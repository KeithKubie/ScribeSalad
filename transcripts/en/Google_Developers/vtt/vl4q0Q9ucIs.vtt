00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.021
MALE SPEAKER: So this
is a little different

00:00:02.021 --> 00:00:04.600
because it's less about
the technology itself

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.370
and more about the process
and the community, and how

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.640
we work together to
produce new standards.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.930
So I think it's a nice way of
tying together all the stuff

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.720
that we've talked about already.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.820
So to moderate this session
we have Lyza Gardner

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.487
from [INAUDIBLE],
and take it away.

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:23.570
LYZA GARDNER: Sure, great.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.100
So I think that you just kind of
stole what I was going to say,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.020
which was pretty much that
this is a great session

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.680
to end the day on.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.596
I think it pulls together
a lot of the threads

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:32.369
that we've been
talking about all day,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.090
and I think that there will be
some fun discussion about all

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.590
the standards' fun.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.290
So to start us
off today, Brian's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.010
going to give us a little bit
of an introductory context.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.840
He's with the
Apollo Group and is

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.740
co-author of the extensible
web manifesto, about which we

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.050
will be speaking today.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.090
He's also the chair of the W3C
community group on the same.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.540
Member of many things.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.490
Expert, I'm sure, of many
of those things, as well.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.130
Take it away.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.300
BRIAN KARDELL: OK, so I'm
going to talk about evolution

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.240
committees and revolutions.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.671
In case you know me online--
some people have trouble,

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:11.920
they say I don't look like
that-- so this is who I am.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.520
Say hi to me.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.040
So I work for the front-end
platform team at the Apollo

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.640
Education Group, and we do
online education-- higher ed--

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.470
at a pretty large
scale for education.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.310
And in my personal
life I'm involved

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.710
in these things on the top here.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.190
So there's this
big cross-section

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.420
for me-- has me thinking
really a lot about standards.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.010
And so I was just going to
throw us way back for brief.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.780
Our concept of standards really
comes from industrialization.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.320
Suddenly we grew amazing
complexity and scale,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.550
and we realized
pretty quickly-- like,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.010
snap-- this is really hard.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.510
We don't really
know how to do this,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.750
and actually we still don't
really know how to do it.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.530
But this is the beginning
of professional engineers,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.280
and these engineering
associations started

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.190
and engineers went, "We need
some controls around the stuff.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.040
We need standards."

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.690
And so they started, and
they created these standards.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.556
And they were regional
and incompatible,

00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:23.560
and they found out
some valuable lessons,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.080
like technically great ideas
that you can't actually

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.390
get implemented--
they're not worth much.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.000
And at that time, the
physical resource makers

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.032
had veto power, so
they said "No, It's

00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:34.990
going to cost too much.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.670
We can't do that."

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.997
But as these companies
scaled to ginormous size,

00:02:39.997 --> 00:02:41.830
they learned the value
of internal standards

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.350
and slowly changed their mind
about external standards, too.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.120
And part of the reason
that was possible

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.240
is because of things
like this: 1903,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.370
the Great Baltimore Fire
wiped out Baltimore.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.810
It was a big deal.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.590
There were over 600 variants
of hose and size couplings,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.090
so people showed up.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.140
They weren't painful and rude.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.830
They showed up, but
they couldn't help.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.880
So things like this
made it really acutely

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.260
aware to lot of people
that we need standards,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.170
and so they started in
the UK and then in the US

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.080
we started doing it, too.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.660
And then, finally, I think
we're getting to the point

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.250
that I'm going to
start on here, which

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.690
is our approach to standards
has changed over time.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.750
We've tried lots of things,
and every once in awhile we

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.400
need a little revolution
to say, "Hey, you're

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.580
not thinking about
this properly."

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.490
And it's worth learning
from what's happened before,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.990
too, because pretty
much everything that's

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.010
been waged about standards
that we're saying now

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.430
has been waged in the past.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.610
And here's what we know.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.290
We know that standards are
necessary at some level.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.420
They're really hard.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.480
And that they're technically
better at the "last miles"

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.430
than the first ones.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.260
They're not the greatest
source of innovation,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.130
but they're really
the only ones that

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.650
are capable of crossing
the boundary to,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.230
this is really a standard.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.160
But I'm emphasizing
this: they're

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.490
trying to solve problems that
are actually fluid, right?

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.940
Environments aren't
a stasis, right?

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.870
And in the '60s, things changed.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.840
IBM became this giant monolith
and everything was theirs.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.604
But software changed
the game and got

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:29.020
us thinking about how to solve
a problem at higher levels.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.990
Here's two things I want
to compare and contrast,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.960
is the thing on your left is
EDI, and it was really popular.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.490
If you wanted to do business
in the '80s you better do this.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.270
But it's really brittle
and it's really specific,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.920
and there's no way
that you can do cats,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.760
It doesn't support cats.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.810
But this thing on
the other side,

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.090
this is intellectually driven by
a small group at Cambridge IBM

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.190
and it was nurtured.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.175
And then, when they kind
of had it figured out

00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:05.800
and it computed a
little bit, then they

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.120
put it through standards.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.850
And it's a really
generalized model,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.680
and that means that
people can do new things.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.370
Somebody came along and said,
"You know what the web needs?

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.790
Kittens."

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.425
Same thing kind of happened
with network architecture.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.320
ISO tried to standardize
a network stack,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.870
and they spent 10
years doing that.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.620
But meanwhile, somewhere kind of
late through that, [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.680
and some guys went
to ARPA and they

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.830
focused on a smaller scale of
agreement and running code.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.610
They got in the door, and
that's why we have the internet.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.120
So adoption matters, again,
but there's a shift here.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.330
Now, the makers-- they're
not pushing iron and steel,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.410
they're pushing bits--
and bits are cheap.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.100
So then when Tim comes
along-- Tim Burners-Lee

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.130
creates the web--
it's measurably worse

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.150
on a number of access than
a whole bunch of things

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.440
that were available at the time.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.110
But it had a really, really
little low barrier to entry--

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.380
just view source and you're in.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.080
And it had enough
to do useful things.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.670
So it got started, and pretty
soon all those shortcomings

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.610
became evident and we
started to fragment

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.570
and there is this worry
that, "Oh no, now it's

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.170
just going to be chaos."

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.030
So we created the W3C.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.840
At first there was
really great progress

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.177
because it was "last
mile" sorts of things.

00:06:39.177 --> 00:06:41.510
There were things that already
looked kind of inevitable

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.470
and we just needed a lot of
people to finalize agreement.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.530
But then we went down
this decade-long foray

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:56.850
into x-whatever or w-whatever:
XML, XSL, XPath XQuerty.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.100
Let's just forget it.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.070
The interesting thing
here is that developers

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.370
became the new veto-power
and important innovators.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.180
Raise your hand if
you use XML stuff.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.620
Not much anymore, right?

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.160
It's not what we use.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.760
We use jQuery.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.550
We all do use jQuery,
but we use JSON.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:27.250
JSON was kind of discovered
but also kind of incubated

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.207
and happened
because we all went,

00:07:30.207 --> 00:07:31.540
good enough, for a lot of stuff.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.160
These high-level observations:
the technical superiority

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.842
ultimately means little.

00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:40.550
There's all kinds of
different advantages

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.260
that it can trumpet when
we get to standard scale,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.410
and that software is
a great equalizer.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.410
It has the potential
to empower developers.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.970
Standardization in the small
is easier than in the large,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.550
and when you do it in a small
these adjacent possibles,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.900
they become possible.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.409
You build something and somebody
will build on top of it,

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:01.950
and when they build
on top of it they

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.625
won't do it in a standards body.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:05.250
They'll do it out in
the open, and they

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.730
have a little bit more freedom
to make harder decisions

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.350
and get it out
there and compete.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.650
And eventually,
when we have things

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.510
that start to look
inevitable, we

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.660
can kind of do the
archeology and find out

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.600
where the common
ground is, and then we

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.334
can send that to
a standard's body.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.000
And if you look at
this from a distance,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.270
it looks a lot more like a
living system than a machine.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.360
It looks like
something evolved, not

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.700
something that's
highly, highly designed.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.510
So here's my point, anyway.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.710
We have changed
standards in the past,

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:45.150
and for good reasons when the
little revolution happened,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.080
and I think it's time
we changed them again.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.840
So step one is, can
we get everybody

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.040
to agree to some fundamental
principles about what we mean?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.080
Step one is the
extensible web manifesto,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.830
where we kind of
articulated, "This

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.590
is what we're talking about.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.100
Can we get there?"

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.360
If you're not familiar
with it, there's

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.080
just a couple points in it that
I think are really important.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.650
If we focus on new ideas
and standards bodies,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.770
we should start with primitives.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.120
Don't start with these very,
very high declarative things.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.170
Let's start low
and let's build up

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.480
and see what happens
in getting data

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.920
and let's focus on excavating
the things that are high-level

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.640
so we can explain the magic
that's in the platform

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.140
so that we can tweak it
slightly and innovate outside.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.537
Tighten the feedback loop.

00:09:40.537 --> 00:09:42.370
We need to find a way
to include developers,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.090
and traditional means,
they're not going to work.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.880
We can't have 200,000 developers
on a mailing list every day

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.250
throwing things back and forth.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.760
And when we do have a
spec that is laid out,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.240
let's probably fill it.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.920
Let's have an elementation
that's not by the browsers,

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.370
if possible.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.070
So there are good
examples of this,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:11.590
and I think we've seen some
interesting things with people

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.440
who are traditionally
spec authors doing this.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.570
Web MIDI stuff Chris
did as a [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.070
Rock.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.125
We have guys who are
authors of the HTML spec.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.060
Some people will debate that.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.840
Instead of just sitting
there arguing about things,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.920
they create a tag with
Polymer and they say,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.294
"This is what I'm
thinking, guys.

00:10:41.294 --> 00:10:42.510
What do you think?"

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.980
And, really, a
lot of them so far

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.410
have been like, "Yeah,
we don't think so."

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.000
But that's useful
because it's turns into,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.430
"But here's what we
can all agree on."

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.960
That's it.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.279
How did I do for time?

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.112
You did pretty good.

00:11:00.112 --> 00:11:04.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.040
LYZA GARDNER: So thanks,
Brian for that introduction.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.930
"View source and you're in"
is a pretty inclusive promise.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.990
It's part of how
we look at the web.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:18.120
So now we're going to
start a little bit blunt

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.431
with some questions, but before
I do that I should mention who

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.860
the people are
sitting next to me.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.818
Alex Russell, on the end
here, works at Google.

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:25.840
He works on Chrome.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.190
He works on web workers.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.960
He works on service workers.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.290
Let's see.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.480
Oh, gosh, he works
on web components.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.770
Kind of all of the things.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.820
And Divya Mannian,
sitting next to me here,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.620
has her name attached to
all sorts of great things

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.890
out in the community.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:42.980
A lot around HTML5.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:48.260
HTML5 Please HTML5 boilerplate,
and also Move the Web Forward.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.680
She's with Adobe.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.670
Over here we have
Adrian Bateman.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.710
He's with Microsoft.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.050
He's fighting the good fight
while leading the program

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.940
manager of the developers
on Internet Explorer.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.910
He mentioned to me that he also
wants IE8 to die in a fire,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.875
so I thought I would
mention it on his behalf.

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:10.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.350
I didn't want him to have
to necessarily say that,

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.920
but he allowed me to.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.970
So Kenneth here on
the end works at Intel

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.250
and is quite involved in
exposing device APIs on the web

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.750
where possible, including
the crosswalk run time

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.680
and also working on
Chromium within Intel.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.560
So like I said, I'm going
to start a bit blunt here

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.130
by stating what I
guess is an opinion,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.530
but perhaps accepted or
agreed upon by you guys.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.480
And that is that, really,
Flexbox took forever.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.620
There was a lot of time.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.780
And in that respect-- looking at
it from the standards process--

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.606
where are we wasting our
time, whether on Flexbox

00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:49.730
or other similar standards.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.770
Where do you guys think
we're wasting our time?

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.250
And I'll let Divya
take the chair,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.650
because she's
definitely ready for it.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.650
DIVYA MANIAN: I
am ready for this,

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.030
I spent-- well, how
much, four years-- trying

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.830
work on the standards body.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.190
I joined Adobe to
represent reps platform

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.650
at Adobe in the standards
bodies, and I quit in a year

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.430
and I moved to some other stuff.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.700
And one of the reason's
is this-- wasting time,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.402
because there's a
lot of waste of time

00:13:20.402 --> 00:13:21.860
that happens with
standards bodies.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.650
And Adobe, we pursue
a lot of features.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.360
We pursue blend modes, and
blend modes are really awesome,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.930
cool things that's
going to happen.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.263
It's going to happen soon, guys.

00:13:31.263 --> 00:13:33.040
It's happening.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.700
And then there is this
[INAUDIBLE] shapes.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.880
We worked on regions.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.130
We spent at least
three years on regions,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.090
which Google said, "Well,
screw your three years of work.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.930
Too bad."

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.820
And then we did all
of our other stuff,

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.290
so there's a lot
of waste of time.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.290
And I think this is very
important discussion to have.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.340
And a lot of waste of time
happens in the mailing list

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.757
and in the weekly meetings.

00:13:55.757 --> 00:13:57.590
And a lot of time it
happens because there's

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.900
somebody who has a lot of
time that you don't, and they

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.680
would be saying
something like, "I

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.530
don't agree with this
particular syntax.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.472
It should have a bubble
or another digit,"

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:08.430
or something like that.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.690
You don't have time to waste
to apply to such nonsense

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.530
but you have to, because
otherwise your proposal will

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.880
not get accepted.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.970
So do you waste
time there or do you

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.960
do things that are interesting?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.354
You have to decide.

00:14:23.354 --> 00:14:25.270
And that's where most
of the time gets wasted.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.728
LYZA GARDNER: What
you think, Alex?

00:14:26.728 --> 00:14:28.440
I can sort of see you
squirming a touch.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.398
ALEX RUSSELL: Well, I'm
squirming in agreement.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.080
For background, my
most recent experience

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.410
with the pain of
Divya's is expressing

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.760
came with the promises
spec in [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.740
So we, in 2013 in
probably February,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.857
had a thing that hung
together, and we sort of

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:51.690
had agreement on it.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.690
The March meeting of 2013
we thought we had general

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.312
agreement about sort of a
cut-down version of an overall

00:14:58.312 --> 00:15:00.520
promises thing that was A+
compatible that we'd spent

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.710
a bunch of time working with
stakeholders to get done.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:09.190
Anyway, I'm going to fast
forward to early 2014.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.030
Early this year we had yet
another series of flareups

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.140
after wasting something like
another six or eight months

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.960
on inconsequential debate to
try to get something done,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.010
and largely-- heroically--
brought over the line

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.540
by Dominic.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.589
He sort of picked
up the ball after I

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:25.630
rage-quit on the process.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.350
This speaks to, on the one
hand, the exact dynamics

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.460
you're talking about,
about requiring

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:39.670
the notion of consensus
without getting something

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.510
valuable in people's hands.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.316
Promises should have
been a slam dunk.

00:15:43.316 --> 00:15:45.690
Promises should have been the
easiest thing in the world,

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.765
because every Javascript
library on the planet

00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:49.390
has something that
looks like Promises.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.514
And in fact, when we started
this design exercise--

00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:53.846
Jake and [INAUDIBLE] and
I, with Dominic's help

00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:55.220
and [? Mark Millan's ?]
help-- we

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.940
sort of went through
all of the catalogue

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.000
of the popular Promises
libraries and all

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.670
the antecedents and of the
cross-language comparisons

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.500
and tried to come up with
something that looked good

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.160
and extract the common
core out of this.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.590
And yet, everyone
has an opinion.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.220
It's not clear that
those standards processes

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.340
that require consensus
are necessarily

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.472
the way to make progress.

00:16:19.472 --> 00:16:21.930
It would be better if we can
make progress through science.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.513
We can go and we can
look at the world

00:16:23.513 --> 00:16:25.610
and figure out who's
doing the most of what

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.120
and see what deserves to be
written down in the dictionary.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.350
I sort of think of it
like slang in dictionary.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.540
We grow slang, just
the way we pick up

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.430
a word then toss it out.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.920
But if it's really
popular it gets

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.880
written into the dictionary.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.920
LYZA GARDNER: Am I hearing that
there's too much consensus,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.250
or is it that the questions--

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:42.720
ADRIAN BATEMAN:
Too much consensus?

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.290
LYZA GARDNER: Or, too much
reliance on consensus.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.880
Or is it that the discussion
points are too broad?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.047
ADRIAN BATEMAN: No, I think
the problem is who decides.

00:16:53.047 --> 00:16:54.630
LYZA GARDNER: Who
should be consulted?

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.560
ADRIAN BATEMAN: Who should
be in charge of this?

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.000
Consensus means that everybody
gets to say something.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.840
And as Alex said,
everybody has an opinion.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.490
The reason these
things take forever

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.490
is because everybody
wants their say.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.839
Everybody wants to put their
little stamp on the speck.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.790
In the absence of that, if
we want to do something else,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.440
then how do we decide who's
going to be in charge?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.420
LYZA GARDNER: How do
we short circuit that?

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.380
What's an alternative?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.380
ADRIAN BATEMAN: Do we
just go into a closed room

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.849
and say, you to
pay to get in here,

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:28.040
or you have to pass some
test to get in here,

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.200
or you have to solve some
riddle to get in here.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.570
How do you do that?

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:31.770
ALEX RUSSELL: Let
me just suggest

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.610
that I think of the worst
things that we've ever

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.970
done as a series
of communities--

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.136
because it's not just one
place-- we don't talk very

00:17:37.136 --> 00:17:41.000
much, and that's another
topic for debate here,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.509
despite talking too
much on mailing lists.

00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:45.800
Mailing lists are the worst
form of human communication

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.420
yet invented.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.531
I submit this for challenge.

00:17:51.531 --> 00:17:53.530
LYZA GARDNER: How do you
think would be a better

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.560
alternative for people to
communicate about these things?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.893
ALEX RUSSELL: I think that
when these processes go well,

00:17:57.893 --> 00:17:59.900
we do it by creating small
communities of people

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.050
who are both informed and
invested in the topics,

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.740
because the larger
community is going

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.698
to be able to take signals
about whether or not

00:18:06.698 --> 00:18:08.292
something is healthy
from experts.

00:18:08.292 --> 00:18:10.250
Not everybody is an
expert, and maybe everybody

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.100
does have an opinion, but
getting those opinions

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.500
from an opinion to
an informed opinion

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.700
generally requires that
people read up on things.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.120
To do that, you often want to
build from a small set of tests

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.710
about an idea, and hopefully
there's competition.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:30.920
But once that first primordial
set of evolutions happens,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.740
you can start to grow
the group of people

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.876
who are invested and involved,
if the platform supports it.

00:18:36.876 --> 00:18:38.250
We have this
challenge in a bunch

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.480
of places where
Promises are easy.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.080
And I kept saying that
the only goal for Promises

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.570
is that there was a spec,
because the version that we

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.720
have now isn't good.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.060
Flat-out has tons
of missing features.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.500
It's not great,
and its large value

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.650
is that it is the one thing
that you can call Promises.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.470
That is the place where
standards provide value,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.620
is that we then can all
agree that it's the thing.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.000
So you sort of have to thread
the needle to get there,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.570
but getting that early evolution
going without requiring that

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.990
you boil an entire 2,000-person
mailing list of ideas before

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.330
anyone will start any debate
on anything is really a recipe

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.210
for failure.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.668
We've been
experimenting with using

00:19:18.668 --> 00:19:20.020
Git Hub to build new things.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.020
That's only one attempt.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.936
DIVYA MANIAN: The one
thing that I want to say

00:19:22.936 --> 00:19:25.570
is I feel like most of the
browser windows lack trust.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.270
They don't trust anybody else.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.010
They think Google
engineers are the best

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.790
at doing what is to be done.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.620
Microsoft engineers
will think the same way.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.370
[INAUDIBLE] would think
the same way, too.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.260
So that lack of
trust-- that means

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.310
that outside players like Adobe
and Intel-- when they come in,

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.980
they basically don't
have any leg to stand on

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.100
and they will have to depend
on somebody else to verify

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.170
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.860
And then politics
enters into the play,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.530
and then it becomes
like, "Well, is

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.290
your feature important
to our vested interests?"

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:55.910
And then--

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.243
ALEX RUSSELL: I want to submit
the experience of service

00:19:58.243 --> 00:19:59.099
workers as a key--

00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:00.640
LYZA GARDNER: Alex,
we're going to be

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.020
able to talk about
service workers

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.445
specifically in
the next question,

00:20:03.445 --> 00:20:05.028
so I want to make
sure that we get it.

00:20:05.028 --> 00:20:07.437
I am neglecting our
audience members,

00:20:07.437 --> 00:20:09.770
because they're behind me and
I wasn't paying attention.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.686
But we've got a number
of people queued up who

00:20:11.686 --> 00:20:15.540
would like to ask or
make comments about this.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.392
AUDIENCE: So
actually my response

00:20:17.392 --> 00:20:19.537
IS from something probably
five or six minutes ago,

00:20:19.537 --> 00:20:21.120
because I was queued
up that long ago,

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.400
but I just wanted to say,
in the terms of consensus,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.950
no successful software project
works by multi-vendor consensus

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:29.950
in building the project.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.089
We have the project lead.

00:20:32.089 --> 00:20:33.880
So I just think that's
an interesting thing

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.780
to keep in mind when you say,
"How can we be successful?"

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.220
And the web has a
lot more constraints

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.050
because we are shipping
literally multiple pieces

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.690
of software, multiple
browsers, that

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.981
need to implement these things.

00:20:41.981 --> 00:20:45.115
But that's partially, probably,
why we're in such a situation.

00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:50.138
LYZA GARDNER: And I want to make
sure we got Jonas ready to go.

00:20:50.138 --> 00:20:51.810
Brian, yep?

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.890
BRIAN KARDELL: I'd just like to
offer as something to consider

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.251
is that the best
thing is actually

00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:00.750
the best thing you
can actually get.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.420
So what we see in history
throughout all these things,

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.250
and what Alex was just saying
here, there are problems.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.660
It's not the best Promises,
but it's standard Promises,

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.420
and that's pretty awesome.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.551
LYZA GARDNER: Shipping
is a good feature.

00:21:20.551 --> 00:21:22.050
BRIAN KARDELL: What
we need is a way

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.890
to shortcut a lot
of these things

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.490
and figure out how to grow
them in the community.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.630
One of things I'm
working on is how

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.040
we can set up meetups
that engage developers

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.250
and have them review specs and
work on prollyfills and things,

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.430
and feed that without all of the
noise back into the groups so

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.400
that we can avoid-- you guys
were talking about regions.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.780
How long was that, four years?

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.400
OK, there are features
in CSS that are 15 years.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.089
I have envy of your delays.

00:21:53.089 --> 00:21:55.380
LYZA GARDNER: Jonas, I'd like
you to get a chance here.

00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:00.150
AUDIENCE: One of the
comments that Alex

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.810
made was that having a
small group of people that

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:07.560
are actually informed is
extremely important to find

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.170
a right-size group with
the right set of people.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.490
We have two extremes,
for example.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.530
[INAUDIBLE] who does
the [INAUDIBLE] version

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.690
of HTML, who many times
sort of goes alone.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.970
At least, this is the
impression that I have.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.900
I guess I should just
speak for myself.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.910
Basically the working mode
there is generally the editor

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:32.410
decides.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.034
He tries to collect
as much information

00:22:34.034 --> 00:22:37.050
to make a scientifically
correct decision.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.040
And then on the other side, we
have actually, funnily enough,

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.710
the same specification in
the W3C space, where there's

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:48.570
a mailing list of hundreds
of people and everyone

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:54.480
opines about every single
thing, and every opinion

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.450
is expressed with
extremely little data:

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.030
"This is my experience having
written this one website,

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.290
and I want a feature that
implements my whole website

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.390
in a single tag."

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.620
That also results,
basically, in disaster.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.230
And so Dave [? Herman ?] who
I'll speak for a little bit

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.250
here, tends to talk about
the layers of an onion

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.930
where you start with a
small group of people

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.560
and then slowly grow
that and take input.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.330
But instead of shooting off
your proposal to a mailing list,

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.440
actually seek out
people you think

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.730
could have valuable
information, and then

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.980
adjust the proposal as the
group of experts grows.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.555
LYZA GARDNER: I want to get
[? Yulav's ?] feedback on this,

00:23:38.555 --> 00:23:40.430
and then I want to move
on the next question.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.830
AUDIENCE: Regarding what
Divya said regarding

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:53.020
browser vendors and trust--
that, for example, Chrome

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.820
doesn't trust people outside
Google-- my personal experience

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:03.800
was that this is
really not the case.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:09.110
And the Opera folks, also,
they have all the trust

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.560
in the world when it comes
to doing [INAUDIBLE] work.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.930
I don't think that's
true as a general rule.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.360
And regarding
everything Alex said,

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.840
I just want to support it.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.060
Again, the RICG's
experience is that we

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:34.830
have to form small groups of
developers and various browser

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:39.650
vendors and work in a focused
way on a single problem,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.190
get it solved, move on.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.517
Otherwise, it drags forever.

00:24:44.517 --> 00:24:45.680
LYZA GARDNER: Thanks.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.971
KENNETH CHRISTIANSEN: think
we've seen a lot of success

00:24:47.971 --> 00:24:50.790
in that lately with
people doing smaller specs

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.600
and trying to have more focus.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.350
One of the working
groups we did.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.540
The opposite was the
sysapps working group,

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.600
where we tried to solve all
the problems of the world

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.060
and we produced
absolutely nothing

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.060
until people said, "Why?

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.020
Can't we do simple things
like the [INAUDIBLE] spec?"

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.750
One function, very simple.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.052
You can standardize it.

00:25:10.052 --> 00:25:11.510
Then you can go
and ask developers.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.580
You can get feedback.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.020
The developers
actually understand

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.910
what they're looking
at, because if you

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.320
have this huge that
no one will read it.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.350
The developers, they don't
get all these small details.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.810
The wording is
slightly different.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.710
And then you don't
get the feedback,

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:30.170
and then, first, at the last
mile, where this is almost

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.729
becoming a standard,
then everyone drops in

00:25:32.729 --> 00:25:34.520
and they give all their
different opinions.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.410
And everything goes,
"Oh my, I thought

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.600
we were on the same page.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.182
What's happening now?"

00:25:39.182 --> 00:25:41.640
That's probably what you saw
with Promises, as well, right?

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.320
LYZA GARDNER: I'm
hearing a few things

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.400
here before we move
on to the next topic.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.590
I'm hearing a lot of
notion that there's

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.436
a lot of noise in the
process and that we're

00:25:50.436 --> 00:25:52.560
working on things that are
a little bit monolithic,

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.820
and if we break
those down into tasks

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.900
that are more manageable
by smaller teams, that

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.750
can help us move faster.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.900
So I'm going to move on
to another discussion

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.150
about something that
a number of people

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.480
view as something that
didn't go quite right.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.020
I guess the way
that I worded it is

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.720
that AppCache was
kind of a train wreck.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.072
In light of how the
standards process is evolving

00:26:17.072 --> 00:26:19.030
or changing, maybe a
little bit for the better,

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.780
are there changes that
have been happening

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.725
that can help Service Worker be
more successful than AppCache

00:26:23.725 --> 00:26:25.000
was?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.640
ALEX RUSSELL: Well, I want
to start by giving credit

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.380
to Andrew Betts
and Jake Archibald

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.292
for getting the process
started that has ended up

00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:36.000
at a place where
Service Worker's getting

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.975
implemented quite broadly.

00:26:38.975 --> 00:26:40.350
Obviously it's my
feature, so I'm

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.030
going to say it looks great.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.051
But the process
was fundamentally

00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:46.050
different to the way that
AppCache was designed.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.175
The history here is that
there was a project called

00:26:48.175 --> 00:26:51.420
Google Gears, which
attempted to flesh out

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.140
some of these ideas in
a hostile environment.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.600
It had to be a plug-in for
IE, because IE was dead.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.660
It had to be a
plug-in for Safari

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.200
because there wasn't really much
to be done, and for Firefox.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.200
And so it was difficult.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.866
It had to be implemented
multiple times.

00:27:05.866 --> 00:27:07.580
But it came up
with one solution,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.770
and then it was clear that
Gears was going to die,

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.830
and so one when Chrome
came about it was like,

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.455
"Well, let's get
everything into HTML."

00:27:14.455 --> 00:27:16.310
So there was a
deliberative process

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.970
of writing down what Gears did.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.860
And AppCache, to
[INAUDIBLE] credit,

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.580
is a coherent way of thinking
about exactly what Gears

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.030
did inside of HTML, without
reexamining whether or not

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.800
it was a good idea
or a bad idea.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.440
It had the fundamental flaw of
being a very high-level feature

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.220
without any
extensibility whatsoever,

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.710
so that when something
goes wrong with AppCache --

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.070
and much the way when
something goes wrong with CSS,

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.519
it's effectively a closed box.

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:42.060
You're completely
screwed because you

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.900
have none of the
latent power of any

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.930
of the intermediate
systems in there.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.380
Think about how an
image is requested.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.647
An image starts with
an image element,

00:27:50.647 --> 00:27:51.980
and then it goes to the network.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.060
It fetches some stuff.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.410
It gets some bytes back.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.020
It picks an image decoder.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.220
It decodes it and
it paints them.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.447
These are all steps
that we can enumerate,

00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:02.780
things that there should be
APIs for, and in some cases,

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.863
there are in the platform.

00:28:03.863 --> 00:28:06.110
But you can plug it
in just a bit of image

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.710
when you want to override,
say, an image format.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.230
That panel made me nuts.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.660
We're sitting here thinking
about how Mozilla may or may

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.750
not approach a particular
image format in the future,

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.680
without any data and no
ability whatsoever for us

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.390
as a community to go plug
in our own image decoders,

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.870
despite the fact that
every browser represented

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.730
here has invested
very heavily in ASMJS

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.820
and has workers
with transferables.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.049
We could be doing image
decoding on our own,

00:28:32.049 --> 00:28:34.590
off-thread, if there was a way
to plumb in our own image data

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.430
the images and just be part of
that image request life cycle.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.681
It is crazy pants that we
can't be part of that today,

00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:42.763
that we're sitting here
having a debate about what

00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:45.599
browser vendors with a lot of
power are going to do tomorrow.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:47.640
That is the goal of the
extensible web manifesto,

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.430
is to get us to a place
where things are layered

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.804
and explained in
such a way where

00:28:50.804 --> 00:28:53.040
and plug-in when you
want some of the power

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.730
or you want to play
inside the framework

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.855
but don't want to have to
reinvent the whole thing.

00:28:56.855 --> 00:28:59.726
LYZA GARDNER: So inaccessibility
is definitely an issue here.

00:28:59.726 --> 00:29:01.600
I want to make sure the
audience on the floor

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.854
gets at the chance to ask--
does Mark already have a-- yup.

00:29:06.854 --> 00:29:08.770
AUDIENCE: I was on the
queue for the last one.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.394
LYZA GARDNER: Oh,
I'm sorry about that.

00:29:10.394 --> 00:29:13.760
Is anyone ready to speak
to this current discussion

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.020
or should I stick with
the panel for the moment?

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.100
Jonas, again.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.000
I think it's David.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
David Barron back there.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.875
ADRIAN BATEMAN: While
we're waiting for them,

00:29:22.875 --> 00:29:25.554
I think App Cache
is a great example

00:29:25.554 --> 00:29:26.720
of all kinds of train wreck.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.930
It's not just one problem.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.465
This is the perfect case study
in how not to build a feature.

00:29:32.465 --> 00:29:33.780
LYZA GARDNER: Like?

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.730
ADRIAN BATEMAN: It was
in the spec in 2008

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.380
and it was there for years,
littered in tiny pieces

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.710
throughout this huge
monolithic spec that

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.820
was very difficult for anybody
to evaluate because there

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.590
were 70 tiny pieces of it.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.230
We've heard, in several
of the sessions today,

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.650
this desire to focus
on small problems.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.050
To work on one
problem at a time,

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.920
to define this in a way
which is comprehensible

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.420
and not just by
standard [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.567
but by web developers as well.

00:30:05.567 --> 00:30:07.400
I think that's one of
the problems, as well,

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.660
with AppCache was it was
really hard to review and see

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.630
how it was going to work
and how it interacted

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.785
with other parts of the system.

00:30:13.785 --> 00:30:15.200
ALEX RUSSELL: But
it also was an API,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.741
so it wasn't possible to just
sort of sit down and write down

00:30:17.741 --> 00:30:20.180
some code, and Jake comes
back to this concept a lot

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.340
of, sit down and
write down some code

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.330
and say, "How would my thing
interact with this if I was

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.820
just even reasoning
about the control flow?"

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.260
Because there's no control flow.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.390
It's only high level.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.420
And so the appeal
that we've come

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.925
to-- first with Web Components
and now with Service Worker--

00:30:32.925 --> 00:30:35.912
is to say, "Look, we don't
necessarily know the answer

00:30:35.912 --> 00:30:37.620
and we're not going
to pretend like we're

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.470
going to figure this
out on a mailing list.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.040
It is the worst
possible environment

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.132
for detecting software fitness."

00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:45.090
LYZA GARDNER: So no
mailing list, that's what--

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:47.110
ALEX RUSSELL: No, a mailing
list might be fine or something.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.520
I haven't identified
what it is yet,

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.978
but it might be
fine for something.

00:30:49.978 --> 00:30:52.940
But it's also terrible at
defining software fitness.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:53.260
LYZA GARDNER:
[INTERPOSING VOICES] decision

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.090
by list.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.300
So David out in the
audience, would you

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.317
like to have your say?

00:30:59.317 --> 00:31:00.650
Are we short a microphone again?

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:00.940
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.940
No, I have a microphone.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:05.330
Two things.

00:31:10.044 --> 00:31:11.710
It rubbed me wrong
way a little bit when

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:17.410
Alex said it's crazy pants that
we don't have this API already.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.850
You have to recognize
that the web has

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.260
evolved to the state it's in.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.730
It's evolved from
something really simple.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.330
And sure, we should have
add a lot of these things,

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.650
but the reason it
got to where it was

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.240
is because we started
with something simple

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.540
and now you're back-killing
it with these primitives.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.180
I think the other
important point

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:51.430
about adding more primitives
to is that sometimes when

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.010
you talk about adding
primitives you're

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.230
exposing primitives
that already exist.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:00.470
And sometimes there aren't
really clear primitives

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.490
that already exist and you
have to make new primitives

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.230
and then rebuild
what you already

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.240
have on top of those things.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:12.300
And the second thing is a
lot more work than the first.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.060
I agree that in some cases
we do want to do that work,

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.100
but you have to recognize that
it is a lot more work for.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.047
ALEX RUSSELL: For context
here-- Chris Wilson

00:32:22.047 --> 00:32:23.630
is going to hate me
bringing this up--

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.260
but I continue to bring up
the notion that the Web Audio

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.600
specification should have
some sort of relationship

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.160
to how audio is played
through the audio tag,

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.800
or through the video tag.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.310
That seems like a
pretty clear bit

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.910
of layering that you should
have in the platform,

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.450
and we don't have it.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.500
And it is a lot of work
and I'm willing to be

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.910
patient about these things, but
I do think that, as a group,

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.780
we should be impatient
about making progress

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.530
in this direction.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.192
We should not accept
the idea that this

00:32:49.192 --> 00:32:50.650
is the endpoint
that we would like,

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:54.930
or that because it happened
to have evolved to this place

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.650
that the next quantum of time
should look like this one.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.580
Progress means doing
something differently.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.362
LYZA GARDNER: So Brian,
it looks like you

00:33:01.362 --> 00:33:02.570
might have a thought on this.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:02.780
BRIAN KARDELL: I do.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.590
LYZA GARDNER: I want to get
Ilya and Natasha queued up

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.290
to have their say, as well.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.450
BRIAN KARDELL: So this is just
kind of a common thing that

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:15.120
comes up where we have a
big, deep system like CSS

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.110
and Layout and
everything, and there

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:21.810
are bits of that that are
not even actually speced.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.970
They just exist.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:28.430
So there's this box tree that
isn't really accurately defined

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.610
anywhere, and so everybody
kind of implemented something

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.470
different.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.200
I think, actually, one
browser-- who I won't name--

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.890
doesn't even actually have
a box tree, technically.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:46.340
It's just something that you can
observe, like its spooky action

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.880
from a distance.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.780
You know it's there.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.010
It's kind of described.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:54.390
Everybody talks about it, but
it it's not really specced out.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.290
And it's not the first
time we've had this.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.250
So yes, it means we
might have to invent

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.280
some things to describe
those spooky sorts of things,

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.460
but that's good.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.305
And even if it's imperfect,
it's still the best we can get.

00:34:06.305 --> 00:34:07.430
LYZA GARDNER: It's a thing.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.990
It's a something.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.989
BRIAN KARDELL: Right.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:10.432
LYZA GARDNER: Did we lose Ilya?

00:34:10.432 --> 00:34:11.352
AUDIENCE: Nope.

00:34:11.352 --> 00:34:12.060
LYZA GARDNER: OK.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.601
AUDIENCE: So I want to come back
to something that, Alex, you

00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:17.179
said earlier, which is
we want to do science,

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.834
or we want to have some data
and metrics and all the rest.

00:34:19.834 --> 00:34:21.500
And I'm hearing a lot
of good discussion

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.110
in terms of how do we improve
the process for generating

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.500
the spec and getting good
feedback and all the rest.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.440
But even if-- let's assume I'm
successful at that-- I then

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.500
take that proposal to
the vendors and they say,

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.580
oh but now you need
commitment from everybody.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.150
Who else is shipping this thing,
because I'm not shipping it

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.650
unless you're shipping it, and
we can't ship it because if I

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.770
ship it and then we can unship
it, and then we're stuck.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.020
LYZA GARDNER: So you go first.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:45.850
AUDIENCE: How do
we do science if we

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.670
can't ship things
that may go wrong?

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.376
ALEX RUSSELL: It's
a great point.

00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:51.500
I'm hopeful about the work
we did in Web Components

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.582
to sort of open up the
HTML parser to everybody,

00:34:53.582 --> 00:34:55.290
because what it's
going to allow us to do

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.840
is to use parses and
metrics that we grabbed

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.060
from telemetry to understand
which things are really

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.140
common in the world so
that we can actually make

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.665
a data-driven case
about who's using what,

00:35:05.665 --> 00:35:07.540
and figure out whether
or not it's important.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.081
This is the same
sort of data that we

00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:10.800
use these days to
evaluate whether or not

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.820
a feature is allowed to die.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:19.324
One of the sort of electrified
fences of the web platform

00:35:19.324 --> 00:35:21.490
is the idea of ever taken
anything back and breaking

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.857
some portion of
the web's content.

00:35:23.857 --> 00:35:25.440
And it's only been
recently that we've

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.500
started to use histogram
data in Chrome telemetry

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.170
to start informing
this question,

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.550
and we can start to do
quite a bit more of that.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.340
And so I'm hopeful that, as we
open up these new primitives,

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.890
we can start to see, on one
hand, the popular libraries.

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.010
We've got central
repositories impact managers.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:39.829
Thank god.

00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:42.120
I remember trying to build
big JavaScript without them.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.560
So, good on ya, and we'll be
able to get some information

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.220
from them.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.170
We'll start to be able to see
and instrument what's important

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.900
in the run times
at the API level,

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.419
and we'll start to be able to
instrument things from crawls

00:35:52.419 --> 00:35:54.960
to sort of understand what sorts
of patterns people are using

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.251
and how they're composing them.

00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:59.764
And I'm hopeful that these
will provide a basic form.

00:35:59.764 --> 00:36:01.180
There's a lot more
than we can do.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.460
There's lots more
instrumentation that we

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.293
can come up with, and
I'm hopeful that we'll

00:36:04.293 --> 00:36:07.580
start to prioritize and
use a confidence interval

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.781
the same sort of how much data,
how good is it, how fresh is it

00:36:10.781 --> 00:36:13.280
sorts of things that we use to
make decisions about removing

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.040
[INAUDIBLE] today.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.950
ADRIAN BATEMAN: I just want to
give a note of caution, though.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.930
I'm certainly in
favor of us exploring

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.860
having different
primitives available.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.360
The thing which I
really worry about

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.670
is, as we start to look at
things like the box model

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.030
or various other parts of
the internals of browsers--

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.270
which, as a browser vendor,
we spend a huge amount of time

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.130
researching, innovating,
trying to improve performance

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:45.360
for-- that every time we expose
a primitive that describes some

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.940
of that implementation we risk
pinning that implementation

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.300
and removing the opportunity
to innovate that black box.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.640
And so I don't think
that it's always the case

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.220
that a black box is a bad thing.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.490
I think sometimes

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.310
LYZA GARDNER: It's a
place for abstraction.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:01.185
ADRIAN BATEMAN: Yeah.

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:04.190
It allows us to innovate
in ways which we might not

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.822
be able to do if we
expose everything.

00:37:05.822 --> 00:37:07.280
ALEX RUSSELL: I'll
see your caution

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.810
and raise you the recent
history of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:09.071
LYZA GARDNER: I want to
give Natasha a chance

00:37:09.071 --> 00:37:10.571
to ask her question,
because she has

00:37:10.571 --> 00:37:12.089
been waiting an
awfully long time.

00:37:12.089 --> 00:37:12.880
NATASHA: That's OK.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.570
I'll try and be quick.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.490
Just going back to
the small teams thing,

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.130
one of the issues
with small teams--

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.830
although I think it's the
right way to go forward--

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.236
is that when you take the
spec to a larger audience,

00:37:23.236 --> 00:37:25.110
then everybody wants to
go through the issues

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.050
of how did you come
to those decisions,

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.890
and how did you
get to that point?

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.860
And it's one of my
jobs as a technologist

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.860
I have to go through these
decisions very often.

00:37:35.157 --> 00:37:36.740
I'm getting some
feedback here, so I'm

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.600
going to take a step this way.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.570
Going back to the stuff happened
that with Service Worker, one

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.400
of the things I really liked
was the explainer document.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.370
It wasn't a spec.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.355
It was just an
explainer document.

00:37:45.355 --> 00:37:47.025
And I know you guys
were the people that

00:37:47.025 --> 00:37:48.650
were involved in
writing that, but that

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.824
made my job so much easier.

00:37:49.824 --> 00:37:51.240
I didn't have to
ask you about why

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.980
you came to those solutions
or the reasoning behind it.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.027
It was all included that.

00:37:57.027 --> 00:37:59.110
LYZA GARDNER: You're getting
ahead, in that sense.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.100
Getting ahead of the
questions that you kind of

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.052
are inevitable
about legitimizing.

00:38:03.052 --> 00:38:03.760
NATASHA: Exactly.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.460
You have planned for them,
and they're saying, "Here.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.585
We had this issue and we
came up with a situation."

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:09.930
and so people have problems,
they go, "Go hang out.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.679
Go have a look at the
explainer document."

00:38:11.679 --> 00:38:13.971
That could be something to
take forward to other specs.

00:38:13.971 --> 00:38:14.803
LYZA GARDNER: Great.

00:38:14.803 --> 00:38:16.040
I've got to move us forward.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.180
We're running a little
bit behind here,

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.200
so I want to pull us
forward and actually

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.630
talk a little bit about the
manifesto we've been skirting

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:26.760
around just a bit, in terms of
how it would advise if it were

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.860
followed, the extensible
web manifesto,

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.710
us to be thinking
about standards

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:31.760
as we're moving forward.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.800
Specifically, I
thought we could talk

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.160
about-- this is a question
inspired by one submitted

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.710
by Sam [? Giles. ?] The
manifesto encourages

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.370
the exposure of low
level standards,

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.300
or granularity on a low level.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.600
But APIs like Beacon kind
of fly in the face of that.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.340
They're higher level.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.940
Looking at that
API in particular,

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.970
as it's moving forward here,
how would we reconcile that gap?

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.120
What things is it
doing that are in line

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.240
with the tenets
of the manifesto,

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.757
and what things
really differ from it?

00:39:02.757 --> 00:39:04.340
ADRIAN BATEMAN: So
I think the problem

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:10.070
with taking Beacon and
doing that-- using some

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.050
of these lower
level primitives--

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.760
ultimately comes
down to performance.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.270
And this is another area that
I worry about with the approach

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.030
of making everything low level.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:25.970
So it's true that we could
build the Beacon API, which

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:31.220
is a way of having a page
send some data to a server,

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.680
even if it's during unload so
you don't have to wait around

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.940
for the response to that.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:40.030
It's true that you could build
that using a Service Worker.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.800
But we have lots of
concerns around the impact

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.940
that Service Worker might have
on the performance of page

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.440
loading.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.650
We spend a lot of time on
getting pages time to glass

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:55.470
and the focus on that, and
the counterargument to that

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:57.820
has always been, "Well,
ServiceWorker is a pay for play

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.320
thing.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.800
If you want to use ServiceWorker
then when you accept that

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.310
that might have some impact."

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.369
Which is fine except this is
for analytics, Which is probably

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:08.785
going to be on every page, and
now suddenly have a Service

00:40:08.785 --> 00:40:11.060
Worker on every page
and now every page

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.990
is paying this penalty.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:15.510
And I'm not sure that's
the right way to go always,

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:18.620
and so maybe there's a
place for a simple API.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.500
This is pretty short
spec that just says,

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.700
"Here's a way of sending--

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.125
LYZA GARDNER: So is this
an example of a spec,

00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:26.890
an API that's concise
enough that it's

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:28.630
easy to just knock
out and get done?

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.470
Or does it have
conflicts, do you think?

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.640
Brian, do you have
a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.830
BRIAN KARDELL: I
think that we have

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.300
to evaluate these things
on a case by case basis,

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.890
and not everything can be
exposed at the lowest level

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:44.470
possible.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:52.430
And I think that where we
choose to do that is debatable.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:53.850
At one point there
was discussion

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.270
about whether we should
have block storage.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:01.470
That's really low level and like
nobody writes block storage.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.720
And some other people said,
"OK, that's kind of crazy.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.890
But maybe up a level,
that make sense."

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.250
I don't know that there's
always a one-size-fits-all,

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:12.890
go-to answer.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.710
There might be some
things we can't get down.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.780
But we should think about it.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.730
Sensor's is a really good one.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.020
Sensor's pretty low level.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.240
It's, I think, a hardware.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.770
But there are people
working on a standard, hey,

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.460
there's how you do
sensors-- all of them.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.300
And it's actually pretty great.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.174
LYZA GARDNER: Divya's
shaking her head a bit.

00:41:36.122 --> 00:41:37.580
DIVYA MANNIAN:
First of all, I feel

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.990
like me missing the point
of browsers live forever.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.440
That's a thing that happens.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.400
Browsers live forever.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.180
People are still using a lot
of old antiquated browsers.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.840
It doesn't even have
to be antiquated.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.560
People have different
hardware systems,

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.750
and if my mom's using
an old version of Mac,

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.715
then she can't use
the newest Chrome.

00:41:56.715 --> 00:41:58.090
She can't use the
newest Firefox.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.370
She's stuck with Firefox
3.4, or something like that,

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.100
and then she browses
the web using that.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.760
And that means a lot of
web appears broken to her,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.220
and she asked me why that's
the case, and I'm like,

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.560
I don't know what to say to her.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.200
If you expose all these low
level APIs, and at some point

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.408
some people are going to be
limited by their hardware

00:42:17.408 --> 00:42:20.400
configurations to a certain
version of the browser,

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.950
and what do you do then?

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.250
Do you forever support
this low level API?

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.584
Or are you going to just say no?

00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:26.833
KENNETH CHRISTIANSEN: Exactly.

00:42:26.833 --> 00:42:28.520
Hardware is really,
really difficult,

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.860
because if you take
something like a camera,

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.590
the technology
changes every year.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.450
So if you make low
level primitives

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.550
to how a camera works
today, well, those

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.050
might not exist
two years from now

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.631
and there might be new
low level primitives.

00:42:43.631 --> 00:42:45.630
Once in awhile you need
to look at the use-case.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:49.270
Maybe it's fine when we have
something higher level API,

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.280
like we did with the
presentation API.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.640
It's higher level and
it solved a use case.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.717
LYZA GARDNER: Jake, did
we leave you behind?

00:42:55.717 --> 00:42:56.550
JAKE: No, not quite.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.480
I was just wanting to
agree with Adrian, really.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.860
I feel that sometimes by some
the extensible web manifesto

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.040
is interpreted as, "We must only
add things to the platform that

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.340
are the lowest
level that we can."

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.980
I think we don't
want to do that.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.020
I want async local storage.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.140
I don't want to be told, "No,
you must use index db for that.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.980
I want to be able to use
event target on my objects

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.990
rather than include
the library for it.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.070
Query selects a role
was a good idea.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.109
We should do that more.

00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:29.650
ALEX RUSSELL: By
the way, I supported

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:34.789
implementing Beacon
in Chrome, because I

00:43:34.789 --> 00:43:36.830
would prefer that we make
progress and figure out

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:37.800
how to clean it up.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.210
I would prefer that we have
a principled way for thinking

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.430
about how to make the
connections between the things

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:45.090
in the platform over time.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:50.380
I don't want this idea to get
in the way of giving developers

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.650
more power, specifically if
there are new areas where

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.140
there's a thing you can't do.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.510
Well, I think the job
one is to give developers

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.530
away to freaking do
it, and then job two

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:01.620
is to figure out how that works.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.110
And so job isn't done if
you only do the first part,

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.160
and we've for a very long
time settled on the notion

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.670
that we might be
binding ourselves

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.320
into some sort of
particular architecture

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.269
if we expose it as a way
of not doing job two.

00:44:14.269 --> 00:44:16.560
And I wanted to push back on
that a little bit on that,

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.500
because I think the recent
history of JavaScript VMs

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.030
shows pretty dramatically that
you can still make forward

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:25.370
progress, even when the
water in front of you

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.210
looks treacherous
and full of sharks.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:31.380
As long as you can figure out
ways to go fast when you're not

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.000
being asked to do a very
specific thing, then

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.167
in the general case you can
still accelerate things.

00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:37.166
LYZA GARDNER: All right.

00:44:37.166 --> 00:44:39.300
I want to hear from Chris
out in the audience.

00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:43.730
CHRIS: Alex mentioned
earlier the audio element,

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.810
and him hassling
me about how you

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.500
build the audio
element as a primitive.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.950
And what we're
doing in Web Audio

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:54.060
is actually totally
relevant to this question,

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.240
because we've gone and
built this Web Audio

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.760
API that's actually
pretty high level.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.490
On purpose it was high
level, but then we

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.710
didn't expose all
the low level stuff.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:07.390
We didn't expose the how
do you get an audio output

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:10.270
device where it just keeps
asking you for more bits

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:12.850
and you just have to keep
pumping more bits to it?

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:14.890
But the problem, to
my mind-- because this

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.020
was a suggestion from Robert
O'Callahan from Mozilla early

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.130
on-- the problem
is if you only do

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.680
that, you're going to
miss a lot of developers.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.174
Like me, for example.

00:45:24.174 --> 00:45:25.590
I never would have
started getting

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.810
into audio
programming on the web

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.740
if I didn't have an
API that I could have

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.690
built this stuff
on top of easily.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.460
I think this calls out
you have to do both.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.175
So now I'm going back
through the audio API

00:45:37.175 --> 00:45:39.930
and recasting it as
this layered API where

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.727
you could think of it in
these very primitive terms,

00:45:42.727 --> 00:45:45.310
particularly because that also
lets us innovate in the future.

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:48.680
It also lets us decide, "Hey,
we need a new type of element

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.610
in Web Audio that
isn't there today,

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.300
and we want to try it
out in JavaScript."

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.660
We want to basically polyfill
it without having to go

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.160
and hand code it into Chrome
and into webkit and everything

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:01.980
else.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.666
So this idea of, there
are multiple levels

00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:06.457
that may be really
interesting to developer

00:46:06.457 --> 00:46:08.249
for is a really critical
one to understand.

00:46:08.249 --> 00:46:10.540
LYZA GARDNER: So it doesn't
sound like it's necessarily

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.700
at odds with the manifesto.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.310
CHRIS: Not at all.

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:12.516
LYZA GARDNER: It's
just different ways

00:46:12.516 --> 00:46:16.265
of interpretation, and general
ideas that avoiding orthodoxy

00:46:16.265 --> 00:46:18.390
and being particularly
fundamental about it, maybe.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.720
ALEX RUSSELL: The manifesto
begs follow-on questions,

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.970
and I think those questions
need to be answered.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:23.500
LYZA GARDNER: Interpretation.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:27.069
BRIAN KARDELL: So low is
a relative term, right?

00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:28.360
I mean open for interpretation.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.443
LYZA GARDNER: And devil's
advocate here-- would it

00:46:30.443 --> 00:46:35.640
help to revisit sort of the
initial text that screams out

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.350
from the manifesto
to sort of explain

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.960
what it means by low level.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.110
Is that something that can be
perhaps a little bit difficult

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:44.375
to--

00:46:44.375 --> 00:46:46.000
ALEX RUSSELL: People
can just email us.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.520
BRIAN KARDELL: Yeah.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.800
ALEX RUSSELL: We're not dead.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.460
BRIAN KARDELL: Send it to the
mailing list is a good idea.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:50.290
LYZA GARDNER: Oh,
the mailing list.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:51.165
Oh, all right.

00:46:51.165 --> 00:46:55.807
[LAUGHTER] I'll do that.

00:46:55.807 --> 00:46:57.390
BRIAN KARDELL: Send
it to [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:58.080
LYZA GARDNER: Yeah.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.060
DIVYA MANNIAN: I'll
troll everybody.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.690
LYZA GARDNER: Mark,
got a comment?

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.230
MARK: Yeah.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.310
I've historically been
a little skeptical

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:06.720
about the extensible
web manifesto-- hopeful,

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.330
but skeptical-- and
this conversation's

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.410
making me feel a bit
better about it, I guess,

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.800
in that I'm hearing a focus
on the low and the high level.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.466
And I think about
this in terms of where

00:47:16.466 --> 00:47:18.360
I'm a little more
comfortable, maybe the ITF,

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.410
where we didn't just
come up with HTTP.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.200
We also did TCP/IP.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.510
We did the low
level capabilities,

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.740
and then allowed people
to build on top of that.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.870
So that makes me
feel better, I guess.

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:32.057
There was that blog
entry that somebody

00:47:32.057 --> 00:47:33.890
did-- what, about two
weeks ago-- that Alex,

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:35.300
you responded to.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.930
And I had some
sympathy with that,

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.920
because one of the
scenarios we have here is we

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.460
have these low
level capabilities.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.290
You look at NPM
and the mess that

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.860
is the NPM package
system, because there's

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.670
a lot of low level libraries
and people building

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:51.820
and you get this kind of
chaos. [INAUDIBLE] that

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.890
have blogged really effectively
about that a while back.

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:57.860
BRIAN KARDELL: You mean by
messy you mean beautiful chaos?

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.360
MARK: Thousands of
flowers blooming,

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.290
including some
poisonous flowers, yes.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.910
And I liked your
response to that.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.177
I think it is beautiful chaos.

00:48:08.177 --> 00:48:09.760
I think that's OK,
but it is something

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.760
that has to be managed
over the lifetime of what

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.760
we're doing, too.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.310
ALEX RUSSELL: Yeah, and I think
that is the legitimate rule

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:15.490
for standards, by the way.

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:16.450
MARK: Yeah.

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.970
ALEX RUSSELL: Once things
become clearly standard,

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.920
it is worth taking a
look and GC'ing, right?

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.780
Get the junk out and
go write that stuff

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.370
in that has survived
this evolutionary cycle

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:29.320
into the dictionary.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.880
That is the goal of evolution,
is not for all organisms

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.100
to continue to live.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.202
t is for the organisms
that are fit to survive

00:48:36.202 --> 00:48:37.160
to the next generation.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.326
MARK: And that was my comment
the first time around,

00:48:39.326 --> 00:48:41.330
which was so many people
come to standards work

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.080
with stars in their eyes
and say, "Well, I just

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.121
have to get it in the
standard and it'll be real,

00:48:45.121 --> 00:48:47.370
and we're doing R&amp;D
here," and I just

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.851
want to find ways to
kill those people.

00:48:50.851 --> 00:48:51.850
LYZA GARDNER: All right.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:53.130
MARK: This is about
consolidation.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.380
It's about building a platform
that we can agree upon,

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.006
and then building
value on top of that.

00:48:57.006 --> 00:48:58.421
ALEX RUSSELL: And
my strategy here

00:48:58.421 --> 00:49:00.280
is to build markets in
which they can fail.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:00.990
MARK: Exactly.

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.410
LYZA GARDNER: All right.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.118
So I want to keep us
moving a little bit.

00:49:03.118 --> 00:49:07.670
Let's shift directions just a
bit right now, in terms of I

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.380
want to talk a little
bit about the gap that

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.290
exists between APIs--
especially device APIs-- exposed

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:17.760
for Web in browsers versus
that which you have access

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.100
to natively.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.972
Are there tactics that we can
use-- and some of the stuff

00:49:21.972 --> 00:49:23.930
we haven't talked about--
to move things faster

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:26.100
to close that gap
a bit, or is always

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.240
going to be a game of catch up?

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.030
And what can we do
about it, if anything?

00:49:32.932 --> 00:49:34.390
KENNETH CHRISTIANSEN:
Well, I think

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.630
we have seen a lot of
progress since we tried

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:40.610
to make like smaller specs and
solve small use cases instead

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.560
of trying to solve
really big use cases,

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.940
like, "Oh, we're going to
make a Bluetooth API so let's

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.090
solve everything you
could do with Bluetooth."

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:49.440
No, let's try to solve those
things that people need

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.510
or they really
want here and now.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.490
Something like the
device orientation lock.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.840
People want to be able
to lock their screen.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.720
So it's a very small spec.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.560
The problem is, I think, the
biggest gap is time to market.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.660
We need to be quick at
shipping these new things.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.340
LYZA GARDNER: So
how do we do that?

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:06.965
Are we still talk
about the same things

00:50:06.965 --> 00:50:10.800
we've been talking
about, like less

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.010
of a net thrown around
huge consensus building.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.520
Less infighting.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.501
Fewer people working.

00:50:16.501 --> 00:50:17.750
Are those the kinds of things?

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.507
ALEX RUSSELL: I have a heretical
suggestion, if that's OK.

00:50:20.507 --> 00:50:22.132
LYZA GARDNER: Heretical,
here it comes.

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:26.266
ALEX RUSSELL: My colleague
Jeff [INAUDIBLE] is at the back

00:50:26.266 --> 00:50:28.230
and he's working on
a Bluetooth spec,

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:32.460
and Bluetooth is a particularly
terrible and terrifying aspect

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.960
of all of this because it is
very much a hardware spec,

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.070
and you can get things wrong
and you can break devices.

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:41.020
If you talk at the wrong level,
as Jeff has given me a tour of,

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.204
you can totally brick
devices that you carry around

00:50:43.204 --> 00:50:44.870
in your pocket with
you, and that's bad.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.510
And exposing that to the
web is clearly dangerous.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.431
At the same time, we
have a security model.

00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:50.930
It's called the
Origin model, and we

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.410
have a lot of capabilities
that we don't have a way

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.300
to expose today, and the way
we start getting capabilities

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.600
into the web is by
getting everyone in a room

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.040
and going, "Guys,
guys, what's the API?"

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.230
Which has a bunch of
implicit questions about it.

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:06.740
And that idea of sorting out
the API before you provide

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:10.240
the capability at some very
low level is quite difficult,

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.510
and so we don't have any
really narrow channels--

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:14.910
common channels--
to map capabilities

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:18.510
onto URLs for things which we
don't have a standard for yet.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.940
And Dmitiri Glaskov who helped
write the original explainer

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.250
document for Web
Components-- which we just

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.484
copied for the Service
Worker, basically--

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:29.650
he has this idea called
navigator dot connect, which

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.525
is just sort of way of
thinking about mapping

00:51:31.525 --> 00:51:34.650
a bunch of other things into
Service Workers and Origins,

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.674
and maybe that could be
devices on your system.

00:51:36.674 --> 00:51:38.590
Obviously it's up to the
system to mediate it,

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.670
but that's one
possible way forward

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:42.870
where we have a very,
very, very narrow API

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:46.715
and it's up to run times to
provide some sort of mapping

00:51:46.715 --> 00:51:48.650
to those capabilities.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:53.320
LYZA GARDNER: Jonas

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.700
JONAS: I actually don't think
that sort of extensible web

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.920
is going to help
with device APIs.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.000
The main problem we have
with device APIs is security.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.290
We just don't know how
to expose certain things

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.416
to the web, given the web's
current security model.

00:52:06.416 --> 00:52:09.040
LYZA GARDNER: So device APIs are
sort of special in this sense?

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:09.600
They don't--

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.430
JONAS: Well, yes, in a sense.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.086
There's more things
than device APIs

00:52:13.086 --> 00:52:14.960
that are limited by
security, but that that's

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.160
a very good example.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.220
And I actually think that device
API is a very good example

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:25.470
of a place where exposing
the low level primitives

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:27.890
isn't the right thing to do.

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:31.440
So we've actually had
file access on the web

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.870
for over a decade--
maybe two, even--

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.660
in the form of input
type equals file.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:40.690
It's a very terrible
API but it has gotten us

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:43.250
through these many,
many years and it

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:46.020
has allowed us to
very powerful things.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.370
We have yet to figure out
how to expose the low level

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:52.659
version of that, which is
raw, file level access where

00:52:52.659 --> 00:52:54.575
a website could just
enumerate your hard drive

00:52:54.575 --> 00:52:57.210
and find all the images
and play all your music.

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:59.260
That'll be super cool
once we figure it out,

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.030
but if that's was
the first thing we

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:05.350
went to, then we would still
not have a lot of the things

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.949
that we have to today,
like probably not YouTube.

00:53:07.949 --> 00:53:09.740
LYZA GARDNER: So in a
sense, though, you're

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.480
kind of saying that something
low-ish level that was exposed

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.920
has actually been
extremely useful.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.300
JONAS: It could've
been useful, but if we

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:24.220
had made that the only
thing we have worked on then

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.590
I think we would have failed.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:30.460
And so by going to higher levels
and only doing higher level,

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.490
we were able to at least
move forward a little bit.

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:34.990
And I agree.

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:37.320
It's good when we can
do the low level thing,

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.450
but especially when
it comes to security

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.610
you can actually often
solve security problems

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.772
by going to higher level.

00:53:43.772 --> 00:53:45.480
LYZA GARDNER: I want
to hear from Vincent

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.570
and then I want to move
on to our next question.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.960
VINCENT: So I'll keep it short
because Jonas particularly

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.300
addressed some of the points.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:57.004
I'm working on the Bluetooth
API with Jeffrey [? Askin ?]

00:53:57.004 --> 00:53:58.420
on the Chrome team,
as well, and I

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.950
think that-- to generalize
how do we move faster

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:04.620
on device APIs--
it's to figure out

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.040
the generalized
problem of dealing

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.550
with the hard security
and privacy issues,

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:13.060
finding a template that works,
and being able to employ that

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.610
to new APIs moving forward
where we don't have

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:19.820
to go through the entire process
again and open up questions

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:20.380
from scratch.

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.838
LYZA GARDNER: I
think that's great.

00:54:21.838 --> 00:54:25.070
Really, it seems sort of obvious
when you think about it, right?

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:30.105
A repeatable approach, and
it seems pretty feasible.

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:34.917
And I really want
us to get a chance

00:54:34.917 --> 00:54:36.750
to talk about this next
question just a bit,

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.583
because I think it'll
give everyone a chance

00:54:38.583 --> 00:54:41.310
to get a few things off their
chest if they so desire.

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:46.680
I was wondering if some you
might have opinions or be

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:50.720
able to identify what specific
newer evolving APIs seem

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.580
to be suffering the most from
flaws in the process right now.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.510
Are there pet
things that you have

00:54:56.510 --> 00:55:00.440
in mind that you think really
could benefit from improvements

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.320
to the standards process?

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.380
ADRIAN BATEMAN: Yeah, every API.

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.720
Every single one.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.180
They're all broken.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.440
And there's a variety
of opinions in this room

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.310
and elsewhere about what a
possible fix might look like,

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:19.690
and there's this
continuum of we just

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:22.620
want it to be a living
document, this living standard,

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.960
this oxymoron of a document
that's never actually

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.340
a standard because it's
always changing versus

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.620
the opposite end of the
spectrum of standards

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:35.500
that are never useful because
they're always out of date.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.034
And I think this is actually
the most important problem

00:55:39.034 --> 00:55:39.950
that we have to solve.

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:43.500
If we can find a
happy medium for how

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.570
we can take in
proposals for new ideas

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:51.180
and not mix them up with the
things which are stabilizing,

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.980
and not mix them up
with the things that

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:59.200
are agreed on and shipped, then
I think all of the API design,

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.450
all of the standardization
process will get better.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:02.920
I think that's
actually the biggest

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.467
problem we face right now.

00:56:04.467 --> 00:56:05.300
LYZA GARDNER: Divya?

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.640
DIVYA MANNIAN: I
agree with Adrian,

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.660
because I feel
like there's a rush

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.470
to focus on cool new
features while not focusing

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.470
on the fundamental
structure of deciding

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:18.450
on the cool new
features, and that

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:22.737
leads to a lot of nonsense
features being on the web.

00:56:22.737 --> 00:56:25.320
And then we are like, "Oh shit,
we should not have done that."

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.610
And then we are like,
"Oh well, it's there."

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.130
LYZA GARDNER: Give me
an example of something.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.820
DIVYA MANNIAN: AppCache,
that we just discussed.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.180
Why would we want to
have these things?

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.060
And I think we are
skirting the issue

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:37.530
of the fundamental
structural problem

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.435
by keeping talking about the
new features and new stuff.

00:56:40.435 --> 00:56:42.310
I feel like there should
be a strong tendency

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:45.450
to say no new
features while fixing

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:47.420
underlying fundamental issues.

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.310
LYZA GARDNER: Larry,
I want to hear from--

00:56:52.039 --> 00:56:54.330
LARRY: I have a lot to say
about the standards process,

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:58.000
but in particular
answer to this question

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.700
there's a lot of
the web platform

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.930
that is not being worked on
and that the standards are not

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:04.150
very good.

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:08.560
It's old stuff, and who
wants to work on old stuff?

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.330
People come to the
process thinking

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:13.500
that it's a place for
innovation and new ideas

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.667
when it's really for review.

00:57:14.667 --> 00:57:16.499
LYZA GARDNER: What's
an example of something

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:17.370
that's languishing?

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.617
LARRY: The file URL scheme.

00:57:19.617 --> 00:57:21.450
How do you translate
files and the file name

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:23.070
to a URL that works?

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:25.050
If I want to put a
website on a thumb drive

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.680
and carry it to
somebody else and then

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.280
open it up with file URLs,
it's completely platform

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:30.790
independent.

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:35.250
And then every operating
system does it differently.

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:36.710
Every implementation
is different,

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:40.020
and there's nobody who
particularly cares about this,

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:43.080
even though it seems like
an important application.

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.580
ALEX RUSSELL: I
think that's untrue.

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.205
It's just that you need to put
a web server on the thumb drive.

00:57:49.492 --> 00:57:50.200
LARRY: Thank you.

00:57:53.575 --> 00:57:54.450
I'll talk to Sandisk.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.700
ADRIAN BATEMAN: But I think
this is a general problem.

00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.484
This general problem
with, it's really cool.

00:57:59.484 --> 00:58:00.900
Everybody gets
props for coming up

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:04.750
with new ideas and brand new
things that they want to do.

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:07.040
And finishing
things-- figuring out

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:10.060
the detail-- that's actually
the really difficult part.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.170
And so I'd really
like it if we could

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:16.400
find the right model for us
to spend time figuring out

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.420
some of those
details, and we seem

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:23.240
to spend a huge amount of
time-- on my team-- trying

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:26.020
to figure out, why does this
website work in this browser

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.630
and not in this browser?

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:29.650
Why does this thing
not quite work?

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.800
Why does this not
quite lay out right?

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.100
And it's because the
devil's in the detail,

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.380
and trying to figure out this
detail-- doing that last mile--

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.980
is actually really difficult .

00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:41.490
We need to find a better way
of actually figuring that out.

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.323
DIVYA MANNIAN: I want
to add one more thing.

00:58:43.323 --> 00:58:45.560
The thing that I
want to add is if you

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.730
are suggesting cool new
features and advocating

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:49.550
for cool new features
like Flexbox,

00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:53.040
make sure you provide the
debugging tools to help debug

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.184
these cool new features,
too, instead of just going

00:58:55.184 --> 00:58:56.600
out and talking
to everybody else,

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.280
"You should use Flexbox
today because it's so cool.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.340
Here's this cool demo."

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.090
But where is the
debugging tools for this?

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:03.981
You need to provide those, too.

00:59:03.981 --> 00:59:05.980
LYZA GARDNER: So getting
all the way there, huh?

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.020
So Jake and, I
think, Mark, let's

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.480
hear what you guys have
to say really quick.

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.630
JAKE: Quick one, I think
that the APIs suffering

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:15.630
the most at the moment are
those that are being needlessly

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:17.517
forked by the W3,
because now have

00:59:17.517 --> 00:59:19.600
two specs for the same
thing and that's pointless.

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:23.290
LYZA GARDNER: Give
me some examples.

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:24.620
Give me some examples?

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.330
JAKE: XMLH HTTP request.

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.820
HTML.

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.257
URL, as well.

00:59:31.257 --> 00:59:32.840
LYZA GARDNER: Mark,
are you out there?

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.423
There you are.

00:59:33.423 --> 00:59:36.370
MARK: Sorry if I'm beating
a dead horse from before--

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:38.042
LYZA GARDNER: This
is all dead horses.

00:59:38.042 --> 00:59:40.000
MARK: I have to go back
to the low level thing.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.458
I know we keep
coming back to that,

00:59:41.458 --> 00:59:43.640
and that seems to be a
big point of contention.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.880
So I personally am a big
believer in abstraction.

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.640
I agree a lot with what
Adrian was saying about missed

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.680
opportunities if you
don't provide abstraction.

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.000
I'll give you the argument
about being more nimble

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.140
and providing more low level
access, enabling developers.

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.750
Let's say you are able to
reform the standards process,

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.700
do these small focus groups,
be very task-oriented,

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.050
move things quickly.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:08.660
How do you avoid missing
the boat, though,

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:12.065
on larger architectural arcs of
opportunities for abstraction?

01:00:12.065 --> 01:00:13.940
LYZA GARDNER: I'm going
to give Alex a chance

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.760
to answer because he looks very
antsy, and then got to wrap.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.389
ALEX RUSSELL: So the
answer there is, hopefully

01:00:19.389 --> 01:00:21.930
there is a super structure in
which these efforts take place.

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:25.100
And so some of my fellow
reformers about this process

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.750
have recently run to the W3C
technical architecture group.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:31.720
And one, I was turned
out for process reasons--

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.980
Dominic joined and so we
worked for the same company.

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.680
Anyway, long story
short, the hope

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.300
is that there is a body
that can redirect enthusiasm

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.360
for new features into
questions about how

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.860
you explain the old
things, instead.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:48.215
To put pressure back on the
question of how does it work,

01:00:48.215 --> 01:00:49.840
because it's probably
already in there.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.590
The web is so big.

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:51.640
It's so freaking big.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.540
The API surface
area is enormous,

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.092
and the implicit API
surface area is even larger

01:00:56.092 --> 01:00:58.300
that the odds are that the
answer is probably already

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.450
in there someplace.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:01.170
You just need to go dig it out.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:04.010
So instead of giving me a
new CSS property, dig it out.

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.300
Give me API and come
back and talk to me.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.300
LYZA GARDNER: All right.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.017
So, panelists,
thank you so much.

01:01:09.017 --> 01:01:10.350
There's a lot of stuff going on.

01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:12.475
I think there's a lot of
the questions people still

01:01:12.475 --> 01:01:16.370
want to talk about, but I think
we ran the gamut fairly well.

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:20.510
We talked about how the amount
of noise in the standards

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.250
processes is hampering
it to some extent.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.390
The scope of some
of the projects

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.080
may be too large
to be efficient,

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.610
and that there's some
languishing, less-sexy APIs

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:35.340
out there that could use love
just as much as anything else.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.830
So I thank you guys quite a lot.

01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:37.330
Thanks.

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:40.252
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.160
ANDREW BETTS: Thanks, guys.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.960
So that is it, but
don't go anywhere,

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.900
because I have a few
wrap-up things to say,

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.700
and then we have the
party to go to Akamai.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.027
So just give us a second.

01:02:02.027 --> 01:02:04.235
We have a few technical
issues with the final slides.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.520
One of the things
we'll be doing now

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.860
is giving out some
of the prizes.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.690
You have to be in the
room to win a prize,

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:50.120
so if you're on this list
and you're not in the room

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.820
then we will just roll
the dice and give it

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.650
to anyone randomly
who is in the room.

01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:01.640
So if you feel eligible to
win a prize this evening

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.220
then you need to get
your phone out and go

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.420
to an on-slide URL,
which will hopefully

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.460
be coming up on the
screen in a second.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:14.416
I'm told that Google, Adobe,
and Akamai employees are exempt.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:18.150
[BOOING]

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:21.110
So sorry, you can't.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.750
You've probably got all of
this stuff already, anyway.

01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:31.700
So if you don't work for
any of those organizations

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.040
then you are welcome
to have a go,

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.418
and hopefully we'll have
the URL up in a second.

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:29.130
OK, great.

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:31.340
Is this working?

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:34.240
Hurray.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.150
So I'll start with
some thank-yous.

01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:39.700
These are the people you
have to thank for today.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.660
I curated the event.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.440
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:50.570
Ruth Yarnit, who's actually
gone ahead to Akamai make sure

01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:54.950
that the party is set up for
us, has been doing all the event

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:57.360
management, which is
why this edition of edge

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.180
is significantly less
shambolic than the last one.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.860
And we have various
to thank it--

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.810
Adobe and Google
and [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:08.000
So onto the prizes.

01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:13.680
This is the URL, so if you feel
eligible to win some prizes

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.650
this evening then tap
that URL into your phone.

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:18.660
And anyone on my
list who's not here

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:19.890
forfeits that prize to you.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:24.920
We applied a highly
scientific methodology

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.670
involving how many times
you spoke, using Onslyde,

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:34.450
and also how many times you
were retweeted by the Edge Conf

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.590
Twitter account.

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:41.280
So based on that, the
winner-- just by a hair--

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.240
is Patrick Kavanagh.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:51.350
Patrick, you win an
Adobe-- what is it called?

01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:53.590
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:56.230
Adobe Creative Cloud
subscription for one year.

01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:57.830
So go and see my
colleague Alberta

01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:59.460
and he'll sort
you out with that.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.090
Sorry, I'm blanking
on the stuff.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:05.470
So we also have five
Google Chromecasts,

01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:09.515
so if you're in the room-- Mark
[INAUDIBLE] congratulations.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:15.869
Aide Edwards from EFT.

01:06:15.869 --> 01:06:16.660
I know you're here.

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:21.550
We're not exempt,
so that's fine.

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:26.100
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.150
We didn't provide any of
the prizes, so that's fine.

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:34.180
Sarah Frost, congratulations.

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.810
Wow, everyone's here.

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:37.980
That's really cool.

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.660
Adam Singer.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.690
Adam's here, as well.

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:42.190
Awesome.

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:43.580
Congratulations, Adam.

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:47.220
And Charles Kobe-Brant.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.610
Are you here?

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:49.214
You are.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:49.880
Congratulations.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:56.140
So you all won
Google Chromecasts.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.510
We also have Android TVs.

01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:59.910
So [INAUDIBLE] TVs.

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:03.730
We have Jack Morgan.

01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:06.529
Congratulations, Jack.

01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:07.195
Jonathan Porter.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:10.910
Oh, OK.

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:14.090
Jonathan's not here.

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:17.061
Jonathan, are you
sure you're not here?

01:07:17.061 --> 01:07:17.810
No, he's not here.

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:19.600
OK, cool.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.435
Wesley, do you want
to roll the dice?

01:07:22.435 --> 01:07:23.385
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:07:23.385 --> 01:07:25.290
If you want a prize,
open your phone.

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:27.827
ANDREW BETTS: Sorry, you
have to have your phone open

01:07:27.827 --> 01:07:30.160
on this address right now if
you want to win this prize.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:30.860
OK?

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:31.346
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, here we go.

01:07:31.346 --> 01:07:31.846
First one.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.178
Your phone should be red.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:41.066
And it'll be yellow if you win.

01:07:41.066 --> 01:07:43.246
Anyone has a yellow phone?

01:07:43.246 --> 01:07:44.912
ANDREW BETTS: Anyone
has a yellow phone?

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.412
MALE SPEAKER: Do we have one?

01:07:49.412 --> 01:07:50.870
ANDREW BETTS: I
don't see a winner.

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:52.680
MALE SPEAKER: OK, no yellow.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.540
Let's do it again.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.840
Here we go.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.320
Keep it open.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.142
Oh, [INAUDIBLE] won
that one, again.

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:01.850
ANDREW BETTS: [INAUDIBLE]
win two things.

01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:04.600
MALE SPEAKER: So we should
have another yellow phone now.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.860
There it is, right there.

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.350
Random winner.

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.930
ANDREW BETTS: Hurray, finally.

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:12.360
MALE SPEAKER: How many
more should I do, Andrew?

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.315
ANDREW BETTS: I think we're
out of Android TVs, right?

01:08:19.852 --> 01:08:20.560
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.870
We'll do a couple
more, just in case.

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:29.267
ANDREW BETTS: Alberto,
are we out of-- OK, cool.

01:08:29.267 --> 01:08:30.850
MALE SPEAKER: Now
we're at Chromecast.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.970
ANDREW BETTS: OK, so the next
we have Larry [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:41.069
Larry.

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:41.735
Congratulations.

01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:45.130
FEMALE SPEAKER:
He's Adobe employee.

01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:46.260
ANDREW BETTS: Oh, you're
an Adobe employee.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:46.759
I'm sorry.

01:08:51.270 --> 01:08:53.200
Sorry, I didn't have
that on my list.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.069
I did scratch out,
but I missed one.

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:55.760
Sorry.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.519
Lukas [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:59.587 --> 01:09:01.170
OK, we don't have a
Lukas [INAUDIBLE],

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:02.624
so let's roll the dice.

01:09:02.624 --> 01:09:03.790
MALE SPEAKER: Roll the dice.

01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:05.120
Here we go.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:11.880
And the lucky
winner is-- aw, man,

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.514
don't change the styling
to get a yellow screen.

01:09:14.514 --> 01:09:16.240
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.630
All right, who has the
yellow screen, besides Luke?

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:26.130
ANDREW BETTS: Did you just
open many, many, many tabs?

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:28.130
MALE SPEAKER: Here
it is, right here.

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:28.939
David.

01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:30.590
ANDREW BETTS: David's won.

01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:33.240
MALE SPEAKER: Are Mozillans
allowed-- Mozillians?

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.156
ANDREW BETTS: I believe
Mozillans are allowed.

01:09:35.156 --> 01:09:37.420
I didn't hear
Mozillans were expempt.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.689
MALE SPEAKER: Do
we need another?

01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:40.689
ANDREW BETTS: That's it.

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:41.550
We're out of prizes.

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:42.770
Excellent.

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:43.270
Hooray.

01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:51.750
So yeah, we like to award people
for contributing to the event,

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:52.710
so that's kind of nice.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:06.045
OK, so onto-- could someone
push space on my computer?

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.340
Oh, OK.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.790
Great.

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:14.654
So onto the finances
for the event today.

01:10:14.654 --> 01:10:16.570
So one of the things we
do at EDGE Conf, which

01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:19.153
is quite unique, is to tell you
what we spent all the money on

01:10:19.153 --> 01:10:21.970
and where we made all our money.

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:25.740
We made about $40,000.

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.610
We have Google, very
largely, to thank

01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:32.690
for a lot of that
sponsorship, along with Shape

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:36.940
and [INAUDIBLE] Logic
and Adobe and Akamai.

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:41.780
And we spent about
$27,000, which

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:47.216
means that we have $12,453
to donate to Hack the Hood.

01:10:47.216 --> 01:10:51.490
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:54.660
So I'm pleased to say we
have Susan Mernit from Hack

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:57.750
the Hood who will just tell us a
little bit about Hack the Hood,

01:10:57.750 --> 01:11:00.252
but we've got a quick video
to show you, first of all.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.144
Press play.

01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:12.602
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.214
-Welcome to our
graduation celebration.

01:11:15.214 --> 01:11:16.866
We are excited to
have you here tonight

01:11:16.866 --> 01:11:18.282
to celebrate the
last week of Hack

01:11:18.282 --> 01:11:20.617
the Hood's summer bootcamp.

01:11:20.617 --> 01:11:22.450
-Without getting too
personal about my life,

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:24.241
you know what I'm
saying-- I didn't grow up

01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:25.700
with a lot of opportunities.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.910
Young kid from the streets,
you know what I'm saying?

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:31.330
I got a lot of fears and worries
for my kids as they grow up.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:35.279
My name is Charles Ray Jones
Jr, father of Charles Ray Jones

01:11:35.279 --> 01:11:36.570
III, graduate of Hack the Hood.

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:41.940
Not only is he gaining
the skills necessary,

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.885
but he's meeting people
who could guide him

01:11:43.885 --> 01:11:46.300
along the path he
choose to go on.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:54.089
Not only information, not
only knowledge, but access.

01:11:54.089 --> 01:11:57.284
-Hello, everybody, my
name is [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:57.284 --> 01:12:01.650
I created websites for small
local businesses in Oakland.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.520
My experience was wonderful.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.260
It was something
that I love to do,

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.570
because I love the people
that I worked with,

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:11.220
and they were so
helpful in every aspect.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.990
-One of our mentors, she
assigned us our clients

01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:17.720
and we would call them, ask
them if they wanted a website.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.738
We were able to convince them.

01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:22.702
-I'm [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:22.702 --> 01:12:26.076
I'm here to present my websites
that I built for clients.

01:12:28.691 --> 01:12:31.637
I'm actually doing this to
get a feel for web designing,

01:12:31.637 --> 01:12:33.601
because I want to
either do video game

01:12:33.601 --> 01:12:38.530
design, mechanical
engineering, or voice actor.

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:40.628
So I'm trying to get a
feel for each of those

01:12:40.628 --> 01:12:41.878
and see which one I like most.

01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:47.580
Technology is something
that is going to be vital,

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.450
and it is for me.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:51.280
If more youth are
involved, they will

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.480
be able to build
websites and also

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.410
get into the tech industries by
creating personal connections

01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:04.320
with people that are already
working in the tech industry.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.952
-My name is Erik and I'm a
mentor with Hack the Hood.

01:13:06.952 --> 01:13:07.702
It's a lot of fun.

01:13:07.702 --> 01:13:09.660
I would definitely
continue to do this.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.120
Just seeing the
change in Mohammed

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.523
from when we started to the
end of the program, the things

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.050
that he learned.

01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:18.500
He did three websites
for local businesses,

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.220
as well as his
own personal page.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:23.400
I would love to see
this grow and mature

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.320
and expand into other cities.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:29.060
I think it would be very
exciting to be a part of that.

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.910
They're no longer
just passive consumers

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:32.390
of what's going on
in the Internet.

01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:34.500
0 actively involved
in contributing

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.022
to what the internet
is as a whole,

01:13:36.022 --> 01:13:37.480
and I think that's
very empowering.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.063
And I think it's just going to
change the face of the internet

01:13:40.063 --> 01:13:43.860
as the youth get more
and more involved.

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.840
Thank you, everybody.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.769
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:45.769 --> 01:13:46.310
-[INAUDIBLE].

01:13:55.767 --> 01:13:56.600
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.080
ANDREW BETTS: So, Susan Mernit,
founder of Hack the Hood.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.510
SUSAN MERNIT: First of all,
thank you guys so much.

01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:12.520
This is such a
wonderful thing to be

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.550
a recipient of this funding
from the Edge Conference,

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:19.200
and to have the Financial
Times and Andrew think of us.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.920
So I just want to
thank everybody

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.290
for putting the money
for this conference

01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:24.689
to such a good cause.

01:14:24.689 --> 01:14:26.480
I want to just talk a
little bit about Hack

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.010
the Hood for a minute.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:31.960
I spent eight years working
as an executive and a product

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.209
developer in Silicon Valley,
and then I moved to Oakland

01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:36.750
because it was kind
of like Brooklyn,

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:38.580
where I had lived
for many years.

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.300
And what we discovered was that
so many people who actually

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:46.090
lived in Oakland felt so shut
out of the technology that

01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:49.630
was happening 30 miles
away in the Valley,

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:51.190
eight miles away
in San Francisco,

01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:52.710
and coming to Oakland.

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:56.660
And as much as everybody was
on their phone-- consuming

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.760
technology, doing
gaming, doing messaging,

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.930
doing e-commerce--
they had no idea

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:04.300
that they could
really be consumers.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.640
And people were like,
"Gee, getting a job at UPS

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.850
would be like a fantastic job.

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:11.710
It has a lot of security."

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:13.340
So we started Hack
the Hood because we

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:17.230
wanted to grow a generation of
programmers and people working

01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:21.420
in other jobs in tech who
really were not shut out,

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.390
who could be young people of
color from very low income

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.970
families.

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:28.050
So the kids that you saw on the
screen from our summer program

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:30.430
in Oakland all
came from families

01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:34.030
that literally made less
than $18,000 a year.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:37.330
They were kids who started
out not doing any programming.

01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:40.260
Really avid users of
tech on their phone.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:44.280
And by the end of the
course, they not only all

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.990
were doing web
development using weebly,

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:52.730
but they were learning CSS,
HTML, starting to look at PHP.

01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:54.840
Here we are at the
end of the summer

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.660
and we have kids who are
going to be taking classes

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.580
in computer science, kids you're
going to start doing Android

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:04.880
development in a workshop
with us with codepath.org.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.520
We were able to take people
who see themselves as very

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.860
isolated, very shut out, very
not able to work in tech--

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:14.860
they wouldn't fit in-- and
light a fire of hope that's

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.800
really connected to building
relationships by meeting

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.880
people, working in the field,
having mentors, visiting

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.120
tech companies.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.370
And they're really starting
to understand, "Well, what

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:27.820
kind of skills do I have to
learn to actually do this?"

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.010
So we've done two
summers in Oakland

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.380
and we just got a
grant from Google

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.090
to expand into five
cities in the Bay Area.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.650
So we're trying to
scale up, and this money

01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:40.950
will be super helpful to
help us by Chromebooks

01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:44.190
and other kinds of equipment,
and to pay instructors

01:16:44.190 --> 01:16:46.250
as we expand--
because we'll be going

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.960
into other communities
like Oakland,

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.590
where there may not be funding
to actually start next summer.

01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:53.580
I would love to invite
all of you guys--

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:56.120
if you live in the area,
or you're in the Bay Area

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.880
or you're interested in
volunteering, being a mentor,

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:00.800
helping out.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.250
We'll be on the peninsula.

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:05.360
We hope to be in San Francisco
to get in touch with me.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.900
It's susan@hackthehood.org.

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:09.620
It's on the Hack
the Hood website,

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.150
and we're actively looking
to grow our program.

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:16.070
It could be anything from an
afternoon to a six week stint

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:17.540
a couple of hours a week.

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.170
But if you've thought
about giving back

01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:23.290
and you kind of want to grow
more people in your own image,

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:25.940
we have some very, very
smart young people.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.950
But they really
need relationships

01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:29.670
and they relating opportunities.

01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:31.475
So thank you so much
for this opportunity.

01:17:31.475 --> 01:17:34.150
I really appreciate it.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.984
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.150
ANDREW BETTS: Thanks, Susan.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.540
OK, it's just left to tell
you how to get to the party.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:49.479
But before I do, someone
left this-- which is a-- aha.

01:17:49.479 --> 01:17:50.020
There you go.

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.840
That's easy.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:57.350
Do you know what it is, yet,
or do you just fancy something?

01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.910
OK, I believe you.

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:07.212
OK, so I think all we have left
is here's how to get to Akamai.

01:18:07.212 --> 01:18:08.670
The directions are
also on the hub,

01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:10.930
so if you want to go
to edgeconf.com/hub,

01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:12.640
there's a link
there to directions.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.720
It's about a 30-minute
walk, or you can take a cab.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.050
And we'll see you there.

01:18:17.050 --> 01:18:19.089
Oh, and you need
to take your pass.

01:18:19.089 --> 01:18:21.130
If you don't have your
lanyard, you won't get in.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:23.030
See you there.
