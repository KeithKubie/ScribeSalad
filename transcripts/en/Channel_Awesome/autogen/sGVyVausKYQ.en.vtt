00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
thinking why do I like that more than
 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
thinking why do I like that more than
this<00:05:19.710><c> because</c><00:05:19.979><c> it's</c><00:05:20.580><c> when</c><00:05:21.330><c> you</c><00:05:21.419><c> get</c><00:05:21.570><c> the</c><00:05:21.690><c> N</c>

this because it's when you get the N
it's<00:05:22.200><c> kind</c><00:05:22.500><c> of</c><00:05:22.590><c> a</c><00:05:22.680><c> similar</c><00:05:23.039><c> idea</c><00:05:23.220><c> and</c><00:05:23.820><c> I</c><00:05:24.780><c> read</c>

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
time and I felt like that was such an
 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
time and I felt like that was such an
interesting<00:06:00.270><c> new</c><00:06:01.020><c> kind</c><00:06:01.919><c> of</c><00:06:02.099><c> idea</c><00:06:02.490><c> but</c><00:06:02.820><c> it</c>

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 align:start position:0%
interesting new kind of idea but it
 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.029 align:start position:0%
interesting new kind of idea but it
really<00:06:03.599><c> is</c><00:06:03.750><c> just</c><00:06:03.990><c> another</c><00:06:04.169><c> survival</c><00:06:04.650><c> quick</c>

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
really is just another survival quick
 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.620 align:start position:0%
really is just another survival quick
and<00:06:05.310><c> I'm</c><00:06:05.400><c> thinking</c><00:06:05.729><c> this</c><00:06:05.849><c> is</c><00:06:05.910><c> a</c><00:06:06.060><c> survival</c>

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking this is a survival
 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.870 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking this is a survival
quick<00:06:06.840><c> to</c><00:06:07.050><c> and</c><00:06:07.410><c> just</c><00:06:07.950><c> telling</c><00:06:08.400><c> nothing</c><00:06:08.550><c> really</c>

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
quick to and just telling nothing really
 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.730 align:start position:0%
quick to and just telling nothing really
that<00:06:09.000><c> new</c><00:06:09.389><c> was</c><00:06:09.630><c> added</c><00:06:09.960><c> if</c><00:06:10.080><c> anything</c><00:06:10.470><c> it</c><00:06:10.590><c> felt</c>

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
that new was added if anything it felt
 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.540 align:start position:0%
that new was added if anything it felt
like<00:06:10.860><c> a</c><00:06:10.889><c> lot</c><00:06:11.190><c> was</c><00:06:11.430><c> taken</c><00:06:11.669><c> away</c><00:06:11.970><c> and</c><00:06:13.520><c> the</c><00:06:14.520><c> only</c>

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 align:start position:0%
like a lot was taken away and the only
 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.580 align:start position:0%
like a lot was taken away and the only
thing<00:06:15.060><c> I</c><00:06:15.180><c> can</c><00:06:15.360><c> figure</c><00:06:15.570><c> is</c><00:06:15.780><c> that</c><00:06:15.930><c> maybe</c><00:06:16.320><c> the</c>

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 align:start position:0%
thing I can figure is that maybe the
 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.510 align:start position:0%
thing I can figure is that maybe the
idea<00:06:16.979><c> is</c><00:06:17.310><c> that</c><00:06:17.780><c> by</c><00:06:18.780><c> taking</c><00:06:19.110><c> those</c><00:06:20.039><c> elements</c>

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
idea is that by taking those elements
 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
idea is that by taking those elements
away<00:06:20.700><c> kind</c><00:06:21.300><c> of</c><00:06:21.479><c> like</c><00:06:21.690><c> you</c><00:06:22.650><c> know</c><00:06:22.800><c> the</c><00:06:23.039><c> zombies</c>

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 align:start position:0%
and the chase you know and stuff like

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 align:start position:0%
zombies uh so I feel like that's already
 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.340 align:start position:0%
zombies uh so I feel like that's already
being<00:06:42.090><c> done</c><00:06:42.360><c> it's</c><00:06:42.630><c> just</c><00:06:42.690><c> now</c><00:06:42.870><c> we</c><00:06:42.930><c> know</c><00:06:43.140><c> the</c>

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 align:start position:0%

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
zombies so it's the only other thing I
 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.460 align:start position:0%
zombies so it's the only other thing I
can<00:06:48.090><c> figure</c><00:06:48.300><c> is</c><00:06:48.570><c> that</c><00:06:48.690><c> because</c><00:06:48.960><c> there's</c><00:06:49.260><c> two</c>

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 align:start position:0%
can figure is that because there's two
 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.900 align:start position:0%
can figure is that because there's two
interesting<00:06:49.650><c> things</c><00:06:50.010><c> happening</c><00:06:50.670><c> in</c><00:06:50.790><c> this</c>

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 align:start position:0%
that everything is kind of has this

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 align:start position:0%
without giving too much away I mean that
 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
without giving too much away I mean that
a<00:07:01.800><c> lot</c><00:07:02.160><c> of</c><00:07:02.250><c> movies</c><00:07:02.490><c> have</c><00:07:02.700><c> that</c><00:07:02.880><c> but</c><00:07:03.060><c> this</c><00:07:03.150><c> one</c>

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 align:start position:0%
a lot of movies have that but this one
 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.030 align:start position:0%
a lot of movies have that but this one
especially<00:07:03.690><c> can't</c><00:07:04.140><c> have</c><00:07:04.320><c> this</c><00:07:04.530><c> impending</c>

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
especially can't have this impending

especially can't have this impending

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
doom aspect so maybe that's kind of the
 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.210 align:start position:0%
doom aspect so maybe that's kind of the
idea<00:07:07.230><c> it's</c><00:07:08.100><c> just</c><00:07:08.490><c> watching</c><00:07:09.330><c> you</c><00:07:10.140><c> know</c><00:07:10.320><c> people</c>

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
sort of in this inevitable situation and
 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.830 align:start position:0%
sort of in this inevitable situation and
what<00:07:15.720><c> they</c><00:07:15.870><c> do</c><00:07:15.930><c> maybe</c><00:07:16.860><c> but</c><00:07:17.760><c> I</c><00:07:18.000><c> just</c><00:07:18.630><c> feel</c><00:07:18.750><c> like</c>

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
what they do maybe but I just feel like
 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
what they do maybe but I just feel like
that's<00:07:18.990><c> not</c><00:07:19.230><c> that</c><00:07:19.290><c> interesting</c><00:07:19.520><c> or</c><00:07:20.520><c> not</c><00:07:20.550><c> it's</c>

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's not that interesting or not it's
 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.380 align:start position:0%
that's not that interesting or not it's
