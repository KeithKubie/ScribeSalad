00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There are other companies who want to go for revenue firstâ€”

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
typically, hardware companies, but not always. Sometimes on the web as well.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The questions to ask are how long will it take to start doubling my revenue every month.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When will I get to $100,000 a month?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
When will I get to $1 million a month?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What are my assumptions about my business when I reach these milestones?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What's changed to get there?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There's nothing magic about these numbers,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but when you start asking about, oh yeah, when am I going to get to $100,000?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What has to happen in all those other pieces of the business model?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Because if you think about it, you've been working hard on value prop,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and you've been working hard on customer segments

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and customer acquisition and activation and channel.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What did you need to do to get to the first $100,000 month, the first $1 million month?

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Boy, as a startup you feel great when those happen.
