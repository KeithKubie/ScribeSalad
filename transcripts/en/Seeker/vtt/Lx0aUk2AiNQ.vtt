00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.120
Biodegradable means being able to decompose
by living organisms, and yet plastic is completely

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.200
synthetic and therefore NOT POSSIBLY biodegradable?!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.290
And yet, somehow biodegradable plastics exist?

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.660
Oxymoron much?!

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.020
Plastic is one of the most versatile materials
in the world, and it's everywhere, in every

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.460
part of world society.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.680
The problem is, plastics are not natural.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.800
Drinks and containers are commonly made of
polyethylene terephthalate[1] or PET[2] plastic.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.070
A bottle of soda is designed to be used once
and then thrown away, but it takes hundreds

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.710
of years for plastic bottles to degrade -- not
BIOdegrade, just degrade[3],[4] Bacteria don't

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.609
digest plastic in the environment.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:44.299
Instead, the plastic degrades under UV radiation
or ocean punishment and the pieces get smaller

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:48.989
and smaller until they become invisible, but
are still part of our environment.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.260
Biodegradable plastics are the plastic industry's
way of trying to remedy the pollution problem,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.729
but unfortunately for us the term biodegradable
is convolutedly complex.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.190
WHAT IS BIODEGRADABLE
According to the International Union of Pure

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.070
and Applied Chemistry, there are three ways
something can biodegrade: Primary: chemical

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.530
alteration of the property of the substance,
Environmentally Acceptable: biodegradation

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.640
of the undesirable properties of that compound.
and Ultimate: which is complete breakdown

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.009
of a compound to either fully oxidized or
reduced simple molecules like water, carbon

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.759
dioxide, methane, nitrate, et cetera.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.290
But they note that some of these things can
be more harmful than the plastic itself![5]

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.799
WHAT IS "BIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC"
Knowing all this, biodegradable plastic is

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.079
a petrochemical created plastic, where they
add things to the plastic to which is supposed

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.830
to help them break down in the presence of
certain bacteria; there's also bioplastic

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.670
-- which isn't confusing at all -- and that's
made primarily from corn[6] into a substance

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.509
called polylactide acid or PLA[7].

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.509
DOES IT WORK?

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.360
This corn-based bioplastic needs a very specific
cocktail of bacteria, heat and temperature

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.490
to break down; so in a landfill it doesn't.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.219
Instead a special facility is required and
as of 2009, there were only 42 commercial

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.490
composting facilities in the U.S. which could
process these so-called biodegradable plastics.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.239
On the other hand, photodegradable or oxydegradable
plastics use light, oxygen, moisture and heat

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.750
to decay rapidly, sometimes leaving a toxic
residue.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.560
In a landfill, where oxygen is scarce, they
will sometimes break down to methane gas -- adding

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.569
more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere[8],[9].

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.910
Studies have shown the additives to plastics
which make them biodegradable are pretty much

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.910
bunk[10].

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.200
the FTC is involved now.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.760
In fact, a Michigan State University[11] study
from last month found there was absolutely

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.000
no difference in the additive-treated plastic
bags and bottles, or regular plastics[12].

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.370
Plastic is simply not a natural substance.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.370
While chemists work to have plastics break
down sooner, or in the right environments,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.370
the idea that any plastic is biodegradable
seems to be incorrect.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.659
Apparently more research is needed for plastics
to be truly biodegradable - fortunately it

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.709
IS ongoing.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.190
This doesn't mean all containers either!

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.049
There are plenty of plant and fiber-based
containers on the market which aren't just

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.010
biodegradable, but can even be composted!

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.000
And, of course, recycling and reduction of
your trash is always a viable option![a] So

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.630
reduce, reuse, recycle peeps!

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.040
Another way to cut your environmental impact
is by driving the right vehicle.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.439
The new Toyota Mirai is looking to the future
with sustainability in mind; it's fueled by

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.250
hydrogen and leaves zero emissions behind!

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.930
You could also try switching from plastic
bags to paper on your trips to the grocery

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.930
store.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.760
Paper comes from treesâ€¦ and isn't it bad
for the environment to cut down trees?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.440
Luckily, this thoroughly handsome devil took
us on a science ride to find out which impacts

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:44.500
the environment more -- paper or plastic!
