(upbeat music)

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.182
(sweet music)

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:19.652
- Hello.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.487
- Salutations.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.421
- Greetings.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.722
Welcome to Walsh on Walsh

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:23.990
where we interview each other...

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.225
- About each other...

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.260 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Together] While lying
on top of each other.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.495
- Good to see you, brother.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:29.396
- Good to see you.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.330
How is it up there?

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.164
- It's cold.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:31.998
- How's the weather?

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:32.966
- It's cold.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.034
- Oh, good.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.001 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.
- It's hot down here.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:35.702
- But I'm starting to heat up.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.536
- Oh yeah.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.504
- You're hot down there?

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.905
- Yeah, can't you feel it?

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:39.873 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You are hot down there.
- Feel my heat.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.107
- (laughing) I can feel it.

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:41.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're going to
steam up your glasses.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:42.642
- I know.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.644
Have you ever told a lie

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.679
and the lie was so bad
that you had to move?

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.647
- I've done that twice.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.915
- (laughs) Oh, you have?

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.583
- Yeah, once I had to
move, as you well know,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:53.520
to my favorite place:
Southern New Hampshire.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.255
The other time to California.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.991
So is it okay if I ask
you a few questions?

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:58.825
- Shoot!

00:00:58.825 --> 00:00:59.759
- Oh, okay.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:02.328
Hang on.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.496
I prepared something.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You have cards?
- Unlike some people...

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.933
I come prepared.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.370
What is your favorite wig?

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
- My favorite wig is
probably the short brown.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.706
- Oh that's a good one.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:17.010
- I thought you were
going to say curly red.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:21.347
What is your first love?

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.382
- Ooh!

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.584
My first love is home invasions.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.418
- Oh.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.252
- (laughs) Yeah.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.087
- Oh that's a good one.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.823
(dramatic music)

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:33.693
- Hey!
- Hi!

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:34.627
How are you?

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:35.862
We're the Walsh Brothers.

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.297 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah we used to live
here in this house.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.531 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You remember when we
used to play witch's swamp?

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.666
- Oh yeah.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.835 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It was all alligators,
so you gotta...

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:42.802 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're gonna get eaten.
- You're gonna get bit, man.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:43.636
- Yeah, you're gonna get eaten.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:44.938
- You're gonna get bit.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:45.772
When we were here
this was just full

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.073
of Dean Koontz novels.

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.875
- We called it the
cabinet of Koontz.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.443
This your workout room?

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.611 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Is there any
reason why you have

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.379
a black dildo up there?

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.148
- That's a light bulb...

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.449
- Should probably put this back.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.650
- Yeah my grandmother

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.085 align:start size:84% position:16%
she died like Elvis,
on the toilet.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.454
And then we buried her
out back like a gerbil.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.423
- Alright, last call boys!

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
These ashes smell
like catsh- (bleeps)

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.026
But I like catsh- (bleeps)

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:10.363 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hey, it's okay if I'm
watching that lady, right?

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.197
- Who let you in?

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.432
- Neil?

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.399 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah, well we
used to live here.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.334
We grew up in this house.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.135
- Yeah, a lot of good memories.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:15.902
- Well, welcome back.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:16.736
- Yeah.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:17.570
Oh, nice.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.374
(dramatic music)

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.977
(upbeat music)

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.480
I really like this studio.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.982
- Yeah, it's delightful.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.550
I really like that
wee old british man

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.785
sitting on the ladder
having a spot of tea.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.420 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm just a little
old english man sitting

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.990
on a ladder with my shirt off

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.725
having a spot of tea.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.029
- Well you seem a
little sore today.

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.197
- Yup.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:44.998 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I want to know what's
going on with you.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.266
- I'm a little sore.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.567
I've been going to
the gym every day.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.069
And stealing fitness equipment.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.405
- So what are some
of your dislikes?

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.340 align:start size:84% position:16%
- One of my dislikes
is I hate people

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.276
who cling to old toast.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.544
- You know one of
my favorite things

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.179 align:start size:84% position:16%
is when we did that
scavenger hunt.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.613
- Oh, when we hunted scavenges.

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.582 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No, we did the
scavenger hunt for points.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:03.483
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.685
(upbeat music)

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.520
Hi we're doing a scavenger hunt.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.621
I'm on a scavenger hunt.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.689
Oh hi!

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:10.590
Can I have a sip of your beer?

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.524
- No!

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:12.725 line:0%
- It's worth like nine points.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:13.893 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- No, it's... that's my beer!
(ringing)

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.061 align:start size:84% position:16%

is we have to

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.130 align:start size:84% position:16%
take a picture
wearing high heels.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.098

- We're brothers!

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.003 align:start size:84% position:16%
We've got to take a

and you come touch
dinkies with this guy?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.045
- I'm sorry, what?

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:32.979
- It's for a lot of points.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:33.813
- Yeah it's seven points.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.148
Oh excuse me sir.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.382
We're doing a scavenger hunt

Excuse me, Nordic man.

- Yeah?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.989 align:start size:84% position:16%

on Walsh on Walsh

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.490
with our brother?

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.958

We're in the garage.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.602
- You guys brought me
down here for this?

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:30.903
You two are (bleeps) nuts.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:31.971
I ain't doing this (bleeps).

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.740
- It's just a chat show, John.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.774
- Yeah, about Walshes.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.342 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.
- It's (bleeps) weird.

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.343
- It's not weird.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.278
- No.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.178
- It's just like your macho test

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.380
you used to give us.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.648 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's nothing like
the macho test!

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.284
I made you guys eat cat
eggs and drink my urine.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.586
This is (bleeps) weird.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.087
(laughs)

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.690 align:start size:94% position:6%
