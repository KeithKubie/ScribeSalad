event will be to invite tout

00:15:17.697 --> 00:15:20.336
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND
EXPLORATION.

00:15:20.369 --> 00:15:22.369
MY

00:15:24.962 --> 00:15:27.225
 GROUP DIGITAL INITIATIVE IS
LED BY CARLA HAYDEN.

00:15:27.341 --> 00:15:30.397
WE CONSIDER IT PART OF OUR JOB
TO DO THAT FOR THE DIGITAL

00:15:30.398 --> 00:15:32.398
COLLECTION.
WITH THAT IN MIND, I'D LIKE TO

00:15:32.418 --> 00:15:34.418

THINGS WE HAVE GOING ON.

00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:37.001

 SOURCING

00:15:46.107 --> 00:15:49.395
WHILE TOM WAS HERE AND AN INSO
VITALY NINAKOVOR, HE HAD A SHORT

00:15:49.442 --> 00:15:51.789
TIME WITH US.
AND IT'S AN APPLICATION BUILT ON

00:15:52.803 --> 00:15:55.212
THE SCRIBED PLATFORM.
CREATE BIDE YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY,

00:15:55.328 --> 00:16:02.364
THAT INVITES PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY
PHOTOS  AND CARTOONS  AND TO

00:16:02.365 --> 00:16:05.166
UPDATE THE CAPTIONS.
YOU CAN SEE SOME REALLY AWFUL

00:16:07.544 --> 00:16:09.544
OCR

00:16:12.562 --> 00:16:14.562
 HERE.

00:16:56.994 --> 00:17:02.446
WE'D LIKE TO INVITE PEOPLE TO
PLAY WITH CONGRESSIONAL DATA AND

00:17:02.577 --> 00:17:06.743
FIND WAYS TO MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY,
YOU KNOW, EVEN MORE ROBUST USING

00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:09.552
THE INFORMATION WE'RE MAKING

00:17:13.012 --> 00:17:16.244

IT'S GOING TO BE A PLATFORM OF
PLAY AND DISCOVERY WITH THE

00:17:27.563 --> 00:17:30.101
DIGITAL COLLECTION.
MY HOPE IS THAT THIS WILL REDUCE

00:17:30.324 --> 00:17:33.196
THE RESTRICTION TO INNOVATION
AND BELLE WE'LL BE ABLE TO USE

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.428
IT AS

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:43.717
 INNO WE'LL BE ABLE TO USE
IT FOR NDI AND HOST INNOVATORS

00:17:46.346 --> 00:17:48.346
AND

00:17:51.381 --> 00:17:54.776
 RELEVANCE.
WHEN I WRITE CODE, AUTO MOSTLY

00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:59.113
ME STARING AT A SCREEN, TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT'S DOING

00:17:59.114 --> 00:18:03.156
THAT.

PLEASE WELCOME ED AYRES.
[APPLAUSE].

00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:10.787
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
GOOD MORNING!

00:21:11.287 --> 00:21:14.042
SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO COVER
SEVERAL

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.602
 DECADES OF DIGITAL
STUFF.

00:21:18.603 --> 00:21:23.971
AND YOU MIGHT THINK I HAVE IT
FIGURED OUT BY NOW, BUT I DON'T

00:21:24.194 --> 00:21:27.066
BECAUSE THE FRONTIER KEEPS
MOVING ON US, AND IT'S REALLY

00:21:27.315 --> 00:21:29.679
EXCITED TO THINK ABOUT WHERE WE
ARE AND WHERE WE'VE BEEN.

00:21:29.695 --> 00:21:33.182
I THINK THE REVOLUTION WE'RE
LIVING THROUGH NOW, BEGAN BEFORE

00:21:33.535 --> 00:21:36.291
THE DIGITAL.
I THINK IT ACTUALLY BEGAN, AND

00:21:36.508 --> 00:21:39.466
IT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO SAY,
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE NA ACTUALLY

00:21:40.078 --> 00:21:42.547
KNOW THE TRUTH.
THERE'S NO Q &amp; A RIGHT NOW.

00:21:42.784 --> 00:21:46.798
I BELIEVE THAT THE REVOLUTION
ACTUALLY BEGAN WITH THE MICRO

00:21:47.647 --> 00:21:53.795
FILM REVOLUTION, THE 1930'S,
40'S, AND 50'S, WHEN WE UNLOCKED

00:21:54.165 --> 00:21:58.339
THIS REMARKABLE TECHNOLOGY, THAT
ALLOWED US TO HAVE ALL THE

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.063
NEWSPAPERS  IN AMERICAN HISTORY
THAT WOULD HAVE THE UNITED

00:22:00.064 --> 00:22:05.049
STATES CENSUS.
ALL THESE BOUNTIFUL DOCUMENTS,

00:22:05.346 --> 00:22:09.365
AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS,
ANYWHERE, FOR RELATIVELY SMALL

00:22:09.771 --> 00:22:16.494
COSTS AND EVEN THOUGH MICRO FILM
SEEMS UNSEXY TODAY, IT WAS MY

00:22:16.563 --> 00:22:19.228
INTRODUCTION NOT ONLY TO ALL
THINGS DIGITAL BUT THE HISTORY

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.335
ITSELF.
I WASN'T SURE WHAT WHAT I WANTED

00:22:23.668 --> 00:22:25.786
TO DO, EVEN WHEN I WAS IN
GRADUATE SCHOOL.

00:22:25.955 --> 00:22:30.299
BUT ONE DAY I WENT INTO THE MIKE
FORM ROOM AND START READING

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.083
THERE ARES ON ONE OF THE BIG
WORLD WAR II

00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:37.479
 ERAS, GRAY THINGS
WITH THE CRANKS ON IT.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.576
AND THERE IN FRONT OF ME, I SAW
SOMETHING REMARKABLE.

00:22:40.913 --> 00:22:44.100
THESE NEWSPAPERS DEMONSTRATED
SOMETHING I HAD NOT REALIZED.

00:22:44.414 --> 00:22:48.398
PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN THE NEXT DAY AND

00:22:48.435 --> 00:22:51.209
AIL THIS STUFF WAS HAPPENING AT
THE SAME TIME THAT YOU WOULD SEE

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:57.996
ON ONE PAGE THE NEWS I
RECOGNIZED FROM THE TEXT BOOK

00:22:58.329 --> 00:23:01.667
AND ON THE OTHER PAGES, THE
NEAT, ALL KINDS OF FASCINATING

00:23:02.252 --> 00:23:05.401
THINGS OF EVOLUTION OF LIFE
BEFORE OUR VERY EYES AND I

00:23:05.402 --> 00:23:09.812
REALIZED, THAT'S WHAT I'M
INTERESTED IN IS ALL THAT

00:23:09.813 --> 00:23:12.980
RESIDENTS, AND INTERACTION, THAT
SPACE BETWEEN THE LINES, THAT

00:23:14.121 --> 00:23:17.797
SENSE OF POSSIBILITY THAT WAS ON
EVERY SCREEN OF THAT OLD SCRATCH

00:23:17.833 --> 00:23:21.879
MIKE FILM ON THAT ARCHAIC
DEVICE.

00:23:22.079 --> 00:23:24.962
SO I WROTE MY DISSERTATION
PARTLY ON THAT.

00:23:26.064 --> 00:23:29.610
WHEN I BECAME A TEACHER, I SAID,
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE FUN TO

00:23:29.611 --> 00:23:33.306
INTRODUCE ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE
TO THE GLORY OF MICRO FILM.

00:23:33.625 --> 00:23:37.284
SO I SENT THEM INTO THE MICRO
FORM'S ROOM, IF FRONT OF THESE

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.729
MACHINES, AND THEY WERE
COMPLETELY ADDLED.

00:23:40.747 --> 00:23:44.943
THIS WAS IN THE 80'S, AND THE
ENTIRE ASSIGNMENT WAS READ A

00:23:44.944 --> 00:23:47.986
YEAR OF THIS NEWSPAPER AND WRITE
ABOUT SOMETHING INTERESTING IN

00:23:49.098 --> 00:23:51.284
IT AND ALL THE PREMED PEOPLE IN
THE CLASS WERE JUST FREAKING

00:23:51.285 --> 00:23:53.247
OUT.
BUT WHAT'S THE ASSIGNMENT?

00:23:53.248 --> 00:23:54.945
THAT IS THE ASSIGNMENT.
WHAT IS THE QUESTION?

00:23:54.946 --> 00:23:57.230
THAT'S FOR YOU TO FIND OUT AND
TO ANSWER IT.

00:23:58.032 --> 00:24:00.287
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THAT
EVALUATION, AT A COME BACK IN

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:05.997
AND SAID, WE DIDN'T LIKE AYRES
THAT MUCH, BUT SEEING HISTORY

00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:10.366
RAW IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING
THINGS I'VE DONE IN MY COLLEGE

00:24:10.867 --> 00:24:14.131
EDUCATION.
I ALREADY NEW THAT MAGIC, THAT

00:24:14.469 --> 00:24:16.593
POWER LAY IN THAT

00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:21.539
 MEDIUM.
ONE DAY, I WAS IN THE LIBRARY,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.682
AND I SAW A GLEAMING, BLACK
MACHINE.

00:24:24.698 --> 00:24:28.408
I SAW THAT AMAZING AS IT SEEMED
AT THAT TIME,

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:39.028
 THAT IMAGES OF
MICRO FILMS AND MAPS, CAN BE

00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:41.451
SEEN ON A COMPUTER SCREEN IN
COLOR.

00:24:41.791 --> 00:24:44.201
WEBS DIDN'T EXIST YET.
SO, FOR INSTANCE, MY LIBRARY

00:24:44.202 --> 00:24:51.993
TOLD ME ABOUT A MAGICAL THING
CALLED S GM L.

00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:55.926
STANDARD GENERALIZED MARK-UP
LANGUAGE OR AS WE CALLED IT,

00:24:55.927 --> 00:25:02.257
SOUNDS GOOD, MAYBE LATER.
AND WE SAW IN THAT, A WAY TO

00:25:02.258 --> 00:25:07.332
BUILD SOMETHING THAT WOULD
IDENTIFY ALL THESE DIFFERENT

00:25:07.333 --> 00:25:08.998
OBJECTS AND CONNECT THEM WITH
EACH OTHER.

00:25:08.999 --> 00:25:12.446
I HAD THE IDEA, HEY, WHAT COW
SAY WE SHARE WITH PEOPLE WHO

00:25:12.447 --> 00:25:17.573
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A MAJOR
RESOURCE LIBRARY, WHO DON'T HAVE

00:25:18.514 --> 00:25:24.923
A BANK OF MICRO FILM READERS.
A WAY TO GET THAT EXCITEMENT FOR

00:25:27.582 --> 00:25:29.321
THEMSELVES.
WE START BUILDING IT.

00:25:29.322 --> 00:25:32.608
AND ONE DAY, A FRIEND CALLED ME
DOWN AND SAID, YOU NEED TO SEE

00:25:32.616 --> 00:25:33.936
THIS.
HERE'S SOMETHING THEY'RE CALLING

00:25:33.937 --> 00:25:37.275
THE WORLD WIDE WEB AND IT'S
BASED ON A BABY VERSION OF S GM

00:25:38.223 --> 00:25:41.107
L.
WE CAN THINK WHAT THEY'RE

00:25:41.108 --> 00:25:45.232
CALLATION SITE FOR THIS WORLD
WIDE WEB PRETTY QUICKLY AND SO

00:25:45.534 --> 00:25:47.835
WE DID.
SO WE WERE OUT THERE AT THE VERY

00:25:48.581 --> 00:25:52.518
BEGINNING, BEFORE WE WERE READY,
BEFORE WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:54.519
DOING.
BUT WHAT WE DID KNOW IS SUDDENLY

00:25:55.885 --> 00:26:00.909
F YOU HAD PLENTY OF PATIENCE,
YOU COULD WATCH AN ENGINE OF A

00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:07.587
NEWSPAPER, VERY SLOWLY, APPEAR
ON YOUR SCREEN OVER THAT 240,

00:26:08.983 --> 00:26:10.842
2400 BAUD MODEM.  AND PEOPLE
LIKED IT.

00:26:10.843 --> 00:26:15.522
SO WE STARTED BUILDING A
MOUNTAIN AND WE BUILT THIS FIRST

00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:19.508
PROJECT THAT MANY MUCH YOU MAY
HAVE HEARD OF, THE VALUE OF

00:26:19.509 --> 00:26:22.786
SHADOW IT'S LIKE IF I COME UP,
I'M GOING TO SEE MY TALK ON THIS

00:26:23.236 --> 00:26:26.329
SCREEN, ON THE HP IF I COULD,

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.505
PLEASE.
LET'S SEE IF THIS WORKS.

00:26:34.738 --> 00:26:38.930
I WANTED TO SEE ALL OF THE TABS
WE MADE

00:26:43.952 --> 00:26:46.750
 BEFORE.
IF NOSE TIMES ARE GONE, FOR SOME

00:26:47.195 --> 00:26:49.386
REASON, CAN YOU GO BACK AND CALL
THAT OUT.

00:26:49.518 --> 00:26:52.660
SO IT'S CALLED THE VALLEY OF THE
SHADOW, AND THE SHORT VERSION

00:26:52.755 --> 00:26:55.719
IS, EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION
ABOUT EVERY PERSON WHO LIVED IN

00:26:56.513 --> 00:26:58.792
A NORTHERN COMMUNITY AND
SOUTHERN COMMUNITY, THROUGHOUT

00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:01.400
THE ENTIRE AMERICAN CIVIL CIVIL
WAR.

00:27:01.401 --> 00:27:04.903
IT REASON IT DOES EXIST, IF I
CAN ACTUAL, AND YOU SEE WHAT WE

00:27:05.254 --> 00:27:08.447
D WE EMULATED AN ARCHIVE.
THIS WAS REALLY, REALLY HARD TO

00:27:08.648 --> 00:27:11.428
BUILD.
IT TOOK US 14 YEARS TO DO IT

00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:16.577
BECAUSE WHAT WE WERE DOING IS
DESCRIBING BY HAND, 10,000 PAGES

00:27:17.572 --> 00:27:20.361
OF NEWSPAPERS AND THIS
CONVENIENT THING IS CALLED PDF

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:22.115
FILES THAT EXIST REQUESTED WE
START.

00:27:22.116 --> 00:27:24.116
SO WE HAD

00:27:27.726 --> 00:27:29.726
SED WHEN WE

00:27:32.222 --> 00:27:34.799
 -- FILE
THAT IS EXITED.

00:27:34.936 --> 00:27:38.853
THIS CAME OUT IN THE MID 90S 
AND 2003, I WROTE AN AN LOG BOOK

00:27:39.069 --> 00:27:41.101
ABOUT IT.
AT THE BEGINNING IT SAYS, BY THE

00:27:41.512 --> 00:27:46.597
WAY, THIS IS BASED ENTIRELY ON A
DIGITAL ARCHIVE THAT YOU CAN SEE

00:27:46.894 --> 00:27:50.715
EVERY SOURCE I USED.
THAT CAME OUT IN 2003.

00:27:50.775 --> 00:27:56.304
THEN ARTS  AND SCIENCES AT UVA,
AND I LEFT UVA TO BECOME

00:27:56.305 --> 00:27:58.499
PRESIDENT AT RICHMOND AND THIS
IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL THINGS

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.933
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, RATHER

00:28:01.965 --> 00:28:09.187
THAN BEING MAD AT ME, SAID, L
WE'VE BEEN HAPPY TO SEE THE

00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:13.608
CREATION OF THIS BIG THING.
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE MAKE SURE,

00:28:14.364 --> 00:28:18.863
THAT GIVE THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS, 10 YEARS FROM NOW THAT

00:28:19.001 --> 00:28:23.721
IT STILL WORKS OR THAT HE WRITES
VOLUME 2 OUT OF THE VALLEY OF

00:28:24.353 --> 00:28:27.498
THE SHADOW THAT AM CONSIST OUT
IN OCTOBER, THE THIN LINE OF

00:28:27.499 --> 00:28:31.164
FREEDOM AND HERE'S THE THING.
I SAT THERE AND HIT ON THIS

00:28:31.165 --> 00:28:36.261
THING AS FAR AS AS HARD AS I
COULD, FOR A YEAR AND A HALF,

00:28:36.597 --> 00:28:38.509
AFTER IT STILL HASN'T BEEN
TOUCHED.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.933
PEOPLE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
VIRGINIA WENT BACK THROUGH AND

00:28:42.317 --> 00:28:44.879
CHECKED EVERY LINK TO MAKE SURE
IT ALL STILL WORKS.  THAT'S

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.362
IMPORTANT.
WE WONDER IF THE THINGS THAT

00:28:47.363 --> 00:28:52.434
WE'RE USING TO MAKE THIS DIGITAL
ENVIRONMENT.

00:28:54.551 --> 00:28:56.551
EVEN MICRO

00:28:59.428 --> 00:29:01.103
 FILM.
SO THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOWS

00:29:01.104 --> 00:29:03.394
SHOWS THAT IT CAN.
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.BUT

00:29:03.398 --> 00:29:08.656
 THERE ARE OTHER THINGS, WHEN
I LEFT VIRGINIA, I SAID, YOU

00:29:08.657 --> 00:29:13.319
KNOW, OKAY.
TRANSCRIBING BY HAND, AN ENTIRE

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.513
INTENTIONAL ARCHIVE, THAT WAS
FUN.

00:29:14.514 --> 00:29:19.563
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT WE
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE

00:29:19.564 --> 00:29:24.846
PREDIGITIZED SOURCES THAT HAD
EMERGED SINCE 1993 WHEN WE

00:29:24.847 --> 00:29:26.719
STARTED THE VALLEY OF THE
SHADOWS.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.719
I BET THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS
THAT WE CAN PUT TO IMMEDIATE USE

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:35.572
AND SO WHEN I WENT TO THE
UNIVERSITY OF

00:29:40.588 --> 00:29:42.588
 RICHMOND

00:29:44.213 --> 00:29:47.381
 WE HAD
MANY NEW PROJECTS AND ONE OF

00:29:47.382 --> 00:29:52.294
WHICH IS AMERICAN PANORAM A
WHICH IS A DIGITAL ATLAS OF

00:29:52.295 --> 00:29:56.334
AMERICAN HISTORY.
AND THE IDEA THERE WAS LET'S

00:29:56.335 --> 00:29:58.335
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SAY, TWO OF
THESE.

00:29:58.346 --> 00:30:03.085
THIS IS THE FORCED MICRO LOAN
OPERATION OF ENSLAVED PEOPLE.AND

00:30:03.194 --> 00:30:10.988
 I REALLY DO WANT TO EXPLORE
T. AND WHAT IT DOES, IT, BASED

00:30:10.989 --> 00:30:14.393
ON THE UNITED STATES CENSUS,
WHICH IS ALREADY A N MACHINE

00:30:14.394 --> 00:30:16.394
READABLE FORM.
THINK ABOUT T IT'S GOING TO COME

00:30:16.551 --> 00:30:20.755
UP HERE.
LET'S MAKE A KIND OF MAP OF THE

00:30:22.711 --> 00:30:28.139
SLAVE TRADE AND THE MOVEMENT OF
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE ACROSS

00:30:28.334 --> 00:30:30.334
THE VAST SOUTH.
THE AMERICAN NETWORK IS STILL

00:30:30.524 --> 00:30:33.724
THINK BEING THAT HERE.
BUT THE IDEA WAS TO SEE THINGS

00:30:33.728 --> 00:30:36.222
WE COULD NOT SEE BEFORE BUT THAT
WERE ALREADY HIDDEN BETWEEN THE

00:30:36.803 --> 00:30:41.097
LINES OF THE DATA.
BEING ABLE TO SEE THAT THE AREAS

00:30:41.113 --> 00:30:45.249
OF THE SOUTH THAT WERE LOSING
ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE, AND

00:30:45.595 --> 00:30:51.218
OTHERS WHO WERE GAINING ENORMOUS
NUMBERS AND COME THROUGH THE

00:30:51.219 --> 00:30:53.219
NETWORK HERE.
LET'S SEE IF THE OTHER ONE

00:30:59.259 --> 00:31:01.259
WORKS.

00:31:12.197 --> 00:31:14.252
MAYBE WE CAN SWITCH OVER TO THE
MAP.

00:31:14.532 --> 00:31:16.886
FORGET YOU SAW THAT.
THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF WHAT I'M

00:31:23.538 --> 00:31:27.127
SHOWING.
WHEN I SAY WE, I DON'T LITERALLY

00:31:27.228 --> 00:31:30.712
MEAN ME.
I MEAN MY COLLEAGUES, ROD

00:31:30.713 --> 00:31:36.127
NELSON.
AND NATE AYRES WHO ARE MAKING

00:31:36.247 --> 00:31:40.082
THESE PROJECTS, INTO THE
CAPACITIES OF COLLECTIONS WE

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:44.139
ALREADY HAVE.
THE OTHER ONE THAT WE MADE WAS

00:31:45.787 --> 00:31:47.753
THE FOREIGN BORN POPULATION OF
THE UNITED STATES.

00:31:47.754 --> 00:31:56.340
FROM 1850 TO 2010 AND IN THIS
CASE TO BE ABLE TO SEE, OKAY.

00:31:56.772 --> 00:31:58.772
THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA WHATEVER
IT LOOKS LIKE.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.991
AND WE CAN CLICK ON ACCOUNTING,
AND IT WILL SHOW YOU ALL THE

00:32:02.992 --> 00:32:07.251
PLACES, THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN
THAT PLACE CAME FROM IN THAT

00:32:07.252 --> 00:32:08.974
YEAR.
SO WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT WE

00:32:08.975 --> 00:32:13.930
ARE DISPLAYING DATA IF FOUR OR
FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:32:14.142 --> 00:32:16.853
AND THERE, IT IS VERY SLOW WHERE
THE PEOPLE ARE COMING  FROM.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.240
AND IT'LL SEND OUT
[INDISCERNIBLE] TO ALL THESE

00:32:20.241 --> 00:32:23.047
PLACES.
BACK ON THE FORCED MICRO LOAN

00:32:23.095 --> 00:32:24.180
OPERATION MAP.
WE COULD HAVE CLICKED ONE THING

00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:28.265
AND IT HAD THE NARRATIVE FOR
PEOPLE WHO WERE SWEPT UP.

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:32.554
MERES SOMETHING, WE WERE ABLE TO
MAKE A MAP THAT GOT WIDESPREAD

00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:36.157
ATTENTION, FROM SOURCES THAT
ALREADY EXIST AND WERE ABLE TO

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:44.066
MAKE WITH SOME SPEED NOW.
AND WHEN WE HAD LAST YEAR, NAME

00:32:44.403 --> 00:32:48.864
ONE OF THE 15 TOP MAPS IN THE
WORLD, BY "NATIONAL

00:32:48.865 --> 00:32:50.865
GEOGRAPHIC."
ABOUT MAPPING INEQUALITY.

00:32:51.005 --> 00:32:53.955
A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT OF
RICHMOND.

00:32:53.977 --> 00:32:59.107
JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, AND
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND TO

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:04.305
SHOW HOW IT WAS THAT SEGREGATION
BECAME BAKED INTO OUR CULT AND

00:33:04.306 --> 00:33:06.230
YOU ARE MAPS OF OVER 150
AMERICAN CITIES.

00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:10.152
WE HAVE A NEW MAP COMING OUT OF
URBAN DEVELOPMENT, THAT WILL

00:33:10.153 --> 00:33:13.705
HAPPEN ALL THE INFORMATION.
A LOT OF IT HERE FROM WASHINGTON

00:33:14.263 --> 00:33:17.239
ABOUT HOW IT WAS THAT OUR
CITIES, INCLUDING VERY SMALL

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.310
ONCE, WERE TRANSFORMED IN THE
1960'S BY THE INNER THE STATES

00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:25.538
THROUGH THEM, AND BULLDOZING,
SUBSTANDARD HOUSING AND ALL

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:28.973
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.
SO ALL THESE HAD THE SAME IDEAS

00:33:29.296 --> 00:33:32.821
AS VALLEY OF THE SHADOWS.
THERE IS ALL THIS ENORMOUS POWER

00:33:33.486 --> 00:33:37.250
WITHIN OUR REACH THAT WE CAN
MAKE VISIBLE.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.534
WE HAD THESE NUMBERS ABOUT WHERE
PEOPLE CAME FROM IN ALL THESE

00:33:40.969 --> 00:33:44.906
PLACES EVERY YEAR.
BUT IF YOU CAN'T SEE IT, YOU

00:33:44.907 --> 00:33:46.907
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT
POSSESSES.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:51.451
AND MY DREAM, TOO, IS THAT EVERY
MIDDLE SCHOOL KID IN AMERICA

00:33:51.452 --> 00:33:54.295
WILL BE ABLE TO CLICK ON HER
COUNTY AND SEE HOW THAT HAS

00:33:54.296 --> 00:33:56.296
EVOLVED OVER THE COURSE OF
AMERICAN HISTORY.

00:33:56.421 --> 00:34:01.136
TO SEE THAT UNITED STATES HAS
ALWAYS BEEN TOGETHER, PEOPLE

00:34:01.137 --> 00:34:03.317
FROM A BROAD RANGE OF PLACES.
THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:08.117
TODAY, ARE JUST THE LATEST STAGE
IN A VERY LONG

00:34:11.614 --> 00:34:14.771
 CONVERSATION.
SO WITH THE AMERICAN PANORAM A

00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:18.237
DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP LAB, THE
VALLEY OF THE SHADOW TURNED

00:34:18.238 --> 00:34:21.479
WRONG INSIDE OUT.
INSTEAD OF TAKING AN 65, THAT'S

00:34:22.057 --> 00:34:26.110
SCATTERED ALL AROUND, AND
NEGLECTED AND MAKING IT VISIBLE,

00:34:26.133 --> 00:34:29.154
WHICH WAS A WORTHY THING TO DO.
WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT WE TAKE

00:34:29.155 --> 00:34:32.806
ADVANTAGE OF ENORMOUS RESOURCES
THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED IN MAKING

00:34:36.118 --> 00:34:38.412
THINGS MACHINE READABLE.
BUT THAT STILL DIDN'T HAVE THE

00:34:38.528 --> 00:34:43.244
NEWSPAPERS I WAS DREAMING OF.
SO

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:54.829
 THE SO MAYBE SWITCH BACK TO
THE H.P. AND SEE THE NETWORK IS

00:34:54.845 --> 00:34:58.742
DOING PLENTY OF THINGS IN HERE.
CAN YOU GO BACK THERE AND SEE IF

00:34:58.743 --> 00:35:00.743
CAN YOU GET RECONSTRUCTING
VIRGINIA.

00:35:00.802 --> 00:35:02.016
YES.
WE CAN.

00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:05.585
YOU REMEMBER HOW MUCH TROUBLE IT
WAS FOR PEOPLE TO SIT THERE AND

00:35:06.203 --> 00:35:09.235
READ NEWSPAPERS ON MIKE FILM
TRANSCRIBE, FROM SCRATCH.

00:35:11.053 --> 00:35:14.476
ALL THE ARTICLES, RUN A SUMMARY
ON THEM.

00:35:14.496 --> 00:35:18.310
THERE ARE OVER 2,000 NEWSPAPERS
AND MILLIONS OF PAGES THAT HAVE

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:23.209
ALREADY BEEN DIGITIZED.
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THAT?

00:35:23.556 --> 00:35:26.341
INSTEAD OF JUST SORT OF READING
THEM IN AN LOG FORM?

00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:32.863
WELL OUR FRIENDS AT GEORGE MASON
DRIVE AND 16 EAGER FIRST-YEAR

00:35:33.465 --> 00:35:37.315
STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
RICHMOND AND VIRGINIA CHRONICLE,

00:35:37.316 --> 00:35:41.027
WHICH IS THE VIRGINIA VERSION OF
CHRONICELLING AMERICA.

00:35:41.083 --> 00:35:47.015
WE SAID, LET'S GO IN AND MAKE
VISIBLE TO THE WORLD, THE

00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:50.453
LEADING NEWSPAPER IN VIRGINIA
DURING THIS TUMULTUOUS PERIOD OF

00:35:52.476 --> 00:35:56.348
RECONSTRUCTION.
AND SO IN ONE SEMESTER, USING

00:35:56.601 --> 00:36:01.911
THE EXPERTISE OF CHRIS KEMP IN
THE LIBRARY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:08.814
RICHMOND, WE WERE ABLE TO
TRANSCRIBE OR ACTUALLY CORRECT,

00:36:08.818 --> 00:36:12.201
2,000 ARTICLES AND YOU CAN SEE
WHAT EACH ONE OF THEM LOOKS LIKE

00:36:14.249 --> 00:36:18.135
AND EACH STUDENT TOOK
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THE

00:36:18.136 --> 00:36:21.843
TRANSCRIPTION HAS ALREADY BEEN
DONE BY O.C.R. BUT THEY NEEDED

00:36:21.844 --> 00:36:24.302
TO BE CORRECTED.
THEY WENT BACK IN AND CORRECTED

00:36:24.502 --> 00:36:28.218
THEM AND IN A FORM OF CROWD
SOURCING, CONTRIBUTED THOSE BACK

00:36:28.222 --> 00:36:32.128
INTO THE ARCHIVE, MAKING THE
ARCHIVE BETTER WHILE USING T. WE

00:36:32.475 --> 00:36:37.083
HAVE ELABORATE TIME LINES,
BASICALLY, IN THREE MONTHS, WE

00:36:38.235 --> 00:36:40.446
DID PROBABLY WHAT WOULD TAKE US
THREE YEARS BACK ON THE VALLEY

00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:43.913
OF THE SHADOWS, BY USING OPEN
SOURCE SOFTWARE, THINGS THAT

00:36:43.914 --> 00:36:45.914
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DYNEL TIESED,

00:36:52.725 --> 00:36:58.356
WE WERE ABLE ARE REFRESHMENT TO
DO SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE

00:36:58.487 --> 00:37:01.564
THE YEAR BEFORE WANT WE DID AN
INSTALLATION OF THIS AT THE

00:37:01.565 --> 00:37:03.565
BLACK HISTORY MUSEUM IN
RICHMOND.

00:37:03.635 --> 00:37:08.068
WE DID A PREVIEW OF THAT.
SO HAVE I THESE KIDS, SHOWING

00:37:09.215 --> 00:37:15.813
VISITORS TO THE MUSEUM WHAT THEY
D. THEY SAID I THEY WANTED TON

00:37:16.065 --> 00:37:20.071
IF WE WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS.
WE SAID NO, WE'RE 19!

00:37:20.513 --> 00:37:26.070
[LAUGHTER]
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT A

00:37:26.814 --> 00:37:29.547
COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO UNLOCK ALL
OF THE POWER IN THESE

00:37:29.548 --> 00:37:33.137
NEWSPAPERS, BY LOOK AT THEM AS
ARTICLES, RESTORING THE ARTICLE

00:37:34.116 --> 00:37:36.882
STRUCTURES, AND THE ALL OF
THESEMENT STRUCTURE AND IT'S

00:37:36.883 --> 00:37:40.714
STILL A SUMMARY AND SYNTHESIZING
THEM INTO A WEEK, I THINK WE'RE

00:37:40.914 --> 00:37:45.244
JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF REALLY
SEEING ALL THE CHRONICALLING

00:37:45.245 --> 00:37:49.260
AMERICA CAN DO.
SO ALL THAT IS GOES GOOD, TOO.

00:37:49.394 --> 00:37:52.057
WE'RE GETTING READY TO DO THE
RICHMOND PLAN THIS FALL.

00:37:52.742 --> 00:37:55.172
ONE OF THE LEADING
AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS

00:37:55.173 --> 00:37:59.631
AROUND THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.
I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK

00:37:59.634 --> 00:38:03.369
TO THE MATT.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE MAXIMUM USE

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:10.279
OF THE INCREDIBLE FACILITY.
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON

00:38:12.327 --> 00:38:13.517
NOW.
THIS IS CALLED BUNK.

00:38:13.518 --> 00:38:15.222
THE HISTORY IS MORE MORE OR LESS
BUNK.

00:38:15.223 --> 00:38:16.771
L OF COURSE, WE DON'T THINK IT
IS.

00:38:16.772 --> 00:38:19.454
HE SAYS, THE COMPREHENSIVE
HISTORY THAT MATTER CITIZEN

00:38:19.455 --> 00:38:21.455
HISTORY

00:38:23.133 --> 00:38:25.133
 ONLY HISTORY THAT MATTER
CITIZEN HISTORY WE MAKE TODAY. 

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:30.811
THE HISTORY, WRITING, AND YOU
POINT AT THE SCREEN.

00:38:30.863 --> 00:38:32.863
THAT'S SUGGESTED.
WE'RE ENGAGING YOU ALREADY.

00:38:32.881 --> 00:38:38.642
WHAT IS THIS?
WE'RE CURATING EF DAY, ALL

00:38:38.643 --> 00:38:40.874
REPRESENTATIONS OF THE AMERICAN
PAST, AMERICAN MEDIA AND PUTTING

00:38:41.312 --> 00:38:44.072
THEM IN CONVERSATION WITH EACH
OTHER.

00:38:44.992 --> 00:38:46.897
AND THIS HAD BEEN, THIS IS NOT
FLAT OUT YET.

00:38:46.898 --> 00:38:51.798
THIS WILL DEBUT VERY SOON AND WE
HOPE THAT YOU WILL SIGN UP FOR

00:38:52.404 --> 00:38:54.911
BUNK MAIL.
THE WEEKLY NEWS LETTER AND IT'S

00:38:54.912 --> 00:38:58.760
ABOUT THE SAME THING I HAD THE
IDEA BACK IN BROUGHT SCHOOL IN

00:38:58.775 --> 00:39:01.394
THE 1970'S.
YOU'LL SEE, THAT I ONLY HAD ONE

00:39:01.928 --> 00:39:05.634
IDEA IN MY LIFE.
WHICH IS HEY, THERE'S COOL STUFF

00:39:06.342 --> 00:39:12.299
HERE, I WISH OTHER PEOPLE CAN
SEE T. AND MAYBE IF I PUT IT

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.581
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR PHONE,
AND THE INTERESTING STUFF IS THE

00:39:14.682 --> 00:39:16.709
CONNECTIONS IN

00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:22.392
 BETWEEN.
WHAT THIS DOES, WE ARE TAGGING

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:27.608
ALL THESE THINGS THAT COME OUT.
YOU'LL SAY THAT THIS IS A

00:39:27.609 --> 00:39:29.116
PORTRAIT FROM LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS.

00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:32.628
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE COMING
FROM THE ATLANTIC OR THE

00:39:32.629 --> 00:39:35.210
"WASHINGTON POST."
BUT THEY'RE ALSO COMING FROM

00:39:35.211 --> 00:39:37.783
BLOG THAT IS PEOPLE WOULDN'T
HAVE SEEN OTHERWISE OR THEY'RE

00:39:38.314 --> 00:39:43.777
COMING FROM THE SCHOLARLY
LITERATURE OR COMING FROM

00:39:43.778 --> 00:39:48.433
NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE POLITICAL
SPECTRUM THAT DON'T TALK TO EACH

00:39:48.566 --> 00:39:52.524
OTHER SO MUCH.
AND HERE'S THE POINT THAT YOU

00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:55.232
REALIZE THERE'S HISTORY ALL
AROUND US.

00:39:55.233 --> 00:39:59.096
AS PEOPLE ON AIRPLANES TELL ME.
THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT THERE,

00:39:59.097 --> 00:40:00.152
BRAIDING PAPERS.
SO.

00:40:00.153 --> 00:40:04.780
WERE YOU A HISTORY TEACHER?
YEAH, I'VE ALWAYS HATED

00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:06.756
HISTORY.
ALL THOSE NAMES  AND DATES.

00:40:06.757 --> 00:40:09.107
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
HISTORY IS AND IT'S NOT REALLY

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:15.853
THAT.  IT'S NOT THIS TEST.
AND THEY DON'T REALIZE WE'RE

00:40:15.854 --> 00:40:18.392
SATURATED IN REPRESENTATIONS OF
THE PAST ALL THE TIME.

00:40:18.507 --> 00:40:21.179
WHAT BUNK IS TRYING TO DO IS
MAKE US REALIZE THAT MOST OF OUR

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.622
MOVIES  AND TELEVISION SHOWS,
UNLESS THEY'RE SCIENCE FICTION

00:40:25.669 --> 00:40:29.065
ARE BASED ON HISTORY.
MOST ARE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE

00:40:29.549 --> 00:40:33.210
COMPLEXITIES OF OUR OWN TIME ARE
OFTEN LOOKING FOR HISTORICAL

00:40:33.211 --> 00:40:36.349
COORDINATES WANT HERE'S
FREDERICK DOUGLAS AS A REFUGEE.

00:40:36.882 --> 00:40:40.039
THE FIRST LINK THERE IS ABOUT
THE CIVIL WAR.

00:40:40.273 --> 00:40:43.028
BUT THE REST IS ABOUT OTHER
REFUGEES  AND FRANK.

00:40:43.232 --> 00:40:46.628
BUT THEN, YOU CAN SEE NOW, LET'S
THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:56.906
 HAPPENED
HISTORY THE WRITTEN HISTORY OF

00:40:56.947 --> 00:40:58.947
JUNE TEETH.

00:41:00.743 --> 00:41:05.022
SO PART OF MY INSTINCT ON ALL OF
THIS IS WHY IT IS THAT THERE IS

00:41:05.491 --> 00:41:12.915
SO MUCH WONDERFUL HISTORY BEING
WRITTEN IN SO MANY VENENZUELA

00:41:12.946 --> 00:41:14.946
YOU'RE.
WE HAVE NEVER TOUCHED

00:41:18.048 --> 00:41:22.117
 -- SO MANY
VENUES THAT HAVE TOUCHED PEOPLE

00:41:22.286 --> 00:41:25.278
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
WHAT BUNK IS TRYING TO DO WITH

00:41:25.514 --> 00:41:29.582
THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW FALL
OH, WITH THE DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP

00:41:29.749 --> 00:41:35.173
LAB IS TO GATHER THE POWER IN
COLLECTIONS AND THEN SHARE THEM

00:41:35.176 --> 00:41:38.506
WITH THE WORLD.
YOU'LL SEE, SHARE CONNECTION SO

00:41:39.243 --> 00:41:45.026
IF YOU CLICK ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA
BUTTON WHEN THIS IS ACTUALLY

00:41:45.027 --> 00:41:47.155
AVAILABLE.
IT MAY BE AVAILABLE AT THIS VERY

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.216
MOMENT, FOR ALL I KNOW.
BUT I DON'T MEAN FOR IT TO BE.

00:41:50.455 --> 00:41:53.828
IT'S GOING TO BE SO MUCH MORE
AWESOME.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:55.965
IF YOU CLICK ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA
OR THE E-MAIL.

00:41:56.173 --> 00:42:01.419
IT SAYS, LOOK AT THIS COOL
CONNECTION I FOUND ON BUNK.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.620
IT'S THE TWO

00:42:05.188 --> 00:42:05.957
 THINGS AND THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM.

00:42:05.958 --> 00:42:12.969
ISN'T THAT AMAZING HOW FREDERICK
DOUGLAS, ANNE FRANK, WE THINK OF

00:42:13.004 --> 00:42:17.978
THEM BOTH AS REFUGEES OR THE
CONVERSATIONS ALL ABOUT

00:42:17.979 --> 00:42:19.630
MONUMENTS.
WHAT WERE PEOPLE SAYING THIS 15

00:42:19.631 --> 00:42:21.721
YEARS AGO, TO BE ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND THAT WITH SOME

00:42:21.722 --> 00:42:23.722
DEPTH.

00:42:28.202 --> 00:42:32.819
PEOPLE WILL BE THEIR OWN CURE
EAT ORS.

00:42:33.171 --> 00:42:36.375
IT'S LIKE WRAPPING EACH OF THESE
INJURIES LIKE A PROTEIN.

00:42:36.959 --> 00:42:38.959
THEY CAN CONNECT IN LOTS OF
DIFFERENT WEARS.

00:42:39.785 --> 00:42:42.644
THE FREDERICK DOUGLAS THING IS
ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY,

00:42:43.128 --> 00:42:46.509
IT'S ABOUT SLAVERY, AND OTHER
KINDS OF COLLECTIONS AS WELL. 

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.876
THE BACK END WE BUILT IS
ALLOWING THIS STUDENT AT THE

00:42:49.877 --> 00:42:54.209
UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND TO HELP
US TAG ALL THESE THINGS SO THEY

00:42:54.417 --> 00:42:57.725
CAN TALK AND WE CAN RECOGNIZE
THAT WE LIVE IN HISTORY THE WAY

00:42:58.032 --> 00:43:00.032
WE LIVE IN

00:43:02.582 --> 00:43:03.514
 OXYGEN.
NAP IT IS EARLY ALL TIME AND WE

00:43:03.515 --> 00:43:05.515
CAN SEE IT IN COOL NEW

00:43:07.947 --> 00:43:11.755
 WAYS.
MY INSPARATION THROUGH ALL OF

00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:17.851
THIS HAVE BEEN ZENIZA BUSH, WHO
IN 1945, INVENTED A MAN THAT WAS

00:43:18.552 --> 00:43:21.574
GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE
EVERYTHING.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.745
PICTURE THIS.
YOU WEAR A WALNUT SIZED CAMERA

00:43:24.948 --> 00:43:28.752
ON YOUR FOREHEAD AND THEN YOU
HAVE THE SHUTTER RUNNING DOWN

00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:30.739
YOUR ARM.
WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING COOL, YOU

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.740
CLICK IT.
IT TAKES A PICTURE OF IT.

00:43:32.868 --> 00:43:37.339
AND YOU'RE ABLE TO ADD THAT
ARCHIVE THAT YOU'RE MAKING, WITH

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.643
ALL THE ARCHIVE OF MICRO FILM
AND HE CALCULATES THAT IF YOU

00:43:41.229 --> 00:43:47.475
ADD UP THE ENTIRE WRITTEN RECORD
OF HUMANS, IN 1945, IT WOULD BE

00:43:47.476 --> 00:43:51.740
IN THE BILLIONS.
BUT WE COULD REDUCE THIS,

00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:55.456
EXTRAPOLATING A BIT.
INTO A MOVING

00:44:00.496 --> 00:44:02.496
 VAN.

00:44:04.116 --> 00:44:08.408
AND THE DEVICE THAT WOULD HOLD
ALL OF THIS TOGETHER, WOULD BE A

00:44:08.861 --> 00:44:14.100
SERIES OF MICRO FILM SCREENS
THAT YOU'D CAUSE IF FRONT OF

00:44:14.101 --> 00:44:17.052
YOU, AND YOU SEE CONNECTION YOU
WANT TO MAKE AND YOU TAKE A

00:44:17.053 --> 00:44:19.053
PICTURE OF T. AND YOU WOULD HAVE

00:44:20.877 --> 00:44:24.218
ADDED TO THE NETWORK OF
KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION.

00:44:29.269 --> 00:44:32.811
WELL, MICRO FILM COULD NOT
FORESEE THE INVENTION.

00:44:32.864 --> 00:44:36.806
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY.
HE IMAGINED THAT IN 1945, THERE

00:44:36.844 --> 00:44:41.666
WOULD BE A NEW PROFESSION OF
PEOPLE WHO MAKE CONNECTION.

00:44:42.098 --> 00:44:47.514
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAILBLAZERS,
WHO WILL FIND ALL OF THE

00:44:47.515 --> 00:44:53.047
EXCITEMENT AND THE DRAMA AND THE
MEANING AND THE HISTORY BETWEEN

00:44:53.746 --> 00:44:57.078
THE LINE.
I HOPE ALL OF YOU WILL JOIN THAT

00:44:57.563 --> 00:44:59.788
EXCITING ADVENTURE.
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS MAKE ITS

00:45:00.313 --> 00:45:02.584
POSSIBLE.
A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE BASED

00:45:02.816 --> 00:45:06.048
ON TREASURES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:17.879
SAFE.SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND 
HAVE

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.880
A GREAT DAY WANT.

00:45:23.297 --> 00:45:26.859
[APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; NEXT UP IS CANADIAN VISUAL

00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:33.842
ARTIST, SARA HAT OWN, SARA'S
DEEP INTEREST IN HUMAN NATURE

00:45:33.926 --> 00:45:35.926
AND INSATTABLE

00:45:37.227 --> 00:45:38.279
 CURIOSITY ABOUT
THE NATURAL WORLD ARE FOUND

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.597
THROUGHOUT HER PAINTINGS AND
MIXED MEDIA WORK.

00:45:41.051 --> 00:45:44.818
SHE OBSERVES, AND EXPLORING
NOTIONS OF LONGING, TRANSITION,

00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:47.894
MORALITY AND HUMAN CONNECTIONS 
WITH NATURE.

00:45:48.114 --> 00:45:51.377
SHE'S HERE TODAY, TO SHARE ABOUT
HER PROCESS OF CREATE

00:45:58.414 --> 00:46:00.414
 CREATING.

00:46:15.444 --> 00:46:19.862
I LIKE CHALLENGING MYSELF.
IN HORTICULTURAL

00:46:24.367 --> 00:46:30.793
 WAYS.
SURVIVED THE CANADIAN WINTER.OF 

00:46:30.794 --> 00:46:32.794
COURSE LIKE ANY

00:46:36.376 --> 00:46:39.883
 MILLENNIAL.
I'M ALSO A BEE

00:46:44.418 --> 00:46:45.464
 KEEPER.
SCIENCE AND NATURE ALWAYS SEEM

00:46:45.465 --> 00:46:48.695
TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE OF IT,
IT'S SOMETHING I JUST CAN'T

00:46:48.696 --> 00:46:50.767
SWITCH OFF.
I WAS INVITED HERE TODAY, TO

00:46:50.768 --> 00:46:53.726
TALK ABOUT MY LATEST SERIES OF
WORK CALLED ATTACHMENTS.

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:58.251
BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE YOU A
BIT OF BACKGROUND INTO A

00:46:58.252 --> 00:47:01.175
PREVIOUS SERIES OF WORK JUST SO
YOU START SEAT CONNECTIONS I'M

00:47:01.176 --> 00:47:03.176
TALKING

00:47:06.683 --> 00:47:08.993
 ABOUT.
2013 WAS NOT A GOOD YEAR FOR

00:47:08.994 --> 00:47:11.408
BEES.
NOT A GOOD YEAR FOR MY BEES, AS

00:47:11.526 --> 00:47:15.188
WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER BEE
KEEPERS, COLONIES IN THE REGION

00:47:15.321 --> 00:47:19.954
THEY LIVE IN.
I LOST ALL OF MY DOG KNEES,

00:47:19.955 --> 00:47:26.139
BECAUSE WE'RE A TIGHT NETWORK, I
WAS LEARNING MORE ABOUT

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:34.787
COLONIES, AND SYSTEMIC PESTICIDE
THAT IS SEEM TO BE CAUSING A LOT

00:47:34.898 --> 00:47:38.204
OF PROBLEMS WITH THE BEES.
SO WHEN I LOST MY HIVE, I WANTED

00:47:38.733 --> 00:47:43.703
TO DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL WITH
THEM SO THAT I COULD START?

00:47:43.741 --> 00:47:46.647
ACTIVISM AND START TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT THE HAPPENING BUT I DIDN'T

00:47:46.878 --> 00:47:49.398
KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I HAD ALL OF THESE THOUSANDS OF

00:47:49.603 --> 00:47:54.854
DEAD BODIES AND I DIDN'T HAVE
THE IDEA YET.

00:47:55.274 --> 00:47:58.758
I BAGGED THEM UP IN ZIP LOCKS 
AND PUT THEM IN MY FREEZER.

00:47:58.937 --> 00:48:03.272
SO I HAD MY EUREKA MOMENT.
MY FAMILY IS EITHER REALLY

00:48:03.273 --> 00:48:06.611
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THIS OR
THEY'RE RESIGNED TO THE STUFF I

00:48:07.044 --> 00:48:12.677
DO NOW.
AND THE EUREKA MOMENT CAME WHEN

00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:16.133
THE EUREKA MOMENT CAME WHEN, I
THOUGHT ABOUT THE MATHEMATICAL

00:48:16.819 --> 00:48:22.107
PATTERNS, THAT ARE INHERENT IN
NATURE, PARTICULARLY, THE

00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:26.641
SEQUENCE OF MAPS THAT IS FOUND
IN SEED-PRODUCING PLANTS LIKE

00:48:26.841 --> 00:48:29.146
THE SUNFLOWER.
AND IT WAS THESE PATTERNS THAT

00:48:29.759 --> 00:48:32.706
GAVE ME MY INSPIRATION ON WHAT
TO FINALLY DO.

00:48:33.037 --> 00:48:36.835
THESE ARE THE SORTS OF CRAPS,
TREATED WITH THE SAME PESTICIDES

00:48:36.836 --> 00:48:40.380
THAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE
DESTROYING THE BEES.

00:48:40.442 --> 00:48:45.737
SO I GLUED, ONE BY ONE, ALL THE
HONEY BEES INTO THESE PATTERNS,

00:48:45.752 --> 00:48:54.629
AND I COATED THEM WITH RESINS
AND THE RESULTING WORK, THIS IS

00:48:54.981 --> 00:48:59.072
THE PROTOTYPE.
AND I GET TO DO A COOL, BAD ASS

00:48:59.104 --> 00:49:03.485
ART DISCLAIMER HERE.
SOME OF THESE PATTERNS TEND TO

00:49:03.519 --> 00:49:08.836
SENSE VERTIGO IN SOME VIEWERS.
IF YOU START TO FEEL

00:49:08.837 --> 00:49:10.837
COMFORTABLE, JUST CLOSE YOUR

00:49:15.837 --> 00:49:24.217
EYES.THESE ARE FOUR FEET

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:37.123
 ACROSS.BECAUSE SYSTEMIC 
PESTICIDES

00:49:37.124 --> 00:49:40.481
AFFECT THE BEES'S CENTRAL
NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THEY WIPE OUT

00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:44.084
THE ABILITY TO NAVIGATE, I CHOSE
PATTERNS  FROM CROP CIRCLES AS

00:49:44.528 --> 00:49:48.921
WELL, THAT GAVE A SIMILAR
EFFECT, AN OPTICALLY ILLUSION

00:49:49.232 --> 00:49:51.232
EFFECT THAT GAVE THAT SAME SENSE
OF

00:49:54.865 --> 00:49:58.018
 ORIENTATION.
THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE THAT'S

00:49:58.019 --> 00:50:04.035
4 FEET BY 4 FEET.
ABOUT 10,000 BEES IN THAT.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:09.781
SO YOU CAN READ STUDY AFTER
STUDY OF THE DATA BEHIND THE BEE

00:50:09.828 --> 00:50:11.828
DECLINE.
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ART, ART

00:50:13.583 --> 00:50:15.583
GIVES

00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:19.925
 YOU THAT VOICE CAL GUT
PUNCH OF EMOTION THAT IS TELLS

00:50:20.377 --> 00:50:26.650
YOU THE STORY YOU'RE SEEING.
THE SERIES GOT INNER NATIONAL

00:50:27.051 --> 00:50:29.251
PRESS.
THE KEY WAS STARTING TO BE

00:50:29.252 --> 00:50:32.468
RECOGNIZED BUT NOT A LOT OF
ARTISTS OUT THERE USING

00:50:32.469 --> 00:50:34.469
THOUSANDS OF DEAD BEES AS THEIR
MEDIUM.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.334
I HOPE THAT'S STILL THE

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:50.616
 CASE.SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO 
THINK

00:50:50.617 --> 00:50:57.233
ABOUT HERE IS THAT I'VE USED A
SINGLE ITEM REPEATED ON MAP.

00:50:57.435 --> 00:51:01.343
TO SEND A SPECIFIC MESSAGE
THROUGH A SYMBOLIC PATTERN,

00:51:01.344 --> 00:51:03.769
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT
SERIES OF WORK.

00:51:03.985 --> 00:51:09.227
SO MEANWHILE IN CANADA,
LIBRARIAN ARCHIVES  IN CANADA

00:51:09.377 --> 00:51:15.386
HAD STARTED THEIR OWN MAP DYNEL
TEASATION PROJECT, A MULTI YEAR,

00:51:15.698 --> 00:51:20.935
ENORMOUS PROJECT, WITH MANY
RESOURCES DEVOTED TO T. AND

00:51:20.936 --> 00:51:24.548
THAT'S DIGITIZATION OF COMPLETE
COLLECTION OF CANADIAN

00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:26.554
EXPEDITION FORCE WARD WAR 1
FILES.

00:51:26.587 --> 00:51:31.093
THIS IS AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING
AND THE DATA PRODUCE BIDE THE

00:51:32.746 --> 00:51:34.452
DIGITIZATION PROBLEMS, IS A
TREASURE IN ITSELF.

00:51:34.453 --> 00:51:38.999
BUT AS ANYONE WHO HAS DONE A
MASSIVE DIGITIZATION PROJECT,

00:51:39.002 --> 00:51:42.736
THERE ARE BY-PRODUCT THAT IS
COME BY T. YOU HAVE TO HIRE

00:51:42.737 --> 00:51:44.737
ADDITIONAL STAPH STAPH TO
PROCESS.

00:51:45.048 --> 00:51:47.197
THESE WERE PAPER RECORDS HELD
TOGETHER FOR A HUNDRED

00:51:50.833 --> 00:51:52.833
 YEARS BY
PINS, STAPLES, AND PAPER CLIPS

00:51:53.048 --> 00:51:56.380
Q. I TOURED THE PRESERVATION
CENTER, THE THING THAT STRUCK ME

00:51:56.527 --> 00:52:01.840
AS AN ASIDE FROM THE DENSITY OF
THE PROJECT WAS THAT THEY HAD

00:52:02.013 --> 00:52:07.495
BEEN BIN AFTER BIN AFTER BIN OF
THESE PINS THAT THAT HELD THE

00:52:07.831 --> 00:52:11.403
RECORDS TOGETHER.
IT STRUCK ME AS SO MOVING  TO Z

00:52:11.842 --> 00:52:14.049
PHYSICALLY REPRESENTED IN FRONT
OF ME, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THIS

00:52:14.398 --> 00:52:15.912
WAS.
AND I ASKED THEM, CAN WHAT ARE

00:52:15.913 --> 00:52:18.278
YOU GOING TO DO WITH ALL OF
THESE PINS?

00:52:18.496 --> 00:52:21.454
THEY SAID L WE WANT TO DO
SOMETHING TO COMMEMORATE THE

00:52:21.455 --> 00:52:23.496
PROJECT BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT.

00:52:23.628 --> 00:52:30.199
WE'RE THINKING OF MELTING THEM
ALL DOWN, AND MAKING NETTALS.I 

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.048
THOUGHT, THAT DOESN'T SIT WELL
WITH ME.

00:52:32.049 --> 00:52:34.806
I HAD THE REACTION OF SEEING A
NUMBER OF THEM, AND THESE WERE

00:52:35.348 --> 00:52:39.081
ITEMS THAT HELD TOGETHER
CANADA'S MILITARY MEMORY FOR A

00:52:39.297 --> 00:52:42.817
HUNDRED YEARS.
YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE THAT AND

00:52:42.818 --> 00:52:44.963
KIND OF DESTROY IT BY MELT
TOGETHERRAL TOGETHER.

00:52:45.286 --> 00:52:48.195
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT AGAIN,
WAITING FOR MY EUREKA AND ALL

00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:51.054
THAT.
SO I SAID, GIVE ME ONE OF THEM

00:52:51.191 --> 00:52:53.643
TO TAKE HOME, AND I'LL THINK
ABOUT THIS AND SEE WHAT I COME

00:52:54.412 --> 00:52:57.414
UP WITH.
SO I TOOK ONE OF THEM BACK.

00:52:57.445 --> 00:53:00.244
I WAS JUST SITTING THERE,
LOOKING AT IT AND I THOUGHT EACH

00:53:02.264 --> 00:53:08.874
ONE OF THESE HAS BEEN EMBOSSED
WITH A STAR.

00:53:09.105 --> 00:53:11.248
SO THIS IS WHAT I

00:53:14.968 --> 00:53:19.578
 DID.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A SINGLE BRASS

00:53:19.579 --> 00:53:21.579
PASTNER PIN.
IT'S 100 YEARS OLD MUCH THESE

00:53:22.191 --> 00:53:25.833
ARE THE PINS THAT HELD TOGETHER
THE MILITARY SERVICE RECORDS OF

00:53:26.577 --> 00:53:30.099
EACH CANADIAN SOLDIER WHO SERVED
IN THE FIST WARD WAR.

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:34.023
&gt;&gt; VIDEO: WHEN LIBRARY AND
ARCHIVES CAN DARKS BEGAN THEIR

00:53:34.286 --> 00:53:36.873
MASS DYNEL TEASATION OF SOLDIERS
FILES.

00:53:37.226 --> 00:53:39.761
EACH PIN HAD TO BE DETACHED BY
HAND.

00:53:41.162 --> 00:53:47.570
IN TOTAL, THERE WERE 640,000.

00:53:57.262 --> 00:53:59.395
NOBODY QUEUE WHAT TO DO WITH ALL
THIS BRASS.

00:53:59.593 --> 00:54:03.718
SO THEY ASKED AN ARTIST.
&gt;&gt; I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITH

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.759
THESE PASTNERS THAT WOULD
PRESERVE THEIR MEANING AS

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.467
HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS BUT THEY
WOULD FIND A RESPECTFUL WAY TO

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.967
CONVEY THE MAGNITUDE OF HUMAN

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:24.089
LOSS.
EACH PASTNER IS STAMPED WITH A

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.120
STAR.

00:54:35.316 --> 00:54:38.847
AND THINK ABOUT THE SACRIFICE
AND (INAUDIBLE) THAT GIVE ME

00:54:43.301 --> 00:54:46.339
INSPIRATION.
IT STARTED BY FOCUSING ON THE 5

00:54:46.376 --> 00:54:51.202
MAJOR BATTLES OF THE WAR, THAT
INVOLVED THE CANADIANS POSITION

00:54:51.933 --> 00:54:54.824
IN THE WAR.
&gt;&gt; AFTER DETERMINING THE

00:54:54.825 --> 00:55:00.285
GEOGRAPHICAL COORDINATES OF EACH
OF THESE, HATON GENERATED STAR

00:55:00.326 --> 00:55:03.190
MASKLESS OF WHAT THE STARS WOULD
HAVE LOOKED LIKE, ON THE NIGHTS

00:55:03.659 --> 00:55:05.976
FOLLOWING EACH OF THESE MAJOR
CONFLICTS.

00:55:06.112 --> 00:55:08.904
THEN SHE GOT TO WORK.

00:55:54.381 --> 00:55:58.130
THE RESULTS IS A SERIES OF STARS
TITLED

00:56:01.455 --> 00:56:03.068
 DETACHMENT.
THESE PIECES SHOW US EXACTLY HOW

00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:08.003
THE STARS APPEARED 1100 YEARS
AGO.  THE FIST NIGHT AFTER THE

00:56:08.507 --> 00:56:14.092
FIGHTING WAS OVER.
THE SKIES THAT NO DOUBT, THE

00:56:14.093 --> 00:56:16.093
SURVIVING SOLDIERS WOULD HAVE
BEEN OKAYING

00:56:20.153 --> 00:56:27.889
 LOOKING AT THAT.
&gt;&gt; THIS SERIES IS A SACRIFICE

00:56:28.116 --> 00:56:30.124
TIME TO

00:56:35.143 --> 00:56:37.976
 REMEMBER.
STARS ARE A CROSS CULTURAL

00:56:37.977 --> 00:56:42.964
CONFLICT AS IT LOOKS  TO
DIRECTION.

00:56:45.166 --> 00:56:46.513
WHETHER THAT'S SPIRITUAL OR
NAVIGATION.

00:56:46.514 --> 00:56:48.514
THERE ARE UNIVERSAL

00:56:51.848 --> 00:56:55.300
 WAYS WE
MEMBER COMMENTS OR IALIZE THE

00:56:59.678 --> 00:57:04.664
WAY -- THERE ARE UNIVERSAL WAYS
THAT WE

00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:15.400
 MEMORIALIZE THE STARS.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU TO CANADA FOR

00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:20.442
POINTING ME IN THIS DIRECTION
AND IN PARTICULAR, LIBRARIAN

00:57:20.443 --> 00:57:22.443
[INDISCERNIBLE] FOR HIS SUPPORT
IN THIS PROJECT.

00:57:22.462 --> 00:57:27.681
AND I THANK THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS FOR INVITING ME TO SHOW

00:57:27.817 --> 00:57:31.184
THIS TO YOU.
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR.

00:57:31.542 --> 00:57:33.542
[APPLAUSE].

00:57:41.239 --> 00:57:46.223
THANK YOU.
WONDERFUL, SAY A. NEXT IS SARA

00:57:47.288 --> 00:57:50.506
STILLER, IN THE RARE BOOK AND
SPECIAL COLLECTIONS DIVISION OF

00:57:50.775 --> 00:57:54.984
THE LOCKE.
PRIOR TO JOINING LIBRARY OF

00:57:54.985 --> 00:58:00.592
CONGRESS, SHED AS THE PROFESSOR
OF HISTORY, AT WASHINGTON AND

00:58:01.582 --> 00:58:04.328
LEE UNIVERSITY WHERE SHE TAUGHT
CLASSES  ON DIGITAL EXHIBITION

00:58:04.528 --> 00:58:06.731
AND DESIGN, PUBLIC HISTORY AND
DIGITAL STORY TELLING.

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.916
SHE'S GOING TO HIGHLIGHT SOME
WORK AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

00:58:10.001 --> 00:58:14.446
THAT RELATES TO COLLECTIONS AS
DATA IN HER TALK, ONLY ONCE

00:58:14.447 --> 00:58:16.447
IMAGINED.
STEPHANIE.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:36.913
I'VE REALLY COME TO REPORT DEPTH
OF KNOWLEDGE AND COMMITMENT THAT

00:58:36.914 --> 00:58:40.363
THEY HAVE TO SHARING THE
LIBRARY'S COLLECTIONS, WHICH I

00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:43.275
THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE SEE
HERE TODAY.

00:58:43.683 --> 00:58:47.545
AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU ALSO TO
SARA FOR THAT LOVELY

00:58:47.546 --> 00:58:49.622
PRESENTATION.
WE WERE JUST COMMENTING OF HOW

00:58:49.637 --> 00:58:52.565
WE WERE TEARING UP A LITTLE BIT
IN THE BACK.

00:58:56.747 --> 00:59:03.855
SO THE TITLE OF MY TALK I THINK
IS A LITTLE BIT RISQUE TO BEGIN

00:59:04.035 --> 00:59:07.642
MY TALK WITH A PEOPLE
CALLED "THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN

00:59:07.686 --> 00:59:13.705
AND HELL" BUT NONETHELESS, HERE
WE G. I AM THE CURATOR HERE AT

00:59:13.936 --> 00:59:17.051
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND I
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF OVERSEEING

00:59:17.258 --> 00:59:20.810
ONE OF THE LARGEST WILLIAM BLAKE
COLLECTIONS IN THE WORLD.

00:59:20.841 --> 00:59:24.236
AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF SAYING
THAT OUT LOUD.

00:59:24.282 --> 00:59:27.476
THAT'S ALWAYS A REALLY FUN
STATEMENT TO SAY AT ANY POINT,

00:59:29.497 --> 00:59:33.972
REALLY.
SO SO I THINK ABOUT BLAKE A

00:59:33.973 --> 00:59:37.340
LOT.
AND BLAKE WROTE THIS PARTICULAR

00:59:37.362 --> 00:59:41.072
WORK IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE
FRENCH REVOLUTION.

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:49.129
AND THE POEM IS VERY MUCH THIS
HOMAGE TO THE CONCEPT OF

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:52.293
CHANGE.
TO CHANGE AND CONVENTIONAL

00:59:52.294 --> 00:59:56.022
MORALITY, TO CHANGE IN POLITICS
TO, CHANGE IN RELIGION AND IT'S

00:59:56.227 --> 00:59:58.227
A QUITE

01:00:00.185 --> 01:00:02.788
 INSPIRING "D."
SO AS A RARE BOOKS CURATOR, I

01:00:02.937 --> 01:00:06.679
THINK ABOUT A LOT, AND I THINK
ABOUT THIS IDEA OF THE ONCE

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.836
IMAGINED QUITE A BIT.
AND I USUALLY THINK ABOUT IT IN

01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:17.662
THE CONTEXT OF THE WAY PRINTING
CHARGED EUROPEAN SOCIETY AFTER

01:00:17.825 --> 01:00:20.813
1455.
AND I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:00:20.857 --> 01:00:24.678
EUROPEANS SAW OR WHAT THEY WERE
THINK CHICAGO THEY SAW THE

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.779
 FIRST
IMAGE OF THE MOON THROUGH A

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.731
TELESCOPE OR THE FIRST
MICROSCOPIC IMAGE OF A FEATHER,

01:00:36.732 --> 01:00:42.158
AND I THINK ABOUT HOW THESE
VISUALIZATIONS EMPOWERED BELIEVE

01:00:42.226 --> 01:00:44.226
KNOWLEDGE, AND REALLY

01:00:47.423 --> 01:00:48.105
 UPENDED
TRADITIONAL INTELLECTUAL

01:00:48.106 --> 01:00:50.267
THOUGHT.
SO I THINK

01:00:55.271 --> 01:00:59.511
 ABOUT.
SO WHAT IS INSPIRE BEING THIS

01:00:59.727 --> 01:01:05.770
MOMENT IN HISTORY, ABOUT OUR
MOMENT IN HISTORY, IS THAT THE

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.899
WAY, DIGITAL TOOLS ARE ALLOWING
US TO LIVE IN THIS AGE, WHERE

01:01:11.303 --> 01:01:13.995
THE ONCE IMAGINED IS TRUE

01:01:17.142 --> 01:01:20.018
AGAIN.
AND THROUGH DATA SETS, THROUGH

01:01:20.406 --> 01:01:23.870
NEW VISUALIZATION, WE'RE ABLE TO
ASK QUESTIONS THAT SIMPLY

01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:25.886
WEREN'T POSSIBLE

01:01:30.913 --> 01:01:35.972
 BEFORE.
IN A WAY, WE'RE STANDINGA

01:01:35.973 --> 01:01:37.184
AT THIS SIMILAR MOMENT OF
CHANGE.

01:01:37.185 --> 01:01:40.403
TODAY I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK
ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE AT THE

01:01:40.404 --> 01:01:45.097
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
-- IN TERMS HAVE A CONFESSION

01:01:45.305 --> 01:01:49.159
AND I WORK AT THE LARGEST
LIBRARY IN THE WORLD AND I'M NOT

01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:53.525
A LIBRARIAN.
THIS IS A RECURRING CONFESSION

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:56.808
IN MY LIFE.
I'VE TAUGHT DIGITAL HUMANITIES,

01:01:56.939 --> 01:02:02.238
AND I'M NOT A TECH GIST WANT A
LOT OF MY RESEARCH RIGHT NOW,

01:02:02.288 --> 01:02:05.194
PHOBE ON THE IMPACT OF
PRESERVATION TECHNOLOGY, AND I'M

01:02:05.509 --> 01:02:14.472
IN NO WAY, A SCIENTIST.
BUT WHAT I AM IS A HISTORIAN

01:02:14.473 --> 01:02:18.853
THAT HAS WANDERED INTO THE ONE
OF THE GREATEST REPOSITORIES OF

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:23.392
HUMAN EXPERIENCE OF AMASSED HERE
AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

01:02:23.445 --> 01:02:29.693
AT OVER 1 60 MILLION ITEMS HERE
AT THE LIBRARY, WE ARE A GALAXY

01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:34.011
OF STORIES.
SO TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:02:34.336 --> 01:02:36.426
MY METHODS OF USING THESE
RESOURCE.

01:02:36.973 --> 01:02:41.177
BUT I THINK THAT'S FAR MORE
EXCITING IS THAT MY VOICE, I

01:02:41.178 --> 01:02:48.228
THINK IS PART OF THIS MUCH
LARGER CHOIR OF RESEARCH, THAT'S

01:02:48.544 --> 01:02:51.092
REALLY CHANGING THE WAY WE'RE
THINKING ABOUT OUR COLLECTIONS

01:02:51.324 --> 01:02:54.225
AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
SO THE FIRST TIME I STEPPED INTO

01:02:54.226 --> 01:03:00.035
THE LIBRARY WAS NOT AS A CURE
RATER.

01:03:00.063 --> 01:03:02.371
IT WAS BECOMEBACK IN 2012.
AND AT TIME.

01:03:02.706 --> 01:03:10.715
I HAD THIS VERY SIMPLE GOAL, I
WANTED TO TELL A STORY ABOUT

01:03:10.716 --> 01:03:12.968
BOOKS.
I WAS INTERESTED IN HOW BOOKS

01:03:13.015 --> 01:03:17.623
MOVED THROUGH TIME AND SPACE.
I WAS INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE

01:03:17.676 --> 01:03:20.850
WHO OWNED THEM AND THE WAY THEY
USED THEM AND CHANGED THEM FOR

01:03:22.875 --> 01:03:24.875
THEIR OWN

01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:30.168
 USE BOOKS HAVE A LIFE
OF THEIR

01:03:34.174 --> 01:03:37.402
 OWN AND THE EARLY
MODERN WORLD, PARTICULARLY, IN

01:03:38.743 --> 01:03:43.860
THE WESTERN WORLD, PEOPLE WOULD
ANNOTATE AND DRAW IN THEIR

01:03:43.861 --> 01:03:45.861
BOOKS, TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND
THE INFORMATION BETTER.

01:03:46.374 --> 01:03:52.320
AND I WAS TERRIBLY INTERESTED IN
THIS IDEA AS ATTEMPTS TO

01:03:52.321 --> 01:03:54.230
ORGANIZE KNOWLEDGE.
TO USE BOOKS IN THIS VERY

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:59.932
PERSONAL WAY, TO CLASSIFY THE
WORLD AROUND YOU, TO MAKE

01:03:59.933 --> 01:04:04.538
INFORMATION PERSONAL.
BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:04:04.539 --> 01:04:08.101
WORKING WITH OLD BOOKS IS THEY
OFTEN BEAR THE SCARS OF MOVING

01:04:08.514 --> 01:04:16.341
THROUGH TIME AND SWAYS.
AN NOTATIONS FADE MUCH PIGMENTS

01:04:16.756 --> 01:04:19.476
CARODE.
BOOKS ARE REBOUND AND RESOLD. 

01:04:19.834 --> 01:04:23.867
MANY OF THEM LIVE THROUGH
REVOLUTIONS AND POLITICAL AND

01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:28.430
RELIGIOUS CENSORSHIP, THEY HAVE
CROSSED CONTINENTS SEVERAL TIMES

01:04:29.079 --> 01:04:33.616
OVER, AND THIS ALL ADDS TO THE
STORY OF YOUR BOOK.

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:39.020
BUT IT ALSO ADDS ANOTHER LAYER
OF RESEARCH THAT'S VERY

01:04:39.021 --> 01:04:42.917
DIFFICULT TO ACCESS, AS JUST THE
HISTORIAN.

01:04:43.023 --> 01:04:46.566
SO I WANTED TO FOLLOW A BOOK
WHEN I GOT HERE.

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:51.887
BUT I FEEDED A NEEDED SOMEONE TO
HELP ME.

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:56.205
I NEEDED A TEAM OF DETECTIVES
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I FOUND

01:04:56.206 --> 01:04:59.136
IN THE PRESERVATION RESEARCH AND
TESTING DIVISION HERE AT THE

01:04:59.137 --> 01:05:02.554
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE, THAT

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:07.012
DO NOT WORK HERE, ONE OF THE
MOST EXTRAORDINARY RESOURCE WE

01:05:07.229 --> 01:05:13.748
HAVE AT THE LIBRARY ARE THESE
STEP TRAINING  TRAINING  AND

01:05:13.749 --> 01:05:16.991
LABS THAT ARE FILLED WITH THIS
FABULOUS

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:23.928
 TECHNOLOGY MUCH THAT I
DO NOT UNDERSTAND, AND TEAMS

01:05:23.929 --> 01:05:27.298
LOOKING AT OUR COLLECTIONS AS
OBJECTS AND DIGGING BEYOND WHAT

01:05:27.367 --> 01:05:33.264
WE SEE UNDER THE SURFACE.
SO WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE

01:05:33.265 --> 01:05:35.265
LIBRARY, I MET PEOPLE THAT
SPECIALIZE IN TECHNOLOGY THEY

01:05:35.509 --> 01:05:38.572
NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE.
AGAIN, I'M A HISTORIAN.

01:05:38.788 --> 01:05:45.142
SO THINGS LIKE MULTI SPECTRAL
IMAGING AND EXTRA FLORESSENTS,

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.400
AND

01:05:51.616 --> 01:05:55.482
 MICROSCOPE DON'T
[INDISCERNIBLE] INTO MY

01:05:55.483 --> 01:05:57.234
CATEGORY.
BUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE

01:05:57.235 --> 01:06:00.918
RESULTLESS I NEEDED TO GET TO
THIS PROBLEMS AND THERE WAS

01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:02.883
NOWHERE ELSE I WAS GOING TO FIND
THIS COMBINATION OF RESOURCES 

01:06:02.884 --> 01:06:06.513
AND EXPERTISE.
BUT AT THE LIBRARY OF

01:06:11.172 --> 01:06:14.531
 CONGRESS.
SO EVENTUALLY, I SETTLE BOD THIS

01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:18.375
WONDERFUL BOOK.
A WORLD ATLAS.

01:06:18.429 --> 01:06:22.085
THE PRINTING WAS LOVELY, BUT THE
COLORING IN THE BOOK WAS SLOPE,

01:06:22.089 --> 01:06:25.988
THERE WERE AN NOTATIONS.
IT WAS BORING IN ONE PLACE, AND

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:28.293
INTEREST IN ANOTHER.
AND IT WAS PROBLEMATIC.

01:06:28.728 --> 01:06:31.970
I CAME TO APPRECIATE PROBLEMATIC
BOOKS.

01:06:32.287 --> 01:06:34.287
THEY TELL GREAT

01:06:37.319 --> 01:06:39.465
 STORIES.
THE BOOK THAT IS LOOK LIKE CRAP,

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:42.764
BRING THEM ON.
SO I SETTLED ON THIS BOOK.

01:06:43.096 --> 01:06:46.396
AND LIKE MOST RESEARCH, THE
CONCLUSIONS OF THE PROJECT ENDED

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:52.479
UP BEING MUCH MORE THAN I
EXPECTED, AND I DON'T KNOW TO

01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:54.829
BURDEN THIS WITH TOO MANY
SPECIFICS.

01:06:55.149 --> 01:06:57.223
BUT VERY BRIEFLY.
SO THE ORIGINAL PRINT PLACED THE

01:06:57.756 --> 01:07:05.014
BEGINNING OF MY STORY WITH THE
SON OF A KNIFE MAKER IN 17TH

01:07:05.015 --> 01:07:11.598
CENTURY AMSTERDAM, IN THE PRINT
SHOP CALLED THE THREE CRAFTS: 

01:07:12.035 --> 01:07:17.169
ANALYSIS OF THE AN NOTATIONS
REVEALED BY BOOK MOVED TO ITALY

01:07:17.392 --> 01:07:22.424
W A STUDENT OF MILITARY
GEOGRAPHYY IN THE 18TH CENTURY

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:27.481
AND HE LIKELY HAD SIGNATURE AN
NOTATIONS, SORT OF REVEALING

01:07:27.482 --> 01:07:32.721
THIS INTERESTING SORT OF
ORGANIZATION OF HIS GEOGRAPHIC

01:07:32.774 --> 01:07:34.380
KNOWLEDGE.
THE PIGMENT ANALYSIS, INTRODUCED

01:07:34.381 --> 01:07:42.221
ME TO A 19TH CENTURY OWNER, THAT
TOUCHED UP THE COLORS.

01:07:43.238 --> 01:07:45.833
AND EVENTUALLY FOUND ITS WAY TO
THE COLLECTIONS OF ONE OF THE

01:07:47.153 --> 01:07:50.514
LIBRARY'S GREATEST BENEFACTORS
AND ONLY INTO THE LIBRARY

01:07:50.515 --> 01:07:57.143
COLLECTION IN 1980.
SO THIS WAS, AGAIN, THERE WAS A

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.320
LOT THAT IN THE END, OF COURSE I
HAD MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT MY

01:08:01.321 --> 01:08:02.728
BOOK.
THIS IS A GREAT STORY.

01:08:02.729 --> 01:08:08.614
ONE THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK
ABOUT IN TERMS OF THIS JOURNEY

01:08:08.676 --> 01:08:12.558
QUITE OFFER, WHICH HAS REALLY
BEEN LOVE LEAST AND ALL EMERGES

01:08:12.905 --> 01:08:16.396
OUT OF THIS EARLY RESEARCH AT
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

01:08:16.596 --> 01:08:24.066
SO NOW I HAVE THE GREAT HONOR OF
BEING THE CURE RATER OF THE

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:27.137
COLLECTION, WHICH IS ONE OF THE
GREATEST GRAPHIC ART COLLECTIONS

01:08:27.152 --> 01:08:30.309
IN THE WORLD.
AND SINCE I'VE BECOME THE CURATE

01:08:30.317 --> 01:08:34.805
O I CONTINUED TO WORK WITH OUR
PRESERVATION DIVISION TO THINK

01:08:35.613 --> 01:08:39.682
ABOUT UNLOCKING NEW STORIES.
OPENING NEW

01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:46.689
 CORES

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:49.916
 NEW DOORS AND
NEW RESEARCH.

01:08:50.854 --> 01:08:55.907
THROUGH MULTIEL SPECTRAL
IMAGING, WE WERE ABLE TO

01:08:55.908 --> 01:08:57.908
IDENTIFY ST. CATHERINE OF
ALEXANDRIA.

01:08:58.596 --> 01:09:00.948
IT'S QUITE RARE.
NOT MANY OF THESE SURVIVED BUT

01:09:01.458 --> 01:09:04.914
WE'RE ABLE TO RECOVER THIS
IMAGE.

01:09:04.952 --> 01:09:08.760
RIGHTFULLY SO, BECAUSE
ST. CATHERINE IS A PATRON OF

01:09:08.761 --> 01:09:10.957
LIBRARIANS.
WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT

01:09:11.158 --> 01:09:13.158
HER BACK.
WE SHOULD ALL

01:09:16.579 --> 01:09:16.640
 EXPECT GOOD
FORTUNATE.

01:09:16.641 --> 01:09:25.801
WE HAVE IN THE ROSENWALL
COLLECTION, WE HAVE WILLIAM

01:09:25.802 --> 01:09:31.075
BLAKES, THE FIRST OF HIS
CONTINENTAL PROPHECIES  AND THIS

01:09:31.795 --> 01:09:36.885
PLATE HAS PERSONAL, PENCIL AN
NOTATIONS FROM WILLIAM BLAKE AND

01:09:36.916 --> 01:09:41.002
THEY'RE FADING.
SO THROUGH MULTIEL SPECTOR RAUL

01:09:41.485 --> 01:09:44.018
IMAGING AND PRINCIPLE COMPONENT
ANALYSIS, WE'RE ABLE TO PULL OUT

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:47.375
THESE AN NOTATIONS, WHICH ARE
ESSENTIAL FOR THE HISTORICAL

01:09:47.376 --> 01:09:49.932
RECORD FOR WILLIAM

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960
 BLAKE.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:02.557
  ONE
OF THE RARE BOOKS IS A

01:10:02.558 --> 01:10:05.900
PARTICULAR TYPE OF DOWN MARKET
PRINT FIGURE THE 15TH CENTURY.

01:10:06.337 --> 01:10:08.809
THESE ARE CALLED BLOCK

01:10:13.824 --> 01:10:15.824
 BOOKS

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.323
THESE ARE REALLY THE PRINTS THAT
HELP GUIDE EUROPEAN DEVOTION FOR

01:10:38.507 --> 01:10:40.507
NEARLY A CENTURY.
THESE NEW TECHNICAL STUDIES ARE

01:10:40.568 --> 01:10:45.958
REALLY HELPING US THINK ABOUT
NEW SITES OF PRODUCTION FOR

01:10:45.959 --> 01:10:50.316
THESE PARTICULAR WORKS, THROUGH
ANALYSIS OF PIGMENTS, THROUGH

01:10:52.328 --> 01:10:54.901
ANALYSIS OF INK, THROUGH ANAL IS

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:02.537
ANALYSIS OF INK AND PAPER.
AND WE'RE ABLE TO GET THROUGH

01:11:02.757 --> 01:11:06.354
THESE RESOURCES  IN A NEW AND
FASCINATING

01:11:11.369 --> 01:11:16.930
 WAY.
EVEN WITH NOW BEING THE

01:11:16.931 --> 01:11:20.286
ROSENWAL'S CURATOR, I STILL
THINK ABOUT MY ONE BOOK, AND I

01:11:20.507 --> 01:11:25.211
THINK ABOUT WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
AND WHY I WAS ABLE TO TELL THAT

01:11:27.868 --> 01:11:29.819
STORY.
AND I THINK ABOUT THAT ONE STORY

01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:34.617
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR
1 60 MILLION ITEMS AT THE

01:11:34.618 --> 01:11:36.587
LIBRARY.
AND EACH ONE OF THEM HAVING

01:11:36.588 --> 01:11:41.237
THEIR OWN STORY.
AND A LOT OF OUR COLLECTIONS OF

01:11:41.391 --> 01:11:47.010
COURSE TOUCHED BY NAMES THAT WE
KNOW.

01:11:47.227 --> 01:11:50.834
NAME THAT IS WE REMEMBER.
NAMES LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON,

01:11:51.269 --> 01:11:53.269
THOMAS

01:11:58.303 --> 01:12:00.303
 JEFFERSON.

01:12:04.968 --> 01:12:08.489
I THINK WHAT'S MOST EXCITING,
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENING AT THE

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:13.452
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS RIGHT NOW IS
THAT WE'RE STARTING TO DISCOVER

01:12:13.453 --> 01:12:16.871
I THINK, THE PEOPLE THAT WE
RARELY HEAR FROM IN OUR

01:12:16.872 --> 01:12:19.447
COLLECTION OR WE'RE JUST
STARTING TO HEAR FROM IN OUR

01:12:19.448 --> 01:12:23.299
COLLECTIONS AND NEW STORIES THAT
ARE COMING, OR THAT ARE EMERGING

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:29.934
FROM THE LIBRARY, FROM NEW
PARTNERSHIP AND NEW RESEARCH IN

01:12:30.273 --> 01:12:32.976
OUR COLLECTIONS.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE CHRONICELLING

01:12:33.771 --> 01:12:36.240
AMERICA API, WHICH IS SOMETHING
THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP.

01:12:36.388 --> 01:12:40.038
IT'S HELPING US LEARN ABOUT
AMERICAN AGRICULTURE.

01:12:40.554 --> 01:12:43.925
THINKING ABOUT THIS SORT OF,
WHAT THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:48.070
PROJECT CALL THIS LONG, HUMAN
HISTORY OF AGRICULTURE, AND THE

01:12:48.286 --> 01:12:55.661
WAY THAT AMERICANS WERE SWEPT
INTO INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY

01:12:55.692 --> 01:13:00.918
AND SCIENCE THAT HAS COME TO
REALLY DEFINE MATERNITY.

01:13:01.402 --> 01:13:04.659
I'VE PERSONALLY FORWARD TODAY TO
THE HISTORIAN AT DEPARTMENT OF

01:13:04.693 --> 01:13:06.693
AGRICULTURE AND HE'S

01:13:09.081 --> 01:13:09.835
 JUST
DEDELIGHTED BY BY THIS PROJECT.

01:13:10.617 --> 01:13:13.896
SO IT'S REALLY SATISFYING TO ME
TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THIS WITH

01:13:15.816 --> 01:13:17.964
SOMEONE.
THE AVAILABILITY OF NEWSPAPERS,

01:13:18.282 --> 01:13:24.349
AND THE NEW AMERICA API IS
FACILITATING NEW CONVERSATIONS 

01:13:24.965 --> 01:13:27.061
WITH AMERICAN LYNCHING, PAYING
NECESSARY AND CLOSE ATTENTION TO

01:13:28.493 --> 01:13:34.283
THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT MOBS AND
EXPLORING HOW NEWSPAPERS PLAYED

01:13:34.298 --> 01:13:39.494
THIS DUAL ROLE BETWEEN VIOLENCE
AND REFORM AND THINK BEING

01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:46.507
 THAT

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:52.137
THAT, WE ARE JUST STARTING TO
LEARN, WHAT WILL BE THE RELEASE

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:54.167
OF OUR 25 MILLION MARK

01:13:58.027 --> 01:13:58.613
 RECORD.
BENJAMIN SCHMIDT FROM NORTHWEST

01:13:58.614 --> 01:14:03.383
UNIVERSITY IS USING THE DATA OF
MARKED CATALOGING AT THE

01:14:03.384 --> 01:14:05.063
LIBRARY.
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS I

01:14:05.064 --> 01:14:08.822
ENCOURAGING YOU TO GO LOOK.
IT IS QUITE FANTASTIC AND HAS

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:12.227
THE POTENTIAL FOR INSIGHTS INTO
OUR OWN INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY.

01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:16.397
I'VE BEEN AT MANY MEETINGS NOW,
WHERE THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:14:16.711 --> 01:14:22.095
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU, EVERYONE
AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS HAS

01:14:22.096 --> 01:14:26.308
AN OPINION ABOUT THIS PROJECT,
WHICH IS NICE TO SEE.

01:14:26.347 --> 01:14:30.536
THIS IS WHAT THESE PROJECTS DO.
THEY FACILITATE THESE SORT OF

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:33.819
FABULOUS CONVERSATIONS, AND IT'S
NICE TO SEE IT HERE, CERTAINLY

01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:36.054
AT THE

01:14:38.319 --> 01:14:41.223
 LIBRARY.
SO JUST TO WRAP

01:14:44.852 --> 01:14:46.331
 UP.
I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT MY

01:14:46.332 --> 01:14:51.709
EXPERIENCE AT THE LIBRARY, AND
MY COLLECTION THEY CURATE.

01:14:53.882 --> 01:14:57.165
AGAIN, ONE COLLECTION WITHIN A
GALAXY OF

01:15:00.285 --> 01:15:03.691
 COLLECTIONS AND I'D
LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS THIS

01:15:03.692 --> 01:15:07.130
SMART PART OF EMERGING RESEARCH
HERE AT THE LIBRARY, WHERE WE

01:15:07.816 --> 01:15:13.811
CONTINUE TO FIND THOSE STORIES
THAT ARE HIDDEN IN OUR

01:15:13.812 --> 01:15:15.812
COLLECTION.
AND WHETHER THAT BE AN

01:15:19.139 --> 01:15:21.139
 AMERICAN
FARMER OR OUR OWN CATALOGERS OR

01:15:21.191 --> 01:15:23.191
SON OF A KNIFE MAKER IN
AMSTERDAM IN

01:15:26.144 --> 01:15:28.570
 THE 16TH CENTURY.
AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE OUR AT

01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:32.201
THAT TIME A WHICH AGAIN, WE'RE
AT THIS REALLY EXCITING MOMENT

01:15:32.336 --> 01:15:36.536
WHERE WE'RE HAVING A RENAISSANCE
WITH OUR DATA, THAT WE'RE

01:15:36.537 --> 01:15:40.327
STARTING TO THINK TOGETHER ABOUT
THE DIGITAL TOOL THAT IS MIGHT

01:15:40.562 --> 01:15:46.644
HELP US FIND THESE NEW STORIES.
WE CAN ONLY DO THAT TOGETHER.BUT

01:15:46.864 --> 01:15:53.254
 WHAT IS SO UNIQUE I THINK
ABOUT THIS MOMENT, IS GOING BACK

01:15:53.523 --> 01:15:56.792
TO BLAKE'S QUOTE OF THE ONCE
ONLY IMAGINED.

01:15:56.841 --> 01:15:59.602
THAT WE STAND AT THAT MOMENT OF
CHANGE RIGHT NOW AND AS WE KEEP

01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:02.888
WORKING TOGETHER, AS WE KEEP
DISCOVERING THESE COLLECTIONS,

01:16:03.245 --> 01:16:09.223
AND AS WE KEEP MAKING THEM MORE
AVAILABLE, I FEEL LIKE WE COME

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:15.164
CLOSER TO TRULY SAYING THAT WHAT
WE IMAGINED TODAY, WE VERY WELL

01:16:15.395 --> 01:16:21.320
MAY BE ABLE TO PROVE TOMORROW.
THANK YOU.

01:16:26.393 --> 01:16:30.702
[APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, STEPHANIE.

01:16:30.922 --> 01:16:33.524
OUR FINAL TALK BEFORE THE BREAK
IS FROM STEVEN

01:16:36.841 --> 01:16:38.645
 ROBERTSON.
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AT THE

01:16:38.646 --> 01:16:44.342
GEORGE MASON DRIVE UNIVERSITY.
HE WILL TELL A STORY ABOUT

01:16:44.343 --> 01:16:50.977
DIGITAL HARLEM, A PROJECT THAT
WON THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL

01:16:50.978 --> 01:16:55.005
ASSOCIATIONS ROY PRIZE FOR
DIGITAL HISTORY AND ABCCLIO ON

01:16:55.227 --> 01:16:58.695
LINE HISTORY AWARD OF THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN

01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:03.189
2010.
YOU'RE

01:17:06.313 --> 01:17:12.145
 OSTEVEN.
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, A QUICK SHOUT

01:17:12.314 --> 01:17:16.296
OUT TO THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE HERE
AT THE HI LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

01:17:16.359 --> 01:17:21.896
I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO MAPS, TO
TALK ABOUT DATA IF PLACE.

01:17:24.662 --> 01:17:27.315
HISTORICAL SOURCES ARE FULL OF
DATA ABOUT PLACES  AND

01:17:27.316 --> 01:17:30.990
LOCATIONS.
THE SPECIAL DATA IS NOT VERY

01:17:30.991 --> 01:17:34.650
INTELLIGIBLE IN TEXTUAL STORM,
AND EVEN WHEN EXTRACTED IN

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:37.906
TABULAR FORM, IT REALLY DOESN'T
TELL US A LOT.  IT'S HOW TO

01:17:37.907 --> 01:17:41.233
DOESN'T THE STORY THAT IT HAS TO
TELL

01:17:45.539 --> 01:17:47.171
 US.
NOW, MAPPING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR

01:17:47.172 --> 01:17:52.049
A LONG TIME.
IT'S BECOME ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE

01:17:52.064 --> 01:17:56.311
ARRANGE OF PEOPLE.
YOU USED  TO HAVE TO GO FIND THE

01:17:57.297 --> 01:18:03.694
GAS PERSON, TO MAKE A MAP
PROJECT.

01:18:03.926 --> 01:18:09.011
THE PROJECT THAT I AM HERE TO
TALK ABOUT TODAY, OWES ITS FORM

01:18:09.969 --> 01:18:12.807
TO A LAUNCH OF GOOGLE MAPS  IN
2005.

01:18:12.839 --> 01:18:15.112
SHAUN WHITE PUT TOGETHER A TEAM
OF FOUR HISTORIANS.

01:18:15.158 --> 01:18:18.771
UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, IN WHICH I
WAS A JUNIOR MEMBER TO COA STUDY

01:18:19.113 --> 01:18:22.541
OF EVERY DAY LIFE IN NEW YORK
CITY'S HARLEM NEIGHBORHOOD IN

01:18:22.557 --> 01:18:26.170
THE 1920'S.
KEY SOURCES FOR THIS TO GET

01:18:26.171 --> 01:18:31.958
BEYOND THE POLITICAL AND
ARTISTIC ELITE THAT DOMINATE

01:18:31.959 --> 01:18:35.851
ACCOUNTS OF HARLEM WAS NEW YORK
CITY'S TWO BLACK NEWSPAPERS, THE

01:18:35.852 --> 01:18:40.090
AGE IN THE AMSTERDAM NEWS, AND
MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

01:18:40.121 --> 01:18:43.393
I WAS IN THAT PROJECT BECAUSE I
USED THOSE LEGAL RECORDS  IN MY

01:18:43.862 --> 01:18:46.958
DISSERTATION AND I KNEW FROM THE
SISERTATION THAT THEY WERE FULL

01:18:47.207 --> 01:18:50.243
OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE
THINGS HAPPENED, THAT I FOUND NO

01:18:50.565 --> 01:18:53.781
WAY TO USE AND ANALYZE REQUESTED
I DID THE DISSERTATION.

01:18:54.116 --> 01:18:56.774
SO WHAT I SUGGEST SIDE MY
CONTRIBUTION TO THIS LARGER

01:18:56.775 --> 01:18:58.818
PROJECT WITH AN EFFORT TO MAP
OUTSOURCES.

01:18:59.385 --> 01:19:02.691
NOW, WHEN WE GOT FUNDING FOR THE
SOURCES  IN 2004, THE TECHNOLOGY

01:19:03.478 --> 01:19:07.566
FOR DOING THAT WAS ART GIA.
FIND COLLABORATED AT THE

01:19:07.567 --> 01:19:11.033
UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY.
OUR EXPERTS  TO MAKE THAT

01:19:11.034 --> 01:19:13.470
HAPPEN.
AT THAT TIME, IT WAS THE

01:19:13.471 --> 01:19:15.471
ARCHAEOLOGICAL COMPUTING
LABORATORY.

01:19:15.698 --> 01:19:21.334
HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM WITH ARC
GIA IN 2004 WAS IT WAS NOT

01:19:21.335 --> 01:19:25.720
POSSIBLE TO USE IT ON THE WEB.
IT WOULDN'T RUN ON OUR BE LOVED

01:19:25.936 --> 01:19:30.422
MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND IT
SIMPLY WAS, AS IT STILL IS, FAR

01:19:30.743 --> 01:19:35.022
TOO HARD TO MASTER AND FAR TOO
COMPLEX TO MAKE IT WORTH USING,

01:19:36.306 --> 01:19:40.420
TO ANALYZE THE QUALITATIVE DATA
THAT WE HAD.

01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:44.630
THANKFULLY, WITH THE LAUNCH OF
GOOGLE MAPS IN 2005 AND THANKS 

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:51.069
TO DAMIAN EVAN, ONE OF OUR TEAM,
TACREATE A HACK BETWEEN OUR

01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:55.436
DATABASE AND GOOGLE MAPS.
WE LAUNCHED DIGITAL HARLEM IN

01:19:55.437 --> 01:19:57.442
2009 AS A WEB-BASED FORM OF
MAPPING.

01:19:58.195 --> 01:20:00.802
AS WITH ANY LARGE DIGITAL
PROJECT, THERE'S A WHOLE TEAM

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:03.717
BEHIND IT.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF

01:20:03.718 --> 01:20:07.015
THOSE PEOPLE, IN ADDITION TO THE
ONCE I'VE ALREADY NAMED, A TEAM

01:20:07.132 --> 01:20:13.199
OF HISTORIANS, GRADUATE RESEARCH
ASSISTANTS, TECH GISTS OF

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.732
VARIOUS KINDS AND ALMOST A
MILLION DOLLARS OF AUSTRALIAN

01:20:18.527 --> 01:20:19.680
GOVERNMENT MONEY UWHICH ALWAYS
AMUSING PEOPLE.

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:27.523
BUT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT
WAS INTERESTED IN FUNDING

01:20:27.524 --> 01:20:30.929
SCHOLARSHIPS.
DIGITAL HARLEM WAS ONE OF THE

01:20:31.148 --> 01:20:34.302
FIRST HISTORICAL MAPPING
PROJECTS AND ONE OF FIRST

01:20:34.303 --> 01:20:36.760
DIGITAL PROBLEMSES  TO SHIFT
FROM WHAT THE SHADOW WAS

01:20:36.761 --> 01:20:40.749
INTERESTED IN DOING.
DIGITIZE MATERIAL, CREATING ON

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.780
LINE COLLECTIONS TOWARDS
VISUALIZING THOSE SOURCES.

01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:48.468
YOU KNOW, TECHNOLOGIES NOW,
EXIST.

01:20:49.032 --> 01:20:51.365
DIGITAL HARLEM REMAINS A USEFUL
STARTING POINT.

01:20:51.569 --> 01:20:57.265
SO THINKING ABOUT MAPPING AS A
MEANS OF MAKING SOURCES MORE

01:20:57.266 --> 01:20:58.826
ACCESSIBLE, MORE VISUAL AND MORE
USEFUL.

01:20:58.827 --> 01:21:05.756
THE CONTRACT HERE IS WITH
SOURCES FLEW A

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:12.266
 -- SOURCES
THROUGH A DATABASE.

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:15.572
SEARCH IS UNGENEOUS.
THE BANDING OF QUERY AND

01:21:15.573 --> 01:21:18.444
RETURNING ONLY THE TUNES IN
TURN.

01:21:19.465 --> 01:21:21.549
WITHHOLDING MATERIALS ABOUT THE
STRUCTURE, AND MATERIALS

01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:26.873
AVAILABLE, AND FILTERING OUT
HYPOTHESES.

01:21:26.923 --> 01:21:30.788
VISUALIZATIONS BY CONTRAST ARE
GENEROUS, RICH, BROWSABLE AND

01:21:31.326 --> 01:21:34.928
DECISIVE, THAT REVEAL THE SCALE
AND BEAT CITY BEHIND THEM AND

01:21:35.148 --> 01:21:39.581
PROVIDE A CONTEXT THAT ENRICHES
THE EXPIRATION, AND ANALYSIS OF

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:44.589
THEIR DATA SO DIGITAL HARLEM IS
NOT A COLLECTION OF SOURCES.

01:21:44.922 --> 01:21:48.067
THANKS  TO COPYRIGHT, LICENSING
AND RESTRICTIONS IMPOSE BY THE

01:21:48.914 --> 01:21:52.210
ARCHIVES, IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR
US, EVEN IF WE HAD WANTED TO,

01:21:52.643 --> 01:21:59.506
WHICH WE DIDN'T.
BUT THOSE RESTRICTIONS DO NOT

01:21:59.995 --> 01:22:02.911
CREATE THE PREVENTION OF DATA
FROM THOSE SOURCES, WHICHS WHAT

01:22:03.395 --> 01:22:08.238
DIGITAL HARLEM CONTAINS.
INFORMATION ABOUT EVENTS AND ILL

01:22:08.916 --> 01:22:12.546
FATED [INDISCERNIBLE] ABOUT
PEOPLE AND TO AN  EXTENT ABOUT

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:15.128
PEOPLE, A LOT ABOUT

01:22:18.098 --> 01:22:20.646
 PLACES.
THOSE OF US WHO WORK ON THE 20TH

01:22:20.654 --> 01:22:24.951
CENTURY AND BEYOND AND CANADA'S
SYSTEM WITH [INDISCERNIBLE]

01:22:24.952 --> 01:22:27.046
SOURCES FOR MORE OFTEN THAN OUR
COLLEAGUE THAT IS WORK IN

01:22:27.047 --> 01:22:30.225
EARLIER PERIODS WANT WE NEED TO
BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THE WAY IN

01:22:30.336 --> 01:22:32.839
WHICH RESTRICTIONS ON THE
SOURCES SHAPE THE KIND OF

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:36.435
DIGITAL PROJECTS WE CAN DO ON
THE 20TH CENTURY AND HOW

01:22:36.436 --> 01:22:42.914
CREATING DATA IS A WAY OF
GETTING EXCESS MATERIAL, THAT IS

01:22:43.147 --> 01:22:44.891
OTHERWISE UNDER COPYRIGHT.
TO CREATE AT THAT TIME A

01:22:44.892 --> 01:22:49.614
HOWEVER, REQUIRED THE DIFFERENT
ENGAGEMENT IN SOURCE THAT IS

01:22:49.615 --> 01:22:53.016
HUMANITY SOURCES TYPICALLY HAD.
WE USUALLY IMMERSE OURSELVES

01:22:53.017 --> 01:22:56.297
UNLESS OUR SOURCES.
DIVE N. UNDERSTAND THEM FROM

01:22:56.298 --> 01:23:02.243
WITHIN TO CREATE DATA IS TO
EXTRACT INFORMATION.

01:23:02.374 --> 01:23:07.976
AND FEATURES FROM SOURCES
REQUIRE A DECOMPOSITION IN

01:23:07.977 --> 01:23:14.220
ATTRIBUTES  AND VARIABLES.
THE DATA WE GET IS DIGITAL

01:23:14.221 --> 01:23:17.970
HARLEM WAS DONE BY HAND AND
BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:23:17.971 --> 01:23:21.571
DIGITIZE NEWSPAPERS AND OTHER
LIMITS OF ACI, IS STILL A

01:23:21.572 --> 01:23:23.746
PROCESS THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY
HAND.

01:23:23.994 --> 01:23:28.648
SO MYSELF, AND THE TEACH MUCH
RESEARCH ASSISTANTS, RECORDED

01:23:29.549 --> 01:23:34.778
DETAILS AT EVERY LOCATION, AT
EVERY EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:40.962
LOCATION, AND THOSE LEGAL
RECORDS THAT I WAS TALKING

01:23:40.963 --> 01:23:45.981
ABOUT.
AND THE HARLEM'S TWO BLACK

01:23:45.982 --> 01:23:47.018
NEWSPAPERS.
NOT JUST INFORMATION FROM THE

01:23:47.019 --> 01:23:51.745
NEW STORIES BUT INFORMATION ON
EVERY SECTION OF THE

01:23:56.764 --> 01:23:59.583
 NEWSPAPERS
THERE'S FAR NEAR INFORMATION,

01:23:59.814 --> 01:24:03.740
THAN WE'RE USED  TO THINK BEING
WHEN WE ROLL THE MICRO FILM

01:24:03.741 --> 01:24:05.959
THROUGH AND LOOK FOR THE NEWS
STORIES.

01:24:06.523 --> 01:24:09.895
WE ORGANIZE THAT WOULD
INFORMATION INTO A DATA MODEL.

01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:12.846
INTO A DATABASE AND GEO CODED
IT, SO IT CAN BEMAND.

01:24:13.787 --> 01:24:18.211
NOW, THE METAPHOR THAT WE
COMMONLY USE TO DESCRIBE MINING,

01:24:19.142 --> 01:24:23.984
SITS AWKWARDLY WITH HUMANITY
SCHOLARS, CONCERNED WITH

01:24:23.985 --> 01:24:26.005
DEVELOPMENT OF EMPATHY.
WITHIN AN APPRECIATION OF

01:24:26.006 --> 01:24:29.793
POSITION OF A PERSONAL GROUP OR
QUALITIES OF AN OBJECT.

01:24:29.925 --> 01:24:34.669
SINCE EVER SINCE, CREATING DATA
IS SOMEHOW DEHUMANIZING.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:39.381
MAPPING DATA CAN MITIGATE THAT
CONSEQUENCE AND ALIGN WITH AN

01:24:41.523 --> 01:24:45.350
ORIENTATION OF ONE ELEMENT,
ARTICULATED IS AN APPRECIATION

01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:49.038
OF CONTEXT, INTERDEPENDENT, AND
VULNERABILITY.

01:24:49.567 --> 01:24:54.338
MAPS, AS A VISUALIZATION, EX
PRESS THIS RELATIONSHIP OF PATH

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:57.780
ONE TO ANOTHER.  AND MANY TO A
GREATER HALT.

01:24:59.312 --> 01:25:03.783
MAPPING DATA IS SEEN IN ITS
GEOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT.

01:25:04.091 --> 01:25:08.648
RICH AND DIGITAL HARLEM BITE USE
OF A HISTORICAL MAP PLAYER.

01:25:10.032 --> 01:25:13.634
A REAL ESTATE ATLAS.
SHE HAS A LOT INFORMATION AND

01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:19.021
QUALITY.
-- IT PROVIDES BUILDING

01:25:19.022 --> 01:25:21.867
FOOTPRINTS.
INFORMATION ON THE HIDEEL

01:25:21.868 --> 01:25:26.332
BERGBERG BELLS -- HIDEEL BERG
BUILDINGS, WHAT IT DOES MOST

01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:30.698
DRAMATICALLY IN TERMS OF THE
MAPS WE ARE USED TO LOOK AT IS

01:25:31.073 --> 01:25:34.390
FILL IN THE SPACES  ON A STREET
MAP.

01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:40.388
IN THAT WAY, IT HELPS  TO
DIVIDE, SUBDIVIDE, HARLEM INTO

01:25:41.081 --> 01:25:44.109
MULTIPLE, SMALLER PLACES  AND
GIVES SOME INDICATION OF HOW

01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:46.496
THOSE PLACES INTERACT.
IF YOU KNOW GOING ABOUT THE

01:25:46.497 --> 01:25:50.869
HISTORY OF HARLEM IN THE 1920'S,
I SHOWED THIS

01:25:54.857 --> 01:25:58.747
 BLOCK.
NEXT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE

01:25:58.956 --> 01:26:05.265
BAPTIST CHURCH, ONE OF THE MAIN
LINE MIDDLE CLASS, RACIAL

01:26:05.266 --> 01:26:07.266
CENTERS OF HARLEM.
AND THE RIGHT IS THE QUARTERS OF

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:12.113
BLACK NATIONALIST UNIA.
AN INTERESTING GATHERING OF

01:26:12.114 --> 01:26:16.172
PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THOSE BLOCKS
 IN A WAY WE DON'T APPRECIATE,

01:26:16.288 --> 01:26:19.499
WITHOUT THIS KIND OF LEVEL OF
DATA ONE OF THE VERY EXCITING

01:26:19.865 --> 01:26:25.465
THINGS GOING ON HERE AT THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS IS THE

01:26:25.466 --> 01:26:29.071
SANDBORN INDICIS MAPS, THAT WILL
PUT THESE RICH SOURCES INTO

01:26:29.072 --> 01:26:31.072
PEOPLE'S HANDS.
TRANSFORM THE KIND OF HISTORICAL

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:36.198
MAPPING PROJECTS WE CAN DO, BUT
ADDING THIS INCREDIBLY RICH

01:26:36.199 --> 01:26:39.973
LAYER OF DATA ABOUT WHAT THE
PLACE IS LIKE.

01:26:40.035 --> 01:26:43.742
LAYER THE DIFFERENT DATA, CAN BE
COMBINED ON A SINGLE MAP.

01:26:44.968 --> 01:26:47.042
PROVIDING AN IMAGE OF THE
COMPLEXITY OF THE PAST.  AND I'M

01:26:47.192 --> 01:26:49.978
GOING TO COME BACK TO THIS
COMPLEX LOOKING MAP.

01:26:50.778 --> 01:26:53.974
YOU CAN EXAM MAPS.
MAKE COMPARISONS.

01:26:54.010 --> 01:26:58.254
DISCOVER RELATIONSHIPS.
BY VISUALLY DETECTING SPECIAL

01:26:59.048 --> 01:27:02.453
PATTENS THAT, REMAIN HIDDEN IN
THE TABLE THAT IS WE START W.

01:27:02.468 --> 01:27:07.681
MAP AND DATA HAS BECOME AN
INCREASINGLY COMMON FORM.

01:27:07.744 --> 01:27:14.624
BUT TOPHIC, THOSE PROJECT MAP
ONLY A SINGLE COLLECTION OF

01:27:14.625 --> 01:27:17.999
MATERIAL.
THAT APPROACH TAPS REALLY ONLY A

01:27:18.208 --> 01:27:21.553
SMALL PART OF THE MAPPING.
GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, PROVIDES A

01:27:21.885 --> 01:27:25.665
MEANS  TO INGRATE MATERIAL FROM
A WIDE RANGE OF DESPERATE

01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:28.103
SOURCE.
SO WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT

01:27:28.104 --> 01:27:33.868
ASSIGNATION GEOGRAPHIC REFERENCE
TO DATA IS THAT IT THEN BECOMES

01:27:34.733 --> 01:27:36.610
POSSIBLE TO APPEAR
TACHARACTERISTIC WITH OTHERS

01:27:36.611 --> 01:27:39.050
THAT EXIST OR HAVE EXISTED  IN
THE SAME

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.534
 GEOGRAPHIC SPACE.
THE POWER OF MAPS TO BRING

01:27:46.535 --> 01:27:49.743
DESPERATE THINGS TOGETHER L
TOGETHER, AS WE REALLY NEED TO

01:27:49.974 --> 01:27:51.957
BE GOING WITH THEM AS A
TECHNOLOGY.

01:27:51.958 --> 01:27:57.079
USED IN THIS WAY, THE GEOSPATIAL
CAN HELP CAPTURE THE CONFLUENCE

01:27:57.396 --> 01:28:02.965
OF MULTIPLE RHYTHMS.
SO THIS IS ONE OF MY GO-TO

01:28:02.966 --> 01:28:05.794
EXAMPLES, TALKING ABOUT HARLEM
IN THE 1920'S.

01:28:06.762 --> 01:28:10.235
IT'S A MAP OF NIGHT LIFE DURING
PROHIBITION.

01:28:10.919 --> 01:28:11.981
UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATIONS, LEGAL
RECORDS.

01:28:11.982 --> 01:28:17.697
IT SHOWS THE VENUES WHICH DREW
CROWDS TO HARLEMS, THE NIGHT

01:28:17.698 --> 01:28:22.027
CLUBS, THE SPEAK EASIES, AND THE
VENUES THAT BLACK RESIDENTS,

01:28:22.028 --> 01:28:26.454
OPENED IN THEIR APARTMENTS.
CATERING EXCLUSIVE TO BLACKS. 

01:28:26.485 --> 01:28:29.911
THE MAPS HIGHLIGHTS THE
DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHYIES, AND THE

01:28:30.712 --> 01:28:34.395
CONTINUING DUSTERRING SECTIONS,
AWAY FROM THE OTHER VENUES.

01:28:35.135 --> 01:28:38.347
WAY AND DREW OUR ATTENTION TO
HOW BLACKS DEVELOPED SPACES

01:28:38.348 --> 01:28:42.485
APART FROM WHITES, AS THEY
FLOCKED TO HARLEM'S NIGHT LIFE

01:28:42.486 --> 01:28:46.061
IN THE 1920'S.
WHILE THIS MAP CAPTURED HOW SOME

01:28:48.411 --> 01:28:51.835
OF HOW PROHIBITION -- IT'S ONLY
A PARTIAL MAP OF THE

01:28:51.836 --> 01:28:54.265
COMMERCIALIZED LEISURE AVAILABLE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:59.248
DIGITAL HARLEM LETS YOU CREATE
THE CONTEXT BY ADDING DARK

01:28:59.249 --> 01:29:05.827
HOLES, THEATERS, HALL ROOMS.
THE HALLS THAT HOSTED BASK

01:29:05.828 --> 01:29:09.943
GAMES, AND BOXING BOUTS AND YOU
CAN ADD TO THOSE COMMERCIAL

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:13.418
VENUES, AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF
THE PLACES WHERE NONCOMMERCIAL

01:29:13.565 --> 01:29:15.836
LEISURE TOOK PLACE IN HARLEM.
MEETING THE CHURCH

01:29:19.208 --> 01:29:21.670
 GROUPS,
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND

01:29:21.671 --> 01:29:26.132
SOCIAL CLUBS.
WE END UP WITH IN INCREDIBLE

01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:30.080
COMPLEX MAP OF SOCIAL CLUBS AND
INCREDIBLY CONFLICT MAP, WHICH

01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:35.898
HIGHLIGHTS, JUST HOW A SMALL
SEGMENT OF SEGMENT, IN HARLEM,

01:29:35.967 --> 01:29:39.442
APPEARS  IN DISCUSSIONS, ON
PROHIBITION, WHICH DEFINES THE

01:29:39.647 --> 01:29:42.631
WAY WE UNDERSTAND WHAT HARLEM
WAS LIKE IN THE

01:29:46.023 --> 01:29:46.847
 1920'S.
THE EVENT, RATHER THAN PLACES,

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:51.864
THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST MAPS WE
CREATED, A RISK FOR NUMBERS IN

01:29:54.289 --> 01:29:58.983
1925, WHICH -- IT SHOWS IN THE
FIRST INSTANCE, THE SHEER

01:29:58.984 --> 01:30:01.848
PERVASIVENESS OF NUMBERS
GAMBLING, WHICH IS A PICTURE OF

01:30:02.065 --> 01:30:06.272
MULTITUDE OF SOURCES REINFORCED
AND IT'S ONE REASON WHY SHANE

01:30:09.286 --> 01:30:11.714
WHITE, SHANE GRANT, WROTE A BOOK
ABOUT THE WIDE RANGING ECONOMIC

01:30:12.181 --> 01:30:15.981
AND CULTURAL ROLE OF NUMBERS
GAMBLING IS HARLEM IS ONE OF THE

01:30:16.765 --> 01:30:18.472
OUTCOMES OF THEIR
COLLABORATION.

01:30:18.473 --> 01:30:22.196
ZOOMING IN, HARLEM HELPED
PLACING BITS WAS WOVEN INTO

01:30:22.197 --> 01:30:25.003
EVERY DAY LIFE.
A RISK OCCURRED ON STREET

01:30:25.004 --> 01:30:28.768
CORNERS, AS RESIDENTS WERE ON
THEIR WAY TO WORK, AND THE BEES

01:30:29.125 --> 01:30:33.897
LINING, THE AVENUES AS THEY
WITHIN SHOPPING  AND RANER ANDS,

01:30:34.243 --> 01:30:35.870
AND HARLEM ON THE CROSS
STREETS.

01:30:35.871 --> 01:30:39.320
NUMBERS WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR,
COLLECTING

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.836
 BITS.
ENOUGH DATA TO REVEAL MORE THAN

01:30:45.837 --> 01:30:48.921
A SINGLE MOMENT OF AN
INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE, PROVED BEYOND

01:30:49.015 --> 01:30:51.847
OUR RESOURCES.
HOWEVER, WE DID GENERATE MAPS

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:56.519
FOR A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.
BASED ON INFORMATION ON THE

01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:01.372
RESIDENTS, WORK AND LEISURE AND
PAROLE RECORDS WANT THOSE MAPS

01:31:02.427 --> 01:31:05.507
MAKE VISIBLE, THE EXTENT TO
WHICH THE LIVES OF HARLEM

01:31:05.508 --> 01:31:07.604
RESIDENTS WERE NOT BOUNDED BY
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:12.480
MAKE CLEAR THAT THE CENSUS DATA
THAT WE COMMONLY RELY ON TO

01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:16.413
DETERMINE WHERE PEOPLE LIVED,
ULTIMATELY ONLY TELLS US WHERE

01:31:18.531 --> 01:31:20.531
THEY SLEPT.
DURING THE 5 YEAR THAT IS MORGAN

01:31:20.582 --> 01:31:24.726
THOMPSON WAS ON PROBATION, HIS
WORK TOOK HIM NOT ONLY UP SIDE

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:29.695
MANHATTAN, BUT TO THE BRONX,
QUEENS, AND BROOKLYN.

01:31:29.715 --> 01:31:36.392
WE HAVE USED LINES WHERE OTHER
PEOPLE FREQUENTED.

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:40.923
THE GEOGRAPHYY WORK WAS
DIFFERENT FOR WOMEN.

01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:45.661
LIKE THE MAJORITY OF HARLEM
PHONAL IN THE WORK FORCE,

01:31:45.662 --> 01:31:50.648
FOUND MMENT AS DOMESTIC SERVER,
AND IN HOTELS AND LAUNDRY IN

01:31:50.649 --> 01:31:53.592
LOWER MANHATTAN.
THE NEWEST VERSION ADD ACE TIME

01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:59.290
LINE TO THIS, TO UNDERSTAND HOW
THESE TIME LINES EVOLVED.

01:32:00.094 --> 01:32:03.341
TWO STRIKINGLY DISTANT
GEOGRAPHYIES, LIVING A CITY IS

01:32:03.457 --> 01:32:07.661
NOT LIVING IN A NEIGHBORHOOD.
IT'S MOVING ACROSS THE CITY THAT

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.673
WE DON'T OFTEN PLACE
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN PLACES LIKE

01:32:10.674 --> 01:32:12.674
NEW YORK.
FOR ALL THE MAPS WE FEATURE ON

01:32:13.026 --> 01:32:17.095
THE SITE AND WE DISCUSS IN OUR
SCHOLARSHIP, MUCH OF THE

01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:21.013
USEFULNESS AND IMPACT OF DIGITAL
HARLEM, COMES  FROM HOW IT

01:32:21.014 --> 01:32:26.429
ALLOWS USERS  TO MAKE THEIR OWN
MAPS.

01:32:26.466 --> 01:32:29.696
RATHER THAN BEING CONTRAINED TO
WHAT THE ESTATES CREATED.

01:32:29.752 --> 01:32:34.050
THAT CAPACITY HIGHLIGHTS THAT
THESE MAPS ARE EXPLORATORY, NOT

01:32:34.054 --> 01:32:36.504
ELISE EISENBERG. -- LUST TIVE.
THEY RAISE QUESTIONS, RATHER

01:32:36.505 --> 01:32:40.161
THAN ANSWERING THEM.
BUT THE SITE ITSELF, OFFERS

01:32:40.162 --> 01:32:44.704
LIMITED HELP IN MAKING SENSE OF
A MAP AND THE DATA VISUALIZES.

01:32:44.807 --> 01:32:47.686
THAT DESIGN IS IN KEEPING WITH
THE ORIGINAL CONCEPTION OF THE

01:32:47.936 --> 01:32:52.107
SITE, WHICH IS A RESEARCH TOOL
FOR THOSE OF US COLLABORATING ON

01:32:52.679 --> 01:32:54.679
THEIR ORIGINAL PROJECT Q. WE
DECIDED TO SHARE THE SITE, WE

01:32:55.134 --> 01:32:58.852
ADDED SOME MATERIAL ABOUT THE
PLACES AND VANES FEATURE ON THE

01:32:59.289 --> 01:33:01.949
SITE, AND ON THE INDIVIDUALS
WHOSE LIVES CAN BE MET.

01:33:02.302 --> 01:33:08.403
AND WE CREATE AID BLOG LINK THE
TO THE ESTATE, WITH POSTS ABOUT

01:33:08.635 --> 01:33:13.687
ADDITIONAL PLACES  AND EVENTS,
SUCH AS TRAFFIC MS, THAT

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:16.358
INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL
LIKE PHOTOGRAPHS.

01:33:16.679 --> 01:33:18.679
UNFORTUNATELY, IF IT CAN ONLY GO
SO FAR.

01:33:19.068 --> 01:33:23.573
CREATING A REAL CONTEXT TO
UNDERSTANDING THE DATA AND

01:33:23.574 --> 01:33:27.762
DIGITAL HARLEM IS A PROJECT IN
ITS OWN RIGHT, THAT WILL REQUIRE

01:33:28.463 --> 01:33:30.765
A WHOLE REDESIGN OF THE SITE.
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED

01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:33.803
TO THINK ABOUT.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCING

01:33:34.388 --> 01:33:36.792
SITES THAT ARE RESEARCH TOOL F
FOR PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:40.758
DATA AT SOME LEVEL AND SITES
THAT ARE SHARED AND BROUGHT BY

01:33:41.881 --> 01:33:45.657
PEOPLE WHO DON'T BRING RESEARCH
OF UNDERSTANDING TO THE SITE.A 

01:33:45.658 --> 01:33:49.242
MAJOR OPTION FOR MAKING DATA
MORE ACCESSIBLE AND USEFUL IS TO

01:33:49.553 --> 01:33:53.854
USE WHAT'S IN DIGITAL HARLEM,
THE BASIS OF A SPATIAL

01:33:53.855 --> 01:33:55.601
NARRATIVE, RATHER THAN SIMPLY A
MAP.

01:33:55.602 --> 01:33:59.895
I'M CURRENTLY EXPLORING THAT
APPROACH FOR A PROJECT OF THE

01:34:01.403 --> 01:34:05.371
1935 HARLEM RIOT, WHICH WE'RE
RATING ANOTHER DIGITAL VERSION

01:34:05.587 --> 01:34:09.506
OF HARLEM.
THERE'S A MUCH GREATER WEALTH OF

01:34:09.725 --> 01:34:15.203
INFORMATION ABOUT LIFE IN HARLEM
THAN THERE WAS IN THE 1920S --

01:34:16.305 --> 01:34:20.082
CREATES A LINEAR SINGLE PATH
THROUGH A MAP CANNOT EFFECTIVELY

01:34:20.435 --> 01:34:24.739
TELL THE STORY OF A COMPLEX AREA
LIKE THE RIOTS IN WHICH MULTIPLE

01:34:25.739 --> 01:34:27.850
THINGS HAPPENED AT A GIVEN
TIME.

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:31.034
NEITHER CAN FOLLOW THE TIME LINE
IN DIGITAL HARLEM, YET, YOU

01:34:31.035 --> 01:34:33.255
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN
THE RIOT.

01:34:33.301 --> 01:34:37.531
NEAT LINE, A METHOD PLUG IN, IT
WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, GIVES

01:34:38.086 --> 01:34:46.032
SOME SCOPE FOR MORE COMPLEX
STORY TELLING AND I'VE CREATED A

01:34:46.494 --> 01:34:48.847
PROTOTYPE EXPERIENCE OF THE RIOT
JUST TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS

01:34:48.848 --> 01:34:51.043
POSSIBLE.
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT

01:34:51.044 --> 01:34:54.044
NEATLINE IS THE TIME LINE SLIDER
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE IMAGE,

01:34:54.045 --> 01:34:57.170
PROVIDES A MEANS OF NAVIGATING
THE EXHIBIT.

01:34:57.401 --> 01:35:00.771
DRAGGING IT NOT ONLY CHANGES THE
POINTS APPEARED ON THE MAP.

01:35:01.102 --> 01:35:06.508
IT ALTERS THE POINTS VISUAL ON
THE RIGHT.

01:35:08.086 --> 01:35:13.085
POINTS DISPLAY INFORMATION.
WAY POINTS, CAN BE USED TO

01:35:13.086 --> 01:35:16.227
EXPLORE BROADER ARGUMENTS THAT
CAN BE GROUPED TOGETHER.

01:35:16.258 --> 01:35:19.948
RATHER THAN BEING TIDE TO A
SINGLE POINT ON THE TIME LINE.IT

01:35:21.186 --> 01:35:23.969
 GIVES YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY OF
HOW A NARRATIVE IS REARED.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.053
CAN YOU ROLL OVER EACH WAY, OR
EXPLORE THEM IN A SEQUENCE OR AT

01:35:28.491 --> 01:35:30.773
A SEQUENCE.
EACH WAVE POINT CAN BE

01:35:30.774 --> 01:35:34.069
ASSOCIATED WITH A ZOOM LEVEL ON
A SPECIFIC LOCATION, CLICKOG A

01:35:34.339 --> 01:35:40.482
SERIES OF WAY POINTS CAN THUS,
MOVE YOU AROUND AND YOU CAN

01:35:40.483 --> 01:35:45.151
ANNOTATE WANT ATTACH THEM TO
POLYGONS, AND LINES, TO DRAW

01:35:45.152 --> 01:35:48.084
ATTENTION TO THE ANALYSIS OF
SPACE IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF

01:35:48.085 --> 01:35:54.662
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RIOT.
TO MOVEMENT, DIRECTION,

01:35:54.663 --> 01:35:56.034
PROXIMITY.
CONNECTION AND PATTENS.

01:35:56.035 --> 01:36:02.248
USED IN THAT WAY, AN NOTATIONS,
SHIFT SOME OF THE ARGUMENT INTO

01:36:02.279 --> 01:36:04.279
VISUAL

01:36:07.314 --> 01:36:12.196
 FORM.
BUT THE FUTURE DIRECTION IN

01:36:12.197 --> 01:36:16.662
VISUALIZING DATA ABOUT A USING
MAPS OF THIS PROTOTYPE POINTS

01:36:16.663 --> 01:36:21.374
TORQUE IS THE CAPACITY TO MORE
EXTENSIVELY AND DYNAMICALLY

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:25.427
INGRATE MAPS  AND NARRATIVES, TO
VISUALLY COMBINE FAT DATA THATTA

01:36:25.827 --> 01:36:27.617
AND INTERPRETATION WHILE
RETAINING THE ORIENTATION

01:36:27.618 --> 01:36:31.966
TOWARDS PUTTING DATA IN CONTEXT,
WHICH TO ME, IS THE MOST

01:36:31.967 --> 01:36:35.464
POWERFUL THING THAT MAPPING
MAKES US DO.

01:36:35.479 --> 01:36:37.479
THANK

01:36:40.499 --> 01:36:42.499
 YOU.

01:36:45.871 --> 01:36:49.169
M THANK YOU, STEVEN.

02:22:22.531 --> 02:22:25.352
.
&gt;&gt; IT IS A GREAT DATA PROJECT

02:22:25.601 --> 02:22:29.350
AND WE DO, IF SOME WAYS,
CONTRIBUTE TO T. IF YOU IMAGINE

02:22:29.697 --> 02:22:34.189
THOSE, AS A REALLY NICE
RESTAURANT KITCHEN, WITH THE

02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:37.545
FANCY, DISHWASHER ^, AND THE
FANCY SINK, WITH THE HOSE THAT

02:22:38.013 --> 02:22:41.744
YOU CAN WIGGLE AROUND, AND THE
MAYBE ONE OF THOSE REFRIGERATOR

02:22:41.745 --> 02:22:48.684
THAT IS HAS COLD WATER PUMP
THEY'RE LIKE, THAT'S GREAT.

02:22:49.053 --> 02:22:51.523
REALLY, LIKE THE THING THAT
CONNECTS THE WHOLE RESTAURANT TO

02:22:52.026 --> 02:22:58.409
THE CITY'S WATER MAIN IS REALLY
FAR BACK THERE.

02:22:58.641 --> 02:23:02.427
THAT'S HOW I THINK OF SOME OF
THE WORK WE DO ON THE GRABBIVE

02:23:02.443 --> 02:23:03.980
TEAM.
I THINK THE BEST WAY TO TALK

02:23:03.981 --> 02:23:06.918
ABOUT THAT IS TO SHOW IT,
THROUGHOUT WAY THESE STORIES

02:23:06.919 --> 02:23:08.996
COME TOGETHER.
SO HERE'S THE STORY.

02:23:09.213 --> 02:23:13.273
ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS A
TROUBLESOME WEB INTERFACE WANT

02:23:13.627 --> 02:23:16.932
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A WEB
INTERFACE THAT CAUSED ONE OF OUR

02:23:17.299 --> 02:23:20.026
REPORTERS SOME TROUBLE.
THIS IS THE BUREAU OF PRISON.

02:23:20.027 --> 02:23:24.510
THEY MAKE A WEBSITE THAT MAKE
ITS EASY TO FIND AN INMATE WHO

02:23:24.596 --> 02:23:28.376
IS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM.
UNFORTUNATELY F DO YOU WANT FIND

02:23:29.146 --> 02:23:33.043
AN INMATE.
WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST TYPE IN AN

02:23:33.058 --> 02:23:34.861
AGE AND ANY INMATE THAT HAVE
AGE.

02:23:34.862 --> 02:23:39.187
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE PERSON'S
AGE AND INFORMATION ABOUT THAT

02:23:39.418 --> 02:23:44.179
SO IN ORDER TO DO THIS YOU HAVE
TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION AND

02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:46.180
HERE'S AN

02:23:49.207 --> 02:23:51.207
 EXAMPLE.

02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:58.766
IF YOU WANT TO FIND A LOT OF
PEOPLE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:23:58.767 --> 02:24:02.008
ENTER THEM ONE AT A TIME.
A REPORTER CAME TO ME WITH A

02:24:02.009 --> 02:24:04.478
LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT
SHE WANTED TO LOOK UP.

02:24:04.709 --> 02:24:08.309
SHE WANTED TO LOOK THEM UP
BECAUSE THEY WERE CONVICTED OF

02:24:08.894 --> 02:24:10.894
TERRORISM IN U.S. COURTS.
SHE WANTED TON WHERE THEY WERE

02:24:11.326 --> 02:24:13.662
LOCATED.
THIS WAS A BIG DEAL, NOT TOO

02:24:13.663 --> 02:24:17.751
LONG AGO BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT
OF QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER PEOPLE

02:24:17.970 --> 02:24:21.858
IN GUANTANAMO CAN BE TRIED OR
HELD IN THE UNITED

02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:30.508
 STATES THERE
WERE A LOT OF THEM AND IT WAS

02:24:30.862 --> 02:24:34.398
GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME.  MANY
OF THEM HAD THREE, FOUR NAMES

02:24:34.851 --> 02:24:38.558
AND IT WASN'T QUITE CLEAR HOW
THEY DIVIDED INTO FIRST, MIDDLE

02:24:39.227 --> 02:24:42.806
AND LAST NAMES.
SO THANKFULLY, SHE HAS A GOOD

02:24:45.527 --> 02:24:47.246
SENSE TO APPLY A LITTLE SOFTWARE
BY TURNING AROUND.

02:24:47.247 --> 02:24:49.247
I HAPPEN TO SIT RIGHT BEHIND
THIS PERSON.

02:24:49.329 --> 02:24:53.338
SO IT WAS A VERY EASY REQUEST.
SHE SAID RACHEL, I FEED SOME

02:24:53.339 --> 02:24:55.170
HELP.
HOW ARE WE GOING DO GET THIS

02:24:55.171 --> 02:24:57.926
DATA OUT OF THE WEBSITE.
I KNOW THE DATA IS THERE, I JUST

02:24:58.158 --> 02:25:01.502
NEED TO GET IT.
THE BACK END OF THAT WEBSITE

02:25:01.503 --> 02:25:06.017
LOOKS LIKE THIS.
ANYBODY WHO HAS A LITTLE

02:25:06.018 --> 02:25:08.873
FAMILIARITY, WILL PROBABLY HAVE
A WARM FEELING IN THEIR HEART

02:25:08.874 --> 02:25:11.942
ABOUT HOW NICE AND EASY IT IS
FOR A SOFTWARE DEVELOP TORE PULL

02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:16.258
DOWN DATA LIKE THIS PROCESS IT,
AND TURN IT INTO USABLE RECORDS

02:25:16.259 --> 02:25:20.738
THAT THE REPORTER CAN USE.
I STARTED WORKING ON THIS.

02:25:20.769 --> 02:25:24.659
SHE ASKED GOVERNMENT OFFICES,
AND EVERYONE WORKS  ON WHAT THEY

02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:29.360
DID WE TURNED THIS INTO A STORY
THAT INCLUDED IN MAP.

02:25:29.582 --> 02:25:31.907
WE FOUND OUT WHERE THE PEOPLE
WHO WERE CONVICTED  IN TERRORISM

02:25:31.922 --> 02:25:34.689
IN UNITED STATES COURTS ARE
BEING HELD, INDEED, IN THE

02:25:34.690 --> 02:25:38.598
UNITED STATES.
AND WROTE AN ACCOMPANYING STORY

02:25:38.717 --> 02:25:41.568
ABOUT T. SO YOU NEED INFORMATION
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GATHER AS A

02:25:42.422 --> 02:25:45.477
COLLABORATION BETWEEN A REPORTER
AND A SOFTWARE ENGINEER WHO

02:25:45.478 --> 02:25:48.564
WORKS  ON DATA THINGS, WE WERE
ABLE TO TELL A STORY THAT WAS

02:25:49.652 --> 02:25:52.602
GENERALLY BEING TOLD AT THE

02:25:57.637 --> 02:26:00.378
TIME.
A DOCTOR TESTIFIED  IN COURT,

02:26:00.825 --> 02:26:04.049
HIS NAME WAS REDACTED.
SOME OF HIS BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS

02:26:04.271 --> 02:26:08.465
WERE AVAILABLE THOUGH, INCLUDING
HIS DATE OF BIRTH, DATE AND

02:26:08.466 --> 02:26:12.821
PLACE OF CERTIFICATION.
AND SOME ADDITIONAL BIOGRAPHICAL

02:26:13.484 --> 02:26:15.484
INFORMATION.
A REPORTER DISCOVERED THROSTLES

02:26:15.647 --> 02:26:19.072
A SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE
FOR THE AMERICAN BOARD OF

02:26:19.073 --> 02:26:22.591
PSYCHIATRY AND NEUROLOGY THAT
LETS YOU DETERMINE

02:26:25.890 --> 02:26:28.170
 WHO WAS
CERTIFIED AND RECERTIFIED AT A

02:26:28.407 --> 02:26:30.559
CERTAIN PLACE AND

02:26:35.595 --> 02:26:38.653
 TIME.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS WEB

02:26:38.654 --> 02:26:43.204
INTERFACE, YOU MIGHT KNOW THAT
DATA CERTIFICATION IS NOT AN

02:26:43.205 --> 02:26:45.330
OPTION.
WHAT HE REALLY WANTED WAS TO

02:26:45.331 --> 02:26:47.926
SEARCH BY DATE.
HE'S STUCK AT THIS

02:26:52.936 --> 02:26:54.936
 POINT.

02:27:05.552 --> 02:27:09.253
SO JEREMY WAS ABLE TO PULL OUT
ALL OF THE DATA FROM THE

02:27:09.254 --> 02:27:11.556
DATABASE AND DO THE SEARCH BY,
AND THEN GIVE IT TO THE REPORT

02:27:11.571 --> 02:27:15.403
NEVER THIS FORMAT, WHERE HE
COULD SEARCH BY

02:27:18.725 --> 02:27:21.535
 DATE.
THERE ABOUT 900 PEOPLE THAT

02:27:21.536 --> 02:27:24.073
MATCH THE DATE THAT THE REPORTER
WAS INTERESTED IN.

02:27:24.290 --> 02:27:27.193
WHAT HE DID AT THAT POINT, HE
STARTED CATEGORY GOOGLING.

02:27:27.425 --> 02:27:30.920
HE GOOGLED 88 OF THESE PEOPLE
AND FOUND SOMEBODY WHO, BASED ON

02:27:31.737 --> 02:27:33.952
OTHER INFORMATION THAT WAS
AVAILABLE ON LINE, MATCHED OTHER

02:27:35.059 --> 02:27:37.970
BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IN THE
TESTIMONY HE HAD

02:27:41.857 --> 02:27:43.722
 READ.
SO AFTER DOING THIS GOOGLING,

02:27:43.723 --> 02:27:47.783
THE REPORTINGS TEAM SENT SOMEONE
TO THE HOUSE-DOCTOR, KNOCKED ON

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.109
THE DOOR AND THEY OFFERED AN
INNER VIEW AND THEY GOT AN HOUR

02:27:52.110 --> 02:27:54.413
ON THE RECORD TO TEST.
THIS IS REALLY A STORY THAT

02:27:54.414 --> 02:27:59.010
COULD NOT HAVE COME ABOUT
WITHOUT TRUE REPORTER

02:27:59.011 --> 02:28:02.283
COLLABORATION.  WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE IDEA TO GO AND PULL DATA OFF

02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:04.500
THAT WEBSITE.
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO

02:28:04.938 --> 02:28:09.106
AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND ASK.
I'M A SOFTWARE ENGINEER.

02:28:09.140 --> 02:28:12.487
CAN YOU IMAGINE ME KNOCKOG YOUR
DOOR, I'D BE LIKE, I'M WITH THE

02:28:12.503 --> 02:28:15.004
FORK TIMES AND I'D LIKE TO ASK
YOU?

02:28:15.604 --> 02:28:17.604
QUESTIONS.
AND IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE

02:28:19.098 --> 02:28:21.489
GONE WELL.
SO IT WAS REALLY A GREAT

02:28:21.490 --> 02:28:22.899
COLLABORATION.
HERE'S THE STORY THAT RESULTED.

02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:27.874
IT WAS ACTUALLY PART OF A 5-PART
SERIES ABOUT MEDICAL AND

02:28:27.875 --> 02:28:31.083
PSYCHIATRIC CARE AT GUANTANAMO
BAY WANT THIS IS A CASE WHERE IF

02:28:31.219 --> 02:28:35.168
YOU LOOK AT THE STORY, YOU WOULD
HAVE NO IDEA THAT A SOFTWARE

02:28:35.169 --> 02:28:37.800
ENGINEER OR ANY KIND OF DATA
COMB POINTS MAY HAVE BEEN

02:28:37.801 --> 02:28:39.801
INVOLVED BECAUSE THERE'S NO
GRAPHICS.

02:28:39.993 --> 02:28:41.968
THERE'S NOTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE
DATA TO YOU.

02:28:41.969 --> 02:28:45.391
BUT THE DATA COMPONENT WAS
REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE

02:28:45.392 --> 02:28:47.616
REPORTING.
IT'S HOW WE SAW THE SOURCE AND

02:28:47.848 --> 02:28:52.572
TOLD THE STORY:  YEAH.
SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ANOTHER

02:28:53.233 --> 02:28:55.282
STORY.
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT DATA THAT

02:28:55.842 --> 02:29:00.183
IS TOO BIG FOR A REPORTER.
ONCE UPON A TIME, THE DATA JUST

02:29:00.184 --> 02:29:03.297
KEPT COMING  AND COMING.
THIS IS A LOT OF

02:29:08.310 --> 02:29:10.485
 DATA CAN ANYONE
TELL WHATS  IN?

02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:14.333
CAN YOU GUYS SEE ALONE.
CAN YOU TELL WHAT THIS DATA IS

02:29:14.701 --> 02:29:15.064
OF?
OH.

02:29:15.065 --> 02:29:17.548
WE HAVE GOT IT OVER THERE.  IT'S
THE OLYMPICS.

02:29:17.579 --> 02:29:20.264
THIS IS WHAT THE OLYMPICS LOOKS
LIKE.

02:29:20.298 --> 02:29:24.406
ON THE BACK END.
DURING DISNEY COMPETITIONS, WE

02:29:24.833 --> 02:29:29.659
CAN GET 20 MESSAGES A SECOND
FROM THE OLYMPIC DATA STREAM.

02:29:34.690 --> 02:29:40.300
AND IN THIS CASE, NO ONE PASSES
GO, OR COLLECTS $200.

02:29:40.401 --> 02:29:42.401
HUGE AMOUNTS OF THE TIMES

02:29:44.818 --> 02:29:46.818
OLYMPICS COVERAGE

02:29:48.264 --> 02:29:52.355
 IS BY TWO
NERDS SITTING IN THE CITY -- OUR

02:29:52.556 --> 02:29:57.466
TEAM KEEPS, IN FACT, OUR TEAM
KEEPS A COLLECTION OF OLYMPIC

02:29:58.738 --> 02:30:02.180
MASCOTS, THE LITTLE DOLLS
BECAUSE THE OLYMPICS ARE SUCH A

02:30:02.527 --> 02:30:04.503
HUGE PART OF THE DATA THAT WE
DO.

02:30:04.504 --> 02:30:07.961
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
WE POWER GRAPH T WE GET

02:30:07.962 --> 02:30:10.063
REPORTERS, THE MOST ACCURATE
INFORMATION AND TIME.  AND WE

02:30:10.281 --> 02:30:13.759
ANSWER QUESTIONS.
SO IF YOU ENJOY WATCHING "THE

02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:17.952
NEW YORK TIMES" COVER THE
OLYMPICS, IF YOU DO THINGS LIKE

02:30:17.983 --> 02:30:20.133
SPLIT TIMES, YOU WANT TO SEE
THOSE RACE THAT IS RUN IN REAL

02:30:20.356 --> 02:30:25.823
TIME AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
THAT'S ALL THANKS TO THIS DATA

02:30:30.851 --> 02:30:37.662
STREAM.ORGANIZATIONS WHO COVER 
THE

02:30:37.663 --> 02:30:39.811
OLYMPIC FEEDS ARE REQUIRED TO
PARTICIPATE IN MASSIVE TESTING

02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:43.370
EXERCISES AS PART OF THEIR DATA
CONTRACT WITH THE GAME, THAT

02:30:43.371 --> 02:30:49.391
START NEARLY A YEAR IN ADVANCE
SO IF YOU ENJOY WATCHING KIND OF

02:30:50.508 --> 02:30:53.150
COVERAGE, ANY WAY, THIS IS ONE
OF MY FAVORITE STORIES  FROM

02:30:53.151 --> 02:30:56.953
RIO.
I KNOW IT'S NOT AS EXCITING AS

02:30:56.969 --> 02:31:00.713
KATY LEDECKY WINNING BY
NEVER-SEEN-BEFORE SECONDS OR

02:31:00.714 --> 02:31:02.714
WHATEVER IT WAS.
BUT IT'S A NARRATIVE THAT CAME

02:31:02.854 --> 02:31:04.874
OUT OF THE

02:31:09.879 --> 02:31:11.879
 DATA

02:31:15.096 --> 02:31:17.613
 HE HAD HIS EYE
ON BOXING FROM THE BEGINNING AND

02:31:17.744 --> 02:31:20.604
HE NOTICED, HE WAS TALK TO THE
REPORTER WHO WAS WORKING ON IT

02:31:20.735 --> 02:31:25.897
AND THEY NOTICED THAT THERE WAS
SOME SCANDAL ABOUT COMPETITORS

02:31:25.898 --> 02:31:30.521
WHO WERE WORRY THAT WOULD JUDGES
WERE BIAS AND THEY WANTED TO

02:31:30.522 --> 02:31:32.236
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A LOOK AT
THAT.

02:31:32.237 --> 02:31:34.393
THEY WANTED TO KNOW, WHAT ARE WE
SEEING.

02:31:34.525 --> 02:31:37.884
WHEN THEY STARTED LOOKING, THEY
RELIGHTED THERE WERE SOME JUDGES

02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:41.204
WHO DISAPPEARED FROM COMPETITION
BECAUSE JUDGES ARE IN THAT DATA

02:31:42.208 --> 02:31:43.276
SET.
THERE WERE JUDGES WHO JUDGED AT

02:31:43.277 --> 02:31:45.960
THE BEGINNING AND STOPPED
JUDGING AND THERE WAS NO CLEAR

02:31:47.003 --> 02:31:49.995
REASON.
THEY WEREN'T LIKE, THEIR RATINGS

02:31:50.527 --> 02:31:52.378
WEREN'T BAD.
THEY JUST DISAPPEARED.

02:31:52.379 --> 02:31:57.637
SO THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THE
DATA TO FIND THE STORY, THAT THE

02:31:57.684 --> 02:32:01.708
JUDGES WERE JUST GONE.
THEY WERE DISMISSED, BUT IT WAS

02:32:02.064 --> 02:32:07.861
BECAUSE.
LET ME TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY.

02:32:08.096 --> 02:32:12.726
ONCE UPON A TIME, OPEN
GOVERNMENT DATA WAS IN THIS

02:32:12.727 --> 02:32:14.623
ADVERSARIAL FORMAT.
UH-OH.

02:32:14.624 --> 02:32:19.339
HEARD SOME LAUGHING THERE.
AS YOU MAY BE AWARE WE HAD

02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:21.305
ANOTHER EVENT IN WASHINGTON THIS
JANUARY.

02:32:21.306 --> 02:32:26.311
THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION.
AFTER EVERY PARTY COMES, THE

02:32:26.312 --> 02:32:30.342
COST OF OUR PRESIDENTIAL
INAUGURATION IS COVERED BY

02:32:30.343 --> 02:32:33.150
FUNDRAISING BY THE INAUGURAL
COMMIT AND HE THEY HAVE TO

02:32:33.151 --> 02:32:37.754
RELEASE A LIST OF DONARS FROM
THE FEDERAL COLLECTION

02:32:37.755 --> 02:32:40.447
COMMITTEE.
WHAT THEY DID, THEY TOOK THIS

02:32:40.563 --> 02:32:45.904
REPORT AND DELIVERED IT ON PAPER
TO THE FEDERAL -- WE KNOCKED ON

02:32:45.926 --> 02:32:48.707
THE DOOR AND HANDED IT TO THE
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.

02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:52.208
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT
THIS IS NOT HOW THEY HAD TO

02:32:52.209 --> 02:32:54.267
RELEASE IT.
IT'S NOT IN STATUTE THAT THEY

02:32:54.516 --> 02:32:57.578
HAVE TO RELEASE IT IN PAPER.
THE LAST TWO OF THEM WILL BE

02:32:57.579 --> 02:33:01.206
SPENT ON LINE AND IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY TYPE THIS OUT ON A

02:33:01.207 --> 02:33:03.612
TYPEWRITER AND THAT WAS THE ONLY
WAY THEY COULD DO IT.

02:33:03.631 --> 02:33:07.533
THIS IS SOFTWARE.
THEY JUST CHOSE TO HIT THE PRINT

02:33:08.396 --> 02:33:11.576
BUTTON, INSTEAD OF SEND TO SEC
BUTTON.

02:33:12.039 --> 02:33:15.909
SO IT WAS NOT MACHINE READABLE
DATA SO BASICALLY, THE VERY NEXT

02:33:16.140 --> 02:33:21.975
CALL WAS FIND ME A NERD.
THE NEWS NERDS, AREN'T THAT MUCH

02:33:22.226 --> 02:33:26.098
HELP IN THIS SITUATION MUCH THE
DATA IS PRETTY BADLY LOCKED UP

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:28.839
AND WE ANYHOW T. WHAT DID WE
DO?

02:33:29.862 --> 02:33:33.095
WE COMBINED OUR NERD POWERS MUCH
THIS IS A REPOSITORY FROM AN

02:33:33.096 --> 02:33:36.038
EDITOR AT THE "WASHINGTON POST"
NAMED STEVEN RICH.

02:33:36.171 --> 02:33:44.647
HE STARTED MANUALLY CLEANING THE
STYLE IN PUBLIC PRETTY QUICK

02:33:44.648 --> 02:33:48.107
PRETTY QUICKLY HE HAD
COLLABORATORS AT A VARIETY OF

02:33:50.339 --> 02:33:52.269
ORGANIZATIONS.
AND A FEW OTHER FOLKS.

02:33:52.270 --> 02:33:55.255
SO IN THE END, WE HAD FIVE
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS

02:33:55.256 --> 02:33:57.893
CONTRIBUTED TO THIS KIND OF
INFORMATION.

02:33:58.378 --> 02:34:01.663
ANOTHER FUN FANG ABOUT THIS DAY
IS THAT I SAW THIS WAS OUT AS I

02:34:01.882 --> 02:34:04.807
WAS EATING MY BREAKFAST AND THE
NEXT THING I REMEMBER, IT WAS

02:34:05.807 --> 02:34:10.327
4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON AND I WAS
SITTING IN MY SOFA ON THE

02:34:10.328 --> 02:34:12.196
PAJAMAS, MANUALLY ENTERING
THIS.

02:34:12.197 --> 02:34:16.545
LIKE THE COLLABORATION, THE NEWS
REGULATIONS READ THEIR OWN

02:34:16.546 --> 02:34:20.605
STORIES.
BUT THE BACKGROUND DATA WAS IN

02:34:20.836 --> 02:34:25.042
SOME WAYS, COLLABORATIVELY

02:34:28.236 --> 02:34:30.006
MANAGED.
THE SAD NEWS NOTORIETY NERDS, BY

02:34:30.007 --> 02:34:32.976
DOING ALL THIS WORK.
WE RAPID REPORTERS DISCOVER

02:34:32.977 --> 02:34:35.812
THERE WERE SOME ISSUES WITH THE
FILING, AND JUST A FEW ERRORS IN

02:34:36.450 --> 02:34:39.077
THE WAY IT WAS FILED.
THAT MEANS THEY HAD TO FILE AN

02:34:39.362 --> 02:34:41.034
AMENDED REPORT.
WHAT DID THAT MEAN?

02:34:41.035 --> 02:34:44.005
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE PAPER
FILINGS CAME OUT ABOUT THREE

02:34:44.006 --> 02:34:48.719
MONTHS LATER THAT WE ALL HAD TO
DIG INTO

02:34:53.741 --> 02:35:03.436
 AGAIN.PERHAPS YOU HEARD OF

02:35:04.153 --> 02:35:07.349
 THIS GUY.
HE'S FAMOUS THESE DAYS.

02:35:08.318 --> 02:35:10.257
HAMILTON.
APPARENTLY, PEOPLE REALLY LIKED

02:35:10.258 --> 02:35:12.946
IT.
THEY LIKED IT SO

02:35:17.957 --> 02:35:19.957
 MUCH

02:35:26.013 --> 02:35:28.013
.
IT WAS THE PRICE FOR ONE TICKET

02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:31.361
WANT THEY WOULD DOUBLE IT IF YOU
BOUGHT TWO OF THEM.

02:35:31.951 --> 02:35:34.115
ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS, ONE
OF THE REASONS THE TICKETS ARE

02:35:34.234 --> 02:35:39.261
SO EXPENSIVE IS THE RESALE
MARKET.  AND PEOPLE IN KNOWABLY

02:35:39.276 --> 02:35:42.311
AT NEW YORK TIMES WERE REALLY
INTERESTED IN HOW THIS MARKET

02:35:42.342 --> 02:35:44.434
WAS WORKING  AND WHAT WAS

02:35:48.650 --> 02:35:55.901
HAPPENING AND HOW RESALE
COMPANIES WERE USING BOX -- THEY

02:35:56.220 --> 02:35:59.393
THOUGHT F ONLY WE COULD MONITOR
WHAT THE COSTS ARE.

02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:01.740
I BET YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT'S
COMING NEXT.

02:36:01.895 --> 02:36:06.018
YES, THEY CALLED IN THE NERDS.
IN THIS CASES IT WAS MY

02:36:06.019 --> 02:36:08.766
COLLEAGUE AND SHE BASICALLY
WROTE A TICKET BUYING BOT.

02:36:08.899 --> 02:36:16.303
INSTEAD OF BUYING TICKS, ALL IT
DID WAS LOOK AT THE PRICES.

02:36:16.641 --> 02:36:19.777
TURNS OUT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE TIMES

02:36:19.778 --> 02:36:24.910
WERE INTERESTED IN THIS.
TIF WAS ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A

02:36:25.058 --> 02:36:29.299
FULL STRUCTURED DATA SET.
THAT HELPED REPORTERS UNDERSTAND

02:36:30.759 --> 02:36:33.913
COPING WITH THE SKILLS  ON
BROADWAY FOR A VARIETY OF

02:36:33.914 --> 02:36:36.893
STORIES THEY WERE TELLING.
THIS IS WHAT HAMILTON, SCALPERS

02:36:39.273 --> 02:36:42.690
WERE MAKE IN (INAUDIBLE).
SO HOW AM I DOING ON TIME?

02:36:43.053 --> 02:36:45.657
OKAY.
I'M GOING TO ADD ONE MORE STORY

02:36:45.658 --> 02:36:49.946
I DON'T HAVE SLIDES FOR BECAUSE
IT'S PARTICULARLY RELEVANT

02:36:49.947 --> 02:36:51.957
TODAY.
THE ONE RECENT SITUATION WHERE

02:36:52.194 --> 02:36:56.625
WE REALLY WANTED TO GET?
DATA IS THE HOUSE OF

02:36:56.626 --> 02:36:59.673
REPRESENTATIVES, OUR NEIGHBORS
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET WERE

02:36:59.674 --> 02:37:03.428
VOTING ON A HEALTHCARE BILL.
IT'S HARD TO GET DATE DATA

02:37:03.429 --> 02:37:05.598
THATTA OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SEN
ATE QUICKLY.

02:37:05.613 --> 02:37:10.010
A LOT OF IT IS BEING RECORDED BY
HAND BITE CLERK OF THE

02:37:13.771 --> 02:37:15.222
 BY THE
CLERK IN THE CHAMBER.

02:37:15.223 --> 02:37:18.642
WHAT WE'LL PROBABLY DO NOT HOUSE
AND IN THE SEN ATE THIS

02:37:18.643 --> 02:37:20.875
AFTERNOON.
AND I APOLOGIZE, I HAVE TO LEAVE

02:37:21.007 --> 02:37:24.120
EARLY S. HAVING PEOPLE SIT IN
THE CHAMBER AND WRITE BY HAND,

02:37:24.321 --> 02:37:28.447
RUN OUT, TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH, SEND
IT TO SOMEONE FROM NEW YORK

02:37:28.448 --> 02:37:32.876
WHO'S GOING TO TRIBE T. AND RUN
BACK N. WE ARE MANUALLY ENTERING

02:37:32.892 --> 02:37:36.459
DATA ABOUT A SEND TOGETHER BACK
AND MAKING IT ELECTRONIC THAT

02:37:36.490 --> 02:37:39.911
WAY.  IN SOME CASES, THAT'S THE
FASTEST WAY TO DO IT AND IT

02:37:39.912 --> 02:37:43.080
WORKS VERY WELL FOR US IN
GETTING HOUSE VOTES LIVE.

02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:45.822
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID, WHY DO
YOU NEED TO DO THAT?

02:37:46.051 --> 02:37:49.034
THE DATA IS GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE IN 40 MINUTES MAYBE.

02:37:49.035 --> 02:37:51.492
ONE THING YOU CAN'T GET FROM
THAT DATA ABOUT A ESPECIALLY IN

02:37:51.625 --> 02:37:54.601
THE HOUSE IS WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE
THEIR VOTES WHICH IS A COMMON

02:37:54.786 --> 02:37:56.966
SAT STRATEGY IN THE HOUSE.
SOMETIMES IT'S ACCIDENTAL.

02:37:57.538 --> 02:38:00.895
THE WAY YOU VOTE IN THE HOUSE, I
LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HOW YOU VOTE

02:38:01.096 --> 02:38:04.454
IN OUR BODIES REPRESENTATION.
IN THE HOUSE, YOU SLIDE A LITTLE

02:38:04.491 --> 02:38:08.311
CARD INTO A MACHINE AND THEN YOU
HIT, THERE'S A BIG YES AND NO

02:38:08.693 --> 02:38:12.329
BUTTON AND YOU HIT THE BUTTON.
PEOPLE HIT THE WRONG BUTTON.

02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:16.104
THERE WAS A SCANDAL A LITTLE
WHILE AGO THAT PEOPLE WERE

02:38:16.105 --> 02:38:19.030
LETTING THEIR KIDS VOTE FOR
THEM.

02:38:19.046 --> 02:38:21.046
WHICH WAS CAUSING THESE FEW
RYSE.

02:38:21.410 --> 02:38:24.720
IF THEY VOTE INCORRECTLY, THEY
CAN GO AND CHANGE THEIR VOTE

02:38:24.721 --> 02:38:28.311
BACK.
THERE'S SOME THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE

02:38:28.563 --> 02:38:31.713
MIGHT VOTE STRATEGICALLY.
THEY MIGHT SAY NO OR YES.

02:38:31.929 --> 02:38:35.713
IF IF THEY'RE NOT REALLY NEEDED
IN THE FUNNEL COUNT -- BY

02:38:35.714 --> 02:38:38.387
RECORDING THE VOTES  IN REAL
TIME, WE WERE ABLE TO GET NA

02:38:38.388 --> 02:38:39.954
INFORMATION OUT.
IT WAS HARD TO DO.

02:38:39.955 --> 02:38:43.745
WE NEEDED 5 PEOPLE IN THE
CHAMBER AND WE'RE HOPING TO BE

02:38:43.746 --> 02:38:47.637
ABLE TO GET BY WITH A FEW FEWER

02:38:52.661 --> 02:38:54.661
PEOPLE.

02:39:03.057 --> 02:39:06.611
WE ALSO WORK WITH DATA FOR
NEARLY EVERY DEFINITION OF THE

02:39:06.961 --> 02:39:10.867
WORD DATA YEAH.
SO I'M ENDING THIS THE WAY GOOD

02:39:11.753 --> 02:39:16.211
STORIES END WITH A HAPPILY EVER
AFTER.

02:39:16.359 --> 02:39:20.629
SO THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES, WHO
WALKED ME THROUGH SOME OF THE

02:39:20.714 --> 02:39:25.166
WORK THEY DID, ON DATA TOA
STORIES SO I CAN SHARE A MORE

02:39:25.218 --> 02:39:29.079
WIDER PERSPECTIVE AND YEAH,
THAT'S ALL I'VE

02:39:34.099 --> 02:39:36.624
 GOT.
[APPLAUSE].

02:39:36.661 --> 02:39:41.558
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, RACHEL.
NEXT IS JESSE DANIELS, PROFESSOR

02:39:42.296 --> 02:39:45.867
OF SEWS AT HUNTER COLLEGE.
SHE STUDIES RACE AND DIGITAL

02:39:45.868 --> 02:39:49.443
MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES  AND SHE IS
GOING TO SHARE A STORY ABOUT HOW

02:39:49.878 --> 02:39:52.829
SOME LIBRARY COLLECTIONS CAN BE
MANIPULATED BY HATE GROUPS  ON

02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:56.314
LINE, WITH HER
PRESENTATION "EXTREMISTS IN THE

02:39:57.453 --> 02:39:58.718
ARCHIVE." JESSE.
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

02:39:58.719 --> 02:40:03.138
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE . I'M HERE
TODAY TO TALK ABOUT EXTREMISTS

02:40:03.139 --> 02:40:07.977
IN THE ARCHIVE.
AND PART OF WHAT MY RESEARCH HAS

02:40:08.161 --> 02:40:11.201
LED ME TO BELIEVE IS YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND A WORLD IN WHICH WE

02:40:11.401 --> 02:40:14.418
LIVE TODAY, WITHOUT
UNDERSTANDING WHITE SUPREMACY.

02:40:14.639 --> 02:40:18.318
BOTH THE SYSTEM OF IDEA THAT IS
SETS WHITE PEOPLE ABOVE ALL

02:40:18.319 --> 02:40:22.479
OTHERS, AND ALSO, THE EXTREMIST
GROUPS THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED IN

02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:24.480
SOME OF MY RESEARCH IN THE
ARCHIVE.

02:40:24.576 --> 02:40:28.418
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SHARE
WITH YOU IS THIS SLIDE.

02:40:28.449 --> 02:40:33.072
THIS IS FROM AN EXTREMIST
WEBSITE THAT WAS FOUND AMERICAN

02:40:33.109 --> 02:40:35.109
CIVIL RIGHTS

02:40:39.243 --> 02:40:42.396
 REVIEW AND IT WAS
COVERED BY A COLLEGE STUDENT OF

02:40:42.434 --> 02:40:45.532
MINE WHEN I TAUGHT IN SUBURBAN
LONG ISLAND AT THE TIME.

02:40:45.983 --> 02:40:52.540
PART OF THIS WEB SIGHS WAS
ARGUING THROUGH A WHITE EXTREME

02:40:52.574 --> 02:40:56.163
SIFT LENS IS SLAVERY WASN'T THAT
BAD.  AND THEY WERE USING

02:40:56.164 --> 02:41:00.459
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS DIGITAL
ARCHIVES OF THE WPA PROJECT

02:41:04.364 --> 02:41:06.705
 NA
ARGUED FORMAL SLAVERY.

02:41:06.939 --> 02:41:10.624
I WANT TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW
I DISCOVERED THIS WEBSITE, AND

02:41:10.857 --> 02:41:14.665
HOW WE GOT TO HERE.
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT

02:41:14.666 --> 02:41:17.207
ABOUT MY RESEARCH.
IN THE 90'S, I STARTED,

02:41:17.208 --> 02:41:21.845
ACTUALLY, IN THE LATE 80'S, BUT
I STARTED PUBLISHING IN

02:41:21.846 --> 02:41:26.361
19NEVER-SEEN-BEFORE, SOME
RESEARCH I HAD DONE ON A PRINTED

02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:30.895
ARCHIVE OF NEWLETTERS FROM SIX
DIFFERENT EXTREMISTS

02:41:30.896 --> 02:41:35.089
ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE KKK
AND DAVID DUKES' ORGANIZATIONS,

02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:39.783
A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ONES, AND
TO DO THIS RESEARCH, THIS IS MY

02:41:41.782 --> 02:41:42.698
DISSERTATION AND BECAME MY FIRST
BOOK.

02:41:42.699 --> 02:41:46.013
TO DO THIS RESEARCH.
I DROVE 7 HOURS FROM WHERE I WAS

02:41:46.564 --> 02:41:52.982
IN SCHOOL TO AUSTIN, TEXAS TO
MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA, WHERE THEY

02:41:54.018 --> 02:41:56.904
KEEP A CLAN WATCH ARCHIVE.
THEY KEEP A TROVE OF THESE

02:41:56.905 --> 02:42:01.209
PRINTED NEWLETTERS OF EXTREMIST
GROUPS, AND I SAT OVER A COPY

02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:04.103
MACHINE FOR THREE, FOUR DAYS AND
THROUGH THEIR GENEROSITY,

02:42:04.104 --> 02:42:07.422
DEVELOPED MY ARCHIVE FOR THAT
FIST PUBLICATION.

02:42:07.769 --> 02:42:10.723
IN THAT RESEARCH, I ARGUED THAT
WHITE

02:42:13.947 --> 02:42:15.128
 SUPREMACIST RHETORIC IS
GENDERED.

02:42:15.129 --> 02:42:18.656
THE THINGS THEY SAY ABOUT RACE,
OFTEN HAVE SOME OTHER MESSAGE

02:42:18.687 --> 02:42:21.576
ABOUT MASCULINITY OR FEMININITY
IN THEM.

02:42:21.592 --> 02:42:25.953
I WAS FASCINATED BY THE WAY THEY
TALKED ABOUT WHITE MAN, AND I'LL

02:42:26.189 --> 02:42:28.189
SAY MORE ABOUT THAT IN A
SECOND.

02:42:28.978 --> 02:42:31.780
THE SECOND YOU WEREMENT I MADE
WHICH I THINK IS RELEVANT TODAY

02:42:32.001 --> 02:42:36.450
IS WHITE SUPREMACIST RHETORIC IS
SIMILAR TO MAINSTREAM POPULAR

02:42:37.138 --> 02:42:40.044
CULTURE RHETORIC.
SO LOOKING AT THOSE EXTREMIST

02:42:40.706 --> 02:42:45.365
PUBLICATIONS AND I COMPARE THEM
TO THE MAINSTREAM RHETORIC TO

02:42:47.513 --> 02:42:50.788
POLITICIANS LIKE PAT BUCHANAN,
AND LOOKED AT POPULAR CULTURE

02:42:51.576 --> 02:42:55.378
SCENES AND THERE WAS A LOT OF
RESONANCE BETWEEN THE TWO.

02:42:55.394 --> 02:42:58.259
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE ARE
SIMILAR IN SOME WAYS.

02:42:58.597 --> 02:43:01.321
AND THEN ABOUT THE GENDER
ARGUMENT, IT CAME TOGETHER WITH

02:43:01.521 --> 02:43:05.337
THE ARGUMENT THAT THEY'RE
SIMILAR IN TO THE MAINSTREAM.SO 

02:43:05.338 --> 02:43:07.177
NOT ONLY DID I LOOK AT THE
TEXT.

02:43:07.178 --> 02:43:11.228
I ALSO LOOKED AT THE IMAGES AND
LINE DRAWINGS.

02:43:11.450 --> 02:43:13.450
THIS ONE IS FROM TOM

02:43:18.239 --> 02:43:20.779
 MESSGER'S
-- THAT'S A DRAWING OF A WHITE

02:43:21.114 --> 02:43:24.880
MAN, HE'S WEARING BASEBALL CAP.
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S RED, BUT

02:43:24.881 --> 02:43:28.921
HE HAS ON A CONSTRUCTION VEST IN
THE BACKGROUND ARE BRIDGES AND

02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:33.268
CITIES, AND AN AIRPLANE.
THE MANY S WHITE MEN BUILT THIS

02:43:33.784 --> 02:43:37.934
NATION, WHITE MEN ARE THIS
NATION AND MY ARGUMENT ABOUT THE

02:43:38.256 --> 02:43:42.310
MAINSTREAM, YOU CAN SEE A RECENT
EXAMPLE FROM, THIS IS THE

02:43:42.311 --> 02:43:46.127
HISTORY CHANNEL.
THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WAS LINKED

02:43:46.158 --> 02:43:51.386
BY RAILROAD, FUELED BY OIL AND
BUILT BY STEEL.

02:43:51.433 --> 02:44:00.111
THIS RHETORIC AND ARGUMENT ABOUT
WHITE SUPREMACY IS RACE IS

02:44:00.112 --> 02:44:03.146
IGNORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND
NATIVE-AMERICANS WHO WERE IN

02:44:03.147 --> 02:44:06.258
THIS LAND BEFORE.
SO THAT'S THE WORK I DID EARLY

02:44:06.699 --> 02:44:08.699
ON.
THEN THE INTERNET HAPPENED.

02:44:08.721 --> 02:44:15.547
NOW, I KNOW FOR YOU SITTING IN
THIS SESSION, YOU KNOW THE

02:44:15.548 --> 02:44:17.734
INTERNET HAPPENED WELL BEFORE
19NEVER-SEEN-BEFORE, BUT IT

02:44:21.555 --> 02:44:24.399
 --
WELL BEFORE 1997.

02:44:24.519 --> 02:44:28.429
I KEPT FOLLOWING THE SAME GROUPS
I HAD LOOKED AT AND AN LYSED IN

02:44:28.561 --> 02:44:30.561
THE PRINTED PUBLICATIONS AND

02:44:35.512 --> 02:44:37.767
ANALYZED IN THE PRINTED
PUBLICATION.

02:44:37.783 --> 02:44:40.503
SUICIDE BOMBER RACISM.
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO YOU'VE 7

02:44:41.699 --> 02:44:45.838
HOURS TO THE SOUTHERN POVERTY
LAW CENTER ARCHIVES, THE WHITE

02:44:45.974 --> 02:44:48.978
EXTREME SIFT ARCHIVES I STUDIED
BEFORE WAS MUCH EASIER TO

02:44:48.979 --> 02:44:51.216
ACCESS.
I COULD FIND IT IN MY LIVING

02:44:51.217 --> 02:44:53.864
ROOM AND DIAL IT UP THAT WAY
WANT IT WAS ALSO GLOBAL SO

02:44:53.865 --> 02:44:59.062
PEOPLE WERE MAKING CONNECTIONS
ACROSS THE GLOBE, AROUND WHITE

02:44:59.093 --> 02:45:03.580
SUPREME S'.  AND PEOPLE WERE
CONTRIBUTING THEIR OWN TAKES  ON

02:45:03.930 --> 02:45:05.930
IT.

02:45:31.879 --> 02:45:36.181
WHEN I CHECKED LAST WEEK, THEY
WERE AT 325,683.

02:45:36.532 --> 02:45:39.816
AND THAT NUMBER ONLY GOES UP OR
IT HAS SO FAR SINCE I'VE BEEN

02:45:39.838 --> 02:45:44.393
RESEARCHING IT.
ON THE NIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS

02:45:44.424 --> 02:45:47.733
ELECTED  IN 2008, SO MANY PEOPLE
WENT TO STORM FRONT, THEY

02:45:47.734 --> 02:45:55.527
CRASHED THE SERVERS THERE SO I
WAS CONCERN ABOUT THE EXTREMIST

02:45:55.961 --> 02:45:59.126
GROUPS, AND I WAS CONCERNED
ABOUT MY STUDENTS AND I WAS

02:45:59.127 --> 02:46:02.494
TEACHING ON A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY
IN LONG ISLAND WANT I WAS

02:46:02.495 --> 02:46:10.016
CONCERN ABOUT HOW THEY WERE
GOING TO STUMBLE UPON WHITE

02:46:10.017 --> 02:46:12.708
SUPREMACISTS ON LINE AND DOING
THEIR TERM PAPERS.

02:46:13.039 --> 02:46:19.742
I WANT TO TELL THE STORY ABOUT
TAKING MY STUDENTS TO LONG

02:46:19.743 --> 02:46:23.380
ISLAND, BEFORE GOOGLE EVEN.
SO WE WERE USING DIFFERENT

02:46:23.381 --> 02:46:27.487
SEARCH ENGINES, YAHOO, ALTA
VISTA.

02:46:27.549 --> 02:46:29.661
LOTS OF DIFFERENT SEARCH ENGINES
THAT HAVE GONE BY THE WAY SIDE

02:46:30.987 --> 02:46:32.987
NOW.
TUNES COME IN, AND ONE STUDENT

02:46:34.247 --> 02:46:39.550
TYPES, THE FIRST THING THAT
STUDENT TYPES IN IS "KKK" INTO A

02:46:41.299 --> 02:46:43.557
SEARCH ENGINE.
AND ANOTHER STUDENT TYPED  IN

02:46:43.558 --> 02:46:45.635
MARTIN LUTHER KING INTO A SEARCH
ENGINE.

02:46:45.736 --> 02:46:49.679
THEY BOTH ENDED UP AT WHITE
SUPREMACIST SITES.

02:46:49.996 --> 02:46:53.581
AND I SAID THAT'S REALLY WHAT
I'M INTERESTED IN, IN THIS WORK

02:46:54.697 --> 02:46:59.586
IS UNDERSTANDING MY STUDENT
SEARCH PATTERNS AND HOW THEY

02:46:59.587 --> 02:47:02.960
MIGHT STUMBLE UPON WHITE
SUPREMACIST RHETORIC.

02:47:02.991 --> 02:47:06.114
THIS IS THE SITE MY STUDENT CAME
UPON.

02:47:06.152 --> 02:47:11.065
THIS IS WHAT I REFER TO, IT
APPEARS TO BE A TRIBUTE TO

02:47:11.066 --> 02:47:13.444
DR. KING, BUT IN FACT, IT'S RUN
BY STORM FRONT THAT, LARGE

02:47:13.445 --> 02:47:16.283
PORTAL I JUST SHOWED YOU

02:47:21.311 --> 02:47:24.154
PREVIOUSLY.
THIS IS WHAT I CALLED A CLOAKED

02:47:24.586 --> 02:47:26.173
WEBSITE.
LIKE THE PRESENTATION TALKING

02:47:26.174 --> 02:47:28.656
ABOUT SLAVERY, WHAT BOTH OF
THESE SITES  AND LOTS OF OTHERS

02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:33.563
I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT LATER DO,
IS THEY INTENTIONALLY DISGUISE

02:47:34.211 --> 02:47:37.094
AUTHORSHIP, IN ORDER TO CONCEAL
A POLITICAL AGENDA.

02:47:37.157 --> 02:47:42.611
IN SOME WAYS, THESE CLOAKED
WEBSITES WERE PRECURSORS TO

02:47:42.612 --> 02:47:44.874
TODAY'S NEWS.
PART OF WHAT MAKES THEM

02:47:44.875 --> 02:47:48.829
DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER, IT'S NOT
CLEAR WHO IS PUBLISHING THEM,

02:47:49.164 --> 02:47:52.076
AND WHAT THEIR POINT OF VIEW S.
SO THIS IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT

02:47:52.307 --> 02:47:55.390
FOR MY STUDENTS IN COLLEGE
CLASSES, EVEN THOUGH WE WERE

02:47:55.391 --> 02:47:57.807
TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE
ISSUES ALREADY, THEY STRUGGLE TO

02:47:58.056 --> 02:48:01.233
MAKE SENSE OF THEM.
SO THIS IS WHAT I DECIDED TO DO

02:48:01.367 --> 02:48:05.514
IN TERMS OF MY RESEARCH.
I WOULD ASK YOUNG PEOPLE, TILE,

02:48:05.945 --> 02:48:08.825
YOUNGER THAN COLLEGE STUDENTS.
SO I RECRUITED PARTICIPANTS WHO

02:48:09.009 --> 02:48:13.747
WERE 15-19 YEARS OLD, ALL FROM
NEW YORK, ALL FROM FAIRLY I GOOD

02:48:13.748 --> 02:48:16.744
HIGH SCHOOLS AND ASK THEM TO TRY
AND MAKE SENSE OF THESE SEARCH

02:48:17.384 --> 02:48:19.559
RESULTS.
LIKE IF THEY SEARCH FOR

02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:22.801
INFORMATION ON DR. KING, AND
CAME ACROSS THIS SITE, HOW WOULD

02:48:23.019 --> 02:48:26.761
THEY MAKE SENSE TELEVISION, AND
I ALSO ASKED THEM TO EVALUATE

02:48:26.778 --> 02:48:31.610
PARIS OF WEBSITE.
SO I WOULD PAIR A CLOAK SITE

02:48:31.611 --> 02:48:34.062
WITH A LEGITIMATE CIVIL RIGHTS
ORGANIZATION SITE.

02:48:34.311 --> 02:48:41.543
SO THIS IS A PAIRING HERE OF A
MARTIN LUTHER KING SITE, AND THE

02:48:41.558 --> 02:48:44.374
SITE FROM THE KING FAMILY IN
THEIR ARCHIVE OF KINGS PAPER AND

02:48:44.590 --> 02:48:46.898
THAT SORT OF THING.
THE SECOND PAIRING I CAN WAS A

02:48:47.791 --> 02:48:51.994
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SITE.
I PAIRED THAT CLOSED SITE, THE

02:48:52.555 --> 02:48:55.788
AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS REVIEW
THAT HAS THE FLAVOR INFORMATION

02:48:56.912 --> 02:49:00.002
WITH WPA, WITH THE HOST OF CIVIL
RIGHTS, WHICH WAS HOSTED HERE AT

02:49:00.153 --> 02:49:03.805
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
AND ASKED YOUNG PEOPLE, HOW

02:49:03.806 --> 02:49:07.510
WOULD YOU MAKE SENSE OF THIS?
WHO I FOUND WAS INTERESTING, IN

02:49:07.525 --> 02:49:10.592
TERMS OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF
THIS MATERIAL, AND HOW THEY MADE

02:49:10.827 --> 02:49:12.827
SENSE OF INFORMATION FROM THE
ARCHIVE.

02:49:13.005 --> 02:49:17.764
THE FIRST THING, AND THIS IS THE
AND THIS IS THE ENCOURAGING PART

02:49:17.911 --> 02:49:20.750
OF MY TALK.
THEY WERE VERY SATISFY.

02:49:20.797 --> 02:49:26.404
EVEN IN 2007, 2008 WHEN I WAS
DOING THIS ANALYSIS, THEY WERE

02:49:27.574 --> 02:49:29.574
VERY SAVVY ABOUT THE WAY THAT
WEBSITINGS LOOKED.

02:49:29.655 --> 02:49:32.038
THEY PICKED UP ON GRAPHIC
USERRISH FACE.

02:49:32.170 --> 02:49:36.416
ON COLORS THAT WERE NOT GOOD AND
FONTS THAT WERE NOT CLEAR OR

02:49:36.417 --> 02:49:40.611
DIDN'T LOOK SOPHISTICATED THIS.
YOUNG PERSON SAID THE SITE LOOKS

02:49:40.946 --> 02:49:43.338
LIKE, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING AN
INDIVIDUAL CREATED.

02:49:43.570 --> 02:49:47.369
IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY PROPOSAL.
SO SHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T TRUST

02:49:47.385 --> 02:49:50.697
T. THE GOOD NEWS IS, THEY WERE
VERY SOPHISTICATED ABOUT THE

02:49:50.698 --> 02:49:54.056
LOOK OF SITES.  THE BAD NUDES WE
KNOW NOW IS ALL IT

02:49:58.327 --> 02:50:02.597
 NEWS IS ALL
IT TAKES IS A GOOD GRAPHIC

02:50:02.598 --> 02:50:04.346
DESIGNER TO FOOL SOMEONE WITH
THE INFORMATION.

02:50:04.347 --> 02:50:06.965
BEYOND THE LOOK OF THE SITE, HOW
DO YOU EVALUATE THE CONTENT THAT

02:50:07.081 --> 02:50:10.708
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE, AND THIS
IS A PAGE FURTHER INTO THAT ONE

02:50:10.839 --> 02:50:13.764
ABOUT SLAVERY, AND WHAT'S
INTERESTING, WHEN I WANTED TO

02:50:13.995 --> 02:50:20.677
POINT OUT HERE, IS PART OF THIS
WHITE SUPREMACIST HAD DONE, WAS

02:50:25.713 --> 02:50:30.362
TO HE HAD TAKEN THIS APPROACH OF
FORGOTTEN BLACK VOICES, AND

02:50:30.363 --> 02:50:34.788
TAKEN THE WTA FORMALLY ENCLOSED
SLAVE PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY YES,

02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:38.254
WE WERE ALLOWED TO GROW
VEGETABLES WHEN WE WERE ENSLAVED

02:50:38.471 --> 02:50:42.048
AND TAKE ITS OUT OF CONTEXT AND
REFRAINS THEM IN A WHITE IS R

02:50:42.964 --> 02:50:44.964
SUPREMACIST CONTEXT.
FOR SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE I

02:50:44.997 --> 02:50:46.837
TALK T. THIS IS VERY HARD TO
MAKE SENSE OF.

02:50:46.838 --> 02:50:50.971
THIS IS SOME OF WHAT THEY SAID.
ONE YOUNG PERSON SAID, LOOKING

02:50:51.355 --> 02:50:53.879
AT THIS SITE.
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK I WOULD

02:50:53.894 --> 02:50:58.233
DISAGREE WITH T. I'M SURE THERE
WERE SOME SLAVES THAT WERE

02:50:58.234 --> 02:51:00.614
TREATED L. I CAN UNDERSTAND
THEIR POINT OF VIEW.

02:51:01.299 --> 02:51:03.299
THERE'S ALWAYS TWO SIDES  TO
EVERYTHING.

02:51:03.319 --> 02:51:07.011
AS AN EDUCATOR, THIS IS A LITTLE
HORRIFYING AND I'M SURE SOME OF

02:51:07.547 --> 02:51:10.963
YOU SOME OF THAT AS WELL.
ONE OF THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS I

02:51:11.311 --> 02:51:14.815
TALKED TO, READ THIS MATERIAL
AND SAID I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS

02:51:15.053 --> 02:51:23.842
BECAUSE I'VE READ OTHER THINGS
ABOUT SLAVERY, AND THIS ISN'T

02:51:28.864 --> 02:51:30.864
TRUE.

02:51:42.517 --> 02:51:45.941
MY RESEARCH, FITS  ON M, ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE INTERNET.

02:51:46.779 --> 02:51:50.064
ANALYSIS, AND THE PINNED ONLY
NEWS LETTER, AND THEN IN THE

02:51:50.065 --> 02:51:55.544
INTERNET ERA OF THEIR WORK.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHETHER IN A

02:51:56.145 --> 02:52:00.399
PRINTED ARCHIVE, AT THE SOUTHERN
POVERTY LAW CENTER OR IN A

02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:03.582
DIGITAL ARCHIVE AT THE LIBRARY
OF CONGRESS, THE GOAL OF WHITE

02:52:04.165 --> 02:52:08.025
SUPREMACY IS THE SAME.
BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE

02:52:08.026 --> 02:52:10.026
INTERNET.
AND THAT IS TO ROLE BACK HARD

02:52:11.460 --> 02:52:14.532
ONE, SOCIAL, LEGAL, POLITICAL
AND MORAL

02:52:19.551 --> 02:52:21.551
 VICTORIES

02:52:26.925 --> 02:52:29.595
 AND WHAT WE
KNOW IS DIGITAL ARCHIVES MAKE

02:52:29.596 --> 02:52:31.596
THIS IS EASIER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:52:32.298 --> 02:52:34.106
[APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESSE.

02:52:34.107 --> 02:52:39.649
IN OUR FINAL TALK BEFORE LUNCH,
PATRICK CRONIN AND THOMAS

02:52:39.650 --> 02:52:42.549
NEVELL, ORGANIZERS OF THAT
CLASS, WILL SHARE A STORY ABOUT

02:52:43.365 --> 02:52:46.079
THEIR SUMMER CAMP LAST YEAR,
WORKING WITH HIGH SCHOOL

02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:48.360
STUDENTS  TO RESEARCH 1968
WASHINGTON D.C. RIOTS.

02:52:50.229 --> 02:52:56.100
THOMAS, PATRICK, PLEASE TAKE IT
AWAY.

02:52:56.131 --> 02:52:58.948
&gt;&gt; HONORED TO BE HERE.
THANK YOU VERY

02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:09.862
 MUCH.
&gt;&gt; VIDEO: EVERYBODY READY.

02:53:12.926 --> 02:53:14.926
[SINGING]

02:53:39.481 --> 02:53:45.664
&gt;&gt; I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT, I JUST LOOK AT HOW MUSIC

02:53:46.012 --> 02:53:52.860
SOCIETY, CULTURE, AND JUST
REALLY, GOING ABOUT MUSIC AND I

02:53:52.994 --> 02:53:55.596
WAS TOLD ABOUT A COURT

02:54:00.029 --> 02:54:04.844
 CASE IT
WAS CALLED HOUND DOG, AND

02:54:04.845 --> 02:54:09.061
(INAUDIBLE) AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
[INDISCERNIBLE] BUT IT WAS THEIR

02:54:09.577 --> 02:54:12.611
SONG, BUT ELVIS MADE IT HIS

02:54:17.639 --> 02:54:21.077
SONG.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

02:54:21.078 --> 02:54:26.120
GOING TO FIND?
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE RIGHT NOW.

02:54:27.658 --> 02:54:31.875
BUT I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT HE GOT ARRESTED FOR.BUT

02:54:31.876 --> 02:54:33.880
 I DON'T KNOW

02:54:38.903 --> 02:54:45.041
 YET.&gt;&gt; (INAUDIBLE).
&gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU COME ABOUT,

02:54:45.042 --> 02:54:50.117
WANTING  TO KNOW ABOUT THIS?
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE IDEA IS THE HOUSING

02:54:50.264 --> 02:54:53.521
SO I'M LOOKING AT HOUSING

02:54:56.569 --> 02:55:01.077
 DESIGN
AND I'M ALSO GOING TO LOOK AT

02:55:01.078 --> 02:55:03.999
DESIGN.
I WANT TO HAVE A NEW DESIGN

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:05.191
TADOESN'T VICTIMIZE THE
RESIDENTS.

02:55:05.192 --> 02:55:11.610
&gt;&gt; THE INTERNET YOU'RE JUST
LOOKING TO ADD A DIGITAL COPY.I 

02:55:11.611 --> 02:55:14.943
CAN'T IMAGINE THAT KIDS GET
OPENLY EXCITED.

02:55:14.974 --> 02:55:18.528
&gt;&gt; THIS DEFINITELY PROVIDES FOR
MORE INTERESTING ASPECTS THAN IF

02:55:18.627 --> 02:55:21.968
YOU'RE LOOKING AT COMPUTERS.
TAN JUST COMING HERE AND LOOKING

02:55:22.184 --> 02:55:26.778
IN PERSON, YOU GET AN
INTERESTING

02:55:29.923 --> 02:55:31.592
 VIEW.
&gt;&gt; PHYSICALLY IN FRONT OF YOU,

02:55:31.593 --> 02:55:33.612
WHAT IS

02:55:38.643 --> 02:55:41.175
 THAT?
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT

02:55:41.176 --> 02:55:44.926
THIS IS.
BUT I KNOW, THE ONE BEFORE IT,

02:55:45.161 --> 02:55:47.161
BECAUSE THESE ARE RECORDS.
AND

02:55:50.522 --> 02:55:55.563
 THEY'RE 45.
AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS HOUND

02:55:55.564 --> 02:55:57.564
DOG.
&gt;&gt; I WAS LISTENING TO MUSIC ON

02:55:57.737 --> 02:56:04.188
THIS -- HOW IS LINKING  TO MUSIC
ON THIS, THAN LISTENING TO IT ON

02:56:04.539 --> 02:56:05.470
THAT?
IS IT THE SAME?

02:56:05.471 --> 02:56:08.294
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE

02:56:12.642 --> 02:56:16.789
 SAME.
IT'S VERY AUTHENTIC, I WOULD

02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:18.490
SAY.
ALL THE SNAP CRACKEL AND POP.

02:56:18.491 --> 02:56:22.175
&gt;&gt; THE OTHER THING IS NOT
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ON THE

02:56:25.077 --> 02:56:29.391
INTERNET.
WE CALCULATED THAT IF WE SCAN

02:56:29.406 --> 02:56:33.132
40,000 SCANS A MONTH HERE, WE'D
BE DONE IN 1300 YEARS.

02:56:33.468 --> 02:56:38.904
SO NOT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE
ON THE INTERNET WHAT IS ON THE

02:56:39.373 --> 02:56:42.229
INTERNET HAS ALREADY BEEN
DISCOVERED.

02:56:42.251 --> 02:56:44.223
WHERE YOU HAVE THE BOX
EXPERIENCE, YOU MAY FIND

02:56:44.224 --> 02:56:46.224
SOMETHING ELSE THAT NOBODY ELSE
HAS FOUND.

02:56:46.409 --> 02:56:52.138
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY MORE
COMMON.

02:56:52.153 --> 02:56:55.744
&gt;&gt; DID THAT HAPPEN TODAY.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, A YOUNG LADY WAS

02:56:55.745 --> 02:56:58.524
LOOKING AT A RECORD GROUP.
RG31.

02:56:58.540 --> 02:57:00.012
I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE
RECORD GROUP.

02:57:00.013 --> 02:57:02.536
I HAD NEVER BEEN ON THAT RECORD
GROUP.

02:57:02.598 --> 02:57:06.440
NATHAN HAD NEVER BEEN ON THAT
RECORD GROUP.

02:57:06.577 --> 02:57:08.595
AND WE HAVE WORKED HERE FOR A
COMBINED 22

02:57:15.621 --> 02:57:22.686
 YEARS.
&gt;&gt; I WANT SEE IF I CAN BRING

02:57:22.687 --> 02:57:25.606
BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE TOGETHER.
SO IT DOESN'T VICTIMIZE A LOWER

02:57:25.755 --> 02:57:27.755
CLASS THAN UPPER CLASS.
&gt;&gt;

02:57:30.610 --> 02:57:32.610
 OKAY.
THANK

02:57:35.687 --> 02:57:37.687
 YOU.

02:57:38.872 --> 02:57:42.544
&gt;&gt; TRADITIONALLY, WHEN STUDENTS
GO TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES OR A

02:57:42.791 --> 02:57:46.887
SPECIAL COLLECTIONS AREA, THEY
GET A TOUR AND THEY'RE LUCKY, IF

02:57:47.035 --> 02:57:54.438
THEY SEE MAYBE SOME PRIZE
COLLECTIONS AND THEN THEY GO

02:57:54.439 --> 02:57:58.431
HOME.
SO BEFORE LUNCH, THIS GROUP GOT

02:57:58.667 --> 02:58:04.696
TO USE A FINDING AGE THEMSELVES,
THEY GOT TO CONSULT PRIVATELY

02:58:05.285 --> 02:58:08.763
WITH AN ACTIVIST AND THEY GOT TO
TOUCH NEGLECTED ARCHIVAL

02:58:15.788 --> 02:58:22.935
MATERIALS.SO PATRICK AND I 
STARTED WORK

02:58:22.936 --> 02:58:25.176
WITH STUDENTS  IN ARCHIVES ABOUT
5 YEARS AGO.

02:58:25.207 --> 02:58:28.123
WE WERE BOTH TEACHING HISTORY AT
A NEARBY HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER.

02:58:28.624 --> 02:58:33.265
WHEN WE WHEN WE ARRIVED, IT WAS
ONE OF THE SCHOOLS WHERE LARGELY

02:58:33.503 --> 02:58:37.843
THAT ENGAGEMENT IN THE PAST WAS
RESTRICT TO THE TESTING

02:58:37.844 --> 02:58:40.641
CURRICULUM.
PATRICK HAD COME IN WITH A LOT

02:58:41.420 --> 02:58:43.312
OF LEARNING EXPERIENCE.
I'VE BEEN DABBLING WITH ARCHIVES

02:58:43.733 --> 02:58:47.410
 AND WE HAD BEEN STRATEGIZEOG
WHAT MIGHT MAKE A RICHER

02:58:47.411 --> 02:58:51.033
EXPERIENCE FOR THE STUDENTS  AND
WHAT WHAT MIGHT THEY ACTUALLY BE

02:58:51.570 --> 02:58:53.548
CAPABLE OF IF YOU PUT THEM IN
THAT POSITION.

02:58:53.549 --> 02:58:57.743
AND THE RESULT WAS, US BEING THE
STUDENT IT IS FIRST, AS YOU SAW

02:58:57.744 --> 02:59:01.515
ON THE LAST SLIDE.
BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST HOP UP AND

02:59:01.635 --> 02:59:04.551
LEAVE CAMPUS.
SO WE CANNOT TO THE ARCHIVES, WE

02:59:04.999 --> 02:59:10.677
WENT TO ANOTHER ARCHIVE, AND WE
RECREATED WHAT WE COULD OF THE

02:59:11.610 --> 02:59:15.069
ARCHIVE IN THE CLASSROOM.
WE REPLACE AID TEXTS BOOK UNIT

02:59:15.116 --> 02:59:20.333
WITH LOW ARCHIVE MATERIALS  AND
WE FELT ADDRESSED THE SAME

02:59:20.334 --> 02:59:22.203
THEMES, AND CHALLENGES OF THE
AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.

02:59:22.204 --> 02:59:25.127
SO JUST A FEW THINGS YOU CAN SEE
IN THIS TIME PERIOD.

02:59:26.148 --> 02:59:31.037
STUDENTS MERGING TECHNOLOGY AND
PRIMARY DOCUMENTS IN THE

02:59:35.385 --> 02:59:40.378
CLASSROOM.
LOCAL WRITER, AND HISTORIAN JOHN

02:59:44.264 --> 02:59:46.264
MULLER.
THIS IS THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES,

02:59:46.554 --> 02:59:50.979
JUST DOWN THE ROAD, AND THE
FIRST STUDENT THAT GOT THEIR

02:59:50.980 --> 02:59:55.073
RESEARCH ID, WE HAD GO INTO THE
FINDING AIDS TO WORK WITH THE

02:59:55.279 --> 02:59:57.356
ACTIVIST.
SHE PUT IN HER POLE AND AS THE

02:59:57.587 --> 03:00:01.624
STUDENTS FINISHED GETTING THEIR
RESEARCH CARDS, THEY CAME IN AND

03:00:01.659 --> 03:00:03.982
TAUGHT ONE ANOTHER HOW TO DO

03:00:08.731 --> 03:00:11.863
THIS IN A WAY, SOME OTHER FOLKS
MIGHT HAVE SAID YEAH, BUT THAT'S

03:00:12.100 --> 03:00:15.612
SORT OF ABOVE THEIR PAY GRADE SO
TO SPEAK.

03:00:15.849 --> 03:00:18.789
WHEN WE ARRIVED ON THE RESEARCH
SIDE, THEY SAID TUNE

03:00:22.324 --> 03:00:24.324
 GROUPS,
INCISE DISON THE OTHER SIDE.

03:00:26.774 --> 03:00:28.774
 [INDISCERNIBLE] ON THE OTHER
SIDE WANT SO THESE

03:00:31.832 --> 03:00:34.531
.
THIS IS THE LEGENDARY REVEREND

03:00:35.257 --> 03:00:39.375
O.J., GIVING A WALKING TOUR OF
THE ALLEY HE GREW UP IN.

03:00:39.406 --> 03:00:44.464
THIS IS ONE OF THE TOPICS OUR
TUNES ARE RESEARCHING, AND AND

03:00:44.465 --> 03:00:46.952
WE HAD THEM THINKING B HOW CAN
WE REPRESENT THIS INFORMATION

03:00:47.171 --> 03:00:50.462
THAT YOU'RE FINDING, THE
INTERPRETATIONS THAT YOU'RE

03:00:50.463 --> 03:00:53.429
MAKING IN DIFFERENT WAYS.  WE
HAD THEM EXPLORING HOW TO

03:00:53.430 --> 03:00:56.756
EXPLORE DIFFERENT MAPPING TOOLS,
INCLUDING MAP

03:01:01.763 --> 03:01:06.453
 STORY AND THE
RESULT WAS, THEY GOT TO PRESENT,

03:01:06.455 --> 03:01:13.866
THEY WERE AT THE PROHIBITTATION
OF THE OPEN DC CONFERENCE -- WE

03:01:14.417 --> 03:01:16.997
SAW THROUGHOUT THAT SPREAD OF
TIME, THAT IF YOU GAVE THESE

03:01:16.998 --> 03:01:19.114
STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY,
WHETHER IN THE CLASSROOM OR IN

03:01:19.214 --> 03:01:25.164
THE ARCHIVES, THAT THEY WOULD BE
EXCITED, THAT THEY WERE CAPABLE

03:01:25.482 --> 03:01:28.120
AND THEY WOULD CREDIBILITY TO
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE

03:01:28.121 --> 03:01:30.348
UNDERSTANDING OF OUR

03:01:33.358 --> 03:01:35.514
 PAST.
BUT WE KEPT RUNNING INTO

03:01:35.515 --> 03:01:37.515
LIMITATIONS.
THOSE CONVENTIONAL

03:01:41.507 --> 03:01:42.834
 STRUCTURAL
LIMITATIONS.

03:01:42.835 --> 03:01:46.236
MAY THEY BE A BELL SCHEDULE OR
JUST A CONSTRAIN A CLASSROOM.

03:01:46.954 --> 03:01:48.983
PHYSICAL SPACE.
THEY THEY CAN BE SCHEDULING A

03:01:48.998 --> 03:01:51.000
FIELD TRIP.
GETTING PERMISSION FORMS.

03:01:51.218 --> 03:01:53.247
ALL OF

03:01:57.068 --> 03:01:58.447
 THESE.
THERE'S MANY, MANY MORE.

03:01:58.448 --> 03:02:01.112
OKAY.
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING ELSEWHERE,

03:02:01.713 --> 03:02:06.444
WHERE THEY HAVE DONE AWAY WITH,
OR A

03:02:12.393 --> 03:02:13.339
 AMELIORATED SOME OF THESE
OCCURRENCE.

03:02:13.340 --> 03:02:17.612
THIS IS A GRAPH OF A STEM LAB
THAT IS IN CAME

03:02:20.769 --> 03:02:21.221
 BRING,
MASSACHUSETTS CALLED NEW VIEW.

03:02:21.222 --> 03:02:25.543
IT WAS STARTED BY AN M.I.T.
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN PH.D.

03:02:25.544 --> 03:02:27.544
TUNE.
AND THE GENERAL MOD CELL KIDS

03:02:27.777 --> 03:02:29.971
ARE PULLED FROM THEIR
TRADITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY

03:02:30.304 --> 03:02:33.061
WORK HERE FULL TIME AS A
STUDENT.

03:02:33.862 --> 03:02:36.993
THEY'RE ENGAGED IN SOME REALLY
GREAT

03:02:40.801 --> 03:02:43.761
 WORK.
WE WENT FROM THAT CONCEPT AND

03:02:44.666 --> 03:02:50.248
SAID, HOW CAN WE START A PROGRAM
THAT IS WITHOUT THESE

03:02:50.249 --> 03:02:52.249
LIMITATIONS

03:02:55.631 --> 03:02:57.631
.
OUR FIRST PROJECT WAS UNCOVERING

03:02:58.556 --> 03:03:00.931
THE 1968 WASHINGTON RIOTS  IN
WASHINGTON D.C. AND IT WAS AT

03:03:01.147 --> 03:03:04.653
THE WASHINGTON D.C. PUBLIC
LIBRARY CENTRAL COLLECTIONS,

03:03:04.654 --> 03:03:06.654
FUNDED BY

03:03:10.046 --> 03:03:11.516
 THEM.
HERE'S A PICTURE THAT IS IN THE

03:03:11.517 --> 03:03:15.135
LAB OF THE HUMANITIES.
IT WASN'T ARTIFICIAL, LIKE THAT

03:03:15.615 --> 03:03:17.931
STUDIO YOU SAW IN STEM IN NEW
VIEW WANT IT

03:03:21.919 --> 03:03:24.493
 WAS A COMMON
LOCATION.

03:03:24.524 --> 03:03:30.009
THIS IS THE FORMER KIP LINGER
LIBRARY IN THE CARNEGIE BUILDING

03:03:30.230 --> 03:03:36.152
JUST UP THE ROAD, SOON TO BE AN
APPLE STORE.

03:03:36.388 --> 03:03:40.615
WE TOOK STUDENTS TO THOSE PLACE
WHERE IS OVERHEAD IS ALREADY

03:03:40.616 --> 03:03:43.989
TAKEN CARE OF.
GALLERIES, LIBRARIES, ARCHIVES,

03:03:44.357 --> 03:03:48.382
AND MUSEUMS, MOST OF WHICH ARE
FREE TO THE PUBLIC AND THEY'RE

03:03:48.892 --> 03:03:50.927
WELCOMING US WITH OPEN ARMS.
PLEASE BRING

03:03:56.341 --> 03:03:59.520
 STUDENTS.
STUDENTS WEARING QUITE

03:04:03.104 --> 03:04:05.920
 GLOVES.
THIS IS OUR LITTLE HUB FOR THE

03:04:05.958 --> 03:04:09.757
SUMMER.
 60 HOUR PROGRAM TWO YEARS AGO

03:04:10.310 --> 03:04:12.310
STUDENTS COLLABORATEOG
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND WORKING

03:04:12.427 --> 03:04:19.465
TOGETHER ON A FORMAL PROJECT.
A PRODUCT, IF YOU WILL.

03:04:19.686 --> 03:04:23.371
WE BROUGHT IN OUTSIDE EXPERTS,
HERE, LEANING OVER THE COMPUTER,

03:04:23.955 --> 03:04:26.557
AND LEANING OVER THE STUDENT IS
A MAN NAMED BRIAN CRAFT.

03:04:27.074 --> 03:04:31.389
HE'S INVOLVED CURRENTLY IN A 10
YEAR PROJECT, TO MAP DIGITALLY,

03:04:32.207 --> 03:04:33.915
EVERY BUILDING IN WASHINGTON D.
C.

03:04:33.916 --> 03:04:37.817
TO CALL HIM AN EXPERT IS AN
UNDER STATEMENT.

03:04:38.164 --> 03:04:44.139
HE'S LEANING OVER A STUDENT,
WHO'S WORKING WITH SOME RTIS

03:04:49.162 --> 03:04:51.162
MAPS

03:04:57.932 --> 03:05:02.975
 THIS IS A STUDENT BRIAN OR
LITTLE BRIAN WAS 14 AT THE

03:05:02.976 --> 03:05:05.237
TIME.
ALSO, THE MINIMUM AGE THAT A

03:05:05.238 --> 03:05:10.036
RESEARCHER CAN GET A CARD AT THE
NATIONAL ARCHIVES.

03:05:11.170 --> 03:05:15.256
AND BRIAN, WHY DON'T YOU COME ON
OUT.

03:05:15.287 --> 03:05:17.287
BRIAN IS

03:05:20.294 --> 03:05:25.710
 CURRENTLY BRIAN IS
CURRENTLY A RISING JUNIOR AT

03:05:25.711 --> 03:05:30.572
SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON D.C. BUT
HE'S ALSO ONE OF 15 STUDENTS IN

03:05:30.910 --> 03:05:36.017
THE CITY WHO HAS JUST ACCEPTED
TO GEORGE WASHINGTON

03:05:36.018 --> 03:05:38.201
UNIVERSITY'S EARLY COLLEGE

03:05:43.218 --> 03:05:44.740
PROGRAM.
[APPLAUSE].

03:05:44.741 --> 03:05:48.557
WE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE BRIAN, JUST
GIVE US HIS PERSPECTIVE.

03:05:48.693 --> 03:05:53.488
WE'LL SHOW YOU SOME VISUALS AS
WE'VE BEEN DOING AND HE'LL MAYBE

03:05:54.160 --> 03:06:00.416
TELL YOU IN A LITTLE BIT MORE
DETAIL, WHAT HE'S WORKED ON.

03:06:00.953 --> 03:06:02.785
OKAY.
SO THAT'S BRIAN CRAFT.

03:06:02.786 --> 03:06:06.704
SO ON MY LEFT IS D.C.
GOVERNMENTAL REPORT.

03:06:06.719 --> 03:06:10.906
ON THE RIGHT, AND THE DAMAGE.
SO CAN YOU SEE, IT'S JUST LIKE,

03:06:10.907 --> 03:06:13.523
STREET IMAGES, LIKE ON THESE
BLOCKS, THE DAMAGE.

03:06:13.839 --> 03:06:18.432
SO BASICALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO
DO IS REPLICATE THAT IMAGE OR

03:06:18.769 --> 03:06:22.952
THOSE IMAGES, AND SO, SORRY.
IF I'M RAMBLING.

03:06:23.271 --> 03:06:28.361
BUT IN THIS BOOK, THERE'S THIS
WHOLE LIKE, A FOLD OUT PAGE OF

03:06:29.599 --> 03:06:34.854
LIKE A HAND DRAWN DAMAGE MAP OF
THE ENTIRE 7TH  STREET AND 14TH 

03:06:35.518 --> 03:06:39.046
STREET OF THE RIOT.
SO I'M BASICALLY, TRYING TO DRAW

03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:42.763
OUT EACH BUILDING, COLOR IT IN,
IF IT'S DAMAGED, HOW DAMAGED IT

03:06:43.531 --> 03:06:46.953
IS.
IF IT'S SALVAGEABLE OR

03:06:46.954 --> 03:06:50.087
UNSALVAGEABLE AND REPLICATE IT
DIGITALLY.

03:06:50.149 --> 03:06:52.784
AT THIS STAGE, I WAS REALLY
IMMERSED IN MY WORK.

03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:55.714
WHEN HE CAME, I WAS LIKE, I
DON'T REALLY NEED HIS HELP.

03:06:55.935 --> 03:06:59.544
BUT YOU KNOW, I STILL, YOU KNOW,
WAS POLITE.

03:07:00.466 --> 03:07:05.390
TOOK A SIP LIKE, YOU KNOW,.
[LAUGHTER]

03:07:05.576 --> 03:07:08.380
BUT STILL, IT WAS A LIVE
EXPERIENCE AND THAT TILE TURNED

03:07:08.611 --> 03:07:12.500
INTO AN INTERNSHIP OFFER AT HIS
INITIALING FIRM, GM T.

03:07:12.999 --> 03:07:14.999
SO THAT WAS COOL.
I DIDN'T GET TO DO IT.

03:07:15.020 --> 03:07:18.502
I DIDN'T GET SECURITY CLEARANCE
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LET

03:07:21.068 --> 03:07:23.533
A 14-YEAR-OLD TOUCH A MULTI
MILLION DOLLAR DOCUMENT.

03:07:23.665 --> 03:07:28.011
BUT STILL, GOOD EXPERIENCE.
SO THIS IS A BEGINNING STAGE.SO 

03:07:28.012 --> 03:07:30.982
THIS IS FROM THE NATIONAL

03:07:36.033 --> 03:07:38.402
ARCHIVE.
SO THIS IS OUR ONLY TIME TO

03:07:38.403 --> 03:07:41.143
GATHER ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS MUCH
THAT'S ME, HOLING  THAT CAM

03:07:41.144 --> 03:07:42.896
REMARKS AND ONE OF MY
APPEARANCE, JAMES.

03:07:42.897 --> 03:07:44.879
SO WHAT WE DID FOR TWO HOURS
STRAIGHT.

03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:46.995
I HELD THE CAMERA.  HE FLIPPED
THE PAGE.

03:07:47.414 --> 03:07:49.772
I TOOK THE PICTURE.
FLIPPED IT.

03:07:50.008 --> 03:07:55.463
I TOOK THE PICTURE, AND THAT WAS
30 MINUTES AND I TOOK A

03:07:59.052 --> 03:08:01.052
 BREAK SO
WE WERE DOING THAT FOR TWO HOURS

03:08:01.083 --> 03:08:03.561
STRAIGHT.
ONE WE GOT ALL THAT

03:08:03.562 --> 03:08:05.099
INFORMATION.
I SHARED THE PICTURE WITH MY

03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:08.363
OTHER PARTNERS, AND WE HAD TO
PUT IT IN THIS SPREADSHEET.

03:08:08.611 --> 03:08:14.061
IT'S 30 COLUMNS, HORIZONTALLY,
DIFFERENT INFORMATION LIKE

03:08:14.062 --> 03:08:17.215
PERCENTAGE OF DAMAGE, HOW MUCH
THE DAMAGE COST THE OWNER OF THE

03:08:17.653 --> 03:08:22.799
BUILDING, IF IT'S REPAIRABLE.
AND IT'S ABOUT LIKE 90 PEOPLE IN

03:08:23.169 --> 03:08:28.999
THAT SPREADSHEET.
AND THEN I HAD TO IMPORT THAT

03:08:29.147 --> 03:08:32.321
SPREADSHEET INTO THE MAPS.
THOSE ARE EACH OF THE 90 PEOPLE

03:08:33.027 --> 03:08:37.002
THAT WE COLLECTED THE REPORTS O.
IF YOU WERE TO CLICK ON IT, YOU

03:08:37.150 --> 03:08:41.176
SEE THEIR NAME, THEIR AGE, THE
BUILDING THEY OWNED, THE DRESS,

03:08:41.495 --> 03:08:43.440
WHAT TYPE OF DAMAGE.
SO THERE'S THAT.

03:08:43.441 --> 03:08:46.770
AND THE RED, YELLOW AND ORANGE
SPOTS, YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THE

03:08:47.623 --> 03:08:49.533
EXTENT OF DAMAGE.
THAT WAS THE HAND DRAWN MAP I

03:08:49.534 --> 03:08:56.477
WAS TALK GOING.
I HAD TO DRAW THE RECTANGLES,

03:08:56.710 --> 03:09:01.465
THE SQUARES AND COLOR IT IN FOR,
I DON'T KNOW, ABOUT 11 STREET

03:09:01.466 --> 03:09:03.911
WORTH FROM L TO

03:09:08.929 --> 03:09:11.766
 Q YOU CAN BARELY
SEE THOSE LITTLE PLUS MARKS.

03:09:12.098 --> 03:09:14.098
THOSE ARE THE IMAGES OF EACH
BLOCK.

03:09:14.361 --> 03:09:20.656
SO IF YOU WERE ABLE TO GET A
DIGITAL VISUAL AND IF YOU CLICK

03:09:20.662 --> 03:09:22.662
ON THE INDIVIDUAL

03:09:29.043 --> 03:09:38.420
 DETAILS.I SAID, L YOU

03:09:39.107 --> 03:09:40.276
 JUST CONTINUE
WORKING  ON THE RIOTS.

03:09:40.277 --> 03:09:42.630
YOU DON'T NEED ME.
WHAT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO FOR

03:09:43.457 --> 03:09:44.976
YOU?
JUST WORK ON THE RIOTS.

03:09:44.977 --> 03:09:49.290
JUST GO FINISH YOUR MAP.
NO, I WANT TO DO YOUR NEW

03:09:49.291 --> 03:09:51.576
TOPIC.
DOWN TIME AND DEBAUCHERY.

03:09:51.792 --> 03:09:53.792
WE LOOKED AT

03:09:59.712 --> 03:10:01.967
 BROTHELS, AND THE
GOAL OF THE THIS PROJECT WAS TO

03:10:02.419 --> 03:10:04.806
TAKE IT TO THE NEXT

03:10:08.866 --> 03:10:10.729
 LEVEL.
HOW DO WE KNOW WHERE THE BAR

03:10:10.730 --> 03:10:13.639
IS.
SO WE LOOKED AT EXISTING

03:10:13.640 --> 03:10:17.458
PROJECTS, THIS IS FROM KEN
WINKEL IN UNIVERSITY OF

03:10:17.459 --> 03:10:20.260
NEBRASKA.
AND ON THIS MAP, THERE'S A

03:10:20.261 --> 03:10:24.894
MISSING LAYER, AND THE LAYER IS
BROTHELS DURING THE CIVIL WAR.

03:10:28.373 --> 03:10:30.373
SO BRIAN MADE THE

03:10:33.434 --> 03:10:38.907
 LAYER.
AND IT BEGAN TO GET THE NATIONAL

03:10:39.092 --> 03:10:43.899
ATTENTION, AND BRIAN WAS ONE OF
THE FIRST TO DO THE

03:10:43.900 --> 03:10:47.379
DIGITALIZATION THAT EXIST IN
THEAR

03:10:52.406 --> 03:10:56.075
 CATALOG.
&gt;&gt; AS A TEACHER AT THE AMERICAN

03:10:56.076 --> 03:10:59.465
SCHOOL OF [INDISCERNIBLE] I STAR
AID PROJECT IN CONJUNCTION WITH

03:10:59.518 --> 03:11:05.842
THE LOCAL 111 CEMETERY, AND THE
MEETING WITH THE SUPERVISOR

03:11:05.843 --> 03:11:09.159
THERE, THEY SAID WE HAVE ALL
THESE SOLDIERS BURIED HERE, AND

03:11:09.291 --> 03:11:12.661
FOR MOST OF THEM, WE DO NOT KNOW
GOING BEYOND WHAT'S ON THE GRAVE

03:11:12.877 --> 03:11:15.110
STONE.
AS A TEACHER, THAT WAS THE

03:11:15.111 --> 03:11:21.272
PERFECT PROBLEM STATEMENT TO
START W GETTING THE STUDENTS

03:11:21.273 --> 03:11:26.085
ENGAGED.
SO I HAD MY 8TH GRADERS  IN

03:11:26.086 --> 03:11:34.056
PARIS, PARTNER WITH PARTNERS  IN
WASHINGTON STATE TO RESEARCH.

03:11:34.441 --> 03:11:41.176
HERE'S A STUDENT, STARTING WITH
LITTLE BIT OF DATA THAT SHE HAS

03:11:42.239 --> 03:11:44.341
AND JUST A GLIMPSE INTO THIS
REMOTE COLLABORATION.

03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:49.733
THESE STUDENTS, 9 HOURS APART,
WORKING AT THIS TIME, USING

03:11:49.734 --> 03:11:53.070
CHECKEDS TO IN THEIR PERSPECTIVE
COUNTRIES, TO TRY AND

03:11:53.071 --> 03:11:55.292
COLLABORATE.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE, THIS IS

03:11:55.293 --> 03:11:57.293
RAYMOND BENNETT, HE DIED IN THE
FIRST DAY OF THE BATTLE OF

03:12:01.582 --> 03:12:06.599
CHATEAU PARIS.
THIS WAS A MIX OF DOCUMENTS,

03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:08.992
DIGITALIZE.
BUT ALSO, ARCHIVES AND MATERIALS

03:12:08.993 --> 03:12:15.161
THAT WEREN'T DYNEL TIESED.
AND THESE STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO

03:12:15.511 --> 03:12:19.200
ASK THEM IF THEY HAD ANY
RELEVANT DOCUMENTS  AND IF THEY

03:12:19.238 --> 03:12:22.089
COULD DIGITIZE THEM AND E-MAIL
THEM TO PARIS AND THEY DID.

03:12:22.558 --> 03:12:24.689
AND NOW, THEY HAVE AGGREGATED
THEIR WORK ON AN APP THAT CAN

03:12:25.156 --> 03:12:27.826
YOU DOWNLOAD FOR FREE IN THE
APPLE STORE.

03:12:27.963 --> 03:12:30.565
YOU CAN GO TO THE CEMETERY.
WHATEVER THEY HAVE FOUND ABOUT

03:12:30.816 --> 03:12:33.367
THESE SOLDIERS IS PINNED TO THE
LOCATION OF THEIR BRAVE AND YOU

03:12:34.053 --> 03:12:36.835
CAN STAND THERE AND LEARN ABOUT
SOMETHING WHO JUST FOUR MONTHS

03:12:37.468 --> 03:12:39.818
AGO, WE KNEW NOTHING

03:12:44.138 --> 03:12:45.102
 ABOUT.
AND WE WERE JOINED  IN LESS THAN

03:12:45.103 --> 03:12:48.040
THREE MONTHS BY AN INDEPENDENT
RESEARCH NOWHERE PENNSYLVANIA,

03:12:48.287 --> 03:12:50.287
WHO OFFERED HER OWN RESEARCH
ABOUT

03:12:53.259 --> 03:12:56.399
 JEWISH SOLD SOLDIERS  IN
THAT STATE.

03:12:58.502 --> 03:13:05.798
AND -- A FAMILY, FROM ILLINOIS,
WHOSE ANCESTOR IS BURIED  IN

03:13:05.799 --> 03:13:08.269
CEMETERY.
SHE SHARED ALL HER DOCUMENTS AND

03:13:09.470 --> 03:13:13.198
SHE LET US DIGITALIZE THEM FOR
THE FIRST TIME.

03:13:13.855 --> 03:13:19.800
SHE KEPT THEM IN A CIGAR BOX.
AND PLAIDSON, THEIR STUDENTS

03:13:19.801 --> 03:13:21.533
JUMPED  IN AND OFFERED MORE THAN
I COULD HANDLE AT THE TIME.

03:13:21.534 --> 03:13:24.801
NOW YOU CAN GO, AS THESE
STUDENTS ARE DOING AND LEARN

03:13:24.802 --> 03:13:27.635
ABOUT THE RESEARCH OF OTHERS,
STUFF THAT WAS NEVER AVAILABLE

03:13:27.987 --> 03:13:32.707
BEFORE, ON A FREE APP AND WE'RE
HOPING  TO GET MORE AND MORE

03:13:32.708 --> 03:13:36.337
INVOLVED ON THIS PROJECT AND
PROJECTS LIKE THIS.

03:13:36.406 --> 03:13:40.152
IN COLLECTIONS ACROSS SPACE AND
GET STUDENTS ENGAGED IN

03:13:40.153 --> 03:13:41.427
PROCESSES THAT DEVELOP REAL
SKILLS.

03:13:41.428 --> 03:13:46.490
&gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO RE-EMPHASIZE THAT
THIS WAS TOM A WORK WITH MIDDLE

03:13:48.486 --> 03:13:51.093
SCHOOL STUDENTS.
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

03:13:51.425 --> 03:13:53.917
MAYBE WE CAN TRICKLE

03:13:58.932 --> 03:14:05.765
 UP THIS IS
AN  EXCERT FROM AN ARTICLE

03:14:05.766 --> 03:14:10.832
WRITTEN LAST YEAR.
AND BRIAN WAS THE INTERVIEW FOR

03:14:10.864 --> 03:14:12.864
THE

03:14:15.889 --> 03:14:23.735
 ARTICLE.THE LINE THE LINE 
AFTER, HIGH

03:14:23.736 --> 03:14:25.736
PARADES INDEED WANT WE WANT TO
COME BACK

03:14:28.187 --> 03:14:33.653
 TO BRIAN, AND SIMPLY
ASK HIM SORT OF OFF THE CUFF.

03:14:34.102 --> 03:14:37.193
HE'S ASKING FOR MORE TIME.
THE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS ASKED, IF

03:14:37.447 --> 03:14:39.751
YOU HAD ONE THING, WHAT COULD
YOU DO.

03:14:39.982 --> 03:14:45.357
L WE JUST NEED MORE TIME.
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE WITH

03:14:45.578 --> 03:14:48.165
MORE TIME?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THE MAP, THAT WAS 7TH 

03:14:49.016 --> 03:14:50.774
STREET.
BUT ANOTHER MAJOR STREET DURING

03:14:50.775 --> 03:14:53.802
THE RIOTS WAS 14TH  STREET, AND
I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THAT.

03:14:54.034 --> 03:14:57.250
IF I HAD MORE TIME, I WOULD HAVE
DONE 14TH  STREET AND PROBABLY

03:14:58.819 --> 03:15:02.305
WOULD HAVE ANYONE BACK TO
ARCHIVES, TAKE MY PICTURES, GET

03:15:02.522 --> 03:15:04.583
MORE INFORMATION TO HAVE MORE
INDIVIDUAL IN THE SPREADSHEET

03:15:06.878 --> 03:15:08.878
AND IMPORT

03:15:11.893 --> 03:15:14.817
 THAT AND I THINK
ARCHIVE LEARNING IS JUST SO MUCH

03:15:14.948 --> 03:15:16.948
MORE

03:15:18.097 --> 03:15:18.953
 VALUABLE.
NO OFFENSE, BUT MORE VALUABLE

03:15:18.954 --> 03:15:22.573
THAN TEXT BOOK LEARNING.
YOU'RE EXPERIENCING  THAT

03:15:22.574 --> 03:15:25.046
INFORMATION FIRSTHAND AND
PRIMARY SOURCES ARE USUALLY

03:15:25.047 --> 03:15:29.184
SUPERIOR TO SECONDARY SOURCES
AND YOU CAN REACH YOUR OWN

03:15:29.185 --> 03:15:32.145
CONCLUSIONS AND YOU RETAIN MORE
INFORMATION, BASE ON THE

03:15:32.146 --> 03:15:33.728
INFORMATION THAT'S GIVEN TO
YOU.

03:15:33.729 --> 03:15:37.802
I THINK ARCHIVAL LEARN SUGGEST
MUCH MORE

03:15:41.135 --> 03:15:44.275
 VIABLE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT IF STUDENTS LIKE BRIAN,

03:15:46.481 --> 03:15:48.481
HAD AN ENTIRE

03:15:51.078 --> 03:15:52.641

WHAT IF WE RETHINK THAT?
WHAT DO WHAT IF TUNES LIKE BRIAN

04:35:33.458 --> 04:35:35.458
 PAUL.

04:35:38.258 --> 04:35:41.652
THIS IS A NICE CROWD FROM ME.
THIS FEELS LIKE HOME.

04:35:41.852 --> 04:35:43.900
JUST GOOD DATA NERDS
EVERYWHERE.

04:35:44.004 --> 04:35:46.816
LET'S SEE, I'M GOING TO START
WITH THE SHORT READING.

04:35:47.130 --> 04:35:53.864
IT'S ABOUT TWO MINUTES LONG.
LATER, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR.

04:35:53.887 --> 04:35:59.385
IT IS THE COCOON HISTORY FROM
NEW YORK CITY FROM A DISGRUNTLED

04:35:59.583 --> 04:36:02.367
RACCOON, BASED ON NEW YORK TIMES
SEARCHES.

04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:06.161
WE HAVE BEEN HERE LONGER -- I'M
A RACCOON.

04:36:06.182 --> 04:36:08.661
WE HAVE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN
YOU HAVE.

04:36:09.054 --> 04:36:11.651
WE DIPPED OUR PAW ON THE SPRING
ON SPRING STREET.

04:36:12.162 --> 04:36:15.020
WE CLIMB OUR TREES IN THE FOREST
OF LOWER MANHATTAN.

04:36:15.414 --> 04:36:20.559
WE LAUGHED  IN THE MOONLIGHT ...
AND YOU CAME AND YOU STAYED AND

04:36:20.760 --> 04:36:22.504
YOU BUILT THE HOUSES.
FINE.

04:36:22.505 --> 04:36:27.224
WE'RE SMALL.
WE WILL MAKE ROOM.

04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:31.631
YOU MADE MUFFINS.
WE ATE THE CRUMBS.

04:36:31.742 --> 04:36:33.742
EVERYONE WAS HAPPY.
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

04:36:34.318 --> 04:36:39.732
WE WENT INTO EXILE UPSTATE.
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, WE KEPT

04:36:39.785 --> 04:36:44.588
TO OURSELVES.
IN THE GARBAGE.

04:36:44.806 --> 04:36:48.309
FOR BAKED BEANS.
OUR FUR WAS ALWAYS IN STYLE AND

04:36:48.314 --> 04:36:53.008
IT WAS A HARD LIFE WANT WE LIVED
ON OUR LOVE AND OUR WITS THEN IN

04:36:53.116 --> 04:36:56.605
THE 1970'S, THERE WAS A FUR
BOOM, AND I WAS SURE THAT WAS

04:36:57.027 --> 04:37:01.617
THE END OF US.
BUT THANK GOD, FINALLY, WE WENT

04:37:02.761 --> 04:37:05.263
OUT OF FASHION.
AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO REALIZE,

04:37:05.264 --> 04:37:09.229
THAT WE, THE RACCOONS HAD A
RIGHT TO BE THERE.

04:37:09.271 --> 04:37:16.271
THEY STOOD UP FOR US.
IN 1982, A WOMAN NAMED -- IN

04:37:16.272 --> 04:37:19.960
1982, A MEETING WAS HELD IN

04:37:25.020 --> 04:37:29.295
SCARSDALE.
RACCOONS ARE LOVABLE CREATURES.

04:37:29.528 --> 04:37:34.083
DO WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO WALK
BY THEIR CARCASSES?

04:37:34.939 --> 04:37:37.392
NO, HEAT REATA, WE DON'T.
YOU SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

04:37:37.411 --> 04:37:45.790
WE WERE GETTING INTO YOUR HEARTS
A WORD ON RABIES.

04:37:46.139 --> 04:37:49.520
I'M FIRST TO ADMIT, RABIES IS A
PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY.

04:37:49.632 --> 04:37:53.417
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY.
IT WAS 1998 IN WOOD STOCK, NEW

04:37:54.103 --> 04:37:56.103
YORK.
LOTS OF PLACES SELL BAKED GOODS

04:37:56.267 --> 04:37:59.561
THERE.  VERY OPEN MINDED.
WE THOUGHT WE COULD TRUST THE

04:37:59.798 --> 04:38:02.474
HUMANS.
THIS ONE RACCOON HAD A GOOD

04:38:02.475 --> 04:38:05.743
THING GOING WITH BARBARA.
IT WAS A BACKYARD THING, SHE

04:38:05.744 --> 04:38:07.324
GAVE HIM TREATS  AND YOU KNOW
HOW THOSE GO.

04:38:07.325 --> 04:38:12.906
IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR BARBARA.
ONE DAY, SHE TRAPPED HIM AND

04:38:12.907 --> 04:38:17.202
TOOK HIM TO THE LOCAL DAYCARE
WHERE SHE INTRODUCED THIS TINY

04:38:18.463 --> 04:38:21.026
RACCOON TO ALL THE CHILDREN AND
THE RACCOON CUDDLED WITH

04:38:21.027 --> 04:38:23.027
EVERYONE.
14 TODDLERS, 10 ADULTS.

04:38:24.224 --> 04:38:28.431
BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT?
WELL, IT TURNED OUT ALL 24

04:38:28.432 --> 04:38:31.048
HUMANS HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO
RAIN ES, WHO WAS BLAMED?

04:38:31.610 --> 04:38:33.610
NOT BARBARA.
WHO WAS SHOT IN COLD BLOOD AND

04:38:34.763 --> 04:38:39.609
BURIED BY BARBARA HE'S HUSBAND?
NOT BARB A. WHO HAD HAD IT IS

04:38:40.109 --> 04:38:42.723
BODY DUG UP BY THE DEPARTMENT OF
HEALTH?

04:38:43.163 --> 04:38:44.744
NOT BARBARA.
AT THIS TIME LET ME ACTUAL, THE

04:38:44.745 --> 04:38:46.745
NAME THEY GAVE THAT RACCOON.
ARE YOU READY?

04:38:47.082 --> 04:38:56.149
THE NAME THE HUMANS GAVE THAT
RACCOON IN 1998 WAS SPARTACUS.

04:38:56.350 --> 04:39:00.644
THE LEADER OF THE SLAVE REVOLT.
YOU CAN READ IT IN THE ARTICLE

04:39:00.659 --> 04:39:02.659
OF THE PAPER OF RECORD WANT
WHO'S TO BLAME HERE?

04:39:03.547 --> 04:39:08.409
THE RACCOON DOING IT'S BEST OR
THE SOCIETY THAT ONLY ACCEPTS

04:39:13.455 --> 04:39:15.365
CUTENESS?
IN MIDTOWN, IT WAS ENOUGH TO

04:39:15.366 --> 04:39:19.299
MAKE "THE NEW YORK TIMES," AND
LET ME ASK YOU, IF YOU DON'T

04:39:19.300 --> 04:39:25.362
WANT RACCOON, WHY WOULD YOU
BUILD AN ORNAMENTAL GOLD POND ON

04:39:25.363 --> 04:39:28.958
5 4TH STREET.
BY 2002, WE MADE IT TO THE BRONX

04:39:29.210 --> 04:39:34.436
AND OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS, WE
FOUND OUR WAY BACK TO THE CITY.

04:39:34.658 --> 04:39:40.510
TODAY YOU'LL FIND US EVERYONE.
AND THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER

04:39:45.519 --> 04:39:53.627
BROOKLYN.PANDA'S OVERRATED.
THEIR

04:39:56.213 --> 04:40:00.094
 ECOLOGICAL NICHE IS
5 INCHES WALL F. YOU DON'T FEED

04:40:00.611 --> 04:40:03.069
THEM BAMBOO, THEY FALL OVER AND
DIE.

04:40:03.690 --> 04:40:07.804
AT FIRST WORD, TRASH.
LET ME ASK, IS IT SO LONG YOU

04:40:08.650 --> 04:40:15.156
WANT WHAT WE THROW AWAY YOUR
BLUE SKY BAKERY MUFFIN CHUNKS?I 

04:40:15.157 --> 04:40:18.576
LIVE FROM YOUR ART IS UNTIL
LEADINGS.

04:40:19.150 --> 04:40:25.642
WHY NOT TREASURE PANDA?
AND REMEMBER, YOU ARE THE GUESTS

04:40:25.643 --> 04:40:33.221
OF THE RACCOONS.
SO THE REASON FOR THAT WILL

04:40:33.222 --> 04:40:35.222
BECOME CLEAR

04:40:38.234 --> 04:40:47.082
 MOMENTARILY.AND THEN DO A VERY 
BRIEF

04:40:47.083 --> 04:40:50.949
SOFTWARE DEMO AND ISSUE SOME
RECOMMENDATION TO THE ASSEMBLED

04:40:55.961 --> 04:40:57.961
AUDIENCE

04:40:59.856 --> 04:41:02.490
 IN 2006, 2005, I WAS A
WRITER, AND I WAS DOING OKAY.

04:41:02.491 --> 04:41:08.394
AND I GOT A JOB AT HARPER'S
MAGAZINE IN CHARGE OF THEIR

04:41:08.395 --> 04:41:11.784
WEBSITE.
I WAS A PROGRAMMER.

04:41:12.654 --> 04:41:17.336
AND HARPER'S BEING CHEAP IS
LIKE, WELL, THIS WILL DUE AND

04:41:17.455 --> 04:41:20.708
BROUGHT ME ON WANT A GOOD
EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO

04:41:20.861 --> 04:41:22.861
WORK THERE, THE PUBLISHER TOOK
ME

04:41:29.731 --> 04:41:31.731
 ASIDE.

04:41:45.060 --> 04:41:49.661
 GIVEN LOTS OF TIME,
AND GIVEN SORT OF THE RESOURCES

04:41:49.861 --> 04:41:54.771
AT HAND, I REALIZE THIS MAGAZINE
IS GOING BACK TO 1850, AND ALSO,

04:41:54.806 --> 04:41:58.116
THERE WAS THIS SORT OF WHITE
ELEPHANT BIBLIOGRAPHY THEY

04:41:58.117 --> 04:42:00.297
BUILT.
THEY BUILT IT DURING THE DAYS

04:42:00.397 --> 04:42:06.045
WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO LIKE,
MAKE IT AND SELL IT TO TERMINAL

04:42:06.495 --> 04:42:10.319
RESEARCH LIBRARIES SO PEOPLE
COULD WALK TO THE STACKS  AND GO

04:42:10.522 --> 04:42:14.089
AND GET THE MAGAZINES OFF THE
STACKS GOING BACK TO THE

04:42:14.090 --> 04:42:15.630
1850'S.
EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFUL.

04:42:15.631 --> 04:42:17.631
AND WITH SUBJECT HEADS  AND ON
AND ON.

04:42:18.088 --> 04:42:20.088
AND IT HAD GONE TERRIBLY OVER
SCHEDULE.

04:42:20.371 --> 04:42:25.363
SO THEY START IN LIKE, '89 OR 90
AND NOW, IT WAS '95 AND

04:42:25.364 --> 04:42:28.798
EVERYBODY WANTED PICTURES.
NOW, 10 YEARS LATER, I SHOW UP

04:42:29.014 --> 04:42:32.345
AND THIS THING IS GREAT.
LET'S PUT PICTURES WITH IT.

04:42:32.795 --> 04:42:34.950
GREAT.
WE'LL GIVE YOU 18 GRAND AND THAT

04:42:35.554 --> 04:42:44.617
INCLUDES YOUR SCANNER.
SO I BOUGHT A FIJITSU 57, AND I

04:42:44.784 --> 04:42:46.784
SCANNED THE HELL OUT OF THAT
ARCHIVE.

04:42:46.928 --> 04:42:51.791
MAKING OF AMERICA HAD GONE FROM
1850 TO 1900 OUT OF CORNELL AND

04:42:51.845 --> 04:42:54.861
OTHER PLACES.
I TRADED THEM A HARD DRIVE WITH

04:42:55.185 --> 04:43:00.426
HARPERS UP TO 1923 AND GAVE THEM
SOME BIBLIOGRAPHY DATA IT WAS

04:43:00.992 --> 04:43:06.058
JUST THIS INSANE HORSE TRADE
WITHING NO MONEY, IN WHICH I WAS

04:43:06.173 --> 04:43:10.708
DOING ALL THE PROGRAMS OR
MOSTEST SCANNING I HAD A HIGH

04:43:11.456 --> 04:43:12.926
SCHOOL STUDENT THAT WAS
TERRIBLE, ACTUALLY.

04:43:12.927 --> 04:43:16.882
I SHOULD HAVE JUST DONE ALL OF
T. IN THE 70'S, THERE'S THESE

04:43:17.003 --> 04:43:24.202
BAD CUTS FROM THE SPINE BECAUSE
HE WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

04:43:24.354 --> 04:43:26.713
PUT TUP AND SUDDENLY, EVERYBODY
WAS REALLY NICE TO ME.

04:43:28.129 --> 04:43:31.112
AND THEY HAD BEEN YELL ATHME

04:43:36.143 --> 04:43:45.162
BEFORE.IT'S WORTH TO PAY IT 
BECAUSE

04:43:45.163 --> 04:43:47.785
ADVERTISING IS REALLY WHAT FUNDS
THE PUBLICATION WANT SO WHAT I

04:43:48.022 --> 04:43:51.665
HAD DONE, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THESE
SUBSCRIPTIONS CAME IN.

04:43:51.795 --> 04:43:55.291
PEOPLE LIKE ARCHIVES.
THEY DON'T LIKE THEM -- THEY

04:43:55.292 --> 04:43:58.320
LIKE SUBSCRIBING BUT THE IDEA OF
GETTING BACK TO 1850 WAS VERY

04:43:59.976 --> 04:44:01.344
MOTIVATING.
SO SUDDENLY, INSTEAD OF HAVING

04:44:01.345 --> 04:44:05.842
TO SPEND 35 BUCKS YOU'RE GETTING
THESE DIGITAL SUBSCRIBERS WHO

04:44:05.873 --> 04:44:09.241
WERE JUST SHOWING UP.  AND THEY
WERE REALLY NICE FOR A COUPLE OF

04:44:09.561 --> 04:44:10.750
MONTHS AND REALLY HAPPY I WAS
THERE.

04:44:10.751 --> 04:44:16.925
I WAS INN MAKINGN'T MAKING THE
MONEY, I WAS SAVING THE MONEY.

04:44:17.257 --> 04:44:20.101
YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR
CIRCULATION UP, IS BECAUSE

04:44:20.102 --> 04:44:22.519
ADVERTISERS BUY BY NUMBER AND
IT'S AUDITED.

04:44:22.752 --> 04:44:26.582
IF YOU HAVE A QUARTER MILLION,
HAVE YOU TO SPEND ALL MONEY IN

04:44:27.125 --> 04:44:29.125
THE WORLD.
SO

04:44:30.574 --> 04:44:34.044
 THAT'S ONE BIG INTERACTION
BETWEEN ARCHIVES AND THE MEDIA.

04:44:34.426 --> 04:44:38.978
ALSO, THAT WHOLE TIME, I WAS
ASHAMED BECAUSE I WOULD GO TO

04:44:39.094 --> 04:44:42.682
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS WEBSITE
THAT HAD STANDARDS FOR SCANNING,

04:44:43.007 --> 04:44:48.268
AND IT WOULD BE ONLY 96 BIT
UNCOMPRESSED HISTORY,

04:44:48.269 --> 04:44:50.668
UNACCEPTABLE EVER.
AND I HAD A COUPLE OF HARD

04:44:50.669 --> 04:44:52.944
DRIVES  AND NO MONEY.
I JUST SORT OF MADE THE DECISION

04:44:53.039 --> 04:44:59.222
THAT IF I CAN SEAT GRAIN OF THE
PAPER THAT WAS OKAY.

04:44:59.575 --> 04:45:01.575
BUT NO ONE BACKED ME UP ON
THAT.

04:45:01.709 --> 04:45:05.635
SO I BUILT THIS ARCHIVE THAT WAS
GOOD THAT, ENDED UP BEING RESOLD

04:45:05.666 --> 04:45:07.209
TO LOTS OF UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES.

04:45:07.210 --> 04:45:11.210
THE WHOLE TIME I DID IT, I
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT

04:45:11.211 --> 04:45:15.514
ANGLED OF PAGES WAS, AND WHAT
THE TOLERANCES ARE TRULY ARE.THE

04:45:15.968 --> 04:45:18.592
 STANDARDS PUSH LIBRARY OFFED
ARE TRULY HIGH.

04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:21.172
THEY'RE NOT INTENDED FOR
AMATEURS WITH NO BUDGETS.

04:45:21.202 --> 04:45:24.232
THAT WAS THE REAL WORLD I WAS IN
TO GET THIS ASSET ON LINE.

04:45:25.507 --> 04:45:29.463
ALSO, I SCORED A WHOLE COPY OF
ARCHIVE FROM BENNINGTON.

04:45:29.832 --> 04:45:33.476
SOMEBODY DROVE DOWN FROM VERMONT
AND TOYOTA AND JUST GAVE ME ALL

04:45:33.947 --> 04:45:37.317
OF HEARTBURN BECAUSE THEY WANTED
DIGITAL

04:45:42.348 --> 04:45:49.874
 ACCESS.ALSO, ONCE I GOT IT OUT 
THERE.

04:45:49.943 --> 04:45:52.847
PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY CAME IN AND
STARTED TO THREATEN LAWSUITS.THE

04:45:53.166 --> 04:45:56.429
 JOB OF AN EDITOR IS NOT TO
MAKE THINGS BEAUTIFUL, OR MAKE

04:45:57.179 --> 04:45:59.393
THE PROS GREAT, IT'S TO AVOID
LITIGATION.

04:45:59.978 --> 04:46:03.637
PUTTING THESE THINGS ON LINE,
MEANT THAT PEOPLE WHO HAD

04:46:03.638 --> 04:46:06.363
FORGOTTEN THAT UNFORTUNATE
INCIDENT IN 1995, SUDDENLY WERE

04:46:07.163 --> 04:46:11.372
BACK AND WERE ANGRY IT HAD
FOUNDED ITS WAY ON TO THE WEB

04:46:11.660 --> 04:46:13.934
AGAIN.
MY MICROPHONE IS FALLING OFF.

04:46:14.165 --> 04:46:19.078
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.
AND THEN I ALSO WORKED FOR A

04:46:19.079 --> 04:46:24.494
SMALL MEDIA CONSULTING FIRM THAT
GAVE ME LOTS OF ACCESS TO BIG

04:46:24.825 --> 04:46:29.358
MEDIA COMPANIES.
I BUILT A VERSION OF GOURMET

04:46:29.359 --> 04:46:33.589
MAGAZINE FOR THE IPAD WHICH
MANY THINGS ASIDE, IT WAS BASED

04:46:34.432 --> 04:46:36.432
ON ARCHIVES  FROM

04:46:38.305 --> 04:46:39.576
 GOURMET, AND I
LEARNED, A THINGS THAT VERY

04:46:39.577 --> 04:46:42.741
IMPORTANT THAT I'LL CONTINUE TO
TALK ABOUT WAS ASSET PANIC.

04:46:42.959 --> 04:46:45.875
UNLESS YOU HAVE THE ASSETS  IN
YOUR HAND AND YOU CANNOT BELIEVE

04:46:45.877 --> 04:46:47.645
HOW MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU, NO
WORRIES.

04:46:47.646 --> 04:46:51.619
I'M GOING TO GO GET YOU A HARD
DRIVE AND LIKE, FOUR MONTHS GOES

04:46:51.978 --> 04:46:53.810
BY.
ACTUALLY, THERE'S 12 LAWYERS

04:46:53.811 --> 04:46:57.317
THAT GO BY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL IT

04:46:57.318 --> 04:46:59.318
HAPPENED.
BOTH THINGS INCREASE RISK IN AN

04:46:59.346 --> 04:47:03.480
ORGANIZATION.
AND API'S AND ARCHIVES ARE

04:47:03.481 --> 04:47:05.627
TERRITORIES.
PEOPLE ARE FIERCELY DEFENDANT

04:47:05.695 --> 04:47:08.863
AROUND THEM SO I LEARND  TO
NAVIGATE AND REVEAL TO THAT.

04:47:09.563 --> 04:47:10.666
THAT'S ANOTHER REALITY IN THIS
WORLD.

04:47:10.667 --> 04:47:15.046
SO THAT'S MY ADVICE.
ANYONE F YOU EVER END UP IN THE

04:47:15.078 --> 04:47:19.792
PRIVATE SECTOR.
JUST NEVER STOP PANICKING UNTIL

04:47:20.108 --> 04:47:25.274
YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL OF ALL THE
ASSETS IN A DIGITAL FORM YOU CAN

04:47:25.961 --> 04:47:28.594
MANIPULATE.
THEN IN MY INTRO, I WROTE THIS

04:47:28.824 --> 04:47:33.997
THING A COUPLE YEARS AGO CALLED
WHAT IS CODE FOR BLOOMBERG

04:47:33.998 --> 04:47:36.378
BUSINESS WEEK.
AND SAID HERE, TAKE THE WHOLE

04:47:36.431 --> 04:47:39.567
ISSUE OF THE MAGAZINE.
I WROTE ABOUT CODE.

04:47:39.783 --> 04:47:42.919
AND IT WAS TERRIFYING.
THEY WERE LITERALLY LIKE, WE'RE

04:47:43.394 --> 04:47:45.206
GOING TO GIVE YOU THE WHOLE
ISSUE.

04:47:45.207 --> 04:47:48.310
AND THEY JUST HID UNDER A
BLANKET, AND I MOONED.

04:47:48.541 --> 04:47:50.496
I KNEW EVERYONE WAS GOING TO
YELL AT ME.

04:47:50.497 --> 04:47:53.784
THERE'S NO WAY YOU DON'T DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND

04:47:53.785 --> 04:47:55.592
PROGRAMMERS DON'T COME AND
SCREAM AT YOU.

04:47:55.593 --> 04:47:57.947
WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND WE TALK
ABOUT ME, THE WRITER.

04:47:58.042 --> 04:48:01.475
I DID IT.
A HUNDRED PEOPLE WORKED ON

04:48:01.476 --> 04:48:03.340
THIS.
AT LEAST AND EVEN MORE Z I WANT

04:48:03.341 --> 04:48:10.343
TO COME BACK TO THIS POINT.
BUT THERE WAS AUGITE HUB

04:48:10.344 --> 04:48:12.344
REPOSITORY.
AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED, PEOPLE

04:48:12.693 --> 04:48:15.459
CONTINUED TO CORRECT T. SO
PROBABLY 200 PEOPLE HAD THEIR

04:48:15.713 --> 04:48:18.434
HANDS ON THIS THING.
SOME OF THEIR WORK IS TRACKED

04:48:18.887 --> 04:48:21.030
TRACKED AND SOME OF IT
ESTIMATE.

04:48:21.351 --> 04:48:25.577
WHAT WE DO ULTIMATE CULT ARALLY,
OH, PAUL FORD WROTE THIS THING.

04:48:26.583 --> 04:48:31.511
MY EGO IS CONSTANTLY GRATIFIED,
BY GRATIFIED BASED ON LIES.

04:48:31.727 --> 04:48:34.948
BUT I LIVE WITH IT AND I DO

04:48:40.004 --> 04:48:42.004
OKAY.

04:48:50.912 --> 04:48:54.984
LASTLESS STAGE IN MY LIFE, I
DECIDED I WOULD PAY A -- WE'RE

04:48:56.187 --> 04:48:57.706
BUILDING, JUST DIGITAL
PRODUCTS.

04:48:57.707 --> 04:49:01.940
WE BUILD APPS  AND WEBSITES  IN
NEW YORK CITY, AND THIS IS T.

04:49:02.154 --> 04:49:05.840
DONE WITH ARCHIVES FOR A WHILE.
DONE WITH A CULTURAL SECTION.GO 

04:49:05.841 --> 04:49:08.193
WORK FOR BANKS BUT THEY FIND
YOU.

04:49:08.509 --> 04:49:13.972
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY.
I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT HALF THE

04:49:14.419 --> 04:49:16.419
WORK.
BUT A BIG NGOCAME.

04:49:16.432 --> 04:49:19.278
I'M LIKE ON THE PHONE FOR AN
HOUR AND A HALF, TALKING ABOUT

04:49:19.901 --> 04:49:22.347
NARA AND THAT AREA LOVES
CONFERENCE CALLS.

04:49:22.415 --> 04:49:25.649
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER
HAD THAT EXPERIENCE.

04:49:27.352 --> 04:49:28.598
BUT.
SO A LOT OF CONFERENCE CALLS.

04:49:28.599 --> 04:49:34.746
A LOT OF WHAT ASSET GOES HERE
AND ASSET GOES THERE.

04:49:35.080 --> 04:49:37.284
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.
YOU DEAL WITH ARCHIVES.

04:49:37.504 --> 04:49:42.717
WHAT I REALIZE IS THAT ALL OUR
SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ARE LEGACY

04:49:42.718 --> 04:49:45.136
PROBLEMS, AND ARCHIVE SAY NICE
WAY TO SAY LEGACY.

04:49:45.569 --> 04:49:49.138
THE CULTURAL SECTOR DEALING WITH
BIG ARCHIVE SYSTEM NOT THAT

04:49:49.139 --> 04:49:53.891
DIFFERENT FROM GOING TO SOME
COMPANY AND THEY HAVE, 5 5

04:49:53.892 --> 04:49:57.280
TERABYTES OF INFORMATION AND
USER RECORDS THAT THEY NEED TO

04:49:57.627 --> 04:49:59.653
MAKE SENSE

04:50:04.666 --> 04:50:12.082
 OF.A COUPLE MORE THINGS TO KNOW
ABOUT ME.

04:50:12.318 --> 04:50:16.910
I LOVE TIME LINES.
TIMELINES ARE GREAT.

04:50:19.605 --> 04:50:21.605
BEAUTIFUL.
THAT ONE IS FROM THE "WASHINGTON

04:50:27.913 --> 04:50:29.913
POST."

04:50:40.764 --> 04:50:42.548
TIMELIPS ALWAYS SEEM LIKE A GOOD
IDEA.

04:50:42.549 --> 04:50:47.025
I BUILT A BUNCH, AND THEY NEVER
ACTUALLY SOLVE A PROBLEM AND

04:50:47.026 --> 04:50:50.177
THEY LOOK COOL.
SOMETIMES THEY KIND OF D. IT

04:50:50.178 --> 04:50:52.289
HURT.
I WANT TO BELIEVE IN TIME LINE

04:50:52.305 --> 04:50:54.939
SO BAD.
BUT I

04:50:58.204 --> 04:50:59.986
 CAN'T.
THIS IS KIND OF THE CONFESSION

04:50:59.987 --> 04:51:02.136
PART.
I WANT TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU.

04:51:02.183 --> 04:51:04.616
WHY WOULD A GUY WHO HAS WHO HAS
A SOFTWARE COMPANY, AS A WRITER,

04:51:05.403 --> 04:51:08.847
GO AND BUILD SOFTWARE.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO WRITE

04:51:13.858 --> 04:51:16.900
SOMETHING.
EXPERIMENTAL WEBSITES.

04:51:17.363 --> 04:51:21.316
LEARN TWO COMPUTER LANGUAGES.
A LOT OF COFFEE

04:51:26.208 --> 04:51:28.618
 STUFF.
I WROTE SOFT BOARD.

04:51:28.853 --> 04:51:31.427
I WROTE THAT BUSINESS WEEK
PIECE.

04:51:31.447 --> 04:51:32.864
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FROM THE
BOOK.

04:51:32.865 --> 04:51:37.428
BUT I DID THAT INSTEAD.
A LOT OF MEDIUM POSTS,

04:51:37.429 --> 04:51:39.602
COCOFOUNDED A COMPANY.
I ABANDONED THIS BOOK WRITING.

04:51:39.834 --> 04:51:41.333
WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WRITE A
BOOK.

04:51:41.334 --> 04:51:44.946
YOU WRITE A CMS TO MANAGE THE

04:51:49.980 --> 04:51:51.980
BOOK.

04:52:11.959 --> 04:52:13.959
--.CMS, AND THEN WRITE THE
BOOK?

04:52:14.242 --> 04:52:16.314
SO IT TURNS OUT, I REMAINED

04:52:20.148 --> 04:52:21.916
BLOCKED.
AND I'M STILL BLOCKED.

04:52:21.917 --> 04:52:23.628
I'M STILL KIND OF WORKING
THROUGH THAT.

04:52:23.629 --> 04:52:26.447
THERE'S A THIRD THING THAT GOES
INTO THE SOFTWARE DEMO.

04:52:26.654 --> 04:52:28.807
THE MEDIA IS HAVING A HARD
TIME.

04:52:28.875 --> 04:52:30.875
NOBODY TRUST

04:52:34.888 --> 04:52:36.691
 ITS.
ONLY 20% OF THE TRUST IT A LOT.

04:52:36.806 --> 04:52:39.237
AND I MEAN, YOU SAW RACHEL HERE
EARLIER.

04:52:39.672 --> 04:52:41.681
SHE'S GETTING A LOT OF
STATISTICS ALL LINE UP AND

04:52:41.682 --> 04:52:45.211
WORKING WITH JOURNALISTS TO, TRY
AND GET THINGS AS FACTUAL AS

04:52:45.212 --> 04:52:47.998
POSSIBLE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES.
 THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THAT

04:52:47.999 --> 04:52:50.750
FIELD ARE VERY DISCIPLINED AND
SERIOUS AND IT SUCKS THAT THE

04:52:51.184 --> 04:52:53.818
WORLD DOESN'T TRUST THEM.
IT'S SAD AND IT'S TOUGH AND BAD

04:52:54.505 --> 04:52:59.382
MARKETING, AND IT'S BAD POLITICS
AND IT'S A SITUATION.

04:53:00.181 --> 04:53:08.700
AND ALSO, SORRY TO GO BACK TO
THE TIMES, BUT EDITORS  AND

04:53:08.701 --> 04:53:12.316
COPYRIGHTERS AND FACT CHECKERS
ARE GETTING LAID OFF

04:53:12.317 --> 04:53:13.734
EVERYWHERE.
THERE'S JUST LESS AND LESS MONEY

04:53:13.735 --> 04:53:16.135
FOR THEM.
LESS AND LESS MONEY FOR CONTENT

04:53:16.538 --> 04:53:17.649
PRODUCTION.
AND SO THEY'RE GOING.

04:53:17.650 --> 04:53:21.959
AND THEN THERE'S A HUGE
DISCUSSION AROUND FAKE NEWS AND

04:53:22.055 --> 04:53:25.228
I'M NOT GOING TO RECAPITULATE.
YOU'RE ALL LIVING IT.

04:53:25.479 --> 04:53:29.551
BUT THERE'S A SENSE OF NEWS
BEING ARBITRARY AND JOURNALISM

04:53:31.707 --> 04:53:33.707
BEING

04:53:34.963 --> 04:53:37.251
 ARBITRARY.
WRITERS IN MY OPINION ARE

04:53:37.252 --> 04:53:39.908
LEARNING LESS AND LESS GOOD
PRACTICE BECAUSE THEY HAVE FEWER

04:53:40.394 --> 04:53:42.897
AND FEWER PEOPLE TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THEM.

04:53:43.597 --> 04:53:46.708
SO MY SOLUTION TO THIS WAS TO
BUILD A TIME

04:53:51.709 --> 04:53:53.709
 LINE

04:54:01.930 --> 04:54:03.930
 AND YOU CAN
CLICK ON THE DATE AND ZOOM OUT

04:54:04.002 --> 04:54:08.884
AND SEE DIFFERENT CONTEXT, AND
THIS IS ALL POWERED BY AN API.

04:54:09.070 --> 04:54:11.329
NICE JOB ON THE FRONT END.
I KNEW I WAS DOING THIS, THAT

04:54:11.444 --> 04:54:15.877
TIME LINES AREN'T THE ANSWER BUT
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.  THESE

04:54:16.106 --> 04:54:19.151
ARE EVENTS  FROM WIKIPEDIA,
EVENTS FROM ALL OVER AND ALL

04:54:19.152 --> 04:54:25.880
KINDS OF DIFFERENT SOURCES.
AND SO I'VE GONE OUT TO THE

04:54:25.881 --> 04:54:31.317
1800'S, AND THEN, UNDERNEATH ALL
THAT, WHAT YOU CAN DO IS JUST

04:54:31.553 --> 04:54:34.637
SORT OF BOOK MARK THE EVENTS.
THEY GO INTO THIS PILE OF STUFF

04:54:34.638 --> 04:54:37.956
ON THE RIGHT AND THEN YOU ADD
NOTES TO THE BOOK MARKS AND THAT

04:54:38.511 --> 04:54:41.595
TURNS INTO AN ESSAY.
SO WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THAT IS

04:54:41.596 --> 04:54:49.424
YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR SOURCES
CONNECTED AND CAN YOU REA RANGE

04:54:49.456 --> 04:54:51.995
THESE LITTLE BLOCKS OF TEXT.
LOOK LIKE IT MIGHT BE EASY.

04:54:52.531 --> 04:54:55.743
IT'S KIND OF A GREAT WAY TO
WATCH F YOU ARE LIKE ME AND

04:54:55.744 --> 04:54:59.145
YOU'RE GETTING OLDER AND YOU
DON'T TRUST YOUR MEMORY AS MUCH

04:54:59.153 --> 04:55:03.300
AND YOU CAN'T COUNT ON FACT
CHECKERS IN THE WAY IT USED

04:55:08.318 --> 04:55:10.318
 TO

04:55:14.474 --> 04:55:18.183
WE BUILT CMS'S IN MY COUNTRY.
I BUILT MORE THAN I WOULD LIKE

04:55:20.324 --> 04:55:23.431
TO ADMIT IN MY LIFE.
YOU GIVE PEOPLE A TEXT BOX AND

04:55:23.763 --> 04:55:29.036
THEN YOU MOVE O. I FEEL THE TEXT
BOXES NEED TO DO MORE

04:55:34.054 --> 04:55:36.054
 WORK.

04:55:44.269 --> 04:55:47.568
MADE A TIME LINE, LOOKED AROUND,
READ SOME RACCOON ARTICLES AND

04:55:47.900 --> 04:55:54.283
THEN STARTED TO WRITE
FACTUALLY-BASED, FUNNY RACCOON

04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:57.684
PROSE.
THAT PIECE EXISTS.

04:55:57.685 --> 04:56:00.247
I BUILT MY SYSTEM AND WANTED TO
TEST IT OUT.

04:56:00.362 --> 04:56:06.746
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
THERE'S SOME CONTINUITY THERE.

04:56:06.982 --> 04:56:09.457
HERE'S WHAT I HAVE REALLY
LEARNED FROM BUILDING THAT AND

04:56:09.678 --> 04:56:13.559
DOING THAT.
I WANT TO GET TO A TERBYTE OF

04:56:13.585 --> 04:56:17.549
META DATA PROBABLY 50, 100
MEGABYTES.

04:56:17.783 --> 04:56:19.783
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE IF YOU COUNT
IMAGES.

04:56:19.836 --> 04:56:23.866
AND I WANT TO GET AS MUCH
CULTURAL INFORMATION IN EVENTS

04:56:24.449 --> 04:56:28.176
AS I POSSIBLY K OVER THE NEXT
YEAR OR SO.

04:56:28.786 --> 04:56:31.004
IT'S A PERSONALIZED SIZE
PROJECT.

04:56:31.205 --> 04:56:34.396
I'M USING IT TO WRITE.
IT HAS REALLY UNBLOCKED ME ON

04:56:36.056 --> 04:56:39.129
THE BOOK.
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT

04:56:39.130 --> 04:56:45.046
THERE'S A GREAT QUOTE THAT SAID,
WRITER'S BLOCK IS RELATED TO THE

04:56:45.615 --> 04:56:48.147
WRITER'S SENSE OF THEIR UNGRADE
LENS.

04:56:48.335 --> 04:56:54.055
IT KEEPS YOU FROM FEELING LIKE A
FRAUD YOU'RE LIKE.

04:56:54.077 --> 04:56:57.964
ALL RIGHT.
I WROTE AN EVENT, AND A NOTE AND

04:56:58.284 --> 04:57:01.578
ANOTHER NOTE.  AND YOU'RE
WRITING KNOW ESSAY, AND THAT IS

04:57:02.295 --> 04:57:04.899
WEYMOUTH TO TAKE WATT BLOCK WHEN
YOU HAVE A PILE OF BOOKS  ON ONE

04:57:05.985 --> 04:57:07.601
SIDE, AND A BLANK SCREEN ON THE
OTHER.

04:57:07.602 --> 04:57:12.188
THIS IS WHAT THE WORLD LOOKS
LIKE A LITTLE BIT AROUND

04:57:12.189 --> 04:57:14.189
CULTURAL ARCHIVES THAT ARE
OPEN.

04:57:14.481 --> 04:57:18.166
I WON'T EVEN EBBING PLAIN THIS
CHART BECAUSE YOU ALL LIVE IT --

04:57:18.583 --> 04:57:23.036
I WON'T EVEN EXPLAIN THIS CHART,
BECAUSE YOU ALL LIVE IT.

04:57:23.242 --> 04:57:29.130
I LOVE UTFA DATA I DON'T LOVE
WEB SERVICES BUT I'M MIX BOD

04:57:29.131 --> 04:57:32.118
METS.
BUT LIKE, THIS IS HOW STUFF

04:57:32.119 --> 04:57:36.699
COMES OUT.
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET TODAY.

04:57:37.068 --> 04:57:40.952
AND IT'S REALLY HARD DOOR.
ALL OF IT, AND I'VE WORKED  WITH

04:57:41.290 --> 04:57:43.290
TALL.
AND I'M GOOD WITH WORKING WITH

04:57:43.315 --> 04:57:48.599
AWFUL T. I'M LIKE 20 YEARS IN.
I PHOTOCOPIED THE SGI

04:57:48.600 --> 04:57:51.607
ISOSTANDARD AFTER GET TOGETHER
THROUGH INTERLIBRARY, ALL 900

04:57:52.990 --> 04:57:55.841
PAGES, BECAUSE I SAW IT AS
WONDERFUL, SECRET LORE WHEN I

04:57:56.079 --> 04:57:59.026
WAS 20 YEARS OLD.
TADOESN'T LEAVE THE ROOM.

04:58:01.001 --> 04:58:03.001
[LAUGHTER]

04:58:04.114 --> 04:58:08.205
BUT I MEAN, I LOVE THIS STUFF.
BUT IT'S ALSO JUST KIND OF

04:58:08.206 --> 04:58:10.370
INCREASINGLY HARD.
IT'S INTRACT BELIEFABLE TO WORK

04:58:10.617 --> 04:58:13.310
WITH WHEN YOU'RE REALLY TRYING
TO EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND A DATA

04:58:13.519 --> 04:58:17.648
SET OR IMPORTANT IT IN BULK INTO
ANOTHER

04:58:22.694 --> 04:58:27.175
 VIEW ACTUALLY, KIND OF
HARD BECAUSE IT'S ZILLIONS OF

04:58:27.856 --> 04:58:30.453
FILES.
YOU HAVE TO IMPORT IT

04:58:30.454 --> 04:58:34.931
SOMEWHERE.
AND SEARCH THROUGH IT.

04:58:35.564 --> 04:58:38.178
HARD TO WORK W. DOESN'T DIRECTLY
LINK TO IMAGES.

04:58:38.383 --> 04:58:40.383
IT

04:58:42.364 --> 04:58:44.364
 HAS AN INTERSTITIAL

04:58:47.465 --> 04:58:49.465
 I.D.

04:58:53.071 --> 04:58:55.680
 THEN
AM I SPIDERRING EVERY WEB PAGE

04:58:55.696 --> 04:58:58.756
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE IMAGE S.
ALL OF THAT COMES UP BECAUSE THE

04:59:00.234 --> 04:59:01.548
CSE DOESN'T INCLUDE MASTER
BELLATOR MMAS.

04:59:01.549 --> 04:59:04.011
THIS IS ME, BY THE WAY,
CRITICIZING THE COMMENTS.

04:59:04.594 --> 04:59:08.181
SAYING THANKS  FOR ALL THE
INCREDIBLE THINGS YOU'VE GIVEN

04:59:08.490 --> 04:59:13.197
TO ME FOR FREE.
LET ME TELL YOU WHY I HATE IT.

04:59:14.166 --> 04:59:17.258
THIS APIIS AGAIN, WONDERFUL AND

04:59:22.350 --> 04:59:26.535
TERRIBLE.
THIS THING IS HORRIBLE.

04:59:27.440 --> 04:59:33.112
THIS, WHEN YOU GET INTO THE XML
ON THIS BAD BOY, IT IS AN

04:59:33.113 --> 04:59:35.881
ENDLESS BAD BOY OF

04:59:40.916 --> 04:59:50.323
 PAIN.25MILLION MARK

04:59:51.225 --> 04:59:53.372
 RECORDS.
THANKS AND

04:59:56.443 --> 04:59:58.443
 THANKS I GOT PIE
MARK.

04:59:58.869 --> 05:00:01.011
STARTED FOOLING AROUND, BUT
THEY'RE HARD TO WORK WITH.

05:00:01.026 --> 05:00:04.565
THEY WERE FROM A SPECIFIC

05:00:09.582 --> 05:00:13.664
 WORLD.
I'M GOING TO SPIDER THE WHOLE

05:00:13.695 --> 05:00:16.996
DAMN THING, AND KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT'S IN THERE.

05:00:17.418 --> 05:00:20.886
AND THERE'S NO SIMPLE WAY TO DO
THAT, ASIDE FROM WRITATION WEB

05:00:21.348 --> 05:00:26.863
SPIEDER AND SORT OF MAP TOGETHER
TO MY SCHEMA.

05:00:26.894 --> 05:00:30.608
I THINK THERE'S THIS ARCHIVE
GOING ON WITH ACCESS, WITH HOW

05:00:30.724 --> 05:00:33.913
THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING  AND I
THINK WE HAVE CUT THINGS UP.

05:00:34.035 --> 05:00:41.334
RIGHT NOW, I THINK THE CONSENSUS
IS A GREAT API.

05:00:41.538 --> 05:00:51.445
BUT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING, OUR DATABASES.

05:00:51.465 --> 05:00:53.722
THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE
UNIVERSE.

05:00:53.738 --> 05:00:59.308
THIS IS HOW PEOPLE STORE AND
RETRIEVE AND THIS LITTLE GUY,

05:01:00.498 --> 05:01:03.496
SQL LIGHT IS ENTIRELY PUBLIC
DOMAIN, IT'S ON ALL OF YOUR

05:01:03.497 --> 05:01:07.152
PHONES.  IT'S ON ANDROID, ON
IOS.

05:01:07.357 --> 05:01:10.219
IT'S BUILT IN EVERYWHERE.
IT AM CONSIST AS PART OF

05:01:10.220 --> 05:01:13.848
PYTHON.
IT IS 150K SQL DATABASE THAT

05:01:13.849 --> 05:01:18.725
RUNS THE WORLD, AND IT'S SO
POWERFUL AND UNASSUMING THAT

05:01:18.726 --> 05:01:20.976
NOBODY REALLY TALKS ABOUT

05:01:25.402 --> 05:01:29.549
 IT BUT
IF YOU COULD START PULLING YOUR

05:01:29.765 --> 05:01:35.004
LIFE INTO SQL DATABASES, I COULD
DOWNLOAD THEM AND SEARCH IT AND

05:01:35.005 --> 05:01:37.526
EXPLORE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT
IT ANYWHERE, WITHIN LIKE, FIVE

05:01:37.988 --> 05:01:40.206
SECONDS.
I CAN START HACKING  AND MESSING

05:01:42.124 --> 05:01:44.540
WITH PUBLIC CORP RAIN THE TIME
IT TOOK TO DOWNLOAD.  ONCE YOU

05:01:44.656 --> 05:01:47.612
GET IN AND YOU TYPE SQL LIGHT
DATABASE.

05:01:47.835 --> 05:01:51.291
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.
CAN YOU TURN ON FULL TEXT

05:01:51.292 --> 05:01:53.292
SEARCH.
PUBLIC DOMAIN.

05:01:53.664 --> 05:01:58.144
IT'S ALL UTF16 BY DEFAULT.
IT ACTUALLY HITS ALL THE SWEET

05:01:58.561 --> 05:02:01.021
SPOTS THAT WE TALK ABOUT.
IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THEM IN

05:02:01.333 --> 05:02:03.681
THE WAY THAT WE USUALLY TALK
ABOUT THEM.

05:02:03.919 --> 05:02:10.029
ALSO F YOU CAN MAKE THEM
TURNABLE, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.I 

05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:13.484
KNOW THAT MAY BE HARD FOR A
LARGE, CULTURAL ORGANIZATION.YOU

05:02:13.709 --> 05:02:18.331
 CAN TAKE YOUR SQ SPADES
LIGHT FILE AND I'M NOT I SAG GET

05:02:18.332 --> 05:02:21.308
RID OF YOUR API.
I'M JUST SAYING, DOING THIS

05:02:21.309 --> 05:02:26.081
OTHER THING, TOO OR SUGGEST
SOMEONE TO GO AND DO IT FOR

05:02:26.082 --> 05:02:27.599
YOU.
IF YOU POINT TO THE THING, AND

05:02:27.600 --> 05:02:31.135
SAY, HEY, WE DIDN'T DO THIS.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TORRENT

05:02:31.136 --> 05:02:34.155
EVERYTHING AS A SQL LIGHT
DATABASE.

05:02:34.386 --> 05:02:38.675
GO IT'S OVER HERE.
A LITTLE BIT INSTITUTIONAL AND

05:02:39.361 --> 05:02:41.807
PREMATURE TO SAY, THAT IS AT
LEAST SEMI OFFICIAL, A REALLY,

05:02:42.463 --> 05:02:47.768
REALLY POWERFUL SIGNAL.
LIKE WIKIPEDIA, THERE'S

05:02:47.769 --> 05:02:49.691
8 MILLION EXTRACTING DATA FROM
WINSTAR WORLD CASINO PEED

05:02:49.692 --> 05:02:54.446
PEAKEDDIA PROJECTS.
NONE OFEM THEM ARE PARTICULARLY

05:02:59.466 --> 05:03:03.026
BLESSED.
IF I CAN CLICK, DOWNLOAD THE

05:03:03.027 --> 05:03:08.887
TORENT, I WON'T START MESSING
WITH AND INCORPORATING YOUR

05:03:08.888 --> 05:03:12.113
CORPORATE INTO MY HISTORICAL
WRITING TOOL WITHIN HOURS  AND I

05:03:12.329 --> 05:03:16.616
WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF THOSE BOXES, HAS A CLEAR

05:03:16.617 --> 05:03:19.175
LINK BACK TO A CREDITTATION BACK
TO YOUR ORGANIZATION.

05:03:19.276 --> 05:03:27.796
I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO DO THAT IF
YOU GIVE ME AN API OR CSV,

05:03:27.797 --> 05:03:31.916
YOU'VE ADD SOMETIMES MONS OF
WORK THAT THAT PROCESS.

05:03:32.132 --> 05:03:34.039
SUPPLEMENT.
I'M NOT ASKING PEOPLE TO REPLACE

05:03:34.040 --> 05:03:38.590
WHAT THEY ARE WITH THIS FORMAT.
BUT SOME SORT OF COMMON FORMAT I

05:03:38.967 --> 05:03:41.881
CAN IMMEDIATELY START TO
MANIPULATE WOULD BE FANTASTIC.

05:03:42.233 --> 05:03:46.384
EVEN PUT IT INTO SQL LIGHT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO THROW WATT

05:03:46.385 --> 05:03:48.385
PAST.
I KNOW THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO

05:03:49.299 --> 05:03:51.299
CULTURALLY TO THROW AWAY OLD
RECORDS.

05:03:51.567 --> 05:03:55.040
JUST LEAVE THEM THERE.
ASSUME STORAGE IS FREE.

05:03:55.352 --> 05:03:59.145
I HAVE A 10 TERABYTE DRIVE.
I SPENT LIKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS

05:03:59.362 --> 05:04:03.143
ON A REALLY, REALLY POWERFUL
MACHINE AND I HAVE VERY FAST

05:04:03.144 --> 05:04:05.144
INTERNET AND THAT'S JUST ME AT

05:04:07.097 --> 05:04:09.097
HOME IN

05:04:11.425 --> 05:04:13.920
 BROOKLYN.
REQUEST GOING YOU CAN DO TO BE

05:04:13.936 --> 05:04:17.123
VISUAL WITH YOUR CORPORA IT'S
EASIER FOR ME TO HACK WITH

05:04:17.124 --> 05:04:19.157
EXPLORER AND PUT THEM INTO OTHER
CONTEXT.

05:04:19.427 --> 05:04:22.359
IT'S SUCH A POWERFUL

05:04:27.410 --> 05:04:34.585
 SIGNAL.GOOD JOB.
I KNOW IT CAN CULTURALLY BE HARD

05:04:34.809 --> 05:04:38.264
TO PUT THINGS WITH YOUR

05:04:41.364 --> 05:04:43.039
 DATA
GOING BACK TO WHERE WE WERE, I

05:04:43.040 --> 05:04:45.840
THINK THERE ARE TWO MAIN
FALLACIES FOR THE ARCHIVES.

05:04:47.055 --> 05:04:49.055
PUBLISHERS BELIEVE THERE IS FREE
CONTENT, AND YOU CAN USE THEM

05:04:49.278 --> 05:04:54.195
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND FIND
VALUE IN THE PAST THAT CAN BE

05:04:56.698 --> 05:04:58.698
EASILY

05:05:01.729 --> 05:05:06.478
 EXPOSED.
AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF LABOR

05:05:06.510 --> 05:05:10.640
TO GET VALUE AND MINING AND NEWS
OUT OF OUR ARCHIVES.

05:05:11.090 --> 05:05:13.583
I TRY TO CORRECT THE PUBLISHERS
ON THIS.

05:05:13.792 --> 05:05:18.868
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD AN ARCHIVE
OF OUR WONDERFUL PUBLICATION.LET

05:05:18.890 --> 05:05:22.086
 ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT WILL
TAKE.  AND 10 MINUTES LATER.

05:05:22.322 --> 05:05:25.150
THEY ASK ME TO LEAVE THE ROOM.
THE NEWS IS AN ARCHIVE WAITING

05:05:25.367 --> 05:05:28.354
TO HAPPEN.
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT

05:05:28.879 --> 05:05:32.496
ARE GOING ON AROUND HOW MEDIA IS

05:05:37.580 --> 05:05:39.580
PRODUCED

05:05:46.884 --> 05:05:50.952
 SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.
AND NOW, I'M PROCRASTINATEOG

05:05:50.953 --> 05:05:54.855
THAT, TOO.
BUT I AM USING THE TOOL.

05:05:55.086 --> 05:05:57.270
I'M GOING TO TRY TO OPEN IT
REALLY SOON.

05:05:57.474 --> 05:06:00.395
I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT
API SECURITY.

05:06:00.964 --> 05:06:04.920
PRETTY SOON, I'LL HAVE PROBABLY
A COUPLE MILLION EVENTS ON

05:06:04.921 --> 05:06:07.179
THIS.
SO I THINK THERE'S AN

05:06:07.180 --> 05:06:08.314
OPPORTUNITY FOR THINGS LIKE
THIS.

05:06:08.315 --> 05:06:12.899
THIS IS JUST A HYPOTHESIS.
THIS IS NOT A [INDISCERNIBLE] ON

05:06:13.146 --> 05:06:15.195
THIS PRODUCT.
THIS IS SOMETHING I REALLY

05:06:15.196 --> 05:06:19.044
WANTED TO SEE IN THE WORLD AND I
WANTED TO RESOLVE MY OWN

05:06:19.045 --> 05:06:22.899
ANXIETIES ABOUT FACTS  AND SORT
OF WHAT ARCHIVES CAN

05:06:27.913 --> 05:06:29.913
 DO

05:06:34.359 --> 05:06:36.707
 I CAN
USE THE HELP IN

05:06:39.828 --> 05:06:41.828
 EASILY
IMPORTABLE

05:06:44.854 --> 05:06:46.854
 DATA

05:06:54.495 --> 05:06:56.367
 SO THAT'S THAT.
IPHONE, IPADD  TO SHOW YOU

05:06:56.368 --> 05:06:58.977
THAT.
AND THANK YOU ALL VERY

05:07:03.982 --> 05:07:09.770
 MUCH.
NEXT, WE HAVE NICK ADAMS, A

05:07:09.771 --> 05:07:12.558
SOCIOLOGIST AND RESEARCH FELLOW
AT THE BERKELEY INSTITUTE FOR

05:07:13.327 --> 05:07:15.564
DATA SCIENCE.
HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW

05:07:15.565 --> 05:07:18.621
SOCIAL SCIENTISTS USE THE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD AS A DATA

05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:21.502
SOURCE.
WELCOME,

05:07:27.604 --> 05:07:29.595
 NICK.
HELLO.

05:07:29.596 --> 05:07:31.763
HELL O. LET ME PULL UP MY SLIDE
HERE.

05:07:31.783 --> 05:07:35.161
THIS IS SOMEONE ELSE'S LAP TOP
AND IT'S HIDDEN HERE.

05:07:37.425 --> 05:07:39.425
IT'S ON THE

05:07:42.512 --> 05:07:44.512
 BOOM.

05:08:10.094 --> 05:08:15.101
I'M GOING TO WALK ON STAGE, I'M
GOING TO WALK BACK ON STAGE.

05:08:15.625 --> 05:08:17.625
HELLO.
HELLO.

05:08:18.480 --> 05:08:20.598
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
ARCHIVISTS.

05:08:21.365 --> 05:08:23.841
LIBRARIANS, JOURNALISTS, DATA
NERDS.

05:08:24.063 --> 05:08:26.997
FELLOW SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND
DIGITAL HUMANS, I'M VERY HONORED

05:08:27.044 --> 05:08:29.153
TO BE HERE TODAY.
THIS IS REALLY EXCITING FOR ME,

05:08:29.939 --> 05:08:32.126
KIND OF A MECCA FOR SOMEONE LIKE
ME.

05:08:32.257 --> 05:08:35.360
I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH A
LOT OF TEXTUAL DATA AND TO BE

05:08:35.361 --> 05:08:41.287
ABLE TO SPEAK HERE IS TRULY AN
HONOR.

05:08:41.493 --> 05:08:45.668
FOR MANY OF US, ARCHIVES EVOKE
IMAGES OF OLD LEATHER BOND

05:08:48.992 --> 05:08:53.171
BOOKS, SWEET ODORS OF OXIDIZING
PULL M AND THEY AROUSE THE

05:08:53.172 --> 05:08:55.983
EXCITEMENT OF DISCOVERING SOME
LONG LOST HISTORY AS IF IT WERE

05:08:56.083 --> 05:08:59.407
A BURIED TREASURE.
MY PARTICULAR EXCITEMENT OF

05:08:59.408 --> 05:09:02.877
ARCHIVE SYSTEM A BIT DIFFERENT. 
LIKE ALL MY FELLOW SCHOLARS, I

05:09:02.914 --> 05:09:06.662
SWOON AT THE THOUGHT OF
UNCOVERING OLD WORLDS, AND

05:09:06.663 --> 05:09:09.648
NEWSPAPERS, POLICY TRACKS,
MEETING MINUTES, CONTRACTS OR

05:09:09.864 --> 05:09:12.166
EVEN RECEIPTS.
THESE ARE THE SORT OF DOCUMENT

05:09:12.167 --> 05:09:16.099
THAT IS MOST PEOPLE THROW AWAY
WITH THE RECYCLING.  WE REALLY

05:09:16.127 --> 05:09:19.209
CHERISH THESE DATA AT UNSPOILED
RECORDS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

05:09:19.325 --> 05:09:24.922
THEY TELL THE STORIES OF WHO WE
WERE ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY,

05:09:25.017 --> 05:09:28.906
SOCIALLY AND CULTURALLY.
I WANT TO FIRST SAY THANK YOU TO

05:09:28.907 --> 05:09:32.193
ALL THE LIBRARIANS AND
ARCHIVISTS WHEN, MAKE THIS DATA

05:09:32.655 --> 05:09:34.655
AVAILABLE.
WHICH REALLY ALLOWSES  TO DO OUR

05:09:34.736 --> 05:09:36.102
WORK.
WE COMPLETELY DEPEND OURAR

05:09:36.103 --> 05:09:38.457
TEARIO.
SO IN A WAY THAT I CAN'T BECAUSE

05:09:38.673 --> 05:09:42.735
I ONLY HAVE TWO HANDS, CAN YOU
HELP ME GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

05:09:42.736 --> 05:09:45.275
TO THE PEOPLE THAT HELP MAKE
THIS HAPPEN.

05:09:46.815 --> 05:09:47.083
[APPLAUSE].
A LITTLE LOUDER.

05:09:47.084 --> 05:09:48.641
OH.
NO.

05:09:48.642 --> 05:09:52.650
OKAY.
MAYBE I SHOULD END

05:09:57.661 --> 05:10:03.126
 THERE.
MY LOVE FOR ARCHIVE SYSTEM A BIT

05:10:04.114 --> 05:10:05.863
DIFFICULT.
ARCHIVES CAN BE POWERFUL THAN

05:10:05.864 --> 05:10:08.969
MOST OF MY SCHOLARS HAVE MET
IMAGINED AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU

05:10:08.970 --> 05:10:13.208
TO THE EXTENT I CAN WANT WE CAN
BRING ABOUT A FUTURE WHERE

05:10:13.209 --> 05:10:16.201
ARCHIVES ARE USED MUCH MORE
OFTEN, AND RESPONSIVELY, TO GIVE

05:10:16.555 --> 05:10:20.751
US A MUCH DEEPER UNDERSTANDING
OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

05:10:21.037 --> 05:10:25.307
RIGHT NOW, SOCIAL SCIENTISTS 
AND DIGITAL -- ARE AT THE

05:10:25.308 --> 05:10:30.461
BEGINNING OF THE IDEA OF A
DECADE-LONG PROCESS, WE'RE

05:10:30.462 --> 05:10:33.361
LEARNING  TO READ, RIGHT
ALONGSIDE COMPUTERS.

05:10:33.592 --> 05:10:36.436
WE'RE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND
AND TRUST HOW THEY CAN READ

05:10:36.437 --> 05:10:41.268
DIFFERENTLY AND MUCH FASTER THAN
WE CAN AND FIND PATTERNS AND

05:10:41.269 --> 05:10:45.519
METS THAT WE REALLY COULDN'T
FIND WITHOUT MONTHS OF CLOSE

05:10:45.520 --> 05:10:47.969
READING.
SO THERE'S A BURN OF NEW

05:10:47.970 --> 05:10:49.970
COMPUTATIONAL TEXT ANALYSIS
APPROACHES THAT PEOPLE USE.

05:10:50.489 --> 05:10:53.187
WE CAN PARSE SENTENCES BY
GRAMMAR.

05:10:53.489 --> 05:10:57.458
WE CAN FIND NAMED ENTITIES.
WE CAN MODEL TOPICS WHAT PEOPLE

05:10:57.575 --> 05:11:00.358
ARE TALKING ABOUT.
WE CAN MODEL NETWORKS OF

05:11:00.359 --> 05:11:01.641
INDIVIDUALS AND HOW THEY
RELATE.

05:11:01.642 --> 05:11:07.309
AND WE CAN EVEN DO REALLY
SEEMINGLY CLASSICAL,

05:11:07.310 --> 05:11:09.689
ETHNOGRAPHICS RESEARCH, LIKE
GROUNDED THEORY, WITH THE

05:11:09.690 --> 05:11:11.794
ASSISTANCE OF COMPUTERS.
THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN DO RIGHT

05:11:12.439 --> 05:11:15.321
NOW.
BUT THESE POWERFUL

05:11:19.495 --> 05:11:21.811
 TOURS -- MOST
OF US HERE ARE FAMILIAR WITH

05:11:21.812 --> 05:11:27.423
TRADITIONAL PRACTICES OF
ARCHIVING, THE PRESERVATION,

05:11:27.424 --> 05:11:28.902
ORGANIZATION, MAINTENANCE AND
THE CAREFUL CONTROL AND

05:11:28.903 --> 05:11:31.287
PROTECTION OF DOCUMENTS AND FROM
THE RESEARCHER'S STANDPOINT,

05:11:31.288 --> 05:11:38.396
WHEN WE WANT TO PULL AN ARCHIVE,
WE CAN PULL A LIBRARIAN AND LOOK

05:11:38.601 --> 05:11:41.558
AT THE DOCUMENTS, USUALLY, ONE
DOCUMENT AT A TIME.

05:11:41.611 --> 05:11:44.889
OFTEN WEARING GLOVES OR VIEWING
THROUGH SOME PANE OF GLASS.

05:11:45.106 --> 05:11:47.106
AND THESE ARCHIVES ARE REALLY
HELPFUL.

05:11:47.226 --> 05:11:50.440
THEY ALLOW US TO ASK SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS OF SPECIFIC COUNSELS,

05:11:50.861 --> 05:11:53.321
QUESTIONS LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN?

05:11:53.536 --> 05:11:55.536
DID HE OR SHE REALLY SAY OR DO
THAT?

05:11:56.258 --> 05:12:00.204
WHO PAID WHOM?
AND WHO VOTED WHICH WAY ON WHICH

05:12:01.308 --> 05:12:05.343
BILL BUT THESE QUESTIONS ARE A
FORENSIC STYLE OF RESEARCH WHERE

05:12:05.593 --> 05:12:10.989
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR
DATE ON A PARTICULAR DOCUMENT.

05:12:11.875 --> 05:12:15.227
NOW, WE HAVE ENTERED THIS AGE OF

05:12:18.582 --> 05:12:23.054
DIGITALIZATION.  NO ARCHIVIST OR
LIBRARIAN WOULD WANT ME TO THUMB

05:12:23.866 --> 05:12:27.025
THROUGH THEIR MOST AGED AND
CHERISHED RECORD.

05:12:28.063 --> 05:12:30.142
APPLYING AN ARRAY OF HIGHLIGHT
COLORS DIRECTLY TO THE

05:12:30.143 --> 05:12:32.399
COLLECTIONS.
I CAN HEAR SOME OF YOU, WINCING

05:12:32.414 --> 05:12:35.092
AT THE THOUGHT.
THAT SORT OF THING CAN EASILY BE

05:12:35.465 --> 05:12:39.657
DONE WITH DIGITAL RECORDS.
HOW IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE

05:12:39.658 --> 05:12:43.102
RESEARCH, AND HOW ARE WE GOING
TO ADAPT TO

05:12:48.119 --> 05:12:50.119
 THAT

05:12:52.579 --> 05:12:56.188
 THERE ARE
DIGITAL ARCHIVING PRODUCTS.

05:12:57.165 --> 05:12:58.819
CHRONICLING AMERICA IS ALLOWING
RICHERS  TO SKIM THROUGH

05:12:58.820 --> 05:13:02.331
THOUSANDS OF NEWSPAPERS, USING
DIGITAL APPROACHES.  IN THIS

05:13:02.332 --> 05:13:07.401
TALK SERIES, MATTHEW WEBERS,
WE'RE CAVES UNUNLEASHED PROGRAM

05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:11.323
WAS DISCUSSED.
IT'S GENERATING VALUABLE

05:13:11.324 --> 05:13:14.579
FINDINGS.
HACKING AWAY AT WELL-CURATED

05:13:14.580 --> 05:13:17.434
ARCHIVES.
THESE ARE NOT REALLY THE NORM.

05:13:18.264 --> 05:13:20.211
WHAT'S NORMAL IS QUITE A BIT
DINNER.

05:13:20.212 --> 05:13:26.551
AS ELIZABETH LURANG MENTIONED,
ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT

05:13:26.552 --> 05:13:29.751
CHALLENGE CHALLENGES, IN THEIR
USE OF DIGITAL COLLECTIONS WAS

05:13:31.455 --> 05:13:33.455
THE INABILITY TO SEARCH
COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE

05:13:35.634 --> 05:13:37.634
MATERIALS.
EXAMPLE.

05:13:37.697 --> 05:13:39.865
THE GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING
OFFICE, THE GTOWEBSITE HAS A LOT

05:13:40.096 --> 05:13:44.821
OF REALLY IMPRESSIVE HOLDINGS,
DESCRIBING THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR

05:13:46.120 --> 05:13:48.491
GOVERNMENT.  THE CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD HEARINGS AND THESE DATA

05:13:49.393 --> 05:13:53.502
ARE ESSENTIAL TO DEMOCRACY, AND
TO THE GPO'S MISSION OF KEEPING

05:13:53.549 --> 05:13:57.303
AMERICA INFORMED.
THEY'RE TOTALLY AVAILABLE TO THE

05:13:57.710 --> 05:14:01.120
PUBLIC, WHICH IS GREAT AND
THEY'RE EVEN DIGITIZED  IN AN

05:14:01.338 --> 05:14:04.759
IDEAL, KIND OF MACHINE READABLE

05:14:09.836 --> 05:14:14.591
FORMAT.
LET ME GIVE YOU A SENSE WHATEVER

05:14:14.607 --> 05:14:19.297
THAT LOOKS LIKE WANT HERE'S A
GGPOWEBSITE.

05:14:19.328 --> 05:14:22.749
IF I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW MY
CONGRESS PERSON IS DEALING WITH

05:14:22.952 --> 05:14:24.919
SCIENCE, I CAN GO TO A
PARTICULAR CONGRESS.

05:14:24.920 --> 05:14:30.737
I CAN GO TO THE HOUSE HEARINGS I
CAN LOOK FOR THE COMMITTEE ON

05:14:30.738 --> 05:14:36.180
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND THEN
I CAN READ THE TEXT OF EVERY

05:14:36.181 --> 05:14:40.221
LAST COMMITTEE HEARINGS, AND TRY
TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH WHAT MY

05:14:40.222 --> 05:14:45.876
CONGRESS PERSON WAS DOING.
SO WE SELECT A FILE.

05:14:46.194 --> 05:14:49.860
WE READ AN INTERVIEWER.
IN THIS CASE, A WEB BROWSER WANT

05:14:50.176 --> 05:14:53.360
WE VIEW IT WITHOUT TOUCH
TOGETHER, WITHOUT SCRIBBLING

05:14:53.361 --> 05:14:55.361
TO.
AND WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR NOTES

05:14:55.661 --> 05:14:58.134
FROM A SEPARATE DOCUMENT.
SO IF A LOT WAYS, EVEN THOUGH

05:14:58.368 --> 05:15:01.464
THIS TEXT IS FULLY DIGITAL,
WE'RE STILL WEARING THE GLOVES,

05:15:01.686 --> 05:15:06.839
AND LOOKING AT A DOCUMENT FROM
BEHIND A PANEOF GLASS.

05:15:07.276 --> 05:15:11.504
NOW, TO BE CLEAR, I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS IS A STATE OF

05:15:11.505 --> 05:15:15.375
AFFAIRS BECAUSE ACTIVISTS ARE
SOMEHOW, YOU KNOW, OVER

05:15:15.376 --> 05:15:18.049
PROTECTIVE OR UNINTERESTED OR
HONOREE.

05:15:18.284 --> 05:15:22.115
MAYBE SOME OF YOU ARE.
THIS IS A VERY WELL ORGANIZED

05:15:22.770 --> 05:15:25.257
SET OF LINK THAT IS MAKES
PERFECT SENSE FOR HUMAN LOOKING

05:15:25.474 --> 05:15:27.223
FOR INFORMATION ABOUT A
PARTICULAR HEARING.

05:15:27.224 --> 05:15:29.993
AND WE ORGANIZE OUR DIGITAL
RECORD THIS IS CHAMPIONS RISE IN

05:15:29.994 --> 05:15:32.801
A SITUATION THE SAME WAY WE
WOULD ORGANIZE OUR PHYSICAL

05:15:32.802 --> 05:15:36.398
RECORDS BECAUSE THESE SYSTEMS
ARE SO SENSIBLE FOR TRADITIONAL

05:15:36.399 --> 05:15:45.736
RESEARCH AND SO EXPEDIENT FOR
ARCHIVISTS' FUNDAMENTAL TASK FOR

05:15:46.954 --> 05:15:50.366
PRESERVATION IF WE DON'T WANT TO
CLICK AND CLICK AND CLICK AND

05:15:50.992 --> 05:15:55.306
DOWNLOAD EACH FILE.
WHAT DO SOCIAL SCIENTISTS

05:16:00.333 --> 05:16:05.585
 WANT?WE WANT DATA THAT ARE WELL
STRUCTURED.

05:16:05.693 --> 05:16:08.445
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.
AND I'LL HAVE A SLIDE IN A

05:16:08.446 --> 05:16:10.446
MOMENT THAT KIND OF LAYS THAT
OUT.

05:16:11.383 --> 05:16:12.970
LET ME OFFER YOU A SENSE, JUST
THROUGH SOME EXAMPLES.

05:16:12.971 --> 05:16:16.145
PERHAPS WE WANT TO SEE ALL THE
MATERIALS IN THE CONGRESSIONAL

05:16:16.230 --> 05:16:18.230
RECORD OR IT COULD BE FOR ANY
ARCHIVE.

05:16:18.417 --> 05:16:21.612
WE WANT TO SEE THE MATERIALS,
OCTODE BY MEN OR WOMEN,

05:16:26.000 --> 05:16:30.900
 AUTHORED
BY MEN OR -- DATE OF THE

05:16:30.901 --> 05:16:34.410
UTTERANCE.
WHO SAID IT WANT WHAT DISTRICT?

05:16:34.866 --> 05:16:37.577
EVEN ADJECTIVES THAT ARE
MARSHALLED TO DESCRIBE

05:16:37.578 --> 05:16:41.294
PARTICULAR NOUNS LIKE VETERAN,
TEACHER, DOCTOR OR CHILD.

05:16:41.432 --> 05:16:45.656
PERHAPS I WANT TO ASSESS THE
COMFORT OF CONGRESS MEMBERS WITH

05:16:47.626 --> 05:16:50.714
THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS.
SO I WANT TO DO SOME SORT OF

05:16:50.715 --> 05:16:52.703
SEARCH AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
OF PSEUDOCODE HERE.

05:16:52.704 --> 05:16:57.035
I WANT TO SEE IF I CAN FIND ALL
INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE SAY THE

05:16:57.089 --> 05:16:59.730
WORD HYPOTHESIS OR FALSIFY,
CORRELATION, CAUSATION,

05:16:59.731 --> 05:17:02.323
STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE.
IF I FIND THAT, I WANT TO SEE

05:17:02.984 --> 05:17:06.764
THE SPEECH DISPLAYED, ALONG WITH
THE IDEA OF THE SPEECHER, THE

05:17:06.795 --> 05:17:08.795
IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPEAKER,
THE

05:17:10.457 --> 05:17:12.020
 PARTIES THEY'RE ASSOCIATED
WITH, ET CETERA.

05:17:12.021 --> 05:17:18.473
THAT WOULD BE REALLY NICE AND
I'D BE ABLE TO COMPARE HOW

05:17:18.474 --> 05:17:22.914
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
SCIENCE.

05:17:23.261 --> 05:17:26.193
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE
HAVE RIGHT NOW.

05:17:26.562 --> 05:17:30.591
THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE ON THE
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE ^,

05:17:30.592 --> 05:17:35.303
AND THE SORTS OF AGAINST DIG
INTO THE NETTA DATA AND THE

05:17:35.304 --> 05:17:41.249
CONTEXT OF IT ITSELF, SO WE
CAN'T CHECK ALL THE TEXTS OF ALL

05:17:41.272 --> 05:17:44.882
THE SCIENCE HEARINGS.
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY PARTICULAR

05:17:44.883 --> 05:17:47.428
SPEAKERS AND ETCH SPUES.
AS A READER, AS I READ THROUGH

05:17:47.543 --> 05:17:51.166
THAT DOCUMENT, I KNOW WHEN
MEMBER JONES IS SPEAKING  AND

05:17:52.424 --> 05:17:54.134
WHEN MEMBER SMITH SIMPLE
SPEAKING.

05:17:54.135 --> 05:17:56.461
AND I CAN'T KNOW THE
IDENTIFICATION OF THE PARTY OF

05:17:56.477 --> 05:17:57.934
THE CONVERSATION.
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS REALLY

05:17:57.935 --> 05:18:00.669
COMMON KNOWLEDGE, THIS STUFF IS
NOT ACTUALLY CONNECT TO THE DATA

05:18:00.885 --> 05:18:05.080
RIGHT THERE AS A RESEARCHER WHEN
I WANT TO QUERY

05:18:10.115 --> 05:18:18.488
 IT.IT'S JUST TOO HARD TO LOOK
THROUGH ALL THAT DATA.

05:18:18.720 --> 05:18:22.488
ONE DOCUMENT AS AT A TIME.
OR TO LEADERSHIP ALL THE SKILLS,

05:18:22.724 --> 05:18:24.464
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING IT
TOGETHER.

05:18:24.465 --> 05:18:26.816
SO YOU CAN SEARCH AT THIS TIME
WAY YOU WANT TO SEARCH T. BUT

05:18:26.952 --> 05:18:28.969
I'M HERE

05:18:33.999 --> 05:18:43.504
 TODAY.I FEW YEARS AGO, I FOUND 
THE

05:18:43.505 --> 05:18:46.941
COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS WORKING
GROUP AT UC BERKELEY AND A KEY

05:18:46.956 --> 05:18:50.245
POINT WAS TO SCOTT KNOT JUST
TEACH RESEARCHERS HOW TO FISH,

05:18:50.877 --> 05:18:57.869
BUT TO TEACH A RESEARCH TEAM HOW
TO WHALE NO MARINE MAMMALS OF

05:18:58.495 --> 05:19:02.731
COURSE HARMED.
BUT TO TEACH A RESEARCH TEAM,

05:19:03.407 --> 05:19:07.591
HOW TO DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO
ACQUIRE, CLEAN, PROCESS,

05:19:07.592 --> 05:19:09.592
ANALYZE, INTERPRET AND REPORT ON
MASSIVE TEXTUAL ARCHIVES.

05:19:10.333 --> 05:19:14.365
NOW, WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THE
SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH COUNCIL,

05:19:14.596 --> 05:19:19.700
SO WE CAN NOT ONLY CONVERT INTO
A QUERY ANNUAL RECORD OF WHAT

05:19:19.715 --> 05:19:23.536
CONGRESS IS UP TO.
BUT ALSO, SO THAT WE CAN CREATE

05:19:24.542 --> 05:19:26.542
TUTORIALS.
SHOWING ANYONE HOW TO DO THIS

05:19:27.950 --> 05:19:29.962
FOR THEIR OWN DIGITAL
COLLECTION.

05:19:29.977 --> 05:19:35.836
I WANT TO RECOGNIZE SOME OF MY
TEAMMATES HERE QUICKLY.

05:19:36.073 --> 05:19:37.833
AND ANY OF YOU CAN JOIN THIS
SLIDE.

05:19:37.834 --> 05:19:40.279
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT

05:19:44.516 --> 05:19:46.550
 LATER.
WE'RE GOING TO GATHER ALL THE

05:19:46.957 --> 05:19:49.859
DATA AND DOCUMENTS.
NEXT, WE'RE FINDING AND LABELING

05:19:50.935 --> 05:19:53.799
STRUCTURES IN THE TEXT.
SO MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING FOR A

05:19:53.800 --> 05:19:57.709
PARTICULAR SPEECH ACTS OR EVENT
IT IS OR LOCATIONS OR AD HOC

05:19:57.710 --> 05:20:01.746
GROUPS AND WE CAN ADD THAT
STRUCTURE TO THE TEXT FLEW AN

05:20:01.895 --> 05:20:04.765
NOTATIONS THROUGH XML.
AND

05:20:09.772 --> 05:20:14.831
 THEN LINK IT INTO EXTERNAL
DATA SOURCE THAT IS ENABLE US TO

05:20:15.431 --> 05:20:19.809
THAT, ENABLE POWERFUL QUERIES,
THAT WE ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT WE

05:20:19.925 --> 05:20:22.545
COULDN'T ASK BEFORE.
SO LET ME SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

05:20:22.607 --> 05:20:26.229
WELL STRUCTURED.
READY RESEARCH DATA THAT'S THE

05:20:26.422 --> 05:20:29.168
HARD PRODUCT S. TO CREATE A
DATABASE.

05:20:29.230 --> 05:20:31.800
AND FOR THE RECORD, WE SHOULD
KNOW WHAT WELL STRUCTURED

05:20:31.801 --> 05:20:34.573
RESEARCH DATA LOOKS LIKE.
FIRST OF ALL, IT SHOULD BE

05:20:34.574 --> 05:20:37.867
DIGITAL TEXT.
MACHINE READABLE SO THAT A

05:20:37.868 --> 05:20:41.807
COMPUTER CAN LOOK FOR DIFFERENT
TOKENS AND COMPARE ACROSS

05:20:41.808 --> 05:20:45.541
VARIOUS DOCUMENTS.
IT SHOULD BE QUERIABLE, BUT

05:20:45.542 --> 05:20:48.877
ALSO, ACROSS A SET OF DOCUMENTS
THE RESEARCHER HAS DEFINED.

05:20:49.023 --> 05:20:52.769
SO IF THEY WANT EVERYTHING FROM
ARIZONA OR A DECADE, YOU SHOULD

05:20:53.004 --> 05:20:54.420
BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT
IMMEDIATELY.

05:20:54.421 --> 05:20:59.342
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND A
LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY MOVE

05:20:59.343 --> 05:21:01.789
INTO A DIGITAL ARCHIVE AND THEY
TRY TO MAKE IT PUBLIC.

05:21:02.324 --> 05:21:05.492
THEY MAKE THIS MISTAKE.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RETAIN

05:21:05.692 --> 05:21:07.737
THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE AND
FORMATTING OF THE DOCUMENTS.

05:21:07.855 --> 05:21:11.980
SO I'M GOING TO DING PRO QUEST
HERE.

05:21:11.995 --> 05:21:14.827
I DON'T THINK.
PRO QUEST TRIP ITS OF ALL THE

05:21:15.128 --> 05:21:17.315
WHITE SPACE, ALL THE NEW LINE
CHARACTERS, AND THE PARAGRAPH

05:21:18.083 --> 05:21:20.713
BREAKS, AND THE SUBHEADINGS HELP
US READ THROUGH THE DOCUMENT AND

05:21:20.936 --> 05:21:24.107
UNDERSTAND OH.
THIS IS JUST THE TABLE OF

05:21:24.108 --> 05:21:27.586
CONTENTS OR THIS IS A PORTION
WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO DO SOME

05:21:27.618 --> 05:21:29.819
PREMATTER BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY
TALKING ABOUT THE HEARING YET.SO

05:21:30.042 --> 05:21:32.669
 IT'S IMPORTANT TO RETAIN THE
ORIGINAL STRUCTURE THAT THE

05:21:32.670 --> 05:21:36.630
ORIGINAL AUTHORS USED TO KEEP
TRACK OF WHICH PORTIONS OF TEXT

05:21:36.999 --> 05:21:42.740
ARE DOING WHAT SORT OF
CONCEPTUAL WORK.

05:21:42.972 --> 05:21:48.732
WE WANT TO ADD IN SOME SUP
ELIMINATAL AND ANNOTATABLE THING

05:21:48.733 --> 05:21:53.179
ON THE TEST.
LOOKING FOR SPEAKERS, LOCATIONS,

05:21:53.180 --> 05:21:55.207
ET CETERA.
AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LINK

05:21:55.426 --> 05:22:00.742
THE DATA TO OTHER DATA THAT
DESCRIBE THE SAME OBJECTS.

05:22:00.802 --> 05:22:04.574
THE ERRORRING MEMBER IS GOING TO
TALK ABOUT CONGRESS MEMBER

05:22:04.575 --> 05:22:06.632
SMITH.
BUT THERE'S A LOT I KNOW ABOUT

05:22:07.180 --> 05:22:09.653
CONGRESS MEMBER SMITH IN ANOTHER
DATABASE THAT TELLS ME ABOUT HER

05:22:10.000 --> 05:22:12.278
AGE AND HER DISTRICT.
THE POPULATION AND DEMOGRAPHICS

05:22:12.647 --> 05:22:18.372
OF HER DISTRICT, WHICH MIGHT
INFLUENCE THE WAY SHE'S BEEN

05:22:18.373 --> 05:22:20.681
BEHAVING.
IN ALL OF THIS, WE'RE NOT JUST

05:22:21.683 --> 05:22:25.071
CREATING A QUERIABLE DATABASE.
THERE'S LEARNING OPPORTUNITY FOR

05:22:25.381 --> 05:22:28.758
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TAKE THEIR
DIGITAL ARCHIVES AND MAKE IT

05:22:28.759 --> 05:22:31.120
MORE ACCESSIBLE TO A LARGER
AUDIENCE OF RESEARCHERS AND THE

05:22:31.469 --> 05:22:35.513
PUBLIC.
WE'RE GOING TO BE CREATING A

05:22:35.514 --> 05:22:41.824
STEP BY STEP HOW TO GUIDE.
WEE BE USING NOTES WHICH ALLOW

05:22:42.059 --> 05:22:45.634
US TO WRITE IN PLANE ENGLISH,
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

05:22:45.687 --> 05:22:48.280
RIGHT RITE NEXT TO A CELL WHICH
RUNS EXECUTABLE CODE.

05:22:48.498 --> 05:22:52.687
SO FOR THOSE THAT ARE A LITTLE
AFRAID OF PROGRAMMING, THE IDEA

05:22:52.920 --> 05:22:58.604
IS TO TAKE YOU STEP BY STEP
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DOING

05:22:58.605 --> 05:23:03.230
THAT PHASE 1, GATHERING AND
ADDING THE DATA.

05:23:03.261 --> 05:23:06.869
PHASE III, LINK IT TO OTHER
USEFUL DATA TO DIG INTO THESE A

05:23:06.870 --> 05:23:09.356
LITTLE BIT.
PHASE 1, BRINGING ALL YOUR DATA

05:23:09.810 --> 05:23:13.979
TOGETHER, THIS IS JUST TRYING TO
GET AROUND, POINTING, AND

05:23:13.980 --> 05:23:15.758
CLICKING AND DOWNLOADING A
THOUSAND TIMES.

05:23:15.759 --> 05:23:18.899
WE CAN ACTUALLY DRAIN A COMPUTER
TO DO THIS.

05:23:19.167 --> 05:23:21.167
OR TRIP PEOPLE TO TELL A
COMPUTER HOW TO DO IT.

05:23:21.206 --> 05:23:24.395
SO WE'LL BE TRAINING PEOPLE IN
THESE NOTEBOOKS TO USE REGULAR

05:23:25.462 --> 05:23:30.257
EXPRESSIONS  TO USE X PATH SO
THAT THEY CAN LOOK ON A WEBSITE

05:23:30.902 --> 05:23:35.726
AND A WEB BROWSER AUTOMATION
TOOL LIKE SELENIUM, YOU CAN HAVE

05:23:36.267 --> 05:23:38.698
A COMPUTER DO IT FOR YOU.
PHASE 2 IS REALLY WHERE WE'RE

05:23:39.928 --> 05:23:43.553
TRYING TO MOVE FROM THE CURRENT
STATE OF THE ART, WHICH IS KIND

05:23:43.904 --> 05:23:48.849
OF A CRAFT, TO A SCIENCE.
FINDING STRUCTURE AND TEXT IT

05:23:49.203 --> 05:23:52.749
TAKES A LOT OF WORKING BACK AND
FORTH WITH THE TEXT, KNOWING

05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:55.831
WHAT IS THEOCRATICAL IMPORTANT
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND

05:23:55.832 --> 05:24:00.566
THERE, AND USING THE COMPUTER TO
HELP YOU FIND THAT STRUCTURE TO

05:24:00.574 --> 05:24:05.241
CHUNK IT OUT, TO LABEL IT AND TO
ADD STRUCTURE WHERE THERE WASN'T

05:24:05.459 --> 05:24:09.257
BEFORE WANT SO WE TAKE TAKE
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT VARIOUS

05:24:09.258 --> 05:24:13.354
EXPRESSIONS  AND HOW TO USE XML
AND WE SHOW THEM SOME OF THE

05:24:13.355 --> 05:24:18.336
TEXT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES THAT I
TALKED ABOUT AT THE TOP.

05:24:18.572 --> 05:24:23.604
AND WE'RE EVEN USING CROWD
SOURCE AN NOTATION SOFTWARE,

05:24:23.605 --> 05:24:26.513
CALLED TEXT [INDISCERNIBLE].
CREATED BY THE GOODLY LABS.

05:24:26.745 --> 05:24:32.535
ALL OF THESE THINGS ALLOW US TO
GET THE COMPUTERS TOGETHER TO

05:24:32.751 --> 05:24:34.228
FIND THAT STRUCTURE IN THE
TEXT.

05:24:34.229 --> 05:24:37.457
IN ORDER TO DO IT EFFICIENT
LEEWAY PROGRAMMING SCRIPT, YOU

05:24:37.672 --> 05:24:40.883
NEED TO KNOW SOME BASIC
PROGRAMMING ARCHITECTURE, IT'S

05:24:40.952 --> 05:24:44.958
NOT SUPER HARD TO LEARN, BUT
WE'LL TEACH

05:24:49.971 --> 05:24:53.771
 YOU.
IDENTIFYING RELEVANT DATA Z.

05:24:53.772 --> 05:24:56.738
EFFECTIVELY STRUCTURING YOUR
DATABASE SO TAYOU'RE

05:24:56.739 --> 05:24:59.585
ANTICIPATING THE QUERIES OF THE
RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND YOU'RE

05:24:59.978 --> 05:25:03.393
ALSO REDUCING REDUNDANCIES IN
THE DATA STORAGE.

05:25:03.836 --> 05:25:06.141
PAUL, WHO SPOKE JUST BEFORE ME,
REALLY KIND OF SET THIS UP.

05:25:06.362 --> 05:25:11.159
IF WE CAN USE SQL AND RELATIONAL
DATABASES, WE CAN COMPUTE MUCH

05:25:11.644 --> 05:25:16.505
MORE QUICKLY OVER SOME OF THIS
MULTI LAYERED STRUCTURED

05:25:21.529 --> 05:25:23.885
 TEXT.
I WANT TO ASK YOU ALL TO GET

05:25:23.886 --> 05:25:25.886
RESEARCH READY.
YOU KNOW, WE'LL BE PUSHING SOME

05:25:26.360 --> 05:25:28.572
OF THIS OUT IN NOVEMBER AND
WE'RE HOPING THAT PEOPLE WILL

05:25:28.918 --> 05:25:30.920
GIVE US

05:25:35.701 --> 05:25:37.569
 FEEDBACK.
YOUR PHASE 2 TUTORIALS WERE

05:25:37.570 --> 05:25:40.075
QUITE CONFUSING.
NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING

05:25:40.208 --> 05:25:42.581
ROOM.
WE NEED TO LOOK FOR ENGAGEMENT

05:25:42.582 --> 05:25:45.167
FROM THE LIBRARY OF

05:25:50.229 --> 05:25:54.812
 CONGRESS.
SEEMS THEY CUT ME OFF.  HERE WE

05:25:56.840 --> 05:25:58.830
GO.
YEAHS IF YOU WANT TO JOIN IN

05:25:58.831 --> 05:26:00.918
THIS EFFORT OR FOLLOW ALONG.
HERE ARE SOME LINKS.

05:26:01.051 --> 05:26:03.582
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SHOW

05:26:06.993 --> 05:26:09.049
 YOU IS
THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS COMPLETELY

05:26:09.085 --> 05:26:13.281
OPENED TO THE PUBLIC.
YOU CAN GO TO THE OPEN SOCIETY

05:26:14.064 --> 05:26:16.535
FRAMEWORK, HOST BY THE THE
CENTER FOR OPEN SCIENCE AND YOU

05:26:16.758 --> 05:26:19.635
CAN WATCH AND FOLLOW ALONG WITH
OUR PROJECT.

05:26:19.655 --> 05:26:24.369
IF YOU WANT TO JUMP IN, CAN YOU
ACTUALLY GO TO OUR GITA GITA HUB

05:26:24.373 --> 05:26:27.030
PAGE AND START DOING FULL
REQUESTS.

05:26:27.097 --> 05:26:31.223
ALTHOUGH, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT
US FIRST AND MAYBE WE CAN LEAVE

05:26:31.570 --> 05:26:37.908
YOU TO THE WORK THAT'S MOST
PRESSING AT THE MOMENT.

05:26:38.025 --> 05:26:40.025
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO

05:26:43.361 --> 05:26:45.039
GETTING IN BLUE SKY IN THE
FUTURE.

05:26:45.040 --> 05:26:48.335
HELP US OUT IF YOU CAN.
THANKS A

05:26:53.332 --> 05:26:55.332
 LOT.
NEXT, WE

05:26:57.332 --> 05:27:02.223
 HAVE, TAHIR SPADES
TEMPO, WORKING IN

05:27:02.224 --> 05:27:04.850
INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION,
THOUGHTS  AND RESEARCH.

05:27:05.779 --> 05:27:08.706
HE'S PLANTED BUSINESS STRATEGY
IN THE ENTERTAINMENT, NONPROFIT

05:27:09.468 --> 05:27:11.394
INDUSTRIES.
HE PRODUCES ART, MEDIA ART

05:27:11.395 --> 05:27:14.776
EDUCATION PROGRAMS  AND MANAGES
THE WRAP RESEARCH LAB.

05:27:15.042 --> 05:27:19.189
HE'S GOING TO SHARE A STORY
ABOUT HOW VISUALIZING RAP LYRICS

05:27:20.105 --> 05:27:22.761
HELPS  TO TEACH DATA LITERACY TO
HIGH SCHOOL

05:27:29.708 --> 05:27:33.347
 STUDENTS.
TAHIR, YOU'RE UP.

05:27:33.367 --> 05:27:36.099
HOW ABOUT A ROUND FOR TAHIR.
[APPLAUSE].

05:27:36.120 --> 05:27:42.036
&gt;&gt; SO I HAVE A REQUEST.
CAN YOU CUT ALL AUDIO TO MY

05:27:42.037 --> 05:27:45.989
PRESENTATION?
I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE IRONIC.

05:27:46.442 --> 05:27:54.037
MY NAME IS HAHIR HEMPHILL.
I AM AN ARTIST,

05:27:58.234 --> 05:28:00.184
 EDUCATOR,
RADICAL ACTIVIST AND A CREATIVE

05:28:00.185 --> 05:28:06.523
TECHNOLOGIST AND I'M GOING TO
TALK ABOUT MY PROJECTS AT THE

05:28:06.561 --> 05:28:08.561
RAP RESEARCH

05:28:11.583 --> 05:28:19.562
 LAB.THE ROLL THAT COLLABORATIVE
PRODUCTION PLAYS IN THE.

05:28:19.663 --> 05:28:25.266
THE SLIDES I'M GOING TO GO
THROUGH TODAY, WILL FIT IF THOSE

05:28:25.298 --> 05:28:30.868
TWO AREAS.
SO THE SYSTEM THAT I DEVELOPED

05:28:32.243 --> 05:28:36.938
IS THE RAP ALMANAC.
AND IT'S ON LINE SEARCHABLE

05:28:40.146 --> 05:28:45.103
DATABASE AND IT CONTAINS A
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING OF

05:28:45.104 --> 05:28:48.147
TONS OF HIP-HOP SONGS.
RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE ABOUT 25,

05:28:48.152 --> 05:28:52.588
30 ARTISTS.
BAY QUARTER OF A MILLION SONGS

05:28:53.598 --> 05:28:58.203
AND THIS IS SOME OF THE DATA
ANALYTICS ASSOCIATED  WITH THE

05:29:01.598 --> 05:29:04.727
SONGS.
THE ALBUM TITLE, GEO LOCATION,

05:29:04.728 --> 05:29:09.771
RELEASE DATES FOR ALL OF THE
SONGS AND SOME OF THE SYNTAX

05:29:09.772 --> 05:29:12.452
ANALYSIS IS THE WORD COUNT
READING

05:29:15.988 --> 05:29:18.055
 LEVEL, RHYME DENSITY AND
THIS RHYME ANALYSIS THAT WILL

05:29:18.259 --> 05:29:21.773
TELL YOU THAT IF WHAT YOU ARE
READ SUGGEST A PERFECT RHYME.

05:29:21.827 --> 05:29:23.827
IT'LL ALSO TELL YOU WHERE THE
RHYMES FIT WITHIN THE

05:29:28.727 --> 05:29:32.137
 LINES.
AND THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

05:29:32.138 --> 05:29:34.138
COVERS SENTIMENT KEY WORD,
PEOPLE AND

05:29:37.208 --> 05:29:39.181
 PLACES.
AND THIS IS WHAT A SEARCH IN THE

05:29:39.182 --> 05:29:47.689
DATABASE LOOKS LIKE.
IN THIS CASE, THE USER TYPED IN

05:29:48.037 --> 05:29:50.506
POWER.
AND YOU GET THIS BALL DATA SONG

05:29:51.238 --> 05:29:54.894
TITLE, ALBUM TITLE AND CAN YOU
ADD THESE ADVANCED SEARCH

05:29:54.895 --> 05:29:58.482
OPTIONS.
IN THIS CASE, THEY'RE ADDING

05:29:58.483 --> 05:30:04.227
SENTIMENT AND SYLLABLES PER
WORD, AND REDOING THE SEARCH.

05:30:04.228 --> 05:30:08.090
AND THE MOST EXCITING PART ABOUT

05:30:12.262 --> 05:30:17.766
THIS IS THE FACT YOU YOU PRESS
THE BUTTON, AND GET A MACHINE

05:30:18.153 --> 05:30:22.503
READABLE OUTPUT AND A HUMAN
READABLE

05:30:26.933 --> 05:30:29.137
 OUTPUT.
IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET GET

05:30:29.168 --> 05:30:33.224
TO THAT POINT.
I WAS ECSTATIC WHEN WE GOT TO

05:30:34.034 --> 05:30:36.034
THAT POINT.
SO WHAT THE DATABASE GIVES US IS

05:30:36.204 --> 05:30:39.664
A NEW CONTEXT FOR HIP-HOP.
SO THERE'S CONTENT.

05:30:40.601 --> 05:30:42.245
THERE'S A LOCATION TAG FOR THE
CONTENT.

05:30:42.246 --> 05:30:46.482
AND THERE'S A TIME.
SO FOR EVERY UTTERANCE OF

05:30:46.483 --> 05:30:48.529
HIP-HOP.
THERE'S A TIME AND PLACE.

05:30:48.549 --> 05:30:54.823
CAN YOU SEARCH FOR POWER AND
FIND EVERY RAPPER THAT RAPID

05:30:54.824 --> 05:30:58.335
ABOUT POWER.
WHEN THEY RAPID ABOUT POWER AND

05:30:58.644 --> 05:31:01.894
THE CONTEXT.
SO IT'S A BIG DATA RAP PROJECT.

05:31:02.032 --> 05:31:05.497
SO I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH A FEW

05:31:09.860 --> 05:31:11.860
SLIDES OF EXAMPLES OF
VISUALIZATION.

05:31:11.961 --> 05:31:16.711
SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID
IMMEDIATELY WAS TO DUMP ALL THIS

05:31:16.926 --> 05:31:22.602
ON GOOGLE EARTH.
WHAT YOU JUST SAW WAS STAT

05:31:22.603 --> 05:31:28.376
INILAND RAPPERS AND NOW YOU'RE
LOOKING AT BROOKLYN RAPPERS AND

05:31:28.953 --> 05:31:31.704
QUEENS RAPPERS.
SO THE PROJECT MATCHES THE

05:31:31.705 --> 05:31:33.182
GEOGRAPHYY AND LANGUAGE OF
HIP-HOP.

05:31:33.183 --> 05:31:41.884
SO YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW SLANG
TRAVELS, HOW R IT ORIGINATES.HOW

05:31:42.868 --> 05:31:47.573
 REGIONS INFLUENCES OTHER
REGIONS AND I THAT CAN BE DONE

05:31:47.585 --> 05:31:51.042
FOR SLANG, FOR POLITICS, AND
THAT CAN BE DONE FOR MANY OTHER

05:31:53.313 --> 05:31:55.891
THINGS.
ANOTHER EARLY

05:31:59.615 --> 05:32:03.771
 DATA.
ARE CHAMPAGNE BRAND MENTIONS.AND

05:32:03.772 --> 05:32:05.473
 OF COURSE, IT'S LIKE, IT'S
QUAINT.

05:32:05.474 --> 05:32:07.474
IT'S

05:32:09.161 --> 05:32:13.113
 FUNNY.
WE ALL HAVE AN IMAGE OF RAPPERS 

05:32:15.281 --> 05:32:19.745
AND SHAME PAIN USE.
IF YOU LOOK AT CHAMPAGNE AS AN

05:32:20.994 --> 05:32:25.431
ASPIRATIONAL PRODUCT, AND TIMES
FOR CHAMPAGNE USE, THAT ARE TIED

05:32:30.383 --> 05:32:38.596
TO EXPRESSIONS OF CELEBRATION OR
EXPRESSIONS OF WEALTH OR THE

05:32:38.597 --> 05:32:44.002
FACT YOU WANT TO PRETEND LIKE
YOU HAVE WEALTH, AND UP TO DIG

05:32:44.487 --> 05:32:46.487
DEEPER INTO THE CULTURAL

05:32:48.785 --> 05:32:53.433
MEANINGS OF CHAMPAGNE AND RAP.
THIS IS A NETWORK RAP I MADE

05:32:53.434 --> 05:32:59.824
THAT LOOKS AT CONTEMPORARY AND
MODERN PAINTERS THAT ARE

05:32:59.825 --> 05:33:01.825
MENTIONED  IN

05:33:03.187 --> 05:33:05.187
 RAP.
AND JOHN MICHELLE

05:33:08.034 --> 05:33:09.700
 BOTSKY BECAME
REALLY POPULAR RECENTLY, IT'S

05:33:09.701 --> 05:33:13.155
CALLED PICASSO BABY.
AND IT SHOWS THE DIFFERENT

05:33:13.156 --> 05:33:16.552
CONNECTS, THE DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
BETWEEN RAP LYRICS  AND

05:33:20.459 --> 05:33:23.756
CULTURE.
AND A PROJECT THEY MADE LAST

05:33:23.757 --> 05:33:28.715
YEAR IS CALLED SPOTTIFY CITY,
AND IT DEALS WITH VIRTUAL ELISE

05:33:28.731 --> 05:33:33.652
EISENBERG.ITY.
SO I HAD A RESIDENT AT SPOTTIFY

05:33:33.667 --> 05:33:38.203
WANT I LOOKED AT THE CONTENT OF
THE STREAMS, AS A REPRESENTATION

05:33:39.477 --> 05:33:44.364
OF A LISTENER'S ASPIRATIONS  AND
DESIRES, AS REVEALED THROUGH THE

05:33:44.933 --> 05:33:49.843
MUSIC THAT THEY LISTEN TO.
SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU'RE

05:33:50.254 --> 05:33:54.648
DRIVING TO DO WORK, ON YOUR WAY
TO WORTH YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT

05:33:54.649 --> 05:33:57.237
LISTENING  TO A SONG ABOUT BE AT
WORK.

05:33:57.660 --> 05:33:59.350
YOU'RE LISTENING  TO A SONG
ABOUT BEING SOMEWHERE ELSE AT

05:33:59.351 --> 05:34:05.538
WORK AND HOW DO WE EXTRACT THAT
VIRTUALITY FROM

05:34:09.019 --> 05:34:12.413
 STREAMS.
THIS IS A LIGHT LIGHT PEN

05:34:12.414 --> 05:34:16.224
DRAWINGS, MADE FROM 20-FOOT TALL
INDUSTRIAL ROBOT.

05:34:16.455 --> 05:34:21.228
SO USING THE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS.
I EXTRACTED THE LOCATIONS THAT

05:34:21.349 --> 05:34:25.704
ARE MENTIONED IN 12 RAPPERS'
BODIES OF WORK FROM THEIR FIRST

05:34:25.705 --> 05:34:31.481
SONG TO THE LAST SONG, AND
THROUGH I THINK IT WAS LIKE A 14

05:34:32.043 --> 05:34:36.625
STEP PROCESS, SENT THESE CODES 
TO A ROBOT ARM.  AND PUT A LIGHT

05:34:36.672 --> 05:34:42.188
PEN IN A ROBOT ARM'S HAND AND
HAD THE ROBOT ARM TRACE THE

05:34:42.189 --> 05:34:44.213
LOCKEDS AROUND THE GLOBE.
IN THIS

05:34:47.369 --> 05:34:52.511
 CASE, IS KANYE WEST.
THIS IS A DIGITAL MODEL OF THE

05:34:53.041 --> 05:34:57.383
SAME THING WE ARE DEVELOPING
INTO A VR EDUCATIONAL PIECE.

05:34:57.665 --> 05:35:06.374
SO THE GREEN PATH ARE THE PATHS
THAT THE RAPPERS

05:35:07.834 --> 05:35:09.883
 -- THAT THE RAP

05:35:14.928 --> 05:35:19.725
TRAVELS AND I WASN'T SATISFIED
WITH JUST TWO DIMENSION WANT I

05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:25.849
WAS INN SATISFIED WITH TWO
DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATION.  SO

05:35:27.870 --> 05:35:30.000
PRODUCING DATA SCROLL PURE OF IT
WORK.

05:35:32.028 --> 05:35:37.116
AND THIS WAS THE SUITE OF ALL
THE RAPPERS.  I'M HAVING A SOLO

05:35:37.336 --> 05:35:40.826
SHOW AT CCA IN SEPTEMBER,
EVERYONE IS INVITED HERE, TOO.

05:35:40.974 --> 05:35:46.694
AND I'M GOING TO PRESENT THIS
WORK.

05:35:46.709 --> 05:35:51.957
SO THE PROJECT VISUALIZES
HIP-HOP AS A CULT AURAL

05:35:51.958 --> 05:35:52.894
INDICATOR.
CAN YOU IMAGINE OVERLAYING

05:35:52.895 --> 05:35:56.738
HEALTH DATA SETS.  CRIME,
STATISTIC DATA SETS.

05:35:56.791 --> 05:36:01.471
EDUCATION DATA SETS DOWN TO A
COUNTY LEVEL AND OVERLAYING

05:36:01.472 --> 05:36:03.986
THOSE WITH THIS DATA

05:36:09.019 --> 05:36:12.239
 SET.
AND THIS IS THE ANALYSIS, THE

05:36:12.678 --> 05:36:15.456
SEMANTIC ANALYSIS OF DRAKE'S
ENTIRE BODY OF WORK BEING

05:36:22.461 --> 05:36:26.359
PROCESSED.
COL, BUT DATA NEEDS MEMORY,

05:36:29.440 --> 05:36:30.944
RIGHT?
IT'S NICE TO HAVE PAGES  AND

05:36:30.945 --> 05:36:35.314
PAGES OF DATA, YOU KNOW, WHETHER
IT'S MACHINE READABLE.

05:36:35.450 --> 05:36:40.318
BUT IN ORDER TO TELL A STORY
WITH DATA, YOU KIND OF NEED AN

05:36:40.640 --> 05:36:43.686
EXPERIENCE TIED  TO IT, TO BRING
IT TO LIFE.

05:36:44.026 --> 05:36:46.726
AND IT WAS THIS QUESTION OF
THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT

05:36:47.042 --> 05:36:51.427
MADE ME START TO WRITE RESEARCH
LAB AND ESPECIALLY THIS

05:36:51.428 --> 05:36:53.428
QUESTION.
SHOULD A CULTURE OWN ITS OPEN

05:36:53.515 --> 05:36:56.821
DATA.
LIKE, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

05:36:56.822 --> 05:36:59.317
PROTECTING THIS DATA WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING THE

05:36:59.318 --> 05:37:04.146
STORIES ABOUT THIS DATA.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECK

05:37:04.147 --> 05:37:08.698
BEING THE STORIES TOLD ABOUT
THIS CULTURAL DATA AND AND EVEN

05:37:08.934 --> 05:37:12.976
WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT
ADVANCES ITS WORKERS INTO

05:37:12.977 --> 05:37:17.609
EXCITING NEW SPACES OF CREATIVE
INQUIRY, THE OPPORTUNITY TO

05:37:17.610 --> 05:37:20.029
CHALLENGE TRADITIONAL MODES OF
HIERARCHY IS OFTEN MISSED.

05:37:20.235 --> 05:37:24.596
AND MOST OF THE TIME, IF THERE'S
A NEW SPACE OPENED, WE BRING OUR

05:37:24.627 --> 05:37:27.574
SAME BIASES TO THESE OPEN
SPACES, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DO

05:37:28.357 --> 05:37:30.400
SOMETHING NEW OR IMAGINING
SOMETHING NEW.

05:37:32.228 --> 05:37:35.356
WE JUST POURED OUR OLD STUFF TO
THE NEW SPACES.

05:37:35.425 --> 05:37:39.283
SO SEW IN THE AGE OF BIG DATA
NORMATIVE NARRATIVES AROUND

05:37:39.284 --> 05:37:41.437
HIP-HOP WANT WE PRODUCE STORY
TYPES.

05:37:41.553 --> 05:37:44.900
FOR ME, THAT ALSO EXTENDS TO THE

05:37:48.451 --> 05:37:50.952
SINGULARITY AND ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE LIKE, THE

05:37:50.953 --> 05:37:56.350
SINGULARITY IN A WAY WAY IS A
COLONIZING PROCESS.

05:37:56.968 --> 05:38:02.166
IT IGNORES WHAT HAPPENS ON THE
SIDES, AND JUST FOCUSES ON WHAT

05:38:02.622 --> 05:38:04.644
WORKS FOR THE

05:38:09.675 --> 05:38:13.629
 SYSTEM.
I HAVE TO INVITE PEOPLE TO TALK

05:38:13.765 --> 05:38:17.297
ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS, EXPLORE
THESE QUESTIONS AND GRAPPLE.

05:38:17.796 --> 05:38:20.721
THE RAP RESEARCH LAB SAY
CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY STUDIO AND

05:38:21.592 --> 05:38:24.634
WE EBBING PROPER RAP AS A
CULTURAL INDICATOR THROUGH

05:38:24.635 --> 05:38:26.688
EDITORIAL AND CREATIVE
INTERROGATIONS.

05:38:26.923 --> 05:38:30.202
I'M GOING TO READ A BIT.
WE ARE A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS,

05:38:32.590 --> 05:38:34.429
RADICAL EDUCATORS.
TECHNOLOGY GIST IT IS AND ARTIST

05:38:34.430 --> 05:38:39.692
WHO IS USE RAP AS TEXT, TO
BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUTH

05:38:39.693 --> 05:38:41.697
CULTURE.
WE EXPLORE QUESTIONS OF SOCIAL

05:38:42.197 --> 05:38:46.571
JUSTICE AND FACILITATE
RESILIENCE FLEW DATA PROJECTS. 

05:38:47.158 --> 05:38:51.437
AND WE DESIGN PROJECTS AND ASK
QUESTIONS, BOTH COLLABORATIVELY

05:38:51.996 --> 05:38:56.374
AND INDIVIDUALLY, THAT CHALLENGE
NOTIONS OF OWNERSHIP AND AGENCY,

05:38:56.412 --> 05:38:59.870
AND NEW SPACES.
SO JUST A FEW AXIOMS RULES OFF

05:39:01.882 --> 05:39:09.067
THE TOP, THAT WE BELIEVE AT THE
RAP RESEARCH LAB.

05:39:09.284 --> 05:39:14.025
RAP IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL
GLOBAL AND YOUTH ART FORM,

05:39:14.026 --> 05:39:18.953
PERIOD MUCH ACCORDING TO A
SPOTTIFY ANALYSIS OF 20 BILLION

05:39:19.049 --> 05:39:24.251
STREAM SONGS, BACK IN 2015, RAP
IS THE MOST LISTENED TO GENRE IN

05:39:24.455 --> 05:39:28.936
THE WORLD.
ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY, RAP

05:39:29.501 --> 05:39:32.360
IS MORE POPULAR THAN ROCK, BUT
WE ALREADY KNEW THAT.

05:39:32.491 --> 05:39:41.180
I MEAN, RAP HAS MORE WORDS.
ANOTHER AXIOM IS, HIP-HOP ISN'T

05:39:41.181 --> 05:39:49.100
RAP, GRAFFITI, DJING AND BREAK
DANCING.

05:39:49.147 --> 05:39:55.176
RAP IN THE BEGIN THERE WAS A DJ
AND NO HIP-HOP RECORDS.

05:39:55.228 --> 05:39:59.641
COOL HERK, PLAYING IN 1973 IN
THE BRONX WANT THERE WERE NO RAP

05:40:01.040 --> 05:40:02.226
RECORDS.
THERE WERE NO HIP-HOP RECORDS.

05:40:02.264 --> 05:40:06.026
THERE WERE SOUL, FUNK RECORDS,
PLUS RECORDS, THERE WERE ROCK

05:40:07.180 --> 05:40:11.244
RECORDS, BUT WHAT WAS HIP-HOP
WAS THE WAY HE PLAYED THOSE

05:40:11.245 --> 05:40:13.245
RECORDS.
SO HIP-HOP IS A FRAMEWORK AND

05:40:13.427 --> 05:40:17.833
THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH HE PLAYED
THOSE RECORDS.

05:40:17.864 --> 05:40:24.526
AND THE QUOTE FROM MY COLLEAGUE,
DAVID GOLDBERG, THIS FRAMEWORK

05:40:24.878 --> 05:40:29.984
IS HELPFUL, IN A FRAGMENTED
WORLD, HIP IS AN EFFECTIVELY

05:40:29.985 --> 05:40:33.750
APPROACH TO PROBLEM SOLVING,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR FUTURE

05:40:33.751 --> 05:40:38.429
DEPEND ON THE RISING RUINS OF
INHERENTED MISTAKES.

05:40:38.636 --> 05:40:41.997
SO BECAUSE OF THIS FRAMEWORK.
WE DECIDED TO TEACH.

05:40:42.212 --> 05:40:50.259
AND THIS IS A MAP OF A CRUMB
ALMOST IN OUR LESSON

05:40:52.600 --> 05:40:53.719
 PA PLANS.
WE START WITH AN INTRODUCTION.

05:40:54.062 --> 05:40:57.504
THE HISTORY OF THE TECHNOLOGY.
HISTORY OF THE CULTURE.

05:40:59.627 --> 05:41:01.627
AND THEN WE STEVE THE STUDENTS
HOW

05:41:04.220 --> 05:41:06.220
 TEACH THE STUDENTS HOW TO
ASK QUESTIONS.

05:41:06.424 --> 05:41:09.837
HOW TO FORMULATE GOOD RESEARCH
QUESTIONS.

05:41:10.523 --> 05:41:14.954
THEN WE HAVE A CONTENT CODING
EXERCISE WHERE WE DO CLOSED

05:41:14.955 --> 05:41:17.307
READINGS OF LYRICS, AND CONTENT
CODES THEM.

05:41:17.339 --> 05:41:20.566
THIS IS AN LOG.
WE ALSO HAVE A DIGITAL VISIONER.

05:41:20.888 --> 05:41:23.731
 THEN WE TEACH THE CITY COUNCILS
HOW TO CONDUCT THE SEARCH, HOW

05:41:23.947 --> 05:41:27.438
TO USE THE TOOLS AND WE DEAL
WITH DATA BIAS.

05:41:28.163 --> 05:41:31.567
LIKE, THEIR OWN IMPLICIT BIAS
AND EXTERNAL BIAS.

05:41:31.904 --> 05:41:35.026
HOW DO THEY COLLECT THE DATA
ABOUT A WHAT DID THEY LEAVE

05:41:35.027 --> 05:41:39.557
OUT.
WHAT WAS LEFT OUT IN THE INITIAL

05:41:40.073 --> 05:41:43.873
PROCESS OF THE DATA THAT THEY
COLLECTED AND HOW THINGS FALL

05:41:43.911 --> 05:41:48.344
OFF ALONG THE WAY.
AND THEN WE HAVE SOME MAPPING

05:41:53.363 --> 05:41:58.182
LESSONS AND VISUALIZATION
LESSONS WANT SO THE

05:42:01.237 --> 05:42:02.898
METHODOLOGIES IN THIS
FRAMEWORK.

05:42:02.899 --> 05:42:06.554
WE INVITE PARTICIPANTS TO ENGAGE
CRITICALLY, WITH CULTURAL

05:42:06.555 --> 05:42:11.488
RESEARCH, DATA COLLECTION, DATA
ETHICS, IMPLICIT BIAS, DATA BIAS

05:42:11.588 --> 05:42:14.978
AND STORY TELLING.
THESE ARE ELEMENTS THAT

05:42:14.979 --> 05:42:17.765
ULTIMATELY EMPOWER THE CRITICAL
THINKINGS AND DECISION MAKING

05:42:17.797 --> 05:42:24.417
THAT LEAVES A STATUS CAPABLE TO
BECOME ESTABLISHING INFORMED

05:42:24.418 --> 05:42:27.412
POSITIONS.
THIS OUTCOME NOT ONLY INFLUENCES

05:42:27.444 --> 05:42:32.433
BEHAVIORAL CHANGE, BUT IS A
PRECURSOR TO DEPLOYING A HEALTHY

05:42:32.449 --> 05:42:34.329
DEMOCRACY, ESPECIALLY IN THIS
PIST TRUTH ERA.

05:42:34.330 --> 05:42:38.435
SO WE'RE DEALING WITH DATA
LITERACY.

05:42:38.899 --> 05:42:40.899
MEDIA

05:42:43.502 --> 05:42:45.756
 LITERACY AND ACTUALLY,
LISTENING  TO RAP AND HAVING FUN

05:42:46.007 --> 05:42:48.972
DOING IT.
I'M MAKING IT SOUND SO BORING.

05:42:49.446 --> 05:42:51.866
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IT'S REALLY

05:42:56.877 --> 05:43:04.087
 COOL.WE PILOTED A FEW YEARS 
AGO.  AND

05:43:04.088 --> 05:43:10.566
I INVITED TEACHERS TO PRODUCE
THE CURRICULUM WITH ME.

05:43:10.582 --> 05:43:13.446
AND THE THIRD PHASE WAS THE
SPREAD.

05:43:13.766 --> 05:43:18.503
SO THIS IS MY ONE ROOM SCHOOL
HOUSE IN THE SOUTH

05:43:22.085 --> 05:43:24.631
 BRONX.
AND DOWN ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT,

05:43:24.632 --> 05:43:30.023
THIS IS A DESIGN THAT WE HAVE,
WHERE WE INVITED EDUCATORS IN TO

05:43:30.241 --> 05:43:36.377
TEST OUR CURRICULUM.
AND ON THE TOP RIGHT IS ACTUALLY

05:43:36.577 --> 05:43:39.373
THE GRADUATION DAY, WHERE I
INSIGHTED SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES,

05:43:39.388 --> 05:43:43.154
IN THE ART AND TECH WORLD TO
COME AND GIVE CRITIQUE AND

05:43:43.155 --> 05:43:50.356
SUPPORT TO THE STUDENTS.
TOP LEFT, THAT'S A PICTURE OF

05:43:51.612 --> 05:43:55.022
ME, AND ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS
ONE OF OUR CONTENT CODING

05:43:55.023 --> 05:43:59.033
EXERCISES WHERE WE ASKED THE
TUNES TO IDENTIFY IN THIS CASE

05:43:59.701 --> 05:44:02.955
-- WE ASKED THE STUDENTS TO
IDENTIFY, IN THIS CASE, 5 THEMES

05:44:03.254 --> 05:44:05.254
THEY THINK THEY'LL FIND IN THE
MUSIC.

05:44:05.679 --> 05:44:09.797
BODY, SEXUALITY, ACHIEVEMENTS,
RELATIONSHIPS, LOVE, FAMILY,

05:44:09.798 --> 05:44:17.400
CONFLICT AND ORIGINS, POLITICS.
WE GIVE THEM TEXT AND WE ASK

05:44:17.401 --> 05:44:20.671
THEM TO CONTENT CODE.
SO EVERY TIME THEY SEE ONE OF

05:44:20.903 --> 05:44:25.790
THESE TEAMS, AT A TAG IT IN THE
TEXT.

05:44:26.126 --> 05:44:28.126
AND THAT'S AN AN LOG PROCESS
THAT

05:44:31.359 --> 05:44:33.359
 HELPS BUILD AILING

05:44:39.474 --> 05:44:41.474
ALGORITHMIC SYNCHING, AND THESE
ARE SCALED.

05:44:41.689 --> 05:44:43.993
THESE ARE SOME OF THE WORKSHOPS
WE DID IN COLLABORATION WITH THE

05:44:46.007 --> 05:44:48.007
PARKS

05:44:50.488 --> 05:44:53.769
 DEPARTMENT AND THEN THE
LAST PHASE IS THE SPREAD WHERE

05:44:54.543 --> 05:44:57.936
WE TOOK OUR CRUCK ALMOST AND
TRAINED THE NEW YORK CITY'S

05:44:57.937 --> 05:45:02.244
PARKS DEPARTMENT EDUCATORS TO
IMPLEMENT OUR CURRICULUM IN 10

05:45:02.785 --> 05:45:07.587
LOCATIONS, IN 5 BURROWS, FOR 9
MONTHS AROUND NEW YORK

05:45:10.930 --> 05:45:12.820
 CITY.
AND IT WAS A TRIP TO SEE

05:45:12.821 --> 05:45:15.318
STUDENTS STUDY ME AND MY PROCESS
ON THEIR SCREEN.

05:45:15.854 --> 05:45:19.473
BUT IT WAS EXCITING  TO SEE THIS
PROCESS CAN BE SPREAD AND SCALED

05:45:19.673 --> 05:45:22.263
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THE
ONLY ONE, STANDING IN FRONT OF

05:45:24.299 --> 05:45:26.299
THE

05:45:28.246 --> 05:45:31.516
 CLASSROOM.  I'M GOING TO
SHOW YOU TWO STUDENT PROJECTS.SO

05:45:31.520 --> 05:45:36.431
 WE HAVE A STUDENT RESEARCH
PAGE.

05:45:37.043 --> 05:45:41.002
AND GABRIEL WAS INTERESTED IN
DOING RESEARCH ON THE Q-WORD IN

05:45:41.043 --> 05:45:43.043
AWFUL HIP-HOP.
HE QUICKLY REALIZED THAT WAS TOO

05:45:43.129 --> 05:45:48.732
MUCH DATA FOR HIM TO PROCESS.
SO EAST KIND OF BUMMED OUT.

05:45:48.800 --> 05:45:50.692
SO I WAS LIKE, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO?

05:45:50.693 --> 05:45:53.280
THEN HE REALIZED  IN HIS
RESEARCH, THERE WAS AN ARTIST

05:45:53.615 --> 05:45:58.901
THAT HAD A SONG, WHERE HE
MENTIONS THE N-WORD ALMOST 200

05:45:59.841 --> 05:46:05.586
TIMES SO HE DECIDES TO FOCUS ON
THAT ARTIST, AND CONTENT CODE.

05:46:06.367 --> 05:46:10.718
ALL OF HIS SONGS, THROUGH A LENS

05:46:14.495 --> 05:46:17.869
OF THIS DICTIONARY OF SLANG THAT
GIVES 8

05:46:21.372 --> 05:46:25.498
 MEANINGS OF THE N-WORD
WANT SO YOU'RE SEEING DIGITAL

05:46:26.747 --> 05:46:30.013
CONTENT CODING.
SO THESE ARE THE SONGS ON THE

05:46:30.228 --> 05:46:32.426
DROP DOWN MENU.
ON THE RIGHT, THESE ARE THE

05:46:32.427 --> 05:46:34.427
DIFFERENT

05:46:38.213 --> 05:46:40.213
 DESCRIPTIONS.
SO

05:46:41.884 --> 05:46:44.550
 SOMEONE'S LOVER, SOMEONE
THAT'S REBELLIOUS.

05:46:44.782 --> 05:46:49.049
SOMETHING THAT'S NEGATIVE.  AND
A FILLER THIS IS A PROJECT BY

05:46:49.970 --> 05:46:53.862
EMMANUEL, WHO WAS READING SOME
OF THE ARTICLES ABOUT RAPPERS

05:46:54.199 --> 05:46:59.144
AND RAPS THAT WERE BEING USED AS
TESTIMONY IN COURT AND HE WANTED

05:46:59.854 --> 05:47:04.056
TO INVESTIGATE THE DIFFERENCES
OR WHETHER THERE WAS A

05:47:04.057 --> 05:47:07.987
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRIMES THAT
WERE RAPPED ABOUT, AND ACTUAL

05:47:07.988 --> 05:47:12.158
CRIMES THAT WERE HAPPENING.
SO THIS IS A MAP THAT HE

05:47:17.168 --> 05:47:21.085
 MADE.
CORRELATION, OF COURSE, YOU

05:47:21.086 --> 05:47:24.281
KNOW, AREN'T TIED BUT THERE'S A

05:47:27.299 --> 05:47:31.045
DIFFERENCE.
SO WHEN CRIME IS DOWN,

05:47:31.046 --> 05:47:35.110
BASICALLY, CRIME CRIME RAPS ARE
HIGH.

05:47:35.230 --> 05:47:40.900
AND I'M GOING TO CLOSE WITH THIS
ONE QUOTE BY DJ PREMIERE AND HE

05:47:40.901 --> 05:47:44.425
TALKS ABOUT PRODUCING JAYS-Z'S
FIRST ALBUM.

05:47:44.658 --> 05:47:48.132
HE SAYS ONE THING HE LOVES ABOUT
HIP-HOP IS YOU HAVE TO

05:47:48.133 --> 05:47:53.489
UNDERSTAND HOW TO LISTEN TO T.
JUT BECAUSE JAY Z-SPEAKING IN

05:47:53.706 --> 05:47:55.754
ENGLISH DOESN'T MEAN YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING.

05:47:55.963 --> 05:47:58.490
THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE RAP
RESEARCH LAB.

05:47:58.710 --> 05:48:04.410
TO DO A DEEP LIVE, IN DECODING
THE MOST POPULAR ART FORM IN THE

05:48:06.591 --> 05:48:08.591
WORLD.
THANK

05:48:11.660 --> 05:48:18.942
 YOU.[APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; OUR FINAL SPEAKER BEFORE

05:48:18.943 --> 05:48:23.646
BREAK IS JEFF HANES STYLES WHO
HAS WORKED ON INNOVATIVE SCIENCE

05:48:23.946 --> 05:48:28.563
MEDIA PROJECT, WHEN HE WAS
DIRECTOR AND SENIOR PRODUCER FOR

05:48:28.578 --> 05:48:32.616
CARL SAGIN'S, LAND MARK AND
COSMOS WINNING SERIES.

05:48:33.435 --> 05:48:36.820
HE'S HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE
CROWD AND THE CLOUD AND HOW

05:48:36.821 --> 05:48:40.053
CITIZEN SCIENCE HAS
REVOLUTIONIZED SCIENTIFIC DATA

05:48:40.054 --> 05:48:42.988
SCIENCE BY, FOR AND WITH THE
PEOPLE.

05:48:43.429 --> 05:48:45.995
HOW CITIZEN SCIENCE AND MOBILE
TECH HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE

05:48:45.996 --> 05:48:50.143
COLLECTION AND USE OF SCIENTIFIC
DATA JEFF, TAKE IT AWAY.

05:48:50.173 --> 05:48:54.036
&gt;&gt; THANKS VOICE OF GOD.
APPRECIATE IT.

05:48:54.051 --> 05:48:55.559
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE WELCOME.
[LAUGHTER]

05:48:55.560 --> 05:48:57.661
&gt;&gt; I WAS GOING TO SAY,
INTERACTIVE GOD.

05:48:57.877 --> 05:49:03.335
IT'S EVEN BETTER.
I WAS GOING TO SAY, SOMETHING

05:49:03.336 --> 05:49:06.249
DISH.
BUT EVERY SINGLE TALK HAS BEEN

05:49:06.821 --> 05:49:08.809
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
THANKS TO THE LIBRARY OF

05:49:08.810 --> 05:49:12.048
CONGRESS FOR INVITING US ALL
TODAY AND I'VE GOT SOME

05:49:12.049 --> 05:49:15.066
REFERENCES THAT ACTUALLY TIE
INTO THE SOME OF THE

05:49:15.067 --> 05:49:18.069
THEMES-TALK.
I'VE BEEN A SCIENCE PRODUCER

05:49:18.070 --> 05:49:20.528
SINCE 1980.
IT'S TAKEN ME TO THE END OF THE

05:49:20.536 --> 05:49:25.025
EARTH WHICH IS FORTUNATE.
THEY GIVE YOU HELMETS  TO COVER

05:49:25.041 --> 05:49:28.437
YOUR BALD SPOT, WHICH IS GOOD.
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE CROWD

05:49:28.452 --> 05:49:31.129
IN THE CLOUD.
MY COLLABORATORS, INDITE AT THIS

05:49:31.415 --> 05:49:33.415
TIME FORMER NASA CHIEF
SCIENTIST.

05:49:33.514 --> 05:49:39.405
AND MY COLLABORATOR IN LIFE AND
WORK, WHO IS IN THE FRONT

05:49:42.654 --> 05:49:44.654
THERE.
RECENT GRANDMOTHER.

05:49:45.457 --> 05:49:46.638
CONGRATULATIONS.
[APPLAUSE].

05:49:46.639 --> 05:49:49.414
SEE, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
CONGRATULATES YOU AS WELL.

05:49:49.650 --> 05:49:51.650
ISN'T THIS GREAT.
I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME WORKING

05:49:51.715 --> 05:49:55.339
WITH SOME OF THE MOST CELEBRATED
SCIENTISTS IN THE COUNTRY, AND

05:49:55.836 --> 05:49:57.756
ALSO COMEDIANS LIKE LILLY
TOMLIN.

05:49:57.757 --> 05:50:01.409
WHAT I HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF S&amp;L
I WAS WALKING AROUND YESTERDAY,

05:50:01.410 --> 05:50:08.088
IS THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS HAS A
COLLECTION OF

05:50:13.101 --> 05:50:17.594
 -- DESIGNED TO
INCREASE THE VISIBILITY AND

05:50:17.595 --> 05:50:18.346
PARTICIPATION IN CITIZEN
SCIENCE.

05:50:18.347 --> 05:50:22.383
HOW MANY IN THE AUDIENCE COULD
DEFINE CITIZEN SCIENCE AT A

05:50:22.384 --> 05:50:25.413
COCKTAIL PARTY?
ABOUT FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE OUT OF

05:50:25.953 --> 05:50:29.946
A COUPLE HUNDRED.  THAT'S ONE OF
THE REASONS WE DECIDED WE SHOULD

05:50:29.950 --> 05:50:31.849
DO THE SERIES.
CITIZEN SCIENCE M YOU'LL HEAR

05:50:31.850 --> 05:50:33.904
FROM SOME OF THE CITIZEN
SCIENTISTS YOURSELVES.

05:50:34.020 --> 05:50:38.740
THESE ARE SOME OF THE WORD THAT
IS OF COURSE USED TO DEFINE

05:50:38.741 --> 05:50:40.569
CITIZEN SCIENCE OVER THE PAST
FEW YEARS.

05:50:40.570 --> 05:50:42.715
YOU'LL SEE CYBER IS IN A LOT
THEM.

05:50:42.751 --> 05:50:46.522
A LOT OF THEM HAVE NATURAL
HISTORY ENVIRONMENTS AS PART OF

05:50:46.528 --> 05:50:48.195
THE SUBJECT MATTER.
ONE OF MY FIELD AND TITAN FALL

05:50:48.196 --> 05:50:53.515
ONCE IS NERDS FOR NATURE, AND IS
ACTUALLY A CITIZENS SCIENCE

05:50:53.516 --> 05:50:54.633
PROJECT CALLED NERDS FOR
NATURE.

05:50:54.634 --> 05:50:59.158
ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT,
HOWEVER WOULD BE SCIENCE, BY,

05:50:59.377 --> 05:51:04.323
FOR AND WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU
MAY NOTICE COMES FROM THE

05:51:04.324 --> 05:51:07.959
GETTIESBERG ADDRESS, AND LINCOLN
IS A GREAT PRESENCE IN THE

05:51:11.081 --> 05:51:13.383
LIBRARY OF CONFIDENCE.
WE HAVE CREATED 4 PROGRAMS.

05:51:13.606 --> 05:51:17.876
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A LARGE
NUMBER OF VIDEO CLIPS.

05:51:18.129 --> 05:51:22.463
CROWD AND CLOUD.ORG IS WHERE YOU
CAN FIND ALL THE PROGRAMS

05:51:22.464 --> 05:51:24.772
STREAMING IN REAL TIME IF WHAT
WE SHOW YOU IS OF INTERESTING.

05:51:24.976 --> 05:51:28.206
OUR PREMISES IS TO TRY TO TURN
VIEWERS INTO DUEERS.

05:51:28.323 --> 05:51:32.695
NOT JUST TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
WATCHATION TV SHOW, BUT BE

05:51:32.696 --> 05:51:34.787
ENCOURAGED TO BECOME PART OF THE
STATUS SCIENCE MOVEMENT.

05:51:34.991 --> 05:51:39.945
AND IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE
WITHOUT COLLABORATION OF A

05:51:39.946 --> 05:51:45.818
NUMBER OF AGENCIES.
THIS IS HOW WE BEGIN THE SERIES

05:51:46.031 --> 05:51:51.635
AND THIS PRESENTATION.
&gt;&gt; VIDEO: THE CROWD AND THE

05:51:51.636 --> 05:51:54.885
CLOUD IS MADE POSSIBLE BY MSF --
NSF.

05:51:55.305 --> 05:51:59.859
THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION,
WHERE DISCOVERIES

05:52:04.905 --> 05:52:12.657
 BEGIN.PEOPLE PURSUING THEIR 
PASSIONS,

05:52:12.658 --> 05:52:15.015
AND GENERATING DATA THAT IS
USEFUL FOR RESEARCH.

05:52:15.036 --> 05:52:18.529
&gt;&gt; I LOVE SCIENCE.
I CAN GO SUFFERING FOR SCIENCE.

05:52:18.561 --> 05:52:24.282
&gt;&gt; TECHNOLOGY SAY WAY TO REALLY
GET PEOPLE OUTSIDE AND LOOK MORE

05:52:24.313 --> 05:52:28.125
CAREFULLY AT THE NATURAL WORLD.
&gt;&gt; DOLLAR NOW MORE MOBILE PHONES

05:52:28.346 --> 05:52:30.292
ON EARTH THAN PEOPLE ON OUR
PLANET.

05:52:30.293 --> 05:52:34.752
AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN HELP
SOLVE MAJOR CHALLENGES.

05:52:34.783 --> 05:52:37.533
&gt;&gt; EVERY SINGLEDATE DATA THATTA
POINT HAS A STORY.

05:52:37.969 --> 05:52:42.664
NOW, COMMUNITIES CAN USE SCANS
TO TACKLE LOCAL PROBLEMS.

05:52:42.695 --> 05:52:46.577
&gt;&gt; THE STATE DOESN'T COME OUT
AND SAY, YOU'VE GOT TO CLEAN

05:52:46.578 --> 05:52:50.025
THIS UP.
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE LINKING SENSORS  AND

05:52:50.263 --> 05:52:54.770
CITIZENS  TO FIND SOLUTIONS.
&gt;&gt; I'M LEARNING ABOUT TOXINS.I'M

05:52:55.009 --> 05:52:57.639
 LEARNING HOW TO TEACH OTHER
PEOPLE TO DO WHAT I DO SO THEY

05:52:58.193 --> 05:53:00.858
CAN DO IT FOR

05:53:05.307 --> 05:53:08.089
 THEMSELVES.
COLLABORATING VEE AT CLOUD, THE

05:53:08.242 --> 05:53:13.203
CROWD CAN SAVE TIME, SAVE MONEY
AND SAVE LIVES.

05:53:13.287 --> 05:53:17.224
WE'RE SURELY SMARTER TOGETHER.
I'M WALEED

05:53:21.200 --> 05:53:23.806
 ABDULADI.
I'VE STUDIED EARTH ICE SHEETS

05:53:24.564 --> 05:53:29.292
FROM AIRCRAFT, AND I WAS NASA
CHIEF WHEN CURIOSITY LANDED ON

05:53:29.307 --> 05:53:33.348
MARS.
SO I KNOW BIG DATA AND BIG

05:53:33.349 --> 05:53:36.433
SCIENCE.
BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT NO LONGER

05:53:37.017 --> 05:53:40.048
IS SCIENCE SOMETHING DONE ONLY
BY PROPOSALS  IN A LAB.

05:53:40.351 --> 05:53:44.628
NO MORE IS DATA JUST THE
PROPERTY OF CORPORATIONS AND

05:53:44.629 --> 05:53:46.630
GOVERNMENT.
&gt;&gt; FOR YEARS, YOU'VE WATCHED

05:53:46.631 --> 05:53:52.583
SCIENCE ON PUBLIC TELEVISION.
NOW, YOU'RE INVITED TO DO

05:53:52.584 --> 05:53:54.584
SCIENCE.
&gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE

05:53:55.116 --> 05:53:58.432
GOT A WIDE VARIETY OF PROBLEMSES
WE FEATURED IN THE SERIES AND A

05:53:58.479 --> 05:54:00.746
WIDE VARIETY OF FOLKS WHO WERE
INVOLVED.

05:54:00.795 --> 05:54:03.450
CITIZEN SCIENCE HAS A LONG
HISTORY, THE BACKGROUND HERE IS

05:54:03.935 --> 05:54:07.756
THOMAS JEFFERSON'S WEATHER
RECORDS, DATING BACK TO THE

05:54:07.757 --> 05:54:12.199
1770'S AND TODAY, CITIZEN
SCIENTISTS LOOKING AT WHETHER

05:54:12.236 --> 05:54:17.264
20,000 OBSERVERS ARE RECORDING
DAILY PRECIPITATION

05:54:17.265 --> 05:54:22.317
MEASUREMENTS, ON THE LEFT HAND
SIDE, IN MICHELLE OBAMA'S

05:54:22.318 --> 05:54:24.145
VEGETABLE GARDEN.
THESE ARE CONTRIBUTING DATA THAT

05:54:24.146 --> 05:54:30.520
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
USES  TO UPDATE FLASH FLOOD

05:54:30.521 --> 05:54:32.280
WARNINGS.
HISTORY OF THE CHRISTMAS BIRD

05:54:32.281 --> 05:54:34.577
COUNT GOES BACK TO THE
19HUNDREDS.

05:54:35.687 --> 05:54:38.708
ONE OF THE LONGEST RUNNING
PROJECT IN THE UNITED STATES.BUT

05:54:40.608 --> 05:54:43.385
 CONTEMPORARY CITIZEN SCIENCE
INCLUDES MILLENNIALS.

05:54:43.610 --> 05:54:46.135
PEOPLE THAT ARE A PART OF THE
PUBLIC LAB.

05:54:46.201 --> 05:54:48.201
IT MAKES ME THINK OF ARCADE FIRE
ON TOUR.

05:54:48.519 --> 05:54:51.911
BUT THESE ARE CITIZEN SCIENTISTS
FLYING.

05:54:52.481 --> 05:54:55.434
BALLOONS UNDERNEATH KITES  TO
DOCUMENT THE B.P. OIL SPILL OFF

05:54:55.693 --> 05:54:59.495
THE DEEP WATER HORIZON.
CONTEMPORARY CITIZEN SCIENTIST

05:54:59.697 --> 05:55:01.697
INCLUDES PUTTING

05:55:05.742 --> 05:55:09.438
 SENSORS,
MICROSCOPIC FENCE TO LOOK AT SEA

05:55:09.499 --> 05:55:11.308
TEMPERATURE.
LIKE I SAID, A GREAT VARIETY.

05:55:11.346 --> 05:55:14.541
TRYING TO TIE MY PRESENTATION TO
THE THEMES OF THIS CONFERENCE,

05:55:14.760 --> 05:55:18.695
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THREE
DIFFERENT KINDS OF DATA

05:55:18.696 --> 05:55:22.127
COLLECTION AND SHARING IN SOME
CASES, IT'S A QUESTION OF

05:55:22.128 --> 05:55:25.646
PUTTING DATA ON THE MAP AND
HELPING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

05:55:26.515 --> 05:55:28.961
THE WEST OAKLAND ENVIRONMENTAL
INDICATOR'S PROJECT.

05:55:28.993 --> 05:55:33.308
IT WAS FOUNDED TO LOOK AT TRUCK
ROUTES GOING THROUGH WEST

05:55:33.309 --> 05:55:37.662
OAKLAND AND HOW TRUCK ROOTS WERE
CORE RESPONDING  TO ASTHMA

05:55:37.663 --> 05:55:44.961
ATTACKS IN SENIOR CITIZEN CARE
CENTERS AND DAYCARE CENTERS.

05:55:45.469 --> 05:55:48.296
THEY'D GO OUT AND COUNT TRUCKS 
AND GOING TO CITY GOVERNMENT TO

05:55:48.496 --> 05:55:53.994
GET THEM TO MOVE THE TRUCK
ROUTES AWAY FROM THE HOST

05:55:53.995 --> 05:55:56.223
HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS.
THEY HAVE CONTINUED THEIR WORK

05:55:56.486 --> 05:56:00.023
REACHING OUT TO KISSED,
IATRIAING  TO GET KIDS EXCITED

05:56:00.031 --> 05:56:06.435
ABOUT THE NEW GENERATION AND
THIS NEXTY CLIP IS HOW THE

05:56:06.436 --> 05:56:08.856
TEAMS, HOW EXCITED THE TEAMS
GET.

05:56:09.178 --> 05:56:11.446
WHEN DOING THEIR RESEARCH.
THEY WERE USINGS THEIR

05:56:11.447 --> 05:56:14.503
ENVIRONMENT, THEIR COMMUNITY AS
THE SOURCE OF

05:56:18.277 --> 05:56:19.443
 DATA.
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE STUDENT HAS BEEN

05:56:19.444 --> 05:56:22.289
ABLE TO GO OUT AND WALK AROUND
THE COMMUNITY.

05:56:22.557 --> 05:56:25.698
AND COLLECT DATA AND THEN
OBSERVE THINGS, THEY UNDERSTAND

05:56:25.710 --> 05:56:32.722
THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DATA
AND THE SOURCES, AND THE

05:56:32.723 --> 05:56:36.337
SOLUTION THEY'RE INTERESTED IN.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS CALLED THE DUST

05:56:36.338 --> 05:56:37.660
TRACK.
IT MALICIOUS HOW MUCH DUST IS IN

05:56:37.661 --> 05:56:40.492
THE AIR.
PARTICULAR MATTER IS THE LITTLE

05:56:40.715 --> 05:56:43.620
DUST PARTICLE THAT IS WE CAN'T

05:56:48.649 --> 05:56:55.637
SEE.THE AIR FILTER IN THERE IS A

05:57:00.663 --> 05:57:02.663
CARTRIDGE.

05:57:04.072 --> 05:57:08.168
IF YOU THINK ABOUT METAL.
THIS IS MET

05:57:13.172 --> 05:57:16.300
 AMP BECAUSE OF THE
LOW COST SENSORS AVAILABLE ^,

05:57:16.315 --> 05:57:18.754
AND THE SMART PHONES, ARE THE
DEVICES.

05:57:19.224 --> 05:57:24.211
STUDENTS CAN COLLECT DATA AND
IMMEDIATELY BEGIN INTERPRETING

05:57:25.968 --> 05:57:27.965
THEM.
IN DECEMBER 2015, SOME OF THE

05:57:27.966 --> 05:57:31.869
STUDENTS PRESENTLIED THEIR
FINDINGS AT THE AMERICAN

05:57:31.870 --> 05:57:37.089
GEOPHYSICAL UNIT, ONE OF THE
LARGEST AND BIZZEST GATHERINGS

05:57:37.136 --> 05:57:41.439
OF PROPOSAL EARTH SCIENCES.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S AMAZING.

05:57:41.470 --> 05:57:43.572
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW BIG A
DEAL.

05:57:43.788 --> 05:57:45.998
ONCE I STARTED LOOKING INTO T WE
HAVE SOMETHING TO BRING TO THE

05:57:46.655 --> 05:57:48.655
TABLE TO.
PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR WHAT WE HAVE

05:57:48.915 --> 05:57:50.915
TO SAY.
IT'S KIND OF

05:57:56.670 --> 05:57:58.232
 EXCITING.
WE MIGHT CHANGE SOMETHING.

05:57:58.233 --> 05:58:03.240
&gt;&gt; WE SOMETIMES RIGHTEN THE
STATISTICIANSES BECAUSE THEY

05:58:03.241 --> 05:58:05.864
WOULD PREFER TO HAVE A LITTLE
BIT OF PERFECTLY PRESS TEEN,

05:58:05.865 --> 05:58:11.351
ABSOLUTELY, YOU KNOW, 100% DATA
FROM A MILLION DOLLAR MACHINE

05:58:11.567 --> 05:58:15.595
AND WE'RE SAYING NO, NO, LET'S
TAKE THIS 200-DOLLAR MACHINE AND

05:58:15.787 --> 05:58:19.242
START MAKING DECISIONS, BASED ON
IT.

05:58:19.969 --> 05:58:24.028
BUT THE NOTION IS, IF YOU HAD
1 MILLION-DOLLAR ON MACHINES,

05:58:24.029 --> 05:58:27.701
CAN YOU DO SO MUCH.
BUT IF YOU HAD A

05:58:32.138 --> 05:58:36.774
 MILLION
100-MACHINES, THEN WE'D START TO

05:58:39.213 --> 05:58:44.380
ADJUST BEHAVIOR IMMEDIATELY.
&gt;&gt; SO THE SECOND CATEGORY OF

05:58:44.381 --> 05:58:47.094
CITIZEN SCIENCE I'M GOING TO
TALK ABOUT WHERE THIS IS NO DATA

05:58:47.095 --> 05:58:50.213
THERE ARE NO AGENCIES IN
GATHERING THE DATA AND SHARING

05:58:50.617 --> 05:58:52.219
THAT.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FROM THE

05:58:52.220 --> 05:58:55.475
SECOND PROGRAM, WHICH IS CALLED
CITIZENS PLUS SCIENTISTS OF

05:58:55.476 --> 05:59:00.915
WHERE A CONCERNED CITIZEN, DEB,
YOU'LL SEE HER IN THE PIECE.

05:59:01.148 --> 05:59:05.680
BUT BECAUSE IT'S AN EDITED
SEGMENT, THAT'S YET NAMES ARE

05:59:05.894 --> 05:59:09.473
HERE AT THE BEGINNING, WAS
CONCERN ABOUT AIR POLLUTION IN

05:59:09.721 --> 05:59:11.895
HER AREA.
CONCERNING GAS AND OIL

05:59:11.896 --> 05:59:15.746
DEVELOPMENT.
SHE WENT TO THE NGO, AND YOU'LL

05:59:15.959 --> 05:59:19.087
SEE HOW DATA IS CAPTURED, AND
SHARED THAT THROUGHOUT PEER

05:59:19.088 --> 05:59:23.022
REVIEW PROCESS, WITH A BIG
RESULT IN TERMS OF STATE

05:59:23.023 --> 05:59:25.618
POLICY.
SO IT GOES ALL WAIT FROM DATA

05:59:25.930 --> 05:59:28.157
COLLECTION, TO SOCIAL GOOD,
SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL

05:59:33.969 --> 05:59:36.242
 RESULTS.
&gt;&gt; IT TOOK OUT RIGHT OUT OF A

05:59:37.854 --> 05:59:40.739
HUNDRED SEMI LOADS.
YOU KNOW, THE TRAFFIC WENT FROM

05:59:40.955 --> 05:59:45.499
MAYBE THREE, FOUR CARDS A WEEK
TO 50 A DAY.

05:59:45.556 --> 05:59:49.049
TONS OF DUST ON THIS COUNTY
ROAD.

05:59:50.052 --> 05:59:53.192
THEY'D LIGHT THE FLAIR ^, AND
THE WHOLE BOTTOM WOULD SHAKE.SO 

05:59:53.193 --> 05:59:57.487
OUR HOUSE WOULD JUST SHAKE.
LOTS OF

06:00:02.527 --> 06:00:04.881
 NOISE.
THERE WERE SPILLS, AND LEAKS,

06:00:05.192 --> 06:00:07.192
NOBODY CLEANS TUP.
NOBODY SAYS GOING.

06:00:07.194 --> 06:00:10.383
THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT.  THE STATE
DOESN'T COME OUT AND SAY, YOU'VE

06:00:10.829 --> 06:00:15.088
GOT TO CLEAN THIS UP.
THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS IS

06:00:15.493 --> 06:00:19.345
THE SITES ARE SELECTED.
THE CITIZEN SCIENTISTS ARE

06:00:19.346 --> 06:00:22.420
TRAINED ONSITE BY OURSELVES.
THEY HAVE GOT A SET NUMBER OF

06:00:22.421 --> 06:00:25.161
SAMPLES THEY CAN TAKE.
SO THE SAMPLES ARE TAKEN.

06:00:27.814 --> 06:00:30.770
LITERALLY, TAKING A PLASTIC
BUCKET AND PUT SOMETHING

06:00:30.771 --> 06:00:33.977
STAINLESS STEEL ON IT, THAT WILL
HOLD THE SAMPLE BAG.

06:00:34.132 --> 06:00:39.290
THE BUCKET IS THE BODY.
THE BAG IS THE LUNG, AND THERE'S

06:00:39.499 --> 06:00:43.381
A PUMP THAT SERVICE AS YOUR
DIAPHRAM THAT PUMPS THE AIR OUT,

06:00:43.849 --> 06:00:46.024
CREATING NEGATIVE PRESSURE.
OPENING THE BAG, AND BRINGING IN

06:00:46.025 --> 06:00:49.553
AIR SO IT CAN BE SEALED AND SENT
TO THE LAB FOR TESTING.

06:00:51.594 --> 06:00:56.634
THEY PROCESS IT IMMEDIATELY.
&gt;&gt; BUCKET BRIGADE TECHNIQUES

06:00:56.635 --> 06:01:01.644
HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY THE EPA
AND ARE FOUND USEFUL WHERE ANY

06:01:01.660 --> 06:01:07.331
OF THE SENSORS ARE LACKING.
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T THINK I'D FIND

06:01:07.332 --> 06:01:10.242
MUCH.
AND WE FOUND CREATING DATA

06:01:10.243 --> 06:01:11.427
MISSIONS OFF THE FREAKIN'
CHART.

06:01:11.428 --> 06:01:15.359
&gt;&gt; WE FOUND, MANY OF THE SAMPLES
EXCEEDED THOSE STANDARDS.

06:01:15.575 --> 06:01:19.596
SOME WERE SOMETHING LIKE 10,000
TIMES ABOVE THE STANDARD.

06:01:20.582 --> 06:01:24.976
MANY OF THE TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT
ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER WHICH

06:01:25.213 --> 06:01:28.904
WE FOUND IN THIS REPORT.
IN ONE CASE, 22 MILLION TIMES

06:01:29.114 --> 06:01:34.842
OVER THE EPA CANCER RISK.
&gt;&gt; THESE WERE ENORMOUS

06:01:34.843 --> 06:01:38.181
RELEASES.
MANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE

06:01:38.182 --> 06:01:40.382
NEURAL TOXINS.
HIGH CONCENTRATION THAT IS CAN

06:01:41.625 --> 06:01:45.955
ACTUALLY CAUSE COMB A. BUT AT
LOWER CONCENTRATIONS, THEY TEND

06:01:45.971 --> 06:01:49.349
TO REDUCE BRAIN FUNCTION.
THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS, BIGGEST

06:01:49.481 --> 06:01:53.604
ONE IS CANCER.
SEVERAL OF THESE ARE KNOWN HUMAN

06:01:53.982 --> 06:01:57.444
CASEINOGENS.
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE STARTED DOING THE

06:01:57.446 --> 06:02:01.304
BRIAN WAS GATE, 5, 6-STATE
BUCKET BRIAN WAS GATE.

06:02:01.456 --> 06:02:03.801
WE DIDN'T INTEND ON DOING THE
PEER REVIEWED ARM.

06:02:03.829 --> 06:02:05.530
WE WERE JUST GOING TO DO THE
REPORT.

06:02:05.531 --> 06:02:09.680
&gt;&gt; I BECAME INVOLVED IN THE
TRACKING STUDY WHEN THE GROUPS

06:02:09.998 --> 06:02:15.091
THAT HAD COORDINATED THE
COMMUNITY BASED ACTIVITIES

06:02:15.092 --> 06:02:17.265
APPROACHED ME FOR ASSISTANCE
DOING THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

06:02:17.266 --> 06:02:21.418
OF THE DATA ABOUT A WRITING UP
THE PUBLICATION AND GET TOGETHER

06:02:22.303 --> 06:02:25.553
PUBLISHED  IN A PEER REVIEW
JOURNAL.

06:02:25.723 --> 06:02:29.158
WHENEVER THERE IS THIS KIND OF
STUDY, HAVING A PEER REVIEW PUN

06:02:29.378 --> 06:02:31.378
OCCASIONS SORT OF THE GOOD

06:02:33.538 --> 06:02:34.416
HOUSEKEEPING SEAL OF LEGITIMACY
FOR A STUDY.

06:02:34.417 --> 06:02:40.564
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENS IS EVERYTHING
DISSES IT.

06:02:40.580 --> 06:02:43.966
SO THE PEER REVIEWED ARTICLE WAS
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT

06:02:43.967 --> 06:02:47.091
GAVE VALIDITY TO CITIZEN
SCIENCE.

06:02:47.106 --> 06:02:51.109
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S WHY WE GOT
TAKEN SO SERIOUSLY.

06:02:51.929 --> 06:02:54.881
THAT A JOURNAL ARTICLE HAD BEEN
PUBLISHED AND THIS IS WHAT

06:02:54.882 --> 06:02:58.376
ACADEMICS, SCIENTISTS  AND
DOCTORS WERE SAYING ABOUT THE

06:02:59.881 --> 06:03:01.881
EXTREME HAZARD AND THERE WAS
WIDESPREAD COVERAGE ACROSS THE

06:03:02.219 --> 06:03:05.920
U.S. AND TILE, GLOBALLY, OF BOTH
THE PEER REVIEWED STUDY, AND THE

06:03:06.156 --> 06:03:07.887
REPORT AND IT HAD A MAJOR
IMPACT.

06:03:07.888 --> 06:03:11.437
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE GREATEST
INFLUENCE FROM THE WARNING SIGNS

06:03:13.445 --> 06:03:17.658
REPORT WAS FOR THE
[INDISCERNIBLE] IN NEW YORK.

06:03:17.674 --> 06:03:24.363
&gt;&gt; OUR TRACKING STUDY WAS WAIVED
BITE COMMISSIONER, WHEN ME MADE

06:03:24.942 --> 06:03:28.049
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK WAS BANNING

06:03:28.757 --> 06:03:31.219
TRACKING.
[END OF VIDEO]

06:03:31.889 --> 06:03:37.239
SO THE LAST GENRE IS REALLY LIKE
CROWD SOURCING WANT SO MUCH DATA

06:03:37.292 --> 06:03:43.226
OR LACK OF DATA IN THE CASE OF
TRACKING, AND THE DEEP WATER

06:03:43.227 --> 06:03:46.909
HORIZON, THERE'S SO MUCH DATA
COMING OUT OF RESEARCH LAB, YOU

06:03:46.994 --> 06:03:50.129
COULD CROWD SOURCE IT MUCH
FASTER THAN THE WORK CAN BE DONE

06:03:50.214 --> 06:03:54.218
BY RESEARCHERS THEMSELVES.
SO THIS STORY IS ABOUT FOLKS UP

06:03:55.049 --> 06:03:58.413
AT CORNELL WHO WERE LOOKING  TO
SEE IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT THE

06:03:59.974 --> 06:04:02.989
CAUSES OF ALZYMEERS.
THEY EXPERIMENT ON MICE, THEY

06:04:03.194 --> 06:04:07.151
TAKE VIDEOS OF MOUSE BRAINS AND
TASTE PROBLEM THAT TAKES THEM A

06:04:07.535 --> 06:04:13.317
WEEK TO CAPTURE THE DATA BUT A
YEAR TO ANALYZE T. THEY BORROWED

06:04:15.177 --> 06:04:18.416
FROM, EXAMPLES  FROM SUCCESSFUL
GAME FEED CITIZENS PROJECTS,

06:04:18.417 --> 06:04:22.459
INCLUDING THE NASA STAR DUST
MISSION, WHERE 30,000 PEOPLE

06:04:22.460 --> 06:04:27.638
PLAYING GAME WERE ESSENTIALLY
ABLE TO FIND TRACES OF

06:04:27.639 --> 06:04:32.354
INTERSTELLAR PARTICLES AND
I-WIRE, LOOKING AT NEURONS IN

06:04:32.385 --> 06:04:35.766
THE BRAIN.
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER, THEY WERE

06:04:35.767 --> 06:04:40.635
ABLE TO BORROW FROM ALL OF THE
LESSONS OF WEB GAMES, IN TERMS

06:04:40.636 --> 06:04:42.954
OF OF LEADER BOARDS,
COMPETITIONS, FIGHTING TO HAVE

06:04:43.162 --> 06:04:47.456
YOUR NAME UP THERE AT THE TOP OF
THE LEADER BOARD AND THIS IS HOW

06:04:47.779 --> 06:04:51.423
A CITIZENS PROJECT WAS DEMOED 
IN A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY IN

06:04:51.424 --> 06:04:53.851
FLORIDA, PLAYING THE STORE
CATCHER'S GAME.

06:04:53.883 --> 06:05:00.663
CAN YOU SEAT EXCITEMENT THE
SENIOR CITIZENS GOT, FROM TRYING

06:05:00.901 --> 06:05:05.414
TO SPEEDUP ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
&gt;&gt; VIDEO: 

06:05:05.752 --> 06:05:08.724
[INDISCERNIBLE] RELEASED ITS
STAR CATCHER'S GAME.

06:05:08.758 --> 06:05:11.298
BASED ON THE STAR DUST INNER
FACE.

06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:15.198
THE CROWD WAS INVITED TO HELP
CROWD SOURCE THE ANALYSIS FOR

06:05:15.916 --> 06:05:18.962
BLOCKED BLOOD VESSELS.
SOME OF THE FIRST PLAYERS WERE

06:05:19.617 --> 06:05:22.551
IN CENTRAL FLORIDA.
THEY WERE RETIREES WHO HAS

06:05:22.552 --> 06:05:24.732
CHOSEN A WARM CLIENT IN A
COMMUNITY WITH PLENTY TO DO.

06:05:24.763 --> 06:05:31.146
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE FAMILY
FRIENDS, SOMEBODY CLOSE TO YOU,

06:05:31.381 --> 06:05:34.950
THAT HAD OR DID HAVE ALZHEIMER'S
OR YOU HAVE IT?

06:05:35.186 --> 06:05:39.202
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.
IF ONLY THE SCIENTISTS WORKED ON

06:05:39.724 --> 06:05:43.953
IT, IT MIGHT TAKE AS MUCH AS 30
YEARS AND FOR MOST IT'S NOT

06:05:43.954 --> 06:05:48.206
GOING TO BE A BIG BENEFIT.
THIS IS WHAT THE GAME LOOKS

06:05:48.207 --> 06:05:50.682
LIKE.
AND YOU CAN GET IT ON YOUR

06:05:50.683 --> 06:05:53.367
PHONE, YOUR TABLET, YOUR LAP
TOP.

06:05:53.387 --> 06:05:54.365
&gt;&gt; DOES THE GAME CHANGE EVERY
DAY.

06:05:54.366 --> 06:05:56.727
&gt;&gt; YES.

06:06:01.781 --> 06:06:09.746
YES.
HOW MANY THINK THAT IT'S

06:06:09.747 --> 06:06:12.939
SLOWING?
HOW MANY THINK IT'S

06:06:16.866 --> 06:06:18.866
 SOLVED?
SHOULD WE FIND OUT?

06:06:18.957 --> 06:06:21.229
TRY AND SOLVE THEN.
I'VE GOT 402 POINTS.

06:06:21.259 --> 06:06:25.149
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[LAUGHTER]HERE WE

06:06:29.668 --> 06:06:35.658
 GO.
EVERY TIME WE FIND A SOLVE ONE

06:06:37.469 --> 06:06:38.988
--
&gt;&gt;

06:06:38.989 --> 06:06:43.193
[END OF VIDEO PRACTICAL.
&gt;&gt; WE CAN HELP MY GENERATION.I'M

06:06:43.508 --> 06:06:44.953
 64.
WHILE THIS IS GOING TO HELP MY

06:06:44.954 --> 06:06:47.162
MOM, THIS IS GOING TO HELP KIDS
MY AGE.

06:06:47.194 --> 06:06:53.804
&gt;&gt; EYES ON OWLS WILL KEEP
REFINING, IT'S GAME INTERFACE B.

06:06:54.119 --> 06:06:58.058
GREATEST IMPACT WILL COME FROM
THE LIMITLESS POWER OF THE

06:07:03.104 --> 06:07:07.534
CROWD.
ONE OF THE COMMON QUESTIONS

06:07:07.535 --> 06:07:12.872
ABOUT CITIZEN SCIENCE, IS, IS
THE DATA QUALITY RELIABLE

06:07:12.873 --> 06:07:14.248
ENOUGH.
AND THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND

06:07:14.249 --> 06:07:18.426
THAT RELATIVE TO THE LABORATORY
GRADE RESEARCH, THE CROWD IS

06:07:18.427 --> 06:07:21.433
DOING VERY WELL.
ORIGINALLY, THEY THOUGHT THEY

06:07:21.833 --> 06:07:23.827
WERE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE
DEVELOPMENT MEMBERS OF THE CROWD

06:07:23.828 --> 06:07:26.692
TO VALIDATE EACH RESULT.
THEY HAVE GONE DOWN TO SEVEN,

06:07:26.909 --> 06:07:31.014
EIGHT PEOPLE, LOOKING AT EACH
PIECE OF DATA TO GET QUALITY

06:07:31.015 --> 06:07:36.055
RESULTS WANT SO DATA QUALITY IS
OFTEN RAISED ABOUT CITIZEN

06:07:36.056 --> 06:07:37.973
SCIENCE.
THE QUALITY OF MANY CITIZEN

06:07:37.974 --> 06:07:39.334
SCIENCE PROJECT HAS BEEN
DEMONSTRATED  IN STATISTICS.

06:07:39.335 --> 06:07:42.622
I THINK ANY OF YOU WOULD FIND
CONVINCING.

06:07:42.669 --> 06:07:46.235
OUR SERIES WAS ON THE AIR BACK
IN APRIL AND MAY.  AND PBS

06:07:46.236 --> 06:07:48.991
STATIONS WILL BE RUNNING IT ON
TO THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.

06:07:49.120 --> 06:07:51.149
JUST LAST WEEKEND, WE DID A
GLOBAL

06:07:55.385 --> 06:07:58.350
 CATCH-A-31, MOBILE ON THE
STREET MAP, MAP-A-TONS, AND GIVE

06:07:59.207 --> 06:08:00.848
THEM PIZZA.
TO DO MAPPING OF STREETS.

06:08:00.849 --> 06:08:07.352
THIS TIME, EYES ON ALZ, 22 TOO
MANY TEAMS, SIX DIFFERENT

06:08:07.353 --> 06:08:10.795
CONTINENTS, PLAYING A GAME,
WITHIN AN HOUR TO SEE WHO COULD

06:08:11.248 --> 06:08:14.550
ACTUALLY CODE THE LARGEST NUMBER
OF STALLS AND YOU CAN SEE SOME

06:08:14.782 --> 06:08:18.606
OF THE PEOPLE THERE.
GO GUATEMALA.

06:08:21.157 --> 06:08:25.102
EL SALVADOR, CHILE, CHAIN AMP
PEOPLE WERE ON LINE, PLAYING

06:08:25.103 --> 06:08:27.103
GAME WHEN, WE DID A LIVE ZOOM
HANG OUT.

06:08:27.147 --> 06:08:29.248
THE WINNERS WERE ACTUALLY DOWN
IN CHILE.

06:08:29.479 --> 06:08:35.957
YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ANNOTATED
1955 EXAMPLES OF BRAIN SCIENCE

06:08:36.888 --> 06:08:39.956
AND THEN THEY CELEBRATED AND
EVERYBODY GOOD GOT TO SHARE IN

06:08:40.534 --> 06:08:43.814
THAT.
ASK THE SCIENCE HAS BECOME A

06:08:43.815 --> 06:08:49.773
GLOBAL PHENOMENON WITH CITIZEN
SCIENCE IN AUSTRALIA, AND EUROPE

06:08:49.774 --> 06:08:52.616
BEING STRONG.
SOME OF THE APPS DEVELOPED  IN

06:08:52.653 --> 06:08:55.136
SPAIN ARE BEING USED HERE IN THE
UNITED STATES AS WELL.

06:08:55.156 --> 06:08:59.859
THIS IS CALLED MOSQUITO ALERT
WITH THE CONCERN BAZOOKA.

06:08:59.990 --> 06:09:04.300
GOING THAT CITIZENS CAN DO TO
REPORT THE AREAS IN WHICH THERE

06:09:04.900 --> 06:09:10.989
IS A BREEDING SITE FOR MOSQUITO
SYSTEM VERY IMPORTANT.

06:09:11.129 --> 06:09:15.872
THIS VIDEO SHOWS YOU THESE ARE
THE SITES OF TRADITIONAL

06:09:15.873 --> 06:09:18.717
LOCATIONS OF LIVE TRAPS.
BUT THEY'RE FAIRLY LIMITED. 

06:09:18.718 --> 06:09:21.444
THIS IS THE NUMBER OF CITIZEN
SCIENTIST REPORT THAT IS CAME

06:09:22.461 --> 06:09:24.461
IN, IN SPAIN.
SO MY TIME IS UP.

06:09:24.523 --> 06:09:26.946
COFFEE BREAK IS LOOMING.  I'M
GOING TO JUST ZIP OVER THE NEXT

06:09:27.179 --> 06:09:33.845
FEW THINGS, JUST TO SAY THAT
THERE IS AN NSF PROJECT USING $6

06:09:34.061 --> 06:09:36.061
MICROSCOPES  TO ATTACH TO THE
SMART PHONES THAT ARE ALSO PART

06:09:36.148 --> 06:09:42.654
OF TODAY'S CITIZEN SCIENCE
REVOLUTION AND THAT I'LL END IT

06:09:43.486 --> 06:09:46.012
HERE BY SAYING IT'S A REVOLUTION
THAT IS HAPPENING, POWERED BY

06:09:46.798 --> 06:09:48.607
PEOPLE.
IT IS REALLY ANSWERING

06:09:48.608 --> 06:09:51.313
OCCURRENCE THE COMMUNITIES  AND
CITIZENS HAVE BUT IT'S USING THE

06:09:52.028 --> 06:09:56.451
TOOLS OF SCIENCE.
IT'S GENERATING DATA FROM THE

06:09:56.489 --> 06:09:59.930
ENVIRONMENT, ANALYZING T
COLLABORATE WITHING SCIENTISTS

06:09:59.931 --> 06:10:03.610
AND DELIVERING BACK SOLUTION
THAT IS WORTH SO CITIZENS PLUS

06:10:03.972 --> 06:10:07.970
SENSORS, WORKING FOR SOLUTIONS.

SO HOW DOES THIS BEGIN IN THIS
1999, I GAVE AN ASSIGNMENT TO MY

06:29:38.601 --> 06:29:40.601
PHONETICS CLASS AND THEY WERE
INTERESTED IN TEACHING

06:29:44.575 --> 06:29:47.470
 ESL SO
THEY WENT OUT AND RECORDED

06:29:47.471 --> 06:29:50.355
NONNATIVE SPEAKERS AND WE
SYSTEMATIZE TIES TODAY AND PUT

06:29:51.055 --> 06:29:55.364
IT ON THE WEB AND IT'S BEEN ON
THE WEB SINCE 1992.

06:29:55.496 --> 06:30:03.029
IT HAS BEEN PICKED UP, AND WE
WANT TO THANK THEM FOR KEEP

06:30:03.030 --> 06:30:06.164
TONGUE.
WHAT'S THE PURPOSE-ARCHIVE?

06:30:07.254 --> 06:30:10.672
TO DEMYSTIFY AND SCIENTIFICALLY
STUDY ENGLISH ACCENTS, BY THE

06:30:11.561 --> 06:30:13.901
WAY, AND THE DATABASE CONTINUES
TO EXPAND.

06:30:14.102 --> 06:30:17.053
THE PURPOSE HAS CURRENTLY,
TODAY, IT

06:30:20.161 --> 06:30:26.506
 HAS 2399 SAMPLES, 3310
NATIVE BACKGROUNDS FROM ASL TO

06:30:27.493 --> 06:30:29.957
ZULU.
175 COUNTRIES ARE REPRESENTED.

06:30:32.326 --> 06:30:35.975
THERE'S 165,400 60 WORDS AT THE
MOMENT MUCH THAT'S USED BY A

06:30:35.976 --> 06:30:40.537
VARIETY OF VISITORS LIKE
LINGUISTS, ESL TEACHERS, SPEECH

06:30:42.039 --> 06:30:44.543
PATHOLOGISTS, ACTORS, AND MOST
OF THE TIME, PEOPLE DOING

06:30:44.544 --> 06:30:47.023
DRINKING GAMES.
THESE ARE ALL THE LANGUAGES THAT

06:30:48.953 --> 06:30:50.535
ARE REPRESENTED, LANGUAGE
BACKGROUNDS.

06:30:50.536 --> 06:30:53.692
EVERYONE IS READING THE SAME
ENGLISH PARAGRAPH.

06:30:53.801 --> 06:30:56.175
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE ARCHIVE A
BIT CURE RATER MEEK.

06:30:56.847 --> 06:31:04.155
THE ARCHITECTURE INCLUDES
ILLICIT PARAGRAPH, AUDIO SAMPLE,

06:31:04.508 --> 06:31:10.014
SOME DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
ABOUT EACH SPEAKER, MAPS OF

06:31:10.015 --> 06:31:12.677
LOCATIONS, PHONETIC
TRANSCRIPTIONS, WHICH I'LL SHOW

06:31:13.238 --> 06:31:17.867
YOU A SAMPLE OF IN A MOMENT.
WHAT MAKES A GERMAN SPEAKER

06:31:17.868 --> 06:31:22.513
DIFFERENT FROM A ZULUSPEAKER OF
ENGLISH.

06:31:22.819 --> 06:31:25.581
SEGMENT INVENTORIES OF ENGLISH
LANGUAGE AND IT HAS THE

06:31:25.582 --> 06:31:28.427
OPPORTUNITY FOR REMOTE RESEARCH
TORSE SEND IN ACCENTS  FROM ALL

06:31:28.643 --> 06:31:36.476
OVER THE WORD.
69 WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH, THE

06:31:37.551 --> 06:31:43.269
SAME AS THE PLEASE CALL STELLA
PARAGRAPH.

06:31:43.805 --> 06:31:47.862
THAT'S THE WHOLE PARAGRAPH.
EVERYONE READS T. WE HAVE A

06:31:47.863 --> 06:31:52.746
STRICTING PROTOCOL.  AND WE
REDUCE IT TO MP3, 28 BITS.

06:31:53.068 --> 06:31:58.893
ANDLET SEE IF THIS WILL WORK FOR
YOU.

06:31:59.109 --> 06:32:02.515
TELL ME IF YOU THINK THIS IS A
NONNATIVE.

06:32:02.573 --> 06:32:04.065
(INAUDIBLE).
&gt;&gt; CAN WE TURN IT UP A LITTLE

06:32:04.066 --> 06:32:06.646
BIT.
I'LL DO IT

06:32:11.379 --> 06:32:13.234
 AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; (INAUDIBLE).

06:32:13.235 --> 06:32:17.603
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HEAR ALL THAT?
&gt;&gt; PLEASE CALL STILL A.

06:32:17.623 --> 06:32:20.738
&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, THOSE ARE THREE
NONNATIVES.

06:32:20.754 --> 06:32:22.754
CAN YOU GUESS THE LANGUAGES?
NO.

06:32:22.802 --> 06:32:30.190
THE FIST ONE IS EMPARIC.
SECOND ONE IS MANDARIN CHINESE

06:32:30.343 --> 06:32:35.096
AND THE THIRD ONE IS RUSSIAN. 
THE SPEAKER DEMOGRAPHICS COME

06:32:35.344 --> 06:32:39.836
LIKE THIS.
WE ASK THEM THEIR NATIVE

06:32:39.837 --> 06:32:41.554
LANGUAGE.
THERE ARE 310 OF THEM AT THE

06:32:41.555 --> 06:32:45.646
HOME.
IT'S LINKED TO AN ETHNOLOG

06:32:45.647 --> 06:32:49.130
CODE.
WE ASK WHAT OTHER LANGUAGES THEY

06:32:53.919 --> 06:32:56.891
KNOW.
LENGTH OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE THE

06:32:57.098 --> 06:32:59.098
GENDER AND AGE OF THE
INDIVIDUAL.

06:32:59.377 --> 06:33:01.221
THE ENGLISH ON SET AGE AND THE
LEARNING STYLE.

06:33:01.222 --> 06:33:03.755
EVERYONE'S ASKED THE SAME 7
QUESTIONS.

06:33:04.093 --> 06:33:08.743
SO THIS IS ALL SEARCHABLE
INFORMATION AND THERE'S SOME

06:33:08.744 --> 06:33:12.709
ROOM FOR SOME NOTES.
HERE'S THE PARAGRAPH.

06:33:12.756 --> 06:33:16.130
TRAN SCRIBED WITH?
FUNNY PARAGRAPHS THAT LIPPING

06:33:16.134 --> 06:33:20.553
WORLD IN THEATERS FRIEDS USE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL BE ABLE

06:33:20.600 --> 06:33:22.600
TO HEAR THIS.
&gt;&gt; BREEZE CALL STELLA.

06:33:22.638 --> 06:33:27.924
ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS
WITH HER FROM THE STORE.

06:33:33.029 --> 06:33:39.230
5 BIG BLOCKS OF BLUE CHEESE AND
MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER,

06:33:39.268 --> 06:33:41.098
BOB WE ALSO NEED A SMALL
PLASTIC.

06:33:41.099 --> 06:33:44.955
&gt;&gt; I'M SURE YOU WERE ABLE TO
FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE PHONETICS

06:33:45.193 --> 06:33:49.305
WE WROTE THERE FOR YOU.
THE PHONETIC INVENTORIES,

06:33:49.306 --> 06:33:52.380
INCLUDED IN THE ARCHIVE FOR EACH
OF THE LANGUAGES, AT LEAST 210

06:33:52.700 --> 06:33:55.328
OF THEM ARE GIVEN IN SOME FORM
LIKE THIS.

06:33:55.813 --> 06:33:59.514
THEY'RE ALL UNIFORM AND YOU CAN
COMPARE VIETNAMESE TO ENGLISH

06:33:59.983 --> 06:34:04.509
AND FIND OUT WHY A VIETNAMESE
SPEAKER IS DOING WHAT SHE'S

06:34:04.510 --> 06:34:07.257
DOING WHEN SHE SPEAKS ENGLISH OR
WHY A SHERMAN SPEAKER DOES WHAT

06:34:07.475 --> 06:34:11.953
SHE DOES WHEN SHE SPEAKS
ENGLISH.

06:34:11.976 --> 06:34:14.228
AND THE SEARCH FACILITY LOOKS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

06:34:14.243 --> 06:34:17.787
CAN YOU DO POINTED SEARCHES ON
ALL THE DATA ON THE ARCHIVES.SO 

06:34:17.788 --> 06:34:21.880
FOR RESEARCH, THE DATA IS
REALLY AVAILABLE, AS A

06:34:24.925 --> 06:34:26.323
 UNIFORM,
IT'S UNIFORM SO THAT YOU CAN USE

06:34:26.324 --> 06:34:29.087
IT TO COMPARE ONE ACCENT TO
ANOTHER.

06:34:29.318 --> 06:34:32.590
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S READING THE
SAME THING.

06:34:32.806 --> 06:34:34.834
IT'S TURNING INTO A MASSIVE
DATABASE.

06:34:35.521 --> 06:34:38.994
SO A LOT SPEECH ENGINEERS ARE
ASKING FOR IT TO USE TO TRAIN

06:34:39.126 --> 06:34:43.762
THEIR MACHINES TO UNDERSTAND
SPEECH.

06:34:44.001 --> 06:34:46.718
AND WE ARE NOW UNDERSTANDING
WITH THE ARCHIVES, A LITTLE

06:34:46.719 --> 06:34:50.660
BETTER WHAT, IT MEANS TO HAVE AN
ACCENT, WHAT IT MEANS TO

06:34:50.661 --> 06:34:55.671
SCIENTIFICALLY STUDY AN ACCENT.
AND WHAT AFFECTS AN ACCENT.

06:34:55.702 --> 06:34:58.305
SOME OF THE MOST CRUCIAL FACTORS
INVOLVED IN ACCENT.

06:35:00.315 --> 06:35:03.417
ARE LIST RIGHT THERE.  WHAT YOUR
NATIVE LANGUAGE S WHEN YOU BEGAN

06:35:04.190 --> 06:35:08.230
TO LEARN OR STUDY ENGLISH.
YOUR LENGTH OF RESIDENCE AND

06:35:08.231 --> 06:35:13.566
WHERE AND YOUR LEARNING STYLE.
THANK YOU, I THINK I MADE IT

06:35:13.567 --> 06:35:15.567
WITHIN 5 MINUTES.

06:35:18.742 --> 06:35:20.742
[APPLAUSE]

06:35:27.068 --> 06:35:29.336
.
&gt;&gt; HI, MY NAME IS CHELSEA SEVERE

06:35:29.390 --> 06:35:36.271
AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING TO
YOU TODAY ABOUT THE CARE BEAN

06:35:36.729 --> 06:35:39.739
PERIODICAL.
IN MY OTHER LIFE, I AM A

06:35:39.740 --> 06:35:43.678
PROFESSOR AT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY
OF AMERICA, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR

06:35:43.726 --> 06:35:46.105
IN FRENCH STUDIES.
I'M GOING TO BE TALKING TO YOU

06:35:46.442 --> 06:35:50.505
ABOUT PERIODICALS, AND THE
CATALOG, MORE SPECIFICALLY,

06:35:50.506 --> 06:35:54.779
ABOUT A PROJECT I'M DEVELOPING
HERE, ON A SPECIFIC HAITIAN

06:35:57.840 --> 06:35:58.512
PERIODICAL.
THE JOURNAL OF THE HAITIAN

06:35:58.513 --> 06:36:00.513
SOCIETY OF HISTORY,

06:36:06.142 --> 06:36:08.142
 GEOGRAPHYY

06:36:13.710 --> 06:36:17.962
IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1923.
IT'S ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS OF

06:36:18.638 --> 06:36:22.733
SCHOLARSHIP.
OVER 250 ISSUES, IT'S THE MOST

06:36:23.170 --> 06:36:26.545
IMPORTANT REPOSITORY OF LOCALLY
PRODUCED KNOWLEDGE.

06:36:27.225 --> 06:36:30.352
IN ITS ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL
SCIENCE RESEARCH COMING OUT OF

06:36:30.553 --> 06:36:32.553
HAITI.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

06:36:32.654 --> 06:36:36.305
U.S. AND REALLY NORTH AMERICAN
AND NORTH ATLANTIC ACADEMICS

06:36:36.306 --> 06:36:38.909
DON'T CITE IT.
THEY DON'T USE T. IT'S REALLY

06:36:39.179 --> 06:36:44.923
RARELY USED AND READ, AND NOT
PART OF OUR ACADEMIC DISCOURSE.

06:36:45.083 --> 06:36:48.413
SO THE QUESTION IS WHY.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS

06:36:48.751 --> 06:36:51.539
WHY, THAT I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE
THE TIME TO GET INTO HERE AND

06:36:51.589 --> 06:36:53.589
THAT WOULD TAKE US HOURS  AND
HOURS  TO DISCUSS.

06:36:53.753 --> 06:36:56.625
BUT THERE IS ONE REALLY
INTERESTING REASON WHY AND IT'S

06:36:57.511 --> 06:36:59.401
SOMETHING I DISCOVERED WHILE
DOING MY RESEARCH HERE AT THE

06:36:59.402 --> 06:37:01.588
LIBRARY.
AND THAT IS SPECIFICALLY, HOW

06:37:03.034 --> 06:37:03.852
PERIODICALS EXIST IN THE LIBRARY
SPACE.

06:37:03.853 --> 06:37:08.710
AND IN THE LIBRARY CATALOG.
PERIODICALS COME INTO THE UPON

06:37:10.098 --> 06:37:12.260
LIBRARY, THEY ARE CATALOGS
BUFFET NOT INDECKED.

06:37:13.003 --> 06:37:18.502
SO HERE, I HAVE A REPRODUCTION
OF THE CATALOG ENTRY FOR THE

06:37:18.503 --> 06:37:20.209
SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL AND HERE,
WE HAVE A REPRESENTATION OF A

06:37:20.210 --> 06:37:22.210
HUNDRED YEARS OF

06:37:25.885 --> 06:37:28.531
 SCHOLARSHIP,
LOCAL, CARE BEAN UPON PRODUCTION

06:37:28.564 --> 06:37:31.366
THAT IS IN THE CATALOG.
WE HAVE OUR SUBJECTS HEADING,

06:37:31.713 --> 06:37:35.179
HAITI PERIODICALS AND THE TITLE
ITSELF IS QUITE EXPLANATORY.

06:37:35.223 --> 06:37:37.223
BEYOND THAT, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S INSIDE.

06:37:37.301 --> 06:37:40.979
AND THIS IS AN INDICTMENT OF THE
LIBRARY CATALOG.

06:37:40.996 --> 06:37:44.265
THIS IS PRECISELY HOW THE
CATALOG IS SUPPOSED TWO THE

06:37:44.266 --> 06:37:49.768
PROBLEM S WE DON'T GET TON WHAT
IS INSIDE BECAUSE IT'S ON

06:37:54.819 --> 06:37:59.587
 INDEX.
THIS IS WHERE KNOWLEDGE

06:37:59.588 --> 06:38:01.588
PRODUCTION IS HAPPEN NEGLIGENT
21ST CENTURY.

06:38:01.799 --> 06:38:08.195
IT'S THE PRIVILEDGED MEDIUM FOR
CARIBBEAN ACADEMIC RESEARCH, AND

06:38:08.226 --> 06:38:13.076
LOCAL SCHOLARSHIP.
WITH THIS CONTENT BEING ELISE

06:38:13.144 --> 06:38:17.264
EISENBERG. -- LEGIBLE, IT'S NO
WONDER PEOPLE AREN'T USING IT OR

06:38:17.471 --> 06:38:21.547
CITE T. WITH THAT IN MIND, WE
DECIDED TO COME WAY PROJECT TO

06:38:21.594 --> 06:38:23.957
SOLVE THAT.
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

06:38:23.989 --> 06:38:25.989
EBBING PANELED ACCESS TO THIS
JOURNAL.

06:38:26.606 --> 06:38:32.400
AND THE IMPACT OF THIS
SCHOLARSHIP THAT THE LIBRARY

06:38:32.401 --> 06:38:36.418
HOLDS THE LIBRARY IS ONE THE FEW
THAT HAS A NEARLY FULL

06:38:43.445 --> 06:38:50.397
RUN-JOURNAL.WE FINISHED PHASE 
ONE WHICH WAS

06:38:50.398 --> 06:38:53.235
TO CREATE A DATABASE.
WE INDEXED EVERY ISSUE OF THE

06:38:53.471 --> 06:38:58.112
JOURNAL, SUBJECT HEADS  AND SO
ON AND SO NOW, WE HAVE OUR

06:39:01.920 --> 06:39:03.346
DATABASE.
AND THE FIXTURE STEP IS TO

06:39:03.347 --> 06:39:06.734
DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE SPACE,
AND ENGAGE WITH THE

06:39:13.751 --> 06:39:16.787
 SCHOLARSHIP.
AND HERE, I WANTED TO SHOUT OUT

06:39:17.350 --> 06:39:22.299
SOME SITES OF PEOPLE DOING BEST
CARIBBEAN

06:39:27.326 --> 06:39:31.187
 PRACTICES HIGHWAY
MIGHT WE ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION

06:39:31.218 --> 06:39:33.551
W INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY AND
OTHERWISE, WORK TO MAYOR OAT GAP

06:39:33.884 --> 06:39:38.202
BETWEEN CARIBBEAN RESEARCHERS,
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE NORTH

06:39:38.518 --> 06:39:40.518
ATLANTIC ACADEMY ^, AND THE
COMMUNITIES WE ARE COMMITTED TO

06:39:41.628 --> 06:39:43.845
SERVING?
SOY AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO PHASE

06:39:44.210 --> 06:39:46.968
TWO, BUILDING THIS COLLABORATIVE

06:39:50.860 --> 06:39:54.506
SPACE, WE WANTED TO TAKE THIS
INSPARATION, WHICH IS GOING TO

06:39:55.043 --> 06:39:57.043
TAKE

06:40:01.686 --> 06:40:03.443
 INSPIRATION.
AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO

06:40:03.444 --> 06:40:06.170
RESEARCHERS NOT JUST IN THE
NORTH ATLANTIC SPACE BUT ALSO IN

06:40:06.419 --> 06:40:11.386
THE CARIBBEAN AS WELL.
SO WE'RE ENVISIONING AN

06:40:11.387 --> 06:40:14.609
NOTATIONS, SOMATIC GROUPINGS OF
CONTENT.

06:40:15.271 --> 06:40:19.220
CREATING A DYNAMIC SPACE THAT
WILL IMPROVE ACCESS AND IMPACT

06:40:19.637 --> 06:40:23.306
TO THIS CARIBBEAN PERIODICAL.
THIS IS IN THE WORKS THE STILL

06:40:23.506 --> 06:40:26.014
IN DEVELOPMENT NOW.
SO I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM

06:40:26.015 --> 06:40:28.482
YOU.
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, IDEAS,

06:40:28.524 --> 06:40:31.454
ADVICE, THOUGHTS, THIS
CONFERENCE HAS BEEN SO

06:40:31.455 --> 06:40:32.741

06:42:23.790 --> 06:42:27.692

WE HAVE INFORMATION RELATING TO
OUR SUBSCRIBERS.

06:42:57.706 --> 06:43:00.676
PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT MORE THAN ONE
TICKET OR TICKET TO A SERIES,

06:43:00.807 --> 06:43:04.188
DATING BACK TO 1842.
WE KNOW THEIR FAMES, THEIR

06:43:04.189 --> 06:43:07.034
ADDRESSES, WE KNOW WHAT SEATS
THEY BOUGHT AND FOR HOW LONG

06:43:07.035 --> 06:43:08.422
THEY WERE GENERALLED WITH THE
ORCHESTRA.

06:43:08.423 --> 06:43:12.189
A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER WE
LAUNCHED THE DIGITAL ARCHIVES, A

06:43:13.094 --> 06:43:15.411
GROUP OF THE SOCIOLOGISTS
APPROACHED US AND ASKED, CAN WE

06:43:15.626 --> 06:43:20.532
DO SOMETHING WITH THIS
DESCRIBEER DATA IT HAS BEEN

06:43:20.533 --> 06:43:25.286
DYNEL TIESED AND IT WAS
RELATIVELY EASY, UNDERSCORING A

06:43:25.324 --> 06:43:29.419
POINT, THERE'S A LOT HUMAN LABOR
THAT GOES TO EXTRACTING DATA

06:43:29.420 --> 06:43:33.242
FROM THESE THINGS B. IT WAS
RELATIVELY EASY TO TAKE THESE

06:43:33.763 --> 06:43:42.140
15TH CENTURY BOOKS AND TURN IT
INTO A NICE ADJACENT DATA SET.

06:43:42.141 --> 06:43:44.175
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY TRYING

06:43:49.215 --> 06:43:51.520
 TO
--

06:43:51.535 --> 06:43:53.702
[PLEASE STAND BY] WHEN THEY WERE
DONE, THEY GAVE THE DATA TO US

06:43:54.387 --> 06:43:58.548
AND WE HAVE THIS NICE WEB
WIDGETS FOR PEOPLE WITH SELECT A

06:43:58.579 --> 06:44:03.895
PORTION OF THE DATA AND ALSO THE
DESIRE SUBSCRIBER DATA S. IS A

06:44:05.117 --> 06:44:08.547
DOWNLOAD, POST 1951 TO PROTECT
THE MOST RECENT FOLKS BUT ALL

06:44:08.579 --> 06:44:14.954
THE DATA IS THERE FOR ANYBODY
WHO WANTS  TO USE IT SO WHAT DID

06:44:15.254 --> 06:44:20.952
THE SOCIOLOGIST FIND IF WELL
WHEN, THEY GOT INTO THE DATA

06:44:20.953 --> 06:44:25.498
THEY GAVE US A NUANCED
UNDERSTANDING OF 19TH CENTURY

06:44:25.906 --> 06:44:27.695
SOCIAL STATUS.
I THINK THIS IS REALLY

06:44:27.696 --> 06:44:30.677
INTERESTING TO MOST THEY USED
THE DATA TO, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW

06:44:31.477 --> 06:44:35.241
KIND OF THE BIG PICTURE OF
GUILDEDER A SOCIAL

06:44:35.242 --> 06:44:38.496
CONSOLIDATION, BUT THEY USED THE
DATA TO FIND SOMETHING THEY

06:44:38.497 --> 06:44:40.930
CALLED SEGREGATED INCLUSION.
WHICH I'M GOING TO READ IT.

06:44:41.172 --> 06:44:46.907
A FORM OF INCLUSION THAT
PRESERVES THE PURITY.

06:44:48.374 --> 06:44:54.063
BY NOT ONLY -- IN A LIMITED WAY,
THAT REA IF ID THE HIGH CLASS

06:44:54.443 --> 06:44:58.270
STAT STATUS OF THE ORCHESTRA.
SO THAT'S A REALLY NICE NUANCE

06:44:58.354 --> 06:45:03.471
TWIST UNDERSTANDING, OF HOW 19TH
CENTURY SOCIAL CONGLOMERATION

06:45:05.821 --> 06:45:07.821
WORKED IN NEW

06:45:10.900 --> 06:45:12.900

INCLUDES MUSIC OR MAGNETIC
TAPE.

BUT PREMIERE OF FIGHTS,
NOTEBOOKS, INVOICES, LETTERS AND

THE AMERICAN LICENSE OF THE
LOCKE.

06:46:57.832 --> 06:47:00.432
MY RESEARCH IS TO ALLOW THE
DOCUMENTS, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH

06:47:00.779 --> 06:47:05.831
COLLECTIONS BETWEEN THE SONGS,
RECORDED BY [INDISCERNIBLE] AND

06:47:05.915 --> 06:47:07.545

THEN, THROUGH

06:47:34.878 --> 06:47:36.878
 THE

06:47:46.012 --> 06:47:48.481
 USING THE SAME
PERFORMANCE, IT IS CLEAR THAT

06:47:48.510 --> 06:47:50.615
THE COLLECTIONS COMPLEMENT ONE
ANOTHER.

06:47:50.831 --> 06:47:59.361
BUT TO WHAT EXTENT IS UNKNOWN.
THE BARCELONA COLLECTION HAS

06:47:59.362 --> 06:48:02.613
BEEN DYNEL TIESED  IN A COT LOG
IN A DATABASE IN WHICH THEY HAVE

06:48:05.242 --> 06:48:08.305
INCORPORATED [INDISCERNIBLE].
CATALOG INFORMATION ON ALL THE

LINKS TO THE CORE RESPONDING
DIGITIZATION OF THE LOCKE

WEBSITE.
THE STATE HAS A COLLECTION FOR

06:48:37.274 --> 06:48:42.041
ARC UNTIL SIS AND COMPARISON AND
IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY

06:48:42.042 --> 06:48:47.813
CONCURONS TO THE LOCKE, AND THAT

IN THE FORM OF TRAN SCRIPTIONS

06:49:09.781 --> 06:49:11.781
MADE

06:49:30.201 --> 06:49:32.201
 [SINGING]

06:49:47.079 --> 06:49:48.865
 A RESEARCH TOOL
FOR INTERPRETING DATA ABOUT A

06:49:48.866 --> 06:49:55.285
AND PREPARING ON THE MEANING OF
THESE CONCURRENCIES, AND IN

06:49:55.286 --> 06:50:00.093
ORDER TO ASSESS, HOW THIS
NETWORK DETERMINES

06:50:00.094 --> 06:50:02.618
[INDISCERNIBLE] AND THE MUSE AND
I CAN PEOPLE HE CHOSE TO

06:50:02.619 --> 06:50:05.702
RECORD.
THIS DIGITAL TOOL ALSO MAKES

06:50:05.703 --> 06:50:08.260
DATA ACCESSIBLE TO OTHER
REACHERS.

06:50:08.568 --> 06:50:14.086
AT THE SAME TIME, THROUGH THE
DATABASE AND THE SOCIAL NETWORKS

06:50:14.148 --> 06:50:18.319
THAT WE DISCONNECTED.
CONTRIBUTION TO SPANISH

06:50:18.320 --> 06:50:22.050
TRADITIONAL MUSIC BECAME KNOWN,
AND APPRECIATED BY A GENERAL

06:50:22.051 --> 06:50:25.016
AUDIENCE.
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE

06:50:25.017 --> 06:50:27.944
DIFFERENT APPROACH BOTH TO THE
DATABASE AND TO THE SPANISH

06:50:27.945 --> 06:50:34.712
COLLECTION, I AM CREATING A
STORY MAP -- CONNECTING THE TOWN

06:50:35.219 --> 06:50:41.297
TO AN EXAMPLE OF THE MUSIC
RECORDED THERE, BELONGING TO THE

06:50:41.634 --> 06:50:45.402
MAX CONNECTION, AND A LINK TO
THE COMPLETE INFORMATION,

06:50:45.403 --> 06:50:47.403
CONCERNING  THAT LOCATION ON THE
DATABASE.

06:50:47.667 --> 06:50:50.358
THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS
APPLICATION IS TO MAKE DATA MORE

06:50:50.396 --> 06:50:54.176
VISUAL, NOT ONLY TO RESEARCHERS,
BUT ALSO TO OTHER AUDIENCE

06:50:54.177 --> 06:50:58.879
OUTSIDE THE CABINET CONTEXT.
AS EARACHEER, I HAVE BENEFITED

06:50:59.100 --> 06:51:02.896
FROM MAKING THE COLLECTION
AVAILABLE AS DATA.

06:51:02.935 --> 06:51:07.701
I AM ABLE TO ANALYZE, COMPARE
AND INTERPRET INFORMATION IN

06:51:07.702 --> 06:51:09.702
ORDER TO PRODUCE ACADEMIC
PUBLICATIONS.

06:51:09.907 --> 06:51:14.938
AT THE SAME TIME.
THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE

06:51:14.939 --> 06:51:18.033
COLLECTION AND VISUAL IS
RESEARCHABLE AND INTERACTIVE

06:51:18.034 --> 06:51:20.034
WAYS THROUGH THE DISABILITIES
ADVISORY BOARD, AND THE MAP

06:51:23.450 --> 06:51:25.412
APPLICATION ALLOWS THE
PERFORMANCE AND THE COMMUNITY IN

06:51:25.413 --> 06:51:32.787
GENERAL TO USE AND ENJOY THESE
MAGNIFICENT COLLECTIONS,

06:51:32.788 --> 06:51:34.788
INCREASING SOCIOLOGICAL IMPACT.
THANK YOU.

06:51:39.209 --> 06:51:41.209
[APPLAUSE]

06:53:07.180 --> 06:53:12.384
.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A PICTURE OF A BUNCH

06:53:12.442 --> 06:53:18.786
OF NUMBERS.
, I GUESS IT'S A JOKE.

06:53:18.917 --> 06:53:22.241
BUT IMAGINE THIS IS A FILE,
RIGHT AND WHAT I'M HOPING  TO DO

06:53:22.244 --> 06:53:26.397
IN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES IS
CONVINCE YOU THAT THIS IS A

06:53:26.398 --> 06:53:30.516
COLLECTION OF DATA AND NOT ONLY
THAT, IT IS A USEFUL COLLECTION

06:53:30.579 --> 06:53:39.038
OF DATA SO I WORK ON A PROJECT
CALLED DOCUMENTING THE NOW,

06:53:39.039 --> 06:53:44.601
WHICH IS A MELON FUNDED PROJECT
TO HELP BUILD SOCIAL MEDIA

06:53:44.602 --> 06:53:49.607
ARCHIVING TOOLS AND PRACTICES.
AND WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON

06:53:50.176 --> 06:53:55.244
TWITTER, WHICH IS KIND OF A
THIRD RAIL KIND OF TOPIC

06:54:00.275 --> 06:54:08.029
 HERE.MY COLLABORATOR, I WORK 
WITH

06:54:08.030 --> 06:54:10.318
BURGESS JEWELS AND MAYBE SOME OF
YOU REMEMBER HIS TALK.

06:54:10.334 --> 06:54:12.334
THIS IS ONE SLIDE THAT HE

06:54:14.732 --> 06:54:17.865
 HAD.
THAT HE SHOWED AND BURGESS, WHEN

06:54:17.866 --> 06:54:22.815
HE WAS HERE, WAS REALLY TRYING
TO IMPRESS ON EVERYONE, THE

06:54:22.816 --> 06:54:28.700
IMPORTANCE OF DOING SOCIAL MEDIA
ARCHIVING IN THE CONTEXT OF

06:54:28.701 --> 06:54:32.790
LARGE STATE AND CORPORATE ACTORS
THAT ARE ALSO DOING SOCIAL MEDIA

06:54:33.265 --> 06:54:37.859
ARCHIVING FOR THE PURPOSES OF
SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL.

06:54:38.179 --> 06:54:42.477
AND SO OUR PROJECT IS INTERESTED
IN MEMORY, RIGHT.

06:54:42.946 --> 06:54:45.574
REMEMBERING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THE
PURPOSES OF CULTURAL MEMORY.

06:54:45.756 --> 06:54:49.876
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE
ACTORS LIKE GEO FEED YEAH, WHO

06:54:50.098 --> 06:54:53.337
ARE SORT OF BUILDING SOCIAL
MEDIA COLLECTIONS THAT THEY ARE

06:54:55.337 --> 06:54:57.337
THEN ADVERTISING

06:54:58.725 --> 06:55:00.021
 TO INCISE DISIN
CALIFORNIA.

06:55:00.022 --> 06:55:02.812
THEY CAN UPON HAD THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT MANAGE THE FERGUSON

06:55:05.025 --> 06:55:08.419
SITUATION, RIGHT?
SO THE COURT AND JURY THAT WE

06:55:08.521 --> 06:55:13.121
WERE WORKING ON IS HOW DO WE DO
SOCIAL MEDIA ARCHIVING WHILE

06:55:13.122 --> 06:55:15.921
THIS IS GOING ON.
HOW DO WE DO IT IN AN ETHICAL

06:55:16.017 --> 06:55:23.357
WAY THAT SORT OF RESPECTS THE
VOICES AND THE CONTENTED OF THE

06:55:23.489 --> 06:55:26.304
PEOPLE THAT ARE CREATING THE

06:55:30.067 --> 06:55:33.399
CONTENT.
THAT'S KIND OF THE CHALLENGE WE

06:55:33.400 --> 06:55:35.400
HAVE

06:55:36.942 --> 06:55:38.354
 HAD.
S  TO NO REAL TECHNICAL SOLUTION

06:55:38.355 --> 06:55:40.910
THAT'S REALLY GOING TO DO IT FOR
US.

06:55:41.141 --> 06:55:45.645
BUT WE FOUND THAT ONE SILVER
LINING WE FOUND WAS IN TWEETER'S

06:55:46.084 --> 06:55:50.612
TERMS OF SERVICE ITSELF.
THEY ACTUALLY DON'T ALLOW

06:55:50.613 --> 06:55:52.292
PEOPLE.
SO HAVE YOU TO AGREE TO THE

06:55:52.293 --> 06:55:56.712
TERMS OF SERVICE TO GET DATA
FROM TWITTER AND ONE OF THE

06:55:56.713 --> 06:56:00.051
RULES THAT THEY HAVE IS THAT YOU
CAN'T DOWNLOAD DATA AND JUST

06:56:00.052 --> 06:56:05.217
SORT OF PUT IT ON WEB, RIGHT?
YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD MILLIONS OF

06:56:05.522 --> 06:56:09.590
TWEETS  AND PUT THEM IN INTERNET
ARCHIVES BECAUSE I MEAN, FOR

06:56:09.591 --> 06:56:13.799
THEM, IT'S SORT OF A BUSINESS
DECISION.

06:56:13.813 --> 06:56:16.331
THEY HAVE REASONS THAT THEY
DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

06:56:16.547 --> 06:56:20.891
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS
THEY DO LET YOU DO IS TAKE A

06:56:20.892 --> 06:56:25.630
FILE OF TWEET I.D'S.
EACH TWEET HAS A NUMERIC

06:56:25.631 --> 06:56:30.320
IDENTIFIER, AND THEY DO ALLOW
YOU TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE AND YOU

06:56:30.630 --> 06:56:33.926
KNOW, WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH A
TWEET IDENTIFIER IS GO BACK TO

06:56:35.149 --> 06:56:39.302
TWITTER'S API AND GET THE DATA
FOR THAT TWEET AND THE

06:56:39.303 --> 06:56:41.459
INTERESTING THING TAHAPPENS
THERE IS IF THE TWEET HAS BEEN

06:56:42.359 --> 06:56:45.484
DELETED OR IF THE USER HAS
DECIDED TO PROTECT THIS ACCOUNT

06:56:46.108 --> 06:56:48.850
OR DELETE THEIR ACCOUNT.
YOU CAN NO LONGER GET THAT

06:56:48.851 --> 06:56:50.927
TWEET.
SO IT KIND OF EMPOWERS THE

06:56:50.928 --> 06:56:53.008
USER.
GIVES THEM SOME LEVER OF CONTROL

06:56:53.256 --> 06:56:57.262
OVER HOW THEIR CONTENT IS USED
ELSEWHERE ON THE

06:57:02.288 --> 06:57:04.288
 WEB.

06:57:08.492 --> 06:57:12.576
THIS IS THE FIRST APPLICATION
THAT I WAS GOING TO MENTION,

06:57:12.577 --> 06:57:15.987
CALLED THE COT LOG AND REALLY
ALL THE CATALOG S IT'S REALLY

06:57:16.837 --> 06:57:22.009
JUST A WEB PAGE THAT LISTS DATA
SETS, WITH TWEET I.D.'S, THAT

06:57:22.071 --> 06:57:25.351
DITCH RESEARCHERS HAVE CREATED
FOR DIFFERENT RESEARCHERS.

06:57:25.443 --> 06:57:28.879
I PUT THEM IN ONE PLACE SO THAT
OTHER RESEARCHERS CAN FIND TEMSO

06:57:28.880 --> 06:57:31.509
THEY HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE
DATA SET.

06:57:32.267 --> 06:57:34.337
WHO CREATE IT WHAT DATE

06:57:39.348 --> 06:57:40.772
 RANGE
WHY THEY CREATE IT.

06:57:40.773 --> 06:57:43.629
AND A REPOSITORY, SO THIS IS
JUST A CLEARING HOUSE FOR THE

06:57:44.084 --> 06:57:48.149
DATA SET THAT IS LIVE ELSEWHERE
AND THEY CAN DOWNLOAD IT.

06:57:48.364 --> 06:57:51.033
SO ONCE YOU DOWNLOAD IT.
YOU END UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE

06:57:52.458 --> 06:57:57.596
THIS, A FILE WITH A BUNCH OF
CONTINUES IN IT.

06:57:57.812 --> 06:58:01.561
AND SO THE APPLYING, I THOUGHT
I'D MENING REALLY QUICK, THE

06:58:01.562 --> 06:58:04.863
HYDRATOR APPLICATION, WHICH
BASICALLY, IT'S A DESKTOP

06:58:04.864 --> 06:58:07.231
APPLICATION.
YOU DOWNLOAD AND RUN ON YOUR OWN

06:58:07.348 --> 06:58:11.568
WORK STATION.
IT WILL READ A DATA SET FILE.A 

06:58:11.569 --> 06:58:17.691
DATA SET OF TWEET ID'S, AND
HYDRATE THEM WANT SO TURN THEM

06:58:17.840 --> 06:58:24.915
BACK INTO THE DATA THAT IS
USEFUL FOR RESEARCH.

06:58:25.023 --> 06:58:33.707
AND ONE OF THE, THINGS IT WILL
DO IS CONVERT THE TWITTER.

06:58:33.942 --> 06:58:41.501
IT'S LIKE A FORMAT IS USED FOR
ALL KINDS OF ANALYSIS.

06:58:42.096 --> 06:58:45.633
THAT'S REALLY THE MAJORITY OF
WHAT I WANTED TO TALK

06:58:50.649 --> 06:58:58.683
 ABOUT.THANKS FOR

06:59:00.710 --> 06:59:02.710
 YOUR

06:59:05.736 --> 06:59:07.736

06:59:22.900 --> 06:59:25.481
[APPLAUSE].

06:59:25.482 --> 06:59:32.179
FARBER, I'M THE ARTISTIC
DIRECTOR OF MONUMENT LAB, A

06:59:32.180 --> 06:59:35.225
PUBLIC ART AND HISTORY PROJECT
BASED IN PHILADELPHIA.

06:59:35.241 --> 06:59:38.781
THANK YOU TO LOCKE FOR HOSTING
US ALL TODAY.

06:59:39.341 --> 06:59:45.593
IN MY DAY JOB, I'M A HISTORIAN

06:59:45.843 --> 06:59:51.874
AND LEAD A COLLECTIVE OF
SCHOLARS, CURATORS, ARTISTS AND

06:59:52.175 --> 06:59:56.190
TUNES AROUND THIS PROJECT SINCE
2014.

06:59:56.406 --> 07:00:00.888
AND WE'RE INTERESTED IN BUILDING
TEMPORARY MONUMENTS IN PUBLIC

07:00:01.472 --> 07:00:06.063
SPACES.
AND DATA SETS TAEPIDURAL IN

07:00:06.064 --> 07:00:10.652
LIBRARIES AND ON LINE.
AS OPEN DATA WE'RE GEARING UP

07:00:10.954 --> 07:00:15.798
FOR A BIG FALL 2017 CITY WIDE
EXHIBITION IN PHILADELPHIA WITH

07:00:16.299 --> 07:00:18.635
THE MURAL ARTS

07:00:23.662 --> 07:00:33.302
 PROGRAM.WHAT

07:00:34.868 --> 07:00:37.311
 IS AN APPROPRIATE MONUMENT
FOR THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. 

07:00:37.312 --> 07:00:43.629
WE HAVE A CITY FULL OF PUBLIC
ART, AND STATUES, MURAL.

07:00:43.837 --> 07:00:49.031
BUT SOMETIMES -- THANK YOU.
WE NEED ASSISTANCE TO FILL IN

07:00:49.178 --> 07:00:54.181
WHAT IS THERE.
SO THIS PROJECT IS ONE WHERE WE

07:00:54.431 --> 07:00:56.431
USE THIS QUESTION TO INVITE
PEOPLE IN.

07:00:56.484 --> 07:01:02.174
WE ASK ARTISTS TO BUILD
TEMPORARY MONUMENTS AND WE ASK

07:01:02.410 --> 07:01:09.851
THIS TO THE PUBLIC AS A WAY TO
MEASURE BOTH THE EXPECTED OR THE

07:01:09.919 --> 07:01:12.699
MUNICIPAL AND ALSO UNDERSTAND
THE POSSIBLE, THE DREAMED, THE

07:01:12.837 --> 07:01:16.003
SPECULATIVE, THE HAUNTS OF THE
CITY, TO HAVE A MORE COMPLETE

07:01:16.041 --> 07:01:20.410
VISION OF OUR HISTORICAL
LANDSCAPE.

07:01:21.848 --> 07:01:24.482
WE'RE WORKING WITH 20 ARTISTS 
FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND AROUND

07:01:24.946 --> 07:01:28.725
PHILADELPHIA, WHO ARE GOING TO
BE BUILDING NEED MONUMENTS IN

07:01:28.928 --> 07:01:33.056
PUBLIC SPACES.
SOME WILL USE THE KIND OF

07:01:33.057 --> 07:01:35.057
TRADITIONAL

07:01:36.560 --> 07:01:37.277
 FORMAT BRONZE,
GRANITE.

07:01:37.278 --> 07:01:41.127
BUT OTHERS ARE GOING TO BUILD
THEIR MONUMENTS WITH SOUND,

07:01:41.128 --> 07:01:43.128
LIGHTS, PERFORMS,
INTERACTIVITY.

07:01:43.213 --> 07:01:48.126
MANY OF THESE ARTISTS, TAKE ON
ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE,

07:01:48.127 --> 07:01:52.342
ESPECIALLY AROUND RACE, GENDER,
SEXUALITY, CLASS, NATIONAL

07:01:52.343 --> 07:01:57.194
BELONGING, TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR
MONUMENTAL LANDSCAPE REPRESENTS

07:01:57.225 --> 07:02:02.614
A CITY FOUNDED ON FREEDOM,
JUSTICE AND TOLERATION.

07:02:02.835 --> 07:02:07.773
THEIR WORKS WILL BE CITED AROUND
THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA AND

07:02:07.774 --> 07:02:12.291
THERE ARE FIVE CENTRAL SQUARE
THAT IS GO BACK TO THE 1680'S

07:02:12.412 --> 07:02:16.905
AND FIVE NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS.
AT EACH OF THESE SIGHTS, THERE'S

07:02:17.695 --> 07:02:23.029
AT -- AT EACH OF THESE CITES
THERE'S AT LEAST ONE TEMPORARY

07:02:23.044 --> 07:02:25.186
MONUMENT AND A RESEARCH LAB
WHERE WE USE THIS FORM.

07:02:25.318 --> 07:02:29.956
ON THIS FORM, WE THE PUBLIC TO
NAME THEIR MONUMENTS.

07:02:30.189 --> 07:02:33.967
PLACE IT SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY
AND ADDRESS AN INTERSECTION, A

07:02:34.636 --> 07:02:36.011
NEIGHBORHOOD, THOUGH THAT OFTEN
IS BROKEN.

07:02:36.012 --> 07:02:41.146
YOU'LL SEE IN A MOMENT.
WE ALSO ASK THEM IN A BIG OPEN

07:02:43.356 --> 07:02:45.356
SPACE TO DESCRIBE OR SKETCH.
IN ADDITION, IF PEOPLE WANT TO

07:02:45.549 --> 07:02:51.493
LEAVE THEIR HOME ZIP CODE, THEIR
AGE, THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA HANDLE,

07:02:51.693 --> 07:02:54.694
THEY CAN ADD THAT ON AS WELL.
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE

07:02:55.716 --> 07:02:58.838
HAVE DONE THIS.
BACK IF 2015, IN THE COURTYARD

07:02:59.424 --> 07:03:03.245
OF CITY HALL, WE HAD OUR
DISCOVERY PHASE, THANK TO THE

07:03:03.476 --> 07:03:08.495
ARTS  AND HERITAGE.
HERE, OUR TEMPORARY MONUMENT

07:03:08.496 --> 07:03:13.143
BITE LATE TERRY ATKINS WAS AN
EMPTY CLASSROOM TO COMMENT ON

07:03:13.792 --> 07:03:15.585
EDUCATIONAL PRIDE THAT WE HAVE
IN THE CITY, AND ALSO FACT OF

07:03:15.586 --> 07:03:17.835
BUDGET CUTS AND SCHOOL CLOSURES

07:03:21.007 --> 07:03:24.161
THAT MARKED OUR CURRENT
SCIENTIFIC LANDSCAPE.

07:03:24.199 --> 07:03:27.161
IN ADDITION TO THIS CLASSROOM,
WE HAD THE DIFFER KIND OF

07:03:27.162 --> 07:03:30.971
CLASSROOM.
THE LEARNING LAB WHERE TEAMS

07:03:30.972 --> 07:03:32.972
MOSTLY OF YOUTH

07:03:35.095 --> 07:03:37.353
 RESEARCHERS
WOULD GATHER PUBLIC PROPOSALS.

07:03:37.354 --> 07:03:43.054
IN THE 3-1/2 WEEKS THAT WE WERE
IN THE CITY COURTYARD, WE

07:03:48.065 --> 07:03:50.342
 HAD 4
FIGHT PEOPLE, LEAVE MONUMENT

07:03:56.382 --> 07:04:00.722
PROPOSALS.
AND OVER 30,000 PEOPLE VISIT THE

07:04:05.742 --> 07:04:12.433
MONUMENT.
O ONE ON ONE HAND, EACH PIECE

07:04:12.490 --> 07:04:15.841
MATTER IT IS AND THE DATA SET AS
A

07:04:20.889 --> 07:04:27.835
 WHOLE.SOME SNAPSHOTS HERE 
DANCING WITH

07:04:27.836 --> 07:04:32.368
LOVE IN YOUR STEP.
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE CITY.

07:04:35.090 --> 07:04:38.936
DOOR-TO-DOOR, AN ENGINE TIVE
PORTAL BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS.

07:04:38.937 --> 07:04:45.896
AND THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE,
I DON'T LOVE YOU, BUT I ...

07:04:46.344 --> 07:04:48.344
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, THERE'S POINT IANT

07:04:48.960 --> 07:04:51.329
AND OTHER IMPORTANT FORMS OF
TRUTH TELLING.

07:04:51.545 --> 07:04:55.343
SOMEBODY WHO'S WARY OF THE
MURDER CRISIS IN OUR CITY,

07:04:55.344 --> 07:04:59.933
CALLED ATTENTION TO THE SHRINES
AROUND THE CITY AND SITES OF

07:04:59.934 --> 07:05:02.046
VIOLENCE.
OTHERS WERE MORE POETIC.

07:05:02.239 --> 07:05:06.863
BLURRING THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN A
VISION OF A STATUE OR JUST AN 

07:05:06.974 --> 07:05:12.364
EXCHANGE BETWEEN PHILADELPHIANS
AND THEN OF COURSE, THE

07:05:12.365 --> 07:05:17.518
COMPLEX.
LIKE CLAUS OLDERBERG SAID,

07:05:17.519 --> 07:05:19.709
COMPOSING MONUMENT SYSTEM LIKE
COMPOSING WITH A CITY.

07:05:19.724 --> 07:05:21.826
IN ADDITION TO THE INDIVIDUALS,
CAN YOU SEE THE DATA SET.

07:05:22.050 --> 07:05:27.972
YOU CAN SEE IT ON A MAP, ACROSS
THE CITY.

07:05:27.987 --> 07:05:29.987
WE HAVE ALSO TRANSCRIBED AND

07:05:32.600 --> 07:05:36.048
ANALYZED A LEVEL OF
CLASSIFICATION, ON OPEN DATE.THE

07:05:37.097 --> 07:05:39.532
 PORTAL FOR CIVIC DATA IF THE

07:05:44.561 --> 07:05:46.561
CITY.

07:05:57.133 --> 07:06:00.225
WE WRITE THE HISTORY OF OUR CITY
TOGETHER AND WE TAKE UP THE CALL

07:06:00.788 --> 07:06:06.098
FOR CULTURAL HER TABLE ORGANIZES
TO FIND NEW WAYS TO BRING IN

07:06:06.099 --> 07:06:12.396
VOICES, PEOPLE AND DATA, NOT
JUST TO BE POWERED BY

07:06:12.397 --> 07:06:14.943
IMAGINATION BUT ALSO TO
CO-AUTHOR THE NEXT CHAPTERS OF

07:06:15.160 --> 07:06:17.665
OUR CITY'S HISTORY.
THANK

07:06:22.694 --> 07:06:24.694
 YOU.

07:06:40.530 --> 07:06:45.976
[APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; CAN WE SWITCH TO THE MAC.

07:06:46.007 --> 07:06:48.826
THANK YOU.
HI, MY NAME IS JARED NEILSON.I'M

07:06:48.959 --> 07:06:51.916
 AN ARTIST AND INSTRUCTOR AT
GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,

07:06:53.871 --> 07:06:56.791
WHERE I TEACH FULL STACK WEB
DEVELOPMENT.

07:06:57.067 --> 07:07:00.432
I RECENTLY DISCOVERED THE
DIGITAL COLLECTIONS AVAILABLE TO

07:07:01.218 --> 07:07:05.874
THE PUBLIC ON LC'S, WEBSITE.
IF YOU HAVEN'T DISCOVERED IT

07:07:05.875 --> 07:07:08.261
YOURSELF.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BROWSING THIS

07:07:08.394 --> 07:07:14.110
YOU'LL LOSE HOURS OF YOUR DAY.
IT'S A FANTASTIC COLLECTION.

07:07:14.583 --> 07:07:16.194
THERE'S ONE COLLECTION IN
PARTICULAR THAT CAUGHT MY EYE

07:07:16.195 --> 07:07:21.271
WANT THIS PICTORIAL ST. LOUIS.
IT'S A SERIES OF PLATES

07:07:21.272 --> 07:07:27.127
PUBLISHED AS AN ATLAS IN 1975
BITE ARTIST, CAMILLE DRY.

07:07:27.147 --> 07:07:32.534
THIS WAS CREATED AT THIS AT THE
SAME TIME AS AN ACTIVE

07:07:32.535 --> 07:07:34.399
BOOSTERISM BITE CITY WHEN THEY
WERE MAKING A BID TO BECOME THE

07:07:34.400 --> 07:07:36.006
NATION'S CAPITAL.
THEY THOUGHT THEIR POSITION ON

07:07:36.007 --> 07:07:41.301
THE MISSISSIPPI, BEING A MASSIVE
TRADE ECONOMIC ROUTE WAS MORE

07:07:41.353 --> 07:07:45.317
SUITABLE FOR OUR NATION'S FUTURE
THAN THIS CURRENT

07:07:49.677 --> 07:07:51.733
 SWAMP.
SO THESE PLATES ARE INCREDIBLY

07:07:51.748 --> 07:07:55.796
DETAILED AND BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING WHEN

07:07:55.843 --> 07:08:00.247
I FOUND THESE IS THAT THERE'S NO
TECHNOLOGY USED IN THEIR

07:08:00.248 --> 07:08:02.742
CREATION.
THERE'S NO AIRPLANE, THERE'S NO

07:08:02.789 --> 07:08:07.389
HOT HAIR BALLOON.
THIS WAS ALL CAMILL DRY, AND HIS

07:08:07.759 --> 07:08:10.950
TEAM, BEATING THE PAVEMENT,
MAKING THESE RECORDS AND THEN

07:08:11.869 --> 07:08:19.425
TRANSPOSING THEIR 2D DATA INTO A
3D AERIAL PERSPECTIVE

07:08:19.426 --> 07:08:22.864
REPRESENTATION.
HERE'S A LITTLE MORE OF THE

07:08:22.865 --> 07:08:24.865
DETAIL

07:08:27.366 --> 07:08:30.166
 HERE.
SO THE ATLAS WAS PUBLISHED WITH

07:08:30.475 --> 07:08:37.399
A KEY THAT SHOWS YOU WHICH PLATE
WHERE THEY LINE UP WITH THEIR

07:08:38.985 --> 07:08:41.939
GEOGRAPHIC POSITION IN
RELATIONSHIP TO ST.

07:08:45.494 --> 07:08:48.140
 LOUIS.
MANY OF THE PLATES

07:08:53.150 --> 07:08:58.604
 HERE, LET ME
JUST CORRECT

07:09:03.622 --> 07:09:07.615
 THIS SO.
BECAUSE THESE WERE ALL HAND

07:09:07.616 --> 07:09:11.899
DRAWN, SOME OF THE PLATES HAVE
THESE INTERESTING FEATURES WHERE

07:09:12.602 --> 07:09:15.438
A LANDMARK IS BREAKING THE
FRAME.

07:09:16.943 --> 07:09:21.803
AND I WANTED TO KEEP THIS WHEN I
L FIRST WHEN, I DISCOVERED THIS,

07:09:22.024 --> 07:09:27.962
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITH
THIS I WANTED TO SEE ALL THE

07:09:27.963 --> 07:09:30.847
PLATES STITCHED TOGETHER AS ONE
LARGE

07:09:35.783 --> 07:09:38.532
 MAP WHEN STITCHING THESE
TOGETHER, THERE ARE A LOT OF

07:09:38.533 --> 07:09:45.007
THESE BREAKS WITH THE FRAME.
SO I CLEANED UP ALL OF THESE,

07:09:45.240 --> 07:09:52.127
BUT I LEFT THESE LANDMARK
DETAILS AND INSERTED SOME SPACE

07:09:53.584 --> 07:09:57.136
INTO MAP AND I HAD TO CONVERT IT
TO GRAY SCALE BECAUSE THIS

07:09:57.137 --> 07:10:02.160
BECAME SUCH A MASSIVE IMAGE
FILE, THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR ME

07:10:02.459 --> 07:10:06.170
TO PULL THIS OFF IS TO STRIP OUT
ALL THE COLOR OF DATA AND GO

07:10:06.171 --> 07:10:15.249
GRAY SCALE WANT SO THIS IS THE
SMALL VERSION MCNEALLY, WHICH IF

07:10:16.389 --> 07:10:21.707
ANYONE HERE WORKS WITH DIGITAL
IMAGES, 64,000 BY 26,000 PIXELS

07:10:22.243 --> 07:10:27.287
WAS A MONSTER.
THE SIZE ROUGHLY WAS

07:10:27.288 --> 07:10:29.306
900-MEGABYTES.
IT WAS

07:10:34.330 --> 07:10:41.374
 HUGE.
I HAVE A WHACK ROUND, IN

07:10:44.633 --> 07:10:47.115
EXHIBITS I TRIED RUNNING THIS
THROUGH THOSE PROGRAMS AND IT

07:10:49.453 --> 07:10:51.453
WAS JUST KILLING

07:10:52.489 --> 07:10:56.188
 THEM MY GOAL IS
TO KEEP THIS INTERACTIVE IN A

07:10:56.922 --> 07:11:00.601
WAY WHERE THE DETAIL WOULDN'T BE
LOST BUT WE COULD ALSO HAVE THIS

07:11:00.621 --> 07:11:03.095
PULLED OUT GLOBAL

07:11:08.099 --> 07:11:13.038
 SCOPE.
IT'S AN OPEN SOURCE JAVA SCRIPT

07:11:13.592 --> 07:11:16.899
LIBRARY, THAT HAS REALLY GREAT
ROBUST TUTORIALS, AND VERY, VERY

07:11:17.117 --> 07:11:19.117
EASY

07:11:20.161 --> 07:11:25.925
 AND SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT.
AND I FOUND THESE FANTASTIC

07:11:25.926 --> 07:11:32.776
REPOWS  ON GITA HUB THAT HELPED
ME PIECE TOGETHER THESE -- THE

07:11:32.968 --> 07:11:36.911
LEAFLET IS INTENDED SPECIFICALLY
FOR GEOGRAPHIC MAPS FOR

07:11:36.912 --> 07:11:38.912
GEOSPATIAL DATA ABSTRACTION
LAYERS.

07:11:49.873 --> 07:11:53.940
SO I FOUND THIS ONE HERE, RAFTER
CORD, THAT WAS

07:11:57.411 --> 07:12:01.634
 KEY.
THIS IS THE LEAST DYNAMIC

07:12:01.635 --> 07:12:04.916
SLIDE.
THIS IS MY PHYLA TREE.

07:12:05.017 --> 07:12:09.073
I NEEDED TO SUPPLIES THAT BIG
IMAGINE UP INTO SMALLER TILES.

07:12:09.277 --> 07:12:11.507
HERE CAN YOU SEE HOW THE TILES
ARE NESTED.

07:12:11.539 --> 07:12:16.237
THIS IS LIKE, THE LEVELS, AND
THESE ARE ALL THE THUMB NAILS.WE

07:12:16.506 --> 07:12:20.072
 HAVE ALL HAD THIS EXPERIENCE
WHEN WE'RE ON A SLOW DATA

07:12:20.073 --> 07:12:23.073
CONNECTION AND WE'RE USING
GOOGLE MAPS  AND WE SEAT LITTLE

07:12:23.792 --> 07:12:26.531
SQUARES, POP UP AND THEN THEY
SLOW AND THEY COME INTO FOCUS.

07:12:26.854 --> 07:12:32.339
THAT'S MAP TILING IN ACTION.
THIS IS WHAT MAP TILING LOOKS

07:12:32.591 --> 07:12:34.591
LIKE ON A

07:12:40.069 --> 07:12:44.870
 SERVER.
THIS IS 0, 0 IN OUR

07:12:44.871 --> 07:12:48.498
ACCORDNANTS.
WE'RE GOING TO ZOOM IN ON

07:12:53.500 --> 07:12:56.923
 0, 0
SO MY MAP HAD 8 LAYERS AND WE

07:12:57.226 --> 07:13:00.050
ZOOMED THROUGH 8 LAYERS.
MY TIME IS UP.

07:13:00.391 --> 07:13:04.047
JAVA SCRIPT IS AWESOME.
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS

07:13:08.077 --> 07:13:10.435
 WHY
YOU CAN IMPLEMENT THE MAP

07:13:10.436 --> 07:13:12.436
YOURSELF.
I NEEDED HELPY SO I ASKED THE

07:13:13.127 --> 07:13:15.687
LIBRARIAN FOR SOME BACKGROUND

07:13:18.794 --> 07:13:20.794
INFORMATION IF YOU HAVEN'T USED
ASK A

07:13:23.786 --> 07:13:27.407
 LIBRARIAN, I RECOMMEND T.
IN LESS THAN A WEEK, I RECEIVED

07:13:27.454 --> 07:13:30.724
THE PERTINENT INFORMATION I
NEEDED.

07:13:30.743 --> 07:13:33.500
THIS IS THE FINAL END

07:13:37.247 --> 07:13:39.311
 RESULT IF
YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN ACTION.CAN

07:13:39.530 --> 07:13:46.622
 YOU DO SO AS THIS URL.
I WROTE A TUTORIAL ON MEDIUM

07:13:46.623 --> 07:13:49.477
THAT YOU CAN FIND HERE.
THANK

07:13:54.502 --> 07:13:56.502
 YOU.

07:14:10.222 --> 07:14:15.575
&gt;&gt; BILL FIRSTER, I'M WITH THE
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AT, IT'S

07:14:16.202 --> 07:14:21.466
THE 16S HUMANITIES, ARTS AND
HUMANITIES TECHNOLOGY

07:14:21.467 --> 07:14:23.498
INITIATIVE.
IT'S KIND

07:14:28.114 --> 07:14:32.309
 OF SO ANYWAY, I'VE
COME HERE TO SHOW YOU A TOOL

07:14:32.310 --> 07:14:36.535
CALLED VISUALIZE.
IT'S A DESIGNED BY US FOR USE IF

07:14:36.668 --> 07:14:40.402
TWO DIFFERENT AREAS.
ONE WAS FOR TEACHING CLASSES,

07:14:40.788 --> 07:14:42.788
INTERACTIVELY, IN A PROJECT
BASED SETTING.

07:14:42.814 --> 07:14:47.287
PRETTY MUCH LIKE WHAT YOU SAW,
THE PEOPLE DOING THE STUDENTS

07:14:48.067 --> 07:14:54.866
EARLIER AND ALSO, WE USE IT FOR
MAKING SCHOLARLY ARGUMENTS,

07:14:54.867 --> 07:15:00.755
USING PRIMARY SOURCES SO WE
CONNECTED A TIME

07:15:05.738 --> 07:15:08.436
 LINE A STORY
PANEL AND A SLIPPY MAP,

07:15:08.437 --> 07:15:10.669
ALTOGETHER AND PUT IT

07:15:15.682 --> 07:15:18.725
 IN AND CAN
YOU OVERLAY THINGS ON TOP OF

07:15:18.726 --> 07:15:21.017
IT.
SO CAN YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, DOTS

07:15:21.133 --> 07:15:24.801
OR THINGS ON TOP OF IT.
YOU CAN HAVE INTERACTIVE

07:15:24.802 --> 07:15:26.802
GRAPHICS.
KML

07:15:31.335 --> 07:15:34.439
 FILES, OR SORT MAPS AND THAT
BECOMES QUITE USEFUL.

07:15:34.657 --> 07:15:38.218
SO ALSO, WE HAVE GOT A VARIETY
OF OTHER KINDS OF TOOLS TO MAKE

07:15:38.233 --> 07:15:41.075
YOUR PRESENT EGGS.
SO THIS IS A DRAWING TOOL BUILT

07:15:41.344 --> 07:15:48.039
IN SO CAN YOU DRAW THINGS ON IT
AND CAN YOU KIND OF PAN AND ZOOM

07:15:53.050 --> 07:15:55.050
MAPS.
THIS TOOL, BASICALLY, IT'S ALL

07:15:55.367 --> 07:15:58.404
WEB-BASED, AND IT'S VERY EASY TO
USE AND THE IDEA IS, INSTEAD OF

07:15:59.797 --> 07:16:04.982
THINGS LIKE ARC GIS, WHICH ARE
VERY ROBUST TOOLS FOR DOING

07:16:04.983 --> 07:16:06.773
GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION TYPE
WORK.

07:16:06.774 --> 07:16:13.347
THESE ARE EASILY USED BY
HUMANITY SCHOLARS OR BY

07:16:13.348 --> 07:16:15.191
STUDENTS.
THE KEY, WE HAVE SET IT UP.

07:16:15.192 --> 07:16:20.612
AND TRIED TO USE A VERY
DISTRIBUTED PROCESS.

07:16:20.861 --> 07:16:28.784
THE UVA WE HAD A -- WE JUST USED
ALL DATABASES BACK THEN AND

07:16:28.785 --> 07:16:31.488
THESE VERY COMPLEXES,
DATABASES.

07:16:31.719 --> 07:16:36.901
AND WHAT REALLY CAME DOWN,
TYPICALLY, HAVE A BIG TABLE FOR

07:16:37.120 --> 07:16:40.975
THE MOST PART AND IT'S AN X
NUMBER OF FIELDS AND A WHOLE

07:16:40.976 --> 07:16:43.598
BUNCH OF EVENTS.
WHAT WE DID, WE DON'T NEED ALL

07:16:43.733 --> 07:16:48.955
THAT COMPLICATED DATABASE.
LET'S TRY AND USE A

07:16:48.956 --> 07:16:51.361
SPREADSHEET.
NOW, THE ADVANTAGE OF USING A

07:16:52.082 --> 07:16:55.500
SPREADSHEET, GOOGLE HAS BUILT IN
ALL THESE INCREDIBLE SHARING

07:16:55.501 --> 07:16:57.728
TECHNIQUES, WITHIN THE
SPREADSHEET AND THE SPREADSHEET

07:16:58.974 --> 07:17:01.396
IS CONNECTED LIVE TO THE
VISUALIZATION.

07:17:01.505 --> 07:17:04.790
THEY TOLD ME, ACTUALLY, I
COULDN'T USE THE INTERNET SO I

07:17:05.243 --> 07:17:06.363
WOULD HAVE SHOWN IT LIVE OUT
HERE.

07:17:06.364 --> 07:17:10.347
BUT THE IDEA IS YOU CHANGE ONE
THING ON THE SPREADSHEET, AND IT

07:17:11.688 --> 07:17:16.258
CHANGES ON THE VISUAL IATION AND
PEOPLE HAVE MORE, YOU KNOW,

07:17:16.259 --> 07:17:22.728
AUTONOMY WITH THEIR DATA AND FOR
CLASS ROOM USE, IT WORKS OUT

07:17:22.729 --> 07:17:24.729
QUITE

07:17:26.990 --> 07:17:31.171
 WELL ACTIVITY FUNDED BY
NEH, WHICH FUNDED US IN A
