00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.380
&gt;&gt; You're right, David. Of the various blocks given here, this block

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.990
best resembles the black block. And therefore the best guess would be,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.140
this is in fact, a black block. This is an example of learning by

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.630
recording cases, because six cases were recorded in the agent's memory. So

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.885
when now when a new problem comes along, then the agent gives an answer to

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:34.200
that new problem based on the cases that it already had recorded in its memory,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.670
it simply sees which case most closely resembles the new situation. And

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.040
gives the answer to the new situation for that most closely resembling case.
