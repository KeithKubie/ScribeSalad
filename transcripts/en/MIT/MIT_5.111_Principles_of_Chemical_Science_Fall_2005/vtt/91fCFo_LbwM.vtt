00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.358
All right.
Let's just remind ourselves for

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:13.208
a moment where we were,
and that is that we were

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:16.402
talking about the structure of
the atom.

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:19.761
And we talked about how
classical physics,

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:23.856
the classical mechanics,
classical electromagnetism

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:28.279
failed to explain how the
electron and the nucleus hung

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.534
together.
And I said that the clues about

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:37.193
how to solve that conundrum
actually came from a different

00:00:37.193 --> 00:00:41.198
area of discussion,
and that is this wave-particle

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:44.305
duality.
And so remember that I said we

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:48.964
are going to put aside that
discussion of the structure of

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:52.070
the atom all the way until next
Monday.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.950
Pardon?
No class Monday?

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.000
We're going to put it aside all
the way until next Wednesday.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.072
Thank you.
[LAUGHTER] You sound surprised?

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:07.649
You're not.
It's a student holiday on

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.225
Monday.
And we're going to talk about

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:15.695
the wave-particle duality of
light and matter,

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:21.357
get clues from that area of
discussion, and we're going to

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:26.125
apply those clues,
then, to solving the structure

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:31.956
of the atom next Wednesday.
Now, we started on this

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:37.144
discussion by talking about the
wave-like nature of radiation.

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:41.737
And to illustrate that,
we did this two-slit experiment

00:01:41.737 --> 00:01:44.798
where we saw an interference
pattern.

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:49.391
And we talked about how that
interference pattern arose

00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:53.559
because of the property of
superposition of waves.

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:58.492
That is, if you have waves in
the two same points in space,

00:01:58.492 --> 00:02:03.000
their amplitudes superpose,
or they add.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.059
And because some of those
amplitudes are positive and some

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:10.192
are negative,
depending on the relative phase

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:13.112
of the waves,
you have constructive or you

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:17.314
have destructive interference.
And specifically what we were

00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:20.946
trying to understand is,
in the two-slit experiment,

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:24.364
why we had this line of bright
spots, dark spots,

00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:27.000
bright spots,
dark spots.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.906
And we analyzed it by drawing
these semicircles,

00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:35.809
which represent the wave front
kind of sneaking through this

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:40.048
little pinhole here,
this slit, emanating equally in

00:02:40.048 --> 00:02:43.123
all directions.
These semicircles here

00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:48.359
represent the crest of the wave.
The distance here between these

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.434
crests is 1 lambda,
is one wavelength.

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:56.420
And when we look closely-- Can
we dim the lights in the front

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.455
here?
If you closely,

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:04.501
what we discovered is that all
points along this line

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:09.838
constructively interfere.
That is we have waves that are

00:03:09.838 --> 00:03:15.854
at the same place in space and
the maxima and the minima are in

00:03:15.854 --> 00:03:21.094
the same place in space,
and so that's going to lead to

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:24.684
a very bright spot here on the
screen.

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:30.409
The amplitude is going to be
twice as high as it was in each

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:36.211
of the individual waves.
And we get this very bright

00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:39.078
spot.
And we realize that along this

00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:43.583
line, the difference in the
distance traveled by the two

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:48.006
waves that are constructively
interfering was 1 lambda.

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:51.037
And then we did so for this
line here.

00:03:51.037 --> 00:03:54.477
And we discovered that all
along this line,

00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:58.000
we had these two waves in
phase.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.483
All along this line we had
constructive interference which,

00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:05.574
of course, imaged as another
bright spot.

00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:09.826
And when we analyzed it,
we found that the difference in

00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:13.768
the distance traveled by the two
waves was 2 lambda.

00:04:13.768 --> 00:04:17.169
And likewise here.
All along this line we had

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.956
constructive interference imaged
as a bright spot.

00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:25.207
And we recognize that in this
case the difference in the

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:30.000
distance traveled by the two
waves was 0 lambda.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.772
And given that pattern,
we then concluded that there

00:04:34.772 --> 00:04:39.732
was a general condition for
constructive interference.

00:04:39.732 --> 00:04:44.598
That is if you had maximum
constructive interference,

00:04:44.598 --> 00:04:49.090
the general condition that had
to apply was this:

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.144
that the difference in the
distance traveled by the two

00:04:54.144 --> 00:04:58.636
waves was an integral multiple
of the wavelength,

00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:02.660
where this integer N could be
0, or 1, or 2,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.923
or 3, or 4.
And it's actually symmetric

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.629
here along the center of the two
slits.

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.045
So you would see the same kind
of interference pattern up here.

00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:17.678
And so we call this
interference feature right here,

00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:21.381
we often call it the zero-order
interference feature.

00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:24.088
We call this one,
when N is equal to 1,

00:05:24.088 --> 00:05:26.652
the first-order.
We call this one the

00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:30.000
second-order interference
feature.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.032
And in between the very bright
spots on that screen,

00:05:35.032 --> 00:05:39.671
what we have are dark spots
here, here and here.

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:45.394
And what I am going to ask you
to do in recitation section,

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:50.328
actually next Tuesday,
is to look at what condition

00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:56.052
has to apply in order to have
these dark spots which result

00:05:56.052 --> 00:06:01.025
from destructive interference.
And, of course,

00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:03.826
when you analyze that you're
going to see,

00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:06.833
say right here,
the crest, the maximum of one

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:10.797
wave at the same point in space
as the minimum of the other

00:06:10.797 --> 00:06:13.257
wave.
And you get maximum destructive

00:06:13.257 --> 00:06:15.922
interference everywhere along
that line.

00:06:15.922 --> 00:06:19.681
And what you will do in
recitation next week is actually

00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:24.054
to figure out what the condition
is for destructive interference.

00:06:24.054 --> 00:06:28.223
And that is going to be N plus
one half times lambda.

00:06:28.223 --> 00:06:33.297
So, it is this observation of

00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:40.005
these interference phenomena
that are characteristics of the

00:06:40.005 --> 00:06:44.781
wave-like nature of anything.
In this case,

00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:49.670
the wave-like nature of light,
of radiation.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:56.492
On Friday, what we are going to
do is we're going to see this

00:06:56.492 --> 00:07:02.860
same sort of interference
phenomena, a property of waves,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.000
be observed from particles,
from electrons.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.536
This diagram,
you are going to see once again

00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:16.938
on Friday.
And we will use that to

00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:21.577
demonstrate the wave-like nature
of particles,

00:07:21.577 --> 00:07:25.494
electrons.
That is our evidence for the

00:07:25.494 --> 00:07:32.393
wave-like nature of light.
Now, what we are going to do is

00:07:32.393 --> 00:07:38.195
we're going to talk about the
other behavior of light,

00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:43.887
and that is the particle light
behavior of radiation.

00:07:43.887 --> 00:07:47.390
And I forgot to get out my
notes.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.754
What is that evidence?
Well, soon after Thompson's

00:07:52.754 --> 00:07:58.665
discovery of the electron,
there were some observations

00:07:58.665 --> 00:08:06.000
being made of something called
the photoelectric effect.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.915
And this was very curious.
The photoelectric effect is

00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:18.946
simply that you have some metal
here and you shine some light on

00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:23.187
that metal.
And what happens is that an

00:08:23.187 --> 00:08:26.089
electron is ejected.
Metal.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:31.000
Light coming in.
Electron comes out.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.501
But the frequency of this light
that is coming in,

00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:39.818
this frequency nu,
we talked about frequency the

00:08:39.818 --> 00:08:45.238
other day, has to be greater
than or equal to some threshold

00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:50.107
frequency, some threshold
frequency that I am going to

00:08:50.107 --> 00:08:52.863
call nu nought.
In other words,

00:08:52.863 --> 00:08:58.007
if I come in with radiation
here that has got a frequency

00:08:58.007 --> 00:09:03.152
that is less than nu nought,
well, then no electrons come

00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:10.179
off of the metal.
Maybe we could raise the screen

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:16.651
here for the moment.
Well, another way to kind of

00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:25.146
plot that observation is to just
plot number of electrons versus

00:09:25.146 --> 00:09:31.846
the frequency of the radiation.
And so if you're at low

00:09:31.846 --> 00:09:36.583
frequency, there are going to be
no electrons that come off,

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:40.518
but then when you get to some
frequency nu nought,

00:09:40.518 --> 00:09:44.291
all of a sudden electrons are
going to come off.

00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:49.029
And the number of electrons
that come off is going to remain

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:53.124
constant as you increase the
frequency of the light.

00:09:53.124 --> 00:09:57.781
And typically this frequency of
the light that causes these

00:09:57.781 --> 00:10:03.000
electrons to be emitted is in
the ultraviolet range.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.633
Well, this was a curious
observation in the late 1800s,

00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:11.666
very early 1900s.
And scientists just started to

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:16.729
measure everything about these
electrons they possibly could

00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:21.448
measure, because they just
didn't understand the effect.

00:10:21.448 --> 00:10:26.683
And one of the things that they
measured is the kinetic energy

00:10:26.683 --> 00:10:31.414
of the electrons.
Here I am going to plot kinetic

00:10:31.414 --> 00:10:34.452
energy, KE.
And they measure the kinetic

00:10:34.452 --> 00:10:39.281
energy of the electrons as the
function of the frequency of the

00:10:39.281 --> 00:10:42.163
light.
Again, at low frequencies there

00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:46.213
is no kinetic energy,
because there are no electrons.

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:49.484
But then here,
at some frequency nu nought,

00:10:49.484 --> 00:10:54.002
all of a sudden electrons come
out, and lo and behold-- And

00:10:54.002 --> 00:10:57.741
these are points just
representing the individual

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:01.159
measurements--
Lo and behold,

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:04.887
as you increase the frequency
above nu nought,

00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:09.195
the kinetic energy increased.
It increased and looked

00:11:09.195 --> 00:11:13.088
directly proportional.
The kinetic energy looked

00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:17.313
directly proportional to the
frequency of the light.

00:11:17.313 --> 00:11:21.538
Well, let me tell you,
that was a big mystery as far

00:11:21.538 --> 00:11:25.017
as classical physical ideas were
concerned.

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:30.006
That was a big mystery.
Because, in the classical

00:11:30.006 --> 00:11:34.982
physics that was understood at
that time, the kinetic energy of

00:11:34.982 --> 00:11:37.952
the electrons,
KE as a function of the

00:11:37.952 --> 00:11:41.724
frequency of light,
well, that classical physics

00:11:41.724 --> 00:11:46.620
would predict that that kinetic
energy were independent of the

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.874
frequency of the light.
There was nothing in the known

00:11:50.874 --> 00:11:54.806
classical physics,
classical electromagnetism that

00:11:54.806 --> 00:11:59.783
would allow the frequency of the
light to be related in any way

00:11:59.783 --> 00:12:05.000
to the kinetic energy of the
electrons kicked off.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.991
There was no reason for why
bluer light, which has a higher

00:12:09.991 --> 00:12:14.207
frequency, would eject electrons
and redder light,

00:12:14.207 --> 00:12:19.026
which has a lower frequency
would not eject the electron.

00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:23.501
And classical physics also
predicted that the kinetic

00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:28.664
energy of the electrons should
be dependent on the intensity,

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:34.000
I am going to call it I,
the intensity of the light.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.868
In kind of general this sort of
dependence.

00:12:37.868 --> 00:12:42.934
That is, the brighter the
light, the more kinetic energy

00:12:42.934 --> 00:12:46.894
these electrons ought to be
kicked out with.

00:12:46.894 --> 00:12:50.394
In other words,
the brighter the light,

00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:54.815
the more energy you were
putting into that metal.

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:58.960
And, therefore,
the electrons should be kicked

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.673
out with more energy.
That's what classical physics

00:13:04.673 --> 00:13:07.992
was predicting.
But the measurements,

00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:13.248
go in the lab and you do the
measurement, the measurements

00:13:13.248 --> 00:13:18.226
showed that the kinetic energy
was independent of these

00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:22.283
intensities of light.
This is the experiment.

00:13:22.283 --> 00:13:28.000
It had nothing to do with the
intensity of the light.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.443
The kinetic energy remained the
same no matter how bright that

00:13:33.443 --> 00:13:38.709
light was, not matter how much
energy you were sticking into

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:41.208
the system.
Now what changed,

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:46.473
here, as you put more and more
energy or as you put more and

00:13:46.473 --> 00:13:50.489
more intensity,
what changed was the number of

00:13:50.489 --> 00:13:55.219
electrons that came off,
but not their kinetic energy.

00:13:55.219 --> 00:14:00.663
So, this was another conundrum
here, in terms of being able to

00:14:00.663 --> 00:14:07.000
explain it with the known
classical physics at that time.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.944
These data were around for a
few years before Einstein took a

00:14:13.944 --> 00:14:18.805
look at it.
And he looked at these plots of

00:14:18.805 --> 00:14:24.824
the kinetic energy versus the
frequency of the light.

00:14:24.824 --> 00:14:30.148
He looked at it,
for, say, this is the data for

00:14:30.148 --> 00:14:34.936
metal B.
Here is the data for metal A.

00:14:34.936 --> 00:14:39.189
In all cases,
it kind of looked like it was

00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:44.455
linearly dependent on it.
And the only thing that was

00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:49.012
seemingly different,
for the different metals,

00:14:49.012 --> 00:14:52.253
was the threshold frequency
here.

00:14:52.253 --> 00:14:57.113
What Einstein did,
a real leap here of intuition,

00:14:57.113 --> 00:15:04.000
was that he went and he fit a
straight line to this data.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.541
Well, he did a better job
fitting a straight line than I

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:12.764
did.
He fit a straight line here.

00:15:12.764 --> 00:15:17.298
Y equals mx plus b,
no problem,

00:15:17.298 --> 00:15:21.731
where kinetic energy is y and x
is nu, right?

00:15:21.731 --> 00:15:25.962
He looked at that and
calculated the slope.

00:15:25.962 --> 00:15:31.000
And he looked at it and he
looked at it.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.677
And he goes finally,
very interesting,

00:15:36.677 --> 00:15:46.343
because what was so interesting
here was the value of the slope,

00:15:46.343 --> 00:15:52.941
the value of m.
The value of this slope here

00:15:52.941 --> 00:16:00.000
was equal to 6.626x10^-34 joule
seconds.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.844
No matter what metal he looked
at, the value of the slope was

00:16:06.844 --> 00:16:11.863
6.626x10^-34 joule seconds.
So what, you say?

00:16:11.863 --> 00:16:18.707
Well, it was very interesting
to Einstein, because just a few

00:16:18.707 --> 00:16:24.524
years before there was a
gentleman who was analyzing

00:16:24.524 --> 00:16:30.000
what's called black-body
radiation data.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.440
Let me just explain this a
little bit to you,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.021
but you're not responsible for
it.

00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:38.992
What is a black-body?
Well, let's just,

00:16:38.992 --> 00:16:42.981
for a simple example,
think about the burner on your

00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.421
electric stove.
We will consider that to be a

00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:49.627
black-body.
What you know is that when you

00:16:49.627 --> 00:16:53.303
turn up the voltage,
that the temperature starts

00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:57.917
going up, and at some point the
temperature gets high enough

00:16:57.917 --> 00:17:03.000
such that the burner glows a
little bit dull red.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.640
And then if you turn it up some
more, it gets hotter,

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.160
the burner glows a little bit
redder.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.329
That's the black-body
radiation.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.970
If you turn it up some more,
the burner glows orange.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.259
Frequency going up.
If you turn it up some more,

00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:21.900
and you better not do this,
the burner starts glowing

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.000
yellow.
And then, if you could,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.079
and you probably cannot turn it
up some more,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:31.000
it ultimately is white.
All frequencies.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.828
Now what scientists had been
doing, is that they had been

00:17:36.828 --> 00:17:43.386
analyzing the intensity of that
radiation from a black-body as a

00:17:43.386 --> 00:17:48.903
function of the frequency.
And they did it for lots of

00:17:48.903 --> 00:17:53.587
different temperatures.
This is our black-body

00:17:53.587 --> 00:17:57.438
radiation.
I am plotting the intensity

00:17:57.438 --> 00:18:00.781
here.
And so they dispersed the

00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:04.631
radiation, they analyzed it as a
function of frequency,

00:18:04.631 --> 00:18:08.836
and what they saw was a curve
that looked kind of like this.

00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:12.044
And this temperature here,
we will call it T1,

00:18:12.044 --> 00:18:15.679
that was for some temperature
T1, a low temperature.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:19.599
This isn't in your notes,
because you're not responsible

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.165
for this.
I'm just trying to make the

00:18:22.165 --> 00:18:25.800
importance here of this slope,
or I'm just trying to

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.006
illustrate the importance of
this value for the slope in the

00:18:30.006 --> 00:18:35.352
photoelectric experiment.
And then at a higher

00:18:35.352 --> 00:18:40.764
temperature here,
T2, the intensity got bigger,

00:18:40.764 --> 00:18:46.411
but also the maximum shifted to
higher frequency.

00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:52.529
And at temperature T3,
here now T3 is greater than T2

00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:57.941
and greater than T1,
frequency shifts even to a

00:18:57.941 --> 00:19:03.384
higher frequency.
That was the observation.

00:19:03.384 --> 00:19:06.151
This is dull red,
red, orange,

00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:09.108
etc.
Well, Planck was trying to,

00:19:09.108 --> 00:19:14.546
along with a lot of other
people, understand those curves.

00:19:14.546 --> 00:19:19.411
And he came up with a model.
And the model said that

00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:24.562
materials, these black-bodies,
had oscillators in them.

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:30.000
And these oscillators were
emitting radiation.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.875
These oscillators were
responsible for giving off this

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:38.646
radiation.
And he also added another twist

00:19:38.646 --> 00:19:43.246
to those oscillators in that
those oscillators were

00:19:43.246 --> 00:19:49.041
quantized, that they could only
emit discrete packets of energy.

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:54.284
And using that basic idea and
something called statistical

00:19:54.284 --> 00:19:59.252
mechanics, he was able to
calculate the shapes of these

00:19:59.252 --> 00:20:03.233
curves.
A lot of his calculation.

00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:08.594
And so this green here is going
to be a calculated curve here

00:20:08.594 --> 00:20:12.525
for T equals 1,
a calculated curve here for T

00:20:12.525 --> 00:20:16.725
equals 2, a calculated curve
here for T equal 3.

00:20:16.725 --> 00:20:21.549
He got the shape right,
but he didn't get the magnitude

00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:24.587
right.
And he said how do I get the

00:20:24.587 --> 00:20:30.163
magnitude right?
Well, what he realized is that

00:20:30.163 --> 00:20:35.435
in that formulation,
what he had to do was multiply

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:41.551
the frequency of the oscillators
by this constant m or this

00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:46.190
constant that is called h,
Planck's constant.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.197
Where does Planck's constant
come from?

00:20:50.197 --> 00:20:52.833
From this.
Hey, that's it.

00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:58.000
It is, in a sense,
a fitting constant.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.402
There isn't any derivation of
Planck's constant.

00:21:02.402 --> 00:21:06.898
You cannot sit down and derive
Planck's constant.

00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:11.112
It is our observation of the
way nature works.

00:21:11.112 --> 00:21:15.327
So that is where Planck's
constant comes from.

00:21:15.327 --> 00:21:19.917
And so you can imagine
Einstein's surprise when he

00:21:19.917 --> 00:21:23.008
analyzed these photoelectron
data.

00:21:23.008 --> 00:21:27.316
And, lo and behold,
out from the data comes the

00:21:27.316 --> 00:21:32.000
same constant that Planck had
found.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.616
And Einstein realized that
there must be something really

00:21:38.616 --> 00:21:45.232
very fundamental about this h,
about what is now known as

00:21:45.232 --> 00:21:49.130
Planck's constant.
So, he pursued.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:55.746
And what he did then was he
just wrote down the equations

00:21:55.746 --> 00:22:03.103
here for that straight line.
That's kinetic energy is equal

00:22:03.103 --> 00:22:08.068
to nu, that is my x,
the slope is h,

00:22:08.068 --> 00:22:14.586
and he found that the intercept
here was minus h times

00:22:14.586 --> 00:22:18.827
nu nought.
So, this will be then plus the

00:22:18.827 --> 00:22:22.758
intercept, or minus h,
times nu nought.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:30.000
That was the equation of the
line he fitted through the data.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.451
Now, he also realized he had
energy units on this side,

00:22:35.451 --> 00:22:40.195
so he better have had energy
units on this side.

00:22:40.195 --> 00:22:45.545
If this is a frequency,
then h must have the unit such

00:22:45.545 --> 00:22:49.381
that h times nu,
this has to be energy.

00:22:49.381 --> 00:22:54.832
And since this is the frequency
of the light coming in,

00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:59.274
this energy E,
that must be the energy of the

00:22:59.274 --> 00:23:04.793
incident light.
And here is where this equation

00:23:04.793 --> 00:23:09.029
E equals h nu comes from.
This is it.

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:12.453
This is where this equation
comes from.

00:23:12.453 --> 00:23:17.500
What it is telling you is that
the energy of the light is

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.726
proportional to the frequency.
This was the first time that

00:23:22.726 --> 00:23:27.773
there was any indication that
the energy of the light had

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:33.000
anything to do with the
frequency of the light.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:40.061
The very first time.
And what E equals h nu ended up

00:23:40.061 --> 00:23:46.015
being thought of is as a
particle of energy,

00:23:46.015 --> 00:23:52.246
as a packet of energy,
as a quantum of energy,

00:23:52.246 --> 00:23:57.923
as, eventually,
it is going to be called a

00:23:57.923 --> 00:24:02.874
photon.
The photon, this particle or

00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:07.801
packet of energy,
is given by its frequency times

00:24:07.801 --> 00:24:11.701
this constant,
this natural constant h,

00:24:11.701 --> 00:24:15.910
Planck's constant.
You could have here any

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:21.864
frequency of light you wanted,
but the energy of that light

00:24:21.864 --> 00:24:27.715
only comes in chunks given by
this quantization constant h

00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:33.837
times that frequency.
I will explain that a little

00:24:33.837 --> 00:24:37.587
more in just a moment.
Well, likewise,

00:24:37.587 --> 00:24:42.959
this h times nu nought here,
that better be an energy,

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:46.202
also.
And so what that h times nu

00:24:46.202 --> 00:24:50.763
nought is,
is the threshold energy.

00:24:50.763 --> 00:24:56.743
Since nu nought was a threshold
frequency, h times nu nought

00:24:56.743 --> 00:25:03.970
better be the threshold energy.
And let's try to understand

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:08.369
that in terms of an energy level
diagram.

00:25:08.369 --> 00:25:15.079
I am going to plot here energy.
This electron that is bound to

00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:21.680
the metal, before we shine any
light on it, I am going to let

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.069
its energy level be represented
here by this line.

00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:34.000
This is the electron bound to
the metal way down here.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.178
And what we know now is that it
takes some energy,

00:25:38.178 --> 00:25:42.015
h times nu nought,
to rip that electron apart,

00:25:42.015 --> 00:25:45.426
to pull it off.
And so I am going to draw

00:25:45.426 --> 00:25:50.457
another energy level up here
which is going to represent the

00:25:50.457 --> 00:25:54.038
energy of the electron free from
the metal.

00:25:54.038 --> 00:25:59.069
So, I will call it "electron
free." And the amount of energy

00:25:59.069 --> 00:26:04.271
that we have to put in to get it
out is this threshold energy,

00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:07.884
h times nu nought.
This energy,

00:26:07.884 --> 00:26:11.646
here, is like an ionization
potential, which you are

00:26:11.646 --> 00:26:14.890
familiar with.
The energy required to pull an

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.651
electron off an atom or a
molecule is the ionization

00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:20.938
potential.
Well, this is like an

00:26:20.938 --> 00:26:24.477
ionization potential.
It really is the ionization

00:26:24.477 --> 00:26:28.165
potential, except since it's
coming off of a metal,

00:26:28.165 --> 00:26:32.000
historically we call it
something else.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.930
It's called the work function.
And we give it often the symbol

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.236
phi.
But phi and h times nu nought,

00:26:41.236 --> 00:26:46.486
they are the same thing,
the energy required to rip the

00:26:46.486 --> 00:26:50.763
electron off.
And so what we

00:26:50.763 --> 00:26:56.402
know is that the packet of
energy that you send in here has

00:26:56.402 --> 00:27:01.711
to be at least this amount.
In other words,

00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:08.098
if you come in with a photon
and the photon has this much

00:27:08.098 --> 00:27:14.600
energy, E sub i = h nought,
you can ripe the electron off,

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.479
but you have to have at least
this.

00:27:18.479 --> 00:27:25.209
Now, you can come in with a
photon that has more energy than

00:27:25.209 --> 00:27:30.000
that, E sub i,
from here to here.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.785
But if you do,
then the rest of this energy

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:39.014
here, the rest of this energy
goes to the kinetic energy of

00:27:39.014 --> 00:27:42.980
the electron.
So, if you come in with exactly

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.208
the energy, the electron is
ripped off, but it doesn't move

00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:52.535
away from the metal.
If you come in with a little

00:27:52.535 --> 00:27:56.681
bit more, the electron is ripped
off the metal,

00:27:56.681 --> 00:28:02.000
but it actually moves away then
from the metal.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.431
And so, in this case and in all
cases, we have got to conserve

00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:11.911
energy.
The incident energy of the

00:28:11.911 --> 00:28:17.710
light, from here to here,
has to be equal to h nu nought

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:22.877
plus the kinetic energy,
or if I turn this around,

00:28:22.877 --> 00:28:29.204
the kinetic energy is equal to
the incident energy minus h nu

00:28:29.204 --> 00:28:33.000
nought.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.402
This is an important
expression.

00:28:36.402 --> 00:28:41.670
You need to know it.
I won't give it to you on an

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.512
exam.
You don't have to memorize it,

00:28:45.512 --> 00:28:48.914
though.
You just have to reason.

00:28:48.914 --> 00:28:54.073
You have to reason here,
conservation of energy.

00:28:54.073 --> 00:29:00.000
You can draw this diagram and
figure it out.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.977
Now, another very important
point here that I am going to

00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:08.888
emphasize is that you
absolutely, positively,

00:29:08.888 --> 00:29:12.355
no question,
have to have a photon of at

00:29:12.355 --> 00:29:16.000
least this energy to get the
electron off.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.444
What you cannot do is you
cannot have, for example,

00:29:20.444 --> 00:29:25.599
a photon with half of this
energy, one half h nu nought.

00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:30.573
Or, what you cannot do is have

00:29:30.573 --> 00:29:35.633
two photons come in with a half
of this energy and make that

00:29:35.633 --> 00:29:39.751
electron come off.
You have to have one photon to

00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:44.039
make this electron come off,
and it has to have the

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:48.414
frequency nu nought.
That's the particle-like nature

00:29:48.414 --> 00:29:52.359
of the radiation.
Even though you have the same

00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:57.248
total amount of energy here,
the fact that you cannot have

00:29:57.248 --> 00:30:02.395
two to pull the electron off,
you have to have one and it has

00:30:02.395 --> 00:30:09.000
to have at least this quantum,
at least that packet of energy.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.133
That's very important.
All the problems you are going

00:30:14.133 --> 00:30:19.364
to do, if one photon comes in,
you're going to get one

00:30:19.364 --> 00:30:25.188
electron off as long as that
photon has h times nu nought of

00:30:25.188 --> 00:30:28.841
energy.
Now what we've got to do is we

00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:32.000
have to do our own.
Yes?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.020
If the energy of the incident
photon, if this energy here is

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:52.938
twice the work function energy,
yes, the electron will come

00:30:52.938 --> 00:30:59.265
off, and the excess energy that
doesn't go to the metal to pull

00:30:59.265 --> 00:31:06.000
the electron off goes to the
kinetic energy of the electron.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.538
And so if this incident energy
is twice the work function,

00:31:10.538 --> 00:31:15.235
well, then the kinetic energy
of that electron will be equal

00:31:15.235 --> 00:31:17.703
to the work function.
I'm sorry?

00:31:17.703 --> 00:31:21.843
Two electrons won't come out.
That's a good question.

00:31:21.843 --> 00:31:25.585
What she asked was,
if I put twice the amount of

00:31:25.585 --> 00:31:31.000
energy here with one photon,
will I get two electrons out?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.171
No, absolutely not.
That is the quantum nature or

00:31:37.171 --> 00:31:41.799
the particle nature of the
radiation.

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:47.071
Let's do our own photoelectron
experiment.

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:49.000
Question?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.896
Those graphs up here,
kinetic energy versus the

00:32:03.896 --> 00:32:08.131
frequency of light,
those were the predictions from

00:32:08.131 --> 00:32:12.112
classical physics.
Kinetic energy independent of

00:32:12.112 --> 00:32:15.500
frequency.
Kinetic energy increasing with

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.650
the intensity of light.
Those are predictions from

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.445
classical physics.
How I got them,

00:32:22.445 --> 00:32:27.019
how I knew about them is
something that we're not going

00:32:27.019 --> 00:32:31.000
to talk about because it's
wrong.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.110
It's best at this point not to
go through the logic of how I

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:43.428
got that, but maybe after you
have 8.02 it will become obvious

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:45.603
to you.
Good question.

00:32:45.603 --> 00:32:49.849
Let's do our own photoelectron
experiment.

00:32:49.849 --> 00:32:55.442
Now we need the camera here.
And now, what I also need,

00:32:55.442 --> 00:33:00.000
is-- Let me get this started
here.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.796
What I also need are two
volunteers to help us do this

00:33:05.796 --> 00:33:08.421
experiment.
Come on down.

00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:14.000
Somebody else want to come?
Okay, come on down.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.802
All right.
I have two volunteers here.

00:33:37.802 --> 00:33:43.146
Oh, I forgot to tell you that I
need to do something,

00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:47.462
so you've got to stay up here
for a moment.

00:33:47.462 --> 00:33:51.470
I forgot to explain something.
My fault.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.169
Sorry.
Maybe you want to turn around.

00:33:55.169 --> 00:34:00.000
I forgot to tell you something,
here.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
What we're going to do --

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
-- is use this device here.
This is an aluminum plate.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.827
And you are going to see it,
here, on the side walls.

00:34:33.827 --> 00:34:37.434
That is a picture of the device
we've got up here.

00:34:37.434 --> 00:34:41.261
This is an aluminum plate.
And that aluminum plate is

00:34:41.261 --> 00:34:44.500
mounted to a metal rod.
That's that blue rod.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.032
And then there is a needle here
in that blue rod,

00:34:48.032 --> 00:34:51.860
and it's mounted on a pivot,
so it moves very easily.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.467
What we're going to do,
is we're going to put some

00:34:55.467 --> 00:34:59.000
excess charge on this metal
plate.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.391
And when we do that,
that needle is going to

00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:05.310
deflect.
It's going to deflect because

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.071
those excess charges,
the electrons,

00:35:08.071 --> 00:35:12.251
are going to run down that
metal rod and then onto the

00:35:12.251 --> 00:35:15.249
needle.
And since these electrons repel

00:35:15.249 --> 00:35:19.114
each other, and this is a very
low friction pivot,

00:35:19.114 --> 00:35:23.610
this needle is going to move.
And then what we're going to

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.870
try to do is we're going to try
to do the photoelectron

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:31.937
experiment.
We are going to come in and

00:35:31.937 --> 00:35:36.244
shine some UV radiation on this
plate and see if we can eject

00:35:36.244 --> 00:35:39.114
electrons.
That's what we're going to do.

00:35:39.114 --> 00:35:42.775
Now I've got my volunteers who
are going to do this.

00:35:42.775 --> 00:35:47.009
Who wants to be the charger?
Who wants to be the discharger?

00:35:47.009 --> 00:35:48.947
You'll be the charger,
okay.

00:35:48.947 --> 00:35:51.746
This will be your weapon.
You hold that.

00:35:51.746 --> 00:35:54.976
You hold that.
Keep your fingers on the yellow

00:35:54.976 --> 00:35:57.272
plastic.
This is going to be your

00:35:57.272 --> 00:36:02.555
weapon, the UV light.
I am going to need you in a

00:36:02.555 --> 00:36:06.624
moment, so just stand by.
What is your name?

00:36:06.624 --> 00:36:10.504
Don, okay.
Don, what you need to do is you

00:36:10.504 --> 00:36:16.372
need to take that Lucite rod and
rub it really hard on the fur.

00:36:16.372 --> 00:36:21.671
And what that is going to do
is, the fur has some natural

00:36:21.671 --> 00:36:27.634
oil, and he is going to transfer
a little bit of the natural oil

00:36:27.634 --> 00:36:31.702
onto that rod.
And there are some stray

00:36:31.702 --> 00:36:34.964
electrons around and some
negative ions around,

00:36:34.964 --> 00:36:37.163
and they like to be on that
oil.

00:36:37.163 --> 00:36:41.631
But then we're going to contact
that rod with the aluminum plate

00:36:41.631 --> 00:36:45.106
and the electrons will go onto
the aluminum plate.

00:36:45.106 --> 00:36:49.219
So, you've got to rub this
really hard, and then you've got

00:36:49.219 --> 00:36:52.411
to go and touch that and put the
electrons on.

00:36:52.411 --> 00:36:55.319
And you should watch the needle
move here.

00:36:55.319 --> 00:36:58.439
You've got to touch it on the
edge, actually.

00:36:58.439 --> 00:37:04.264
Good.
Well, you charged it a little

00:37:04.264 --> 00:37:07.058
bit.
That's not bad.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:14.852
Now take the rod again and rub
it really, really hard.

00:37:14.852 --> 00:37:22.205
[LAUGHTER] Really hard.
Touch the edge of the plate

00:37:22.205 --> 00:37:27.205
there.
Touch the edge of the plate.

00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:30.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.929
This way.
You've got it.

00:37:36.929 --> 00:37:40.956
Pretty charge there.
Touch the edge of the plate.

00:37:40.956 --> 00:37:44.060
Fantastic.
Now we need the discharger.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:48.926
You've got to come right here
and shine the UV light on the

00:37:48.926 --> 00:37:52.030
base of it.
You've got to get a little

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.050
closer.
Maybe turn your hand this way

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.986
so that people can see it
discharge.

00:37:57.986 --> 00:38:01.170
Fantastic.
Try it again.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:05.219
Come on, charge it up.
[LAUGHTER] Really hard.

00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:09.000
Touch the edge of the plate.
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.136
This way.
This works the best.

00:38:24.136 --> 00:38:26.936
All right.
Touch the edge of the plate.

00:38:26.936 --> 00:38:29.000
Let's get it.
Fantastic.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.683
Maybe just a little bit more.
We can get more electrons.

00:38:34.683 --> 00:38:37.679
Hard, hard, hard,
really hard.

00:38:37.679 --> 00:38:39.539
Okay.
Charge it up.

00:38:39.539 --> 00:38:42.019
Oh, okay.
Discharge here.

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:47.083
[LAUGHTER] Fantastic.
What you saw was when the UV

00:38:47.083 --> 00:38:52.250
radiation then was incident on
that aluminum plate,

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:58.036
the electrons were emitted,
and then the needle deflected

00:38:58.036 --> 00:39:03.373
back.
Now we've got to do this one

00:39:03.373 --> 00:39:08.072
more time.
Why don't you come over here?

00:39:08.072 --> 00:39:10.963
What is your name?
Jenny.

00:39:10.963 --> 00:39:14.457
Come on over here,
if you can.

00:39:14.457 --> 00:39:18.915
And this time,
after you charge it up,

00:39:18.915 --> 00:39:25.903
I am going to hold this glass
Pyrex plate between the light

00:39:25.903 --> 00:39:33.294
and the aluminum plate.
And that is going to prevent

00:39:33.294 --> 00:39:39.764
the UV radiation from going
through, and so it shouldn't

00:39:39.764 --> 00:39:41.529
discharge.
Okay?

00:39:41.529 --> 00:39:43.764
All right.
Go ahead.

00:39:43.764 --> 00:39:47.529
Let's charge it up one more
time.

00:39:47.529 --> 00:39:52.588
You really do have to rub that
oil on there.

00:39:52.588 --> 00:39:57.294
[LAUGHTER] Really hard.
Touch it up here.

00:39:57.294 --> 00:40:02.879
Fantastic.
Now I am going to put the light

00:40:02.879 --> 00:40:06.408
there and now we are going to
shine it.

00:40:06.408 --> 00:40:11.888
Oops, it's already discharging.
You've got to do it one more

00:40:11.888 --> 00:40:14.953
time.
You've got to do the control

00:40:14.953 --> 00:40:17.554
experiment here.
Really hard.

00:40:17.554 --> 00:40:22.569
It's a little bit humid out
today, so it's a little bit

00:40:22.569 --> 00:40:26.749
harder to make this work.
A little bit harder.

00:40:26.749 --> 00:40:30.000
Done.
Get it up there.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.572
All right.
Touch the side there.

00:40:33.572 --> 00:40:36.338
Good.
That's pretty good.

00:40:36.338 --> 00:40:41.063
Fantastic.
We've blocked the UV radiation.

00:40:41.063 --> 00:40:45.903
Electrons didn't jump off.
Hey, this works.

00:40:45.903 --> 00:40:50.858
Thank you very much.
Let's give them a hand.

00:40:50.858 --> 00:40:57.657
[APPLAUSE] Thank you very much.
This photoelectron business,

00:40:57.657 --> 00:41:01.000
it's really real.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
What I want to do now is I want
to just work a couple of

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
problems.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.064
And here is the first problem.
What it says is,

00:41:32.064 --> 00:41:38.129
how many photons,
at the radiation wavelength of

00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:45.741
1 picometer, do you need to
supply a pulse of energy that is

00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:50.129
a 1 joule pulse,
say, from a laser?

00:41:50.129 --> 00:41:56.193
It's a pulse laser.
Suppose you want to supply 1

00:41:56.193 --> 00:42:02.000
joule of energy in this light
pulse.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.953
That is what the problem says,
1 joule in a pulse.

00:42:06.953 --> 00:42:13.220
Now, how do you work a problem?
Lots of ways to work a problem.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.555
Sometimes I like to draw
pictures.

00:42:16.555 --> 00:42:21.812
1 joule, that's my 1 joule.
I want 1 joule of energy.

00:42:21.812 --> 00:42:27.472
But I am told that I have
radiation that has a wavelength

00:42:27.472 --> 00:42:32.500
of 1 picometer.
That's 1x10^-12 meters.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.521
That's the wavelength of my
radiation.

00:42:36.521 --> 00:42:41.086
And I am asked,
how many photons do I need?

00:42:41.086 --> 00:42:45.108
Well, what do you know about a
photon?

00:42:45.108 --> 00:42:51.521
We said that the energy of a
photon is equal to h times nu .

00:42:51.521 --> 00:42:55.978
That's one photon,
the energy of a photon.

00:42:55.978 --> 00:43:03.538
The units here are joules.
Implied is joules per photon.

00:43:03.538 --> 00:43:10.250
And so I know the wavelength,
I don't know the frequency

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:16.474
here, but I know the
relationship between wavelength

00:43:16.474 --> 00:43:21.599
and frequency.
Frequency is equal to c over

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:27.213
the wavelength.
And so I can then calculate the

00:43:27.213 --> 00:43:33.803
energy, and when I do that,
it's 1.99x10^-13 joules per

00:43:33.803 --> 00:43:39.567
photon.
Carrying one more digit than is

00:43:39.567 --> 00:43:45.781
significant because this is an
intermediate step in our

00:43:45.781 --> 00:43:50.500
calculation.
And now, if I want a pulse of

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:56.369
energy that is one joule,
and each photon has 10^-13

00:43:56.369 --> 00:44:01.892
joules per photon,
well, that's 1 J / 1.99x10^-13

00:44:01.892 --> 00:44:07.919
joules per photon.
Well, you can calculate that.

00:44:07.919 --> 00:44:11.342
It comes out to be 5x10^12
photons.

00:44:11.342 --> 00:44:16.073
That's what I will need then.
That's the answer,

00:44:16.073 --> 00:44:20.000
then.
Let me just write that down.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Let's work one more where we
can understand.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.951
This is important,
because you need it for your

00:44:34.951 --> 00:44:38.072
homework.
Here is the problem.

00:44:38.072 --> 00:44:43.993
You've got power of a radiation
from a continuous laser.

00:44:43.993 --> 00:44:48.298
You turn on your laser,
you've got power.

00:44:48.298 --> 00:44:53.034
What is power?
Power is energy per unit time.

00:44:53.034 --> 00:44:59.170
We're going to use in our unit
system the unit of power as

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:04.270
watt.
A watt is a joule per second.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:09.684
It is how much energy is
delivered per unit time.

00:45:09.684 --> 00:45:16.225
And we're told that we've got
radiation of 3 milliwatts,

00:45:16.225 --> 00:45:20.736
that's 3.0x10^-3 joules
per second.

00:45:20.736 --> 00:45:25.586
The question is,
how long will it take for a

00:45:25.586 --> 00:45:31.000
total energy of 1 joule to be
supplied?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.815
Well, 1 joule divided by
3.0x10^-3 joules per second

00:45:37.815 --> 00:45:44.497
equals 330 seconds.

00:45:44.497 --> 00:45:49.041
And then,
rushing through this,

00:45:49.041 --> 00:45:54.387
one more.
How many photons at a radiation

00:45:54.387 --> 00:46:00.000
wavelength of 1 picometer again
--

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:07.345
How many photons per second
have to be delivered if the

00:46:07.345 --> 00:46:12.514
power of the radiation is 3
milliwatts?

00:46:12.514 --> 00:46:17.411
Power is 3.0x10^-3 joules per
second.

00:46:17.411 --> 00:46:25.301
The radiation is 1 picometer,
but we already calculated how

00:46:25.301 --> 00:46:31.966
many joules there are in
radiation per photon with

00:46:31.966 --> 00:46:40.797
wavelengths of 1 picometer.
That's 1.99x10^-13 joules per

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:43.547
photon.
Joules cancel.

00:46:43.547 --> 00:46:51.404
And that means we're going to
have to have 1.5x10^-10 photons

00:46:51.404 --> 00:46:59.000
per second, because each photon
has this much energy.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.450
This was the power,
the rate at which we're

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:11.069
delivering the energy.
We're going to have this many

00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:19.375
photons per second coming out if
the photons have that wavelength

00:47:19.375 --> 00:47:22.100
of 1 picometer.
Great.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.833
See you later this afternoon or
on Friday.
