00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.939
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop not too long ago

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.089
We showed you how to use liquid nitrogen to turn soda into a delicious Slurpee at the end of that video

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.990
I said I might want to try it again

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.360
Using dry ice because the liquid nitrogen pulled all of the carbonation out of our soda

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.570
And I was curious if dry ice would put carbonation back into the soda as it froze it well today

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.279
We're gonna try a few different varieties of that. We'll see if we can get a Slurpee. That's still nice and fizzy

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.669
We've got our soda. We've got our dry ice let's get started

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.679
To start let's pour a measure of our soda into our Bowl

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.219
Then break up some

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.489
Medium sized chunks of our dry ice put that in and stir it and see if we can get our soda to start freezing

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.640
That's about the size

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.469
About the size I want get these chunks in there

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.839
just kind of stir it up and see if we can get it to start freezing into a slush

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.949
I don't really have a good sense for how long this should take I've never tried just

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.369
Chunks of dry ice and soda before to see how long it takes to solidify

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.349
We're getting somewhere getting some slush in there. That's what you want to see

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.879
Interesting how it's sort of freezing with a pebbled texture to it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.740
It's not going evenly everywhere

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.890
And I'm not sure what's causing the difference turning into a good slushy though, the question is whether enough of the carbon dioxide

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.479
Coming off of the dry ice has been dissolved into the slushy as it's mixing up and freezing to really give us a carbonated

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.699
Fizzy result when we eat this

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.019
Alright, I think that's a pretty good freeze on here try and scoop it from the bowl into our cup and of course we want

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.280
To avoid scooping any chunks of dry ice into our cup. We don't want to eat those

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.139
Just want them to cool everything down and add a little bit of carbonation, hopefully

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.649
There we go a homemade Slurpee it took five or six minutes of stirring up I would say and overall it works pretty

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.050
Well, it's a good texture, tastes really good

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.140
It's not very fizzy there might be a little bit, but there are a couple other things

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.790
I still want to try to see if they give us a little bit more fizz. For our next test

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.060
We're gonna take a similar

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.250
Quantity of dry ice but then we're gonna throw it in a blender and turn it into a very fine powder

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.459
We'll see what happens if we mix that powder in with our soda and see if we get a different texture a different freeze time

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.010
And if it's more or less carbonated than our first one

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.800
Our blender actually seals up airtight when it's closed so to keep the CO2 pressure from building up inside

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.199
We're gonna drill a small hole into the side of the cup

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.049
Alright, let's take our soda. Dump in our blended up CO2

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.730
It's not a complete powder

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
But there is a lot of powder in there

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.358
Wow that is definitely freezing way way faster

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.399
In fact it's frozen pretty much all of the way already

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.379
with a bunch of CO2

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.549
left over in it

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.349
And then of course we don't want to eat the dry ice which is one of the concerns

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.310
I had with this method is that we're putting

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.149
Powdered dry ice into the soda if the soda contains a little bits of dry ice that haven't turned back into gas

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.128
Then the dry ice would just go in your mouth if you started to eat it. We don't want to do that

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.680
wow that froze it so

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.929
so much faster, like I said it took five or six minutes with the chunks of dry ice just

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.658
constantly stirring with the powdered stuff it just

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.940
immediately almost started freezing together a lot more surface area

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.969
Alright here. We go. We've got our considerably more frozen slushy at this point

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.699
I think we've maybe even gone past the texture of slushy and

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.358
Into, I don't know it's kind of like the fruit flavored dippin dots almost it's not quite that frozen

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.860
And it's not that well defined you can't see the individual particles that much, but it is almost

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.179
Powdery it's so frozen. Alright I've got a spoonful of this

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.750
I'm trying to make sure there's no vapor rising off of it because I don't want any dry ice chunks in my mouth

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.020
Freezing onto my tongue that sounds uncomfortable

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.159
Let's try this

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.580
Still surprisingly little in terms of fizz. I don't know I think maybe

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.070
Carbon dioxide doesn't dissolved well into liquid when it's this cold once it starts freezing

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.220
They might squeeze all of the carbon dioxide out of it and just not hold any fizz left

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.660
Well there is another variety we want to try

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.260
We've still got some dry ice and as we've seen in the past if we freeze our dry ice in liquid nitrogen it becomes

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.379
Extremely brittle to the point where we can just sort of break it apart

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.769
So I'm going to try taking some dry ice freezing it in liquid nitrogen

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.170
Then breaking it apart into a dust and then using that to freeze our soda. Let's give it a shot

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.539
All right, we've got some liquid nitrogen in our bowl

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.730
Let's add a chunk of dry ice to it and let it really get cold in case dry ice isn't cold enough

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.649
Ha! it just falls right to pieces now, all right, let's see how soft this stuff is

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.589
Man, that does come apart really easily

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.010
In comparison normal dry ice

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.840
Nothing

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840
super frozen dry ice

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.660
Still hurt a little bit, but it broke up

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.100
Not even gonna blend this I'm just gonna put the lid on and then shake it up

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:33.029
That powdered most of it. We've got our little jet of carbon dioxide gas flying out here in the hole

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.029
Alright, let's pour off some soda, and then add our powdered carbon dioxide to it

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.729
Well I would say an even faster freeze time than the normal powdered dry ice. That goes so quickly

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.099
It's still so cold, I'm just gonna pour more soda on top of it

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.379
React with the rest of the dry ice in there

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.829
Compared to just a bottle of soda this seems like it has so much volume

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.580
It's got so much air and carbon dioxide added into it

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.780
It just seemed a lot bigger. I kind of wonder how much this could keep freezing

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.369
We got a whole bottle of soda, and it's you know it froze all of it no problem

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.989
I think we're gonna add more from a different bottle and see if we can get it to freeze some of that, too

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:37.588
More. I'm gonna keep going until it doesn't freeze it anymore or until I run out of bottles of soda

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:39.270
It's so weird

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.759
This is the same amount of dry ice for the most part as what went into our first batch with the larger chunks of dry ice

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:49.408
and it took a while to freeze just that much soda that was about half of one of these bottles and

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:52.558
In the end it still wasn't nearly as frozen as this is so

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:58.648
Grinding it up and changing the surface area makes a huge difference. Just got a little bit left in this bottle

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.680
Let's just top this off

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:06.419
There we go that's our orange and lime or sorry Mandarin and lime flavored

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:12.838
Sodas mixed together, and there is still chunks of dry ice in there. You can see the vapors that are still forming

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:15.539
I dig down I can pull a couple of them out

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:20.818
Take a gamble here. I don't think there's much dry ice in this bit

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.710
Mandarin line

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.100
That might have actually had a little bit of fizz to it

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.200
There you go making slushies using soda and dry ice. We tried a few different varieties

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.369
And we learned a few things - dry ice can freeze soda into a slushy consistency

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:45.849
If you use the large chunks, it may take a few minutes of stirring but you'll get there. You'll get a nice mixed-up, slushy consistency

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.989
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have much in the way of carbonation in fact none of our experiments really gave us a carbonated slushy for

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.400
The most part so something about soda seems to not really absorb the carbon dioxide once

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.910
It's gotten down to the temperature

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.179
Where it's cold enough to actually begin to freeze

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.729
We tried taking your dry ice and blending it up into a powder to see what difference that made when we mix it into our

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:13.180
Soda and it froze way faster. It went from five or six minutes of stirring to about 10 seconds of stirring

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:18.370
It was already frozen, but we also still had little chunks of dry ice sort of mixed in with our frozen soda

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.340
And we don't want to be putting the chunks of dry ice in our mouth

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:26.199
So you have to be really careful sort of picking around the dry ice as you scoop it out into your cup

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.660
Then finally we tried freezing our dry ice even more in liquid nitrogen to really bring the temperature down

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.940
Because that also makes it more fragile

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:39.760
So we took our super cool dry ice broke that down into tiny little chunks and powder and mixed that in with the soda.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.179
That did an amazing job of freezing the soda, very quickly as well. In fact

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.270
We're able to freeze two entire bottles full of our soda

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.729
And it still turned into slush and had some dry ice left over so overall the dry ice

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.390
Definitely has enough freezing power to make a slushy out of a bottle of soda

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.340
But it can take a while if you want to do it the safe method which is to leave some larger chunks that can easily

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.919
Be picked out once your slushy has formed

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:08.619
Thanks for joining us for this experiment today and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at thekingofrandom.com

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.620
See you there

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.710
Where's my spoon

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.499
Oh, that had dry ice in it
