&gt;&gt;Paul Stout: Thank you everyone for coming
on this Earth Day. I'm Paul Stout and it was

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:19.750
about, I think, three or four months ago,
my lovely wife introduced me to a website.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.759
It was about, a website on Mona Caron and
I hadn't heard of her before.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.510
We got to look at the website and it was actually
pretty interesting, very intriguing. The site

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.669
itself had a number of really large scale
public murals that she had done as well as

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.460
a number of other types of artworks, illustration.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.989
And we thought for - it was kind of a lark
almost and a good weather report over San

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.710
Francisco. We went up to the city and actually
kind of thought we'd do a Mona Caron tour

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.199
because she has several different public murals,
enormous - I'm talking about - when you think

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.109
of murals, you normally think of like, 'Okay,
the little thing on the side of my drugstore

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:03.940
in town' - no, these were like 30 x 10 foot
type of murals, like huge.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.710
And so we put together a little itinerary
for ourselves, went around and there's like

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.050
- it was really interesting, really thrilling
because this, the talent and the art itself

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.070
is absolutely fantastic. It's just, I encourage
you all to go do this.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.000
And it was about two months ago I think or
so in January when they had the - January,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.530
February, the San Francisco Historical Society
ran a kind of a special San Francisco History

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.360
Day and Mona was giving a talk there. So we
went up to see her and it was nice because

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.540
we're like, 'Oh, we get to put a face to this
beautiful work now'.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.140
But the interesting thing to me was that in
the talk it was - to hear a little bit, even

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.380
just a little bit in that talk about her own
personal journey of discovery almost and how

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.000
this public art, this idea of using, in her
case, these public murals were actually - became

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.340
really resounding points for how communities
started to come together.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.380
And this was in case, like one in particular
she's done - I'll let her get into the details

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.780
here but it was in the Tenderloin and these
are a lot of people who - not necessarily

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.990
the best part of San Francisco - have kind
of been a real center at one point and time

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.530
- and people who had lived next to each other
or close to each other for maybe 20 or 30

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.680
years and still didn't know each other.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.319
And yet by virtue of her coming in and starting
to do this project, now they're like a community

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.939
with a vision for their future. And so the
leadership aspects of this I thought were

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.999
actually very interesting, very phenomenal
especially as we start to look at how social

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.359
networking - how we can play into a social
networking that is more uplifting and more

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.230
building connections rather then just relying
on the connections I already have.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.820
So, without further ado, I want to let Mona
tell us her story. Thank you so much for coming

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.519
today, too. Thanks.

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.859
[applause]

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.859
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Thank you so much for being
here as well.

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.659
So I am going to talk to you a little bit
more about what was suggested to me by Paul

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.290
that might be of interest of you today and
kind of stressing a little bit how sometimes

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.760
you can use art to, to really relate to your
surroundings. And also how I use my own artwork

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.920
to try and change the very surrounding around
the mural as well and not simply the wall

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.829
that is painted, being painted itself.

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.700
I want to perhaps maybe minimize a little
bit of the statement. I definitely don't want

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.040
to presume that by virtue of my little presence,
I changed an entire neighborhood. That's not,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.599
not exactly what happens.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.430
In fact, the Tenderloin, as you will see,
is an incredibly rich neighborhood that actually

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.569
compared to only two other neighborhoods has
a lot of social interaction. It's a

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.340
place where public space is being used a lot
in very sociable ways, in ways that I think

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.040
are actually pretty great and I'll show you
more of that.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.420
However there's still - anyway, I will get
more into that. I just wanted to make a clarification

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:09.480
so I definitely do not presume to influence
the entire society to such a degree. [laughs]

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.959
But anyway, one scene that I chose for today
is to tie together a few of my murals. I did

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.049
a whole bunch. I've been doing murals for
12 years and I have several recurring themes

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.640
and one of them is that of the bird's eye
view.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.069
It's like - I like to do like these kind of
views from above over things. This is sort

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.259
of a cartoon that I drew for 'The Garden'
a while back that incorporates two of these

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.479
aspects. One is like this view from above
and the other one is a little bit of a fantasy

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:43.020
utopian vision that is also slightly post
apocalyptic. It's kind of a way of, you know,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.639
showing a joyful, perhaps zany through the
whole - you know, zaniness of it.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.280
Also, a little bit of a reflection of the
fact that no matter what's coming our way,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.389
if there's impending disasters, I don't know
if all these things are going to happen. I

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:06.430
insist still on trying to envision not just
our mere survival but actually a better life

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.740
for all of us despite all of these things.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:16.000
So that's kind of like the two essential points
that I try to make with these things so - so

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.139
I've always loved that bird's eye view thing.
So I've put myself in that vantage point quite

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:30.120
often and it's - this is a quick charcoal
drawing I did and it's not so much about detachment

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.150
but about gaining perspective.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.810
Because once you kind of pull back - it's
easy when you're in the midst of life, et

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.110
cetera --to go like - to take things that
happen to you really personal. It's like,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.349
'Oh, why am I stuck in traffic? Why me?',
et cetera.

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.629
And then like if you kind of pull back, you
see like well maybe we have a little something

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.120
to do with. with how things are around us.
It's just a way of gaining perspective. It's

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.319
not necessarily distance or it's - it's distance
but not detachment is what I'm trying to say.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:07.169
It is also for me a view kind of, of innocence
from nature back into the city somehow or

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:14.919
the civilization is kind of like a little
bit of a distance in that sense as well.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:21.169
Also this particular point of view that I
take is - a bird can move, right? It's dynamic.

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.840
You can go low so it's low enough to see the
details and the uniqueness of each individual

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:37.539
but it's also a more - you know, it's a point
of view that allows you to see other things

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:47.689
as well like what emerges are patterns, what
emerges are like the result, the cumulative

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:54.360
result of our collective actions. And also
the possibility of changing things when we

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.789
all get together, I guess. And it is to me
a little bit of a political vantage point

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:04.979
because I don't do so much what I call the
"hall of the fame" murals with a lot of portraits

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.520
of the people we look up to.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.080
Like here everybody is unique but you know
we're all - everybody is inhabiting the

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.180
space in the same plane, like we're all in
this together and like what I'm interested

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.360
in looking at really is precisely that -- how
we are unique and do our own thing and how

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.219
that looks like cumulatively when we do that.

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:31.449
And so this is still the same mural - I'm
just pulling back from the tiniest to the

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:37.389
largest so - [pause].

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:41.699
One thing that this allows me to do because
of the sweeping views is I can make quick

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:48.939
comparisons, comparisons across space. In
this case, the upper versus, fold under, the

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:54.700
lower part of 24th Street in San Francisco.
So one block difference in a very different

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:01.240
vibe and it's just a way of kind of like taking
a quick stock and a quick look at this fact.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:09.480
And -- or it also allows me to make comparisons
across time. So this a mural - it's called

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.160
the Market Street Railway Mural and it's a
180 degree bird's eye view of Market Street

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160
through time.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.550
So those vertical strips just show a different
era. But also kind of my goal with this was

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:32.110
kind of twofold. Like on one hand, when I
do these things, I want to use history not

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:37.060
just to make it look quaint but what I'm trying
to do actually is to use history as an argument

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.620
for radical change in the future.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:44.730
So basically, in other words, if we compare
the way things used to look not so long ago

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:50.779
and then with the present, it's actually quite
striking and we're often, I think we often

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:53.980
get into this, this way of thinking where
we're like, 'Well, we just need to accept

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.260
the way things are', you know? 'Live in the
world you are living', like 'Face reality'

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.590
and it's like you know things have changed
a lot in the past, why not again in the future?

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:07.610
And so one thing that I often do - it's like
in this case chronologically at the end, there's

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.200
actually a future vision that doesn't look
radical at all because it's not that much

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:20.600
different from the present. And in fact this
is sort of the 20's but in fact a lot of things

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.510
that I had in my little future vision there,
this one have already come to past.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:32.959
There's like bike lanes, et cetera on Market
Street, et cetera, et cetera. And one thing,

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:39.190
another thing that I'm trying to do in these
murals is to sort of fan out a wide range

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:46.930
of ways, legitimate ways to use public space
so often again there's like this pressure

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.779
where we're being told that the streets are
really for just traffic and shopping really.

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:54.050
There's nothing else and things kind of digress
outside of that.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.600
And it's like there's many, many ways that
people have used the space and I tried to

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.399
show a range of them from the celebratory
and happy to the maybe confrontational. But

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:10.300
all of these things are part of what makes
a city a vibrant and interesting place to

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.389
live. It's a place where history happens,
where politics is actually visible and not

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:16.170
an abstract concept, you know?

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.850
And so basically to remind us like - I would
love like for us to use public space more

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:28.290
for - in convivial ways and social ways other
then just a regular old hurrying through,

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:35.930
getting to the next spot. Then these murals
- I showed you the sort of the wide view and

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.120
this is a really small view.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.190
You can maybe tell from the texture of the
wall how tiny that is and one of the things

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:49.010
that I - the essence kind of, of the little
messages in my murals are actually contained

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:56.320
in the tiniest of details. And so the essence
of what really describes our humanity in our

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.330
shared space and cities, et cetera is not
so much in the grand infrastructure, you know?

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.949
The grand building, et cetera.

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:07.190
It's really in all the ways that people interact
with the infrastructure. So I try to show,

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:12.820
you know, like all the traces of creative
intervention onto public space, you know?

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:18.860
And like in this case quoting various poster
art and whatever I encounter here and there

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:24.980
and also try the people, to make the people
not generic but really unique.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:30.630
It's just when you pull back, you can see
what they do cumulatively. And by the way

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:38.050
all the tags in the painting are copied accurately
while all the commercial signage is slightly

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.970
modified to kind of change its essence or
just like show its basic essence.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.380
[pause]

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.399
Kind of get to the point.

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:48.279
[pause]

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:53.460
And so these are just like little references
to - this was kind of like comments on the

00:11:53.460 --> 00:12:03.030
dot com. So great. Speed up of work and stress,
et cetera. So these are the little comments

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:08.529
but what this causes is, it causes people
to stop because they notice there's something

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:09.720
more to see, right?

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.770
'Cause it's small and that's kind of exactly
my personal - like I try to reward the slowing

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:21.690
down by hiding so many details. Why do I want
people to slow down? It's because I have like

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:27.089
this meta purpose as I mentioned before. Like
not only do I want to advocate within the

00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:33.850
painting. You know, wouldn't it be great if
we use public space more sociably but actually

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:40.110
try to recreate that so if you notice the
detail, you stop. Another person stops.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:46.759
And I - since I try to do make things very
easily - wide appeal, easily readable by everyone,

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:52.660
and I supply a topic of conversation and at
the moment in which I have a group of people

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:58.160
going like, 'Ah, wow, that used to be really
different' or the comment on how the present

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.170
is being portrayed or 'What are you going
to do in the future?' or 'Ah, that's a bad

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.740
idea. Do something else.' And like they started
talking to me and to each other and end up

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.889
introducing themselves to each other.

00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:12.329
In that moment, I've actually achieved what
this whole thing is about. It's in that moment

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:18.250
I've created in this little bit of space,
precisely the kind of inhabitation of public

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:27.399
space that I'm trying to advocate. So again,
I try to work in a very wide, widely easy,

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:34.110
you know, easy to read style like formal innovation
is - I don't really care about that stuff.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.440
But like I really just try to communicate.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.370
In the future versions, this is an early one
of these, like I tried to just put little

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:49.580
hints
that more things have changed than just infrastructures

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:57.880
and some values and you know maybe there's
some radical societal changes instead have

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.540
happened.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:05.380
And so from that mural on, I kept doing a
series a murals and everytime I tried to kind

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.899
of push it a little further like this previous
future vision, it was a little kind of gray.

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:13.980
It wasn't green enough. It's like where's
the green? Okay, next time, more color, more

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.980
green, you know?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.760
So this is my take two, you know, on the same
thing. So the reason there's vegetables there

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.040
is because it's at the site of a farmer's
market and it's on the opposite side of the

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:31.740
other one you saw. But so on one hand you
got sort of the past vision of the neighborhood.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.300
And then, on the other side, you got the future.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:41.860
And it's sort of better but like it came out
just maybe a little too - there's still too

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:48.180
much pavement as - maybe too colorful, too
hippie, I don't know. It's like you never

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:53.180
know - you try to do things and you try to
incorporate more people's ideas every time.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.509
And in this case, I invited various people
that I respect whose work about the visionings

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:06.149
and prefigurative activities I respect to
get their input and ideas and so I came up

00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:13.240
with this and I got a lot of sort of - I keep
it zany and humorous because I don't, I'm

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.860
not an engineer, et cetera.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.690
I'm just an artist. All I can do is really,
like I do my best to show things that are

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.940
actually achievable with our own hands. But
sometimes I put in little jokes and stuff.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.040
But, once again, if you see in the background
of the Bay Area Relaxed Transit Balloon, there's

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.040
downtown.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.259
And once again it's flooded. And once again
that's what it is. I'm just - yeah, maybe

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:42.930
things will happen. But we will still overcome
and not only survive, but get better and wiser

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:53.000
through this. And so I – whoops.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.660
[pause]

00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:00.720
Okay. So here is where I'm going to - this
was sort of a brief flyover of a couple of

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:08.740
former murals on this theme. The one that
I finished in 2010 is in the Tenderloin and

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:16.250
it's circled there in red. It's at Jonas and
Golden Gate and I guess, Paul, you introduced

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.820
the neighborhood sort of vaguely.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:26.310
It's, it's a very historic place. It's historic
quote "vice and entertainment district". And

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:32.160
it's a low income neighborhood, but really,
like the societal problems are definitely

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.940
are still there, it's less than it used to
be for sure. And really I've still heard it

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:44.580
to be referred to, I believe from law enforcement,
as a containment zone which is kind of a,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.720
kind of a shocking thing. It's like a place
where certain societal problems are being

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.389
concentrated and that is visible in the public
space there.

00:16:53.389 --> 00:17:00.750
But there's another side to that as I mentioned
earlier and so this is sort of a view from

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:07.329
the mural coming up from Market Street. And
- but the Tenderloin really ought to be called

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:12.089
a 'family neighborhood' because I was told
it is like there's a higher concentration

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:16.049
of children in that neighborhood than almost
anywhere else in San Francisco including Noe

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:17.049
Valley.

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:21.490
So like there's so many people there and it's
true that you hardly see them. They're not

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:26.850
as visible as elsewhere but that's really
at the heart of the Tenderloin. It's a very

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:34.520
dense, incredibly rich and incredibly culturally
diverse place that has again, economically

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.460
poor but very rich in all of these other aspects.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:44.861
And so I was invited by the North of Market
Tenderloin Community Benefit District to do

00:17:44.861 --> 00:17:51.040
a mural at this particular site. They picked
the spot. The building is now vacant. Before

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.360
it was a garment factory. Before that it was
a porn theater, apparently the cheapest in

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:04.480
town I'm told. But it's an old venerable building
that belongs to a Chinese Benevolent Association

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:11.650
which means a large group of, of owners that
have it owned it forever basically.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:18.230
So and - but as you see this is actually not
really the way you normally see this. And

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:23.520
the process of doing this goes as follows:
So like I went to the neighborhood. I had

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.950
one moderately, moderately attended meeting.
And I said, "Hi, my name is Mona. I want to

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.650
- before I do any drawings, I want to learn
more about this place. So if you feel strongly

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:39.169
about the neighborhood, if you have a story
to tell, I want to hear it. Put out the word."

00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:47.169
And boom, like response is overwhelming. And
so I preceded like many weeks of tours of

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:51.870
the neighborhoods from very, very different
people. It was fun sometimes to get the same

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:57.170
tour by different people and get different
versions and -- but basically just I got a

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:03.309
sense of really the, the layers and the richness
of the place that way and again from young

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:15.340
to old to, you know, everything from the churches
to mosques to, to like schools and sex clubs

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.799
[laughs] and everything.

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:26.220
And basically - and I wanted to also mention
this one thing that's so - I did this research

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.331
but I have actually lived in San Francisco
for 20 years. And I had been in the Tenderloin

00:19:31.331 --> 00:19:37.090
before this project a million times, like
I've been there many, many times. But I never

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:42.130
want to presume to know a place because that
is only in relation to how much you reach

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.520
out.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:50.480
I think that, you know, I sort of, I feel
like whether you're a tourist or somebody

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.340
who lives in a place forever, like we consciously
or sub-consciously, we always put our blinders

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.059
on a little bit, you know? I actually feel
that I know way more about the places where

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:05.789
I did the mural then I actually do on my own
block where I live which is messed up.

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:09.010
I need to change that, you know? That is definitely
something I need to do. But there's a way

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:15.909
in which - like there's a way of - we can,
we can screen out certain people that are

00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:20.490
not really part of our circles. And that's
how it's possible in a place like San Francisco

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:28.210
to have so many overlapping networks of people
that actually never really interact and you

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.720
know across the usual boundaries, you know?

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:42.400
And so, let me see - and also I just want
to speak a little bit to the thing about the

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.200
Tenderloin. I've heard people refer to it,
'Oh but isn't it dangerous?' or something.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:53.560
It's definitely not. I mean, not to - things
happen but if an outsider just comes inside

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.450
and walks through, it's perfectly safe. And
I just think sometimes it's worth questioning

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.640
what the perception of fear really comes from.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.950
And you know maybe sometimes we might, we
might just be a little bit uncomfortable at

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:14.029
the sight of poverty or you know at the sight
of otherness, culturally or racially, et cetera.

00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:19.679
And it's sometimes worth it to try and like
get past that a little bit and the rewards

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.720
are many, you know?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:27.620
And so this is just a couple photos of the
environments because you're gonna see that

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:35.440
in the paintings. This is sort of Hibernia
Bank on one side and this is kitty-corner

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.570
from the mural. So the mural is on the corner,
directly opposite corner is St. Anthony's

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:46.230
Soup Kitchen. So every morning there's a line
of hundreds of people. I had a constant audience

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:51.750
there from across the street of people waiting
for lunch.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.800
And this is a zoomed view across the street
from the mural. It's a little cluttery but

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.429
it contains some of the things that you'll
see again in the pictures that are to come,

00:21:59.429 --> 00:22:07.220
that old building, et cetera to give some
context and so I spotted a - basically to

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.971
go back to the
bird's eye view.

00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:10.820
[pause]

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:22.169
Here we are. So this is the place where the
mural is in itself. And I actually actively

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:28.750
tried my best to make the contemporary views
of the neighborhood look beautiful using color,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:35.409
et cetera. And this was not to gloss over
anything in terms of what happens in the neighborhood.

00:22:35.409 --> 00:22:41.720
What it's for is because I feel like its beauty
there in order to actually better serve the

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.480
people who live there and also beauty as a,
as a metaphor.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.720
Like in this case, up high, I put a lot of
golden colors, et cetera on those free things

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.380
in nature that we can always appreciate like
the way the light hits a building in the sunset

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:03.770
and below I missed the pavement. The beauty,
the color comes entirely from the people themselves

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:08.159
which is what I actually found and there's
precious little infrastructure to support

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:11.080
that – them.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:17.059
And as for the past, you know I always show
the past as well - instead of showing a separate

00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:24.169
panel for the past, this time I made these
little vapor like, sort of like smoky things,

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:29.250
that drift up from the various locations where
I want to mention something that used to be

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.250
there before.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.330
And they're kind of like - I call them the
'ghosts of the past' and sort of, they drift

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:40.610
up towards symbols of, of the things that
used to be there. So all of these buildings,

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.840
et cetera, there actually used to be in these
various parking lots. Really a lot of great

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.000
theatres, et cetera have been torn down to
make room for parking lots and the great Black

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.680
Hawk Jazz Club, legendary place, was torn
down.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.080
There's a parking lot there. So there's a
lot of - I found the parking lots and like

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:05.350
had the ghosts of the parking lot like come
out of there to show that. And so while the

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:12.710
initial research I was telling about provided
the content for the, the history part a lot,

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:18.320
it is the people that I really stumbled upon
or they would stumble upon me 'cause I'm fixed

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.201
in one spot but whoever came by, they're the
ones who provided the content for the street

00:24:23.201 --> 00:24:27.690
level, for the, the, the present views themselves.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:36.179
And so the entire mural has - so basically
the way I did that is I basically started

00:24:36.179 --> 00:24:42.220
by setting the stage. And I started drawing
the neighborhood and tried to put the markers

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:47.279
that make it clear where it is. And immediately
as soon as it became clear, people started

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:48.570
placing themselves in it.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:52.640
It's like, 'Oh, ah, I see...that's as soon
as I get – that's Jonas and Golden Gate.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.860
That's here. Put me right there. That's where
I live', you know? 'Put me over here with

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.860
my friends'.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:05.670
And so people just started pointing out where
it is that they wanted to be. And so all I

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:12.110
had to do was set the stage and they basically
directed the play with themselves as actors.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:17.899
And so because I couldn't always just stop
and paint them in because I started doing

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:22.370
this before I had even finished a background
and I couldn't really paint them, I took reference

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:27.299
pictures so that I could copy them later.
And when I'm done I will give them the picture.

00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:33.160
And so in the background there's - there,
slowly, it's becoming a little populated and

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:39.091
it became quite a gregarious little scene.
I would joke that I work at the Tenderloin

00:25:39.091 --> 00:25:47.860
Public Photo Booth 'cause like everybody would
come by and just [pause] - and so, and it

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:57.710
was a great, great way to kind of - and what
this actually did was it really described

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.419
the social geography of the place accurately.

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:07.559
So this is the part of the mural that is not
a second, third hand, secondary, tertiary,

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:12.610
et cetera, et cetera historical document.
Things of the past I've copied from pictures

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:19.150
of copies, prints of reference material, blah,
blah, blah. It's a hand me down historical

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:24.649
document whereas this is a direct primary
historical document. I find that this is where

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:35.950
the story of the present or contemporary to
the making of this mural is being told. [pause]

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:46.260
Umm, yeah. So there's all my pictures and
I'm just - I'm in there too, right? I'm painting

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.580
the mural within the mural 'cause that like
serves - so the mural in the mural is a bit

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:56.610
like 'you are here' on a map, you know? You
go like, 'Oh, wait, that's', you know?

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.950
So it's fanning out from where we are, you
know? And showing people around it.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:27.900
And now I'm gonna show a little clip. [pause]

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:40.920
Sorry about that.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.980
[video starts with car moving in background]

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.880
[sounds of cars going by]

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.039
[street noises]

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.200
[people talking]

00:27:50.200 --> 00:28:03.049
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: My 'M' right here stands
for 'Memphis' and put a 'K' on her, stands

00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:05.600
for Kim.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:14.530
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Alright, we could do that.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:24.720
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: You could do that?

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:37.470
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: If you want. You wanna be in
it?

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.750
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Yeah.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:48.120
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: You wanna be in it? I'll take
your picture and then you'll tell me M and

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120
K.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.120
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Yeah.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.150
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Yeah. Walkin' down the street?

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.300
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Yeah.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.740
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Where do you want to be?

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.870
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Here. Well, you can put
us down there then and make us tall, you know

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.370
what I'm saying?

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.840
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Right here?

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:13.399
&gt;.Male in Video #1: Make us tall.

&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: You two together?

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.779
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Yeah.

&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Great.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:31.210
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: All right?

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:44.200
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Actually, do one where you're
pointing where you're gonna be so I remember.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.430
[pause] Awesome. Okay, great.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.659
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Yeah.

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:54.070
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #1: Thank you.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.029
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #2: What about me?

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:59.399
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Hey.

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:02.730
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #1: That's pretty good.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:48.059
[singing in background]
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #2: Yeah. You know right there?

00:30:48.059 --> 00:30:53.980
That's where everybody sells marijuana at.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.929
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Ahh.

00:30:56.929 --> 00:31:12.721
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #2: So I'll stand right there
though 'cause that's where I do my thing.

00:31:12.721 --> 00:31:28.139
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: I see. I'm gonna, I'm gonna
give you the picture when I'm done.

00:31:28.139 --> 00:31:31.120
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #2: Okay.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.299
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #3: Charles used to work at
St. Anthony's. That's Dick Charlie, right?

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:42.600
And that's that guy that always be out there,
the big guy. He's the first one in

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:49.630
the morning that goes, that goes down there
to St. Anthony's to eat. This, this man in

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:53.490

Yeah, I'm Tony. I live right here, that's

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.610
my room right there.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.610
[talking in background]

00:31:55.610 --> 00:32:01.400
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #4: There are people here
in these urban communities of America. We

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:07.120
are people, real people with real dreams and
real thoughts, man. Real motivations and real

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.120
families, man.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:13.860
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Right there. That's me.
That's Memphis. Look at that.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.630
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #1: That's the first time
I've ever been on a wall.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.669
[talking in background]

00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:25.860
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #5: My brother came up here.
I showed my family this mural yesterday and

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:39.050
they were really surprised by it. They were
all in it. My brother's like, "Oh my God,

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.059
it's really you though", you know?

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.850
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #6: I know everybody on the
picture.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:44.850

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.650
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #7: That's Dede.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #8: That's Brent.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #7: I'm right here.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #8: Double R is over on this

&gt;&gt;Male in Video #7: Yeah. That's him.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #8: And here's Jimmy.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.840
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #2: There's Sterling right

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #7: This is on a Wednesday.
This is on the first. That's how that is all

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.840
out there.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.840
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #2: And that's you right
there.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: I'm doing good. I'm doing good.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #9: We were just talking about
you earlier.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: [laughs] Hey.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #9: We were talkin' about
you earlier.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.840
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.840
&gt;&gt;Cameraman: Have you lived in the neighborhood
long?

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #10: Si, si. [speaking in
Spanish]

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #11: For years to come and
years to go, that other people will be, you

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.840
know, they'll walk past here and just see
this for theirselves and be like, "Wow, I

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840
know this person." I know that particular
person or - it also shows a lot of history

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.840
before and after too. And it's just amazing.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #12: That's me right there
on my way to church. You can see in that picture

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.840
of the future - this is a sun shiny corner
so I come here sometimes just to get the sun.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.840
[video clip ends]

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Okay so that's - my friend Nick
Kasimatis made this little video clip for

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.840
me. It's pretty great to have. It's a great
souvenir. It was really an amazing experience

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.840
and here maybe you see how, how incredibly
social this place is and it's, it's working

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.840
there was it kind of like contradictory thing
all the time.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840
One on hand, yes, there's a lot of people
there who carry within them a tremendous amount

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.840
of pain that they're dealing with. At the
very same time, on the other hand, it's like

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840
by far the most gregarious place I've ever
worked in and often in relation to the very

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.840
same people.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.840
It's like, it's both, you know? But one thing
is like this place, more than many others,

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840
has such a potential for incredibly vibrant
public space but does not have the infrastructure

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840
for it. So – let's see if I can - so this
is my pictures appearing in various places

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840
around the neighborhood like on the boom box.
I took that picture and that was -- and people

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.840
with themselves and the mural.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.840
[pause]

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.840
And so - however, all those communities that
I met in the research process, there's many,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840
as I was saying, that you don't really see
out in the street very much. This is beautiful

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.840
- Roya is a
fantastic artist, beautiful spirit in the

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.840
neighborhood. That's both of them in the,
in the street.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.840
And um, um - and one thing that I kept hearing,
even before I got to the future section, was

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.840
the following story. Like someone would say,
"You know, the other night I came because

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.840
I'm in the mural. I wanted to show my friends.
So I came with a group of friends", to show

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.840
how he was in the mural. And the people down
on Jones Street, you know, they were doing

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.840
the same thing at the same time and you know
what?

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840
At the end, we ended up shaking hands and
I was like, 'Yes, that's exactly, exactly

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.840
what I'm talking about. There's a lot of people
there that in fact do not - it's a very gregarious

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.840
place but some communities don't interact.
Some people for religious and cultural reasons

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.840
really don't want to deal with some of the
things going on in the street and they're,

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840
they're
scurrying by, et cetera.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.779
It was a pleasure to watch some of this ice
breaking through this process. And, and basically

00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:57.559
you know there's something about - you know,
what I advocate for again is a more - like

00:33:57.559 --> 00:34:04.240
we ought to facilitate the simple human need
for company and like actually facilitate the

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.740
freedom to assemble and be in company now
in a public space.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:12.740
And I think more often than not that actually
the opposite is being done because we're afraid

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.680
of loitering or something and the illegal
activity that does happen.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.050
And it definitely happens but I actually feel
like this is actually addressing the problem

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:25.710
not quite in the right direction. Personally
because like, I think that a welcoming public

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:30.620
space would do wonder to change the - for
example, all of the families, all of these

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:36.430
people that I met during the research process,
will be far more visible in public space if

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:40.790
the infrastructure were more welcoming and
by the very fact itself kind of change the

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:41.790
vibe a lot.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:49.480
I also think it would do a lot to reduce the
degree of alienation that economically disadvantaged

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.020
people feel in places like these. Like you're
really kind of punished. All you get is like

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.310
sidewalks and chain link fences and no place
to sit.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:03.690
And a lot of people that I found in the street
are not homeless. They choose to be with people

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:08.130
they know rather then being isolated in their
hotel Room. Like I wouldn't want to be like

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.570
stuck in one room all day long, you know?

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:17.570
And so the infrastructure kept telling me
it's so stark and there's a one way sign.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.070
By the
way, all the streets are one way in the Tenderloin.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:24.770
So you can imagine how cozy that is, [laughs]
you know? But look at the sign, it goes one

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.580
way and that's the one way it is.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.720
Face it. This is just the way it is and I
sort of feel like there's gotta be, there's

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:39.930
gotta be another way, you know? And so that's
what I set about to do. Just okay take two,

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.510
on this
exact same street corner.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:50.680
What, what would it be like? What could it
be like? So what I did in this case is another

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:57.560
utopia section. It's exactly the same place
and I did so completely collaboratively. So

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:02.670
what I did is I - the first painting I did,
I traced that exactly. That's why they fit

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.110
so perfectly in the size.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:09.460
It's like exactly the same basic drawing.
I traced it exactly. People recognize what

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.340
I was doing and they were like, "Why are you
doing the same thing twice? You just did that."

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.770
And it's like, "I know but this time different."
"What do you mean? Different how?" "Well,

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:21.140
you tell me. You know, how could it be different?"
"I don't know."

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:26.110
And so I had to kind of start the ball rolling
a little bit. I started by adding some verger,

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:31.780
you know, and people got it. It's like, "Oh"
and then they started having suggestions.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:37.930
And I started incorporating suggestions from
the totally frivolous and fun to the really

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:43.200
smart and thoughtful, like the whole range
of things, you know?

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:51.840
And also crucial, crucial, crucial to this
process was to continue to include local people

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.340
because what I wanted to change is an improvement
of the neighborhood without a change in population.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:03.250
In other words, an improvement by and for
the people who are there 'cause we all deserve

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.250
that.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:11.540
So it's not an economic upturn. It is a DIY,
do it yourself transformation using what we've

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:19.390
already got. Like rather then a big top down
transformation, it's something that is conceivably

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:25.380
achievable maybe. And also I did do one thing
a little bit different this time though. So

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:31.460
I continued putting all of the characters
and the people that I, that I met but in terms

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:37.480
of social geography, this is total fantasy.
So I had people from different communities

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.550
interact in a convivial way.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:44.800
People had nothing to do with each other so
I have them all like barbecuing together,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.350
whatever, you know, like stuff like that and
the people definitely don't know each other

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:52.551
because I tried to - okay can I push this
further, you know? Like it was already happening.

00:37:52.551 --> 00:37:55.270
People were telling me that it was already
happening, people getting to know each other

00:37:55.270 --> 00:38:00.190
but I just wanted to stress it even more.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:05.910
And also another thing I tried to do is to
showcase people's talents. This girl is a

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.340
fantastic singer. I have her do that thing.
Whatever they're good at, like you know, like

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:21.620
show that thing. And this is actual artwork
by this man Kai and tricks on the skateboard

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.750
to, to whatever people can do and also work.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:30.160
Like the kind of work that people are telling
me they'd rather be doing, that they actually

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:39.790
feel a calling for. And so - and also I wanted
to have a place with an infrastructure that

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:47.330
is set up for the kind of human interaction
that I think we need a lot more of, like it's

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:52.970
a place that is physically set up for appreciating
other people's talents and acknowledging each

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.110
other's presence and being.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:01.430
And this one has – the little tags in golden
frames as a way of, you know, illustrating

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:08.260
that. And all this - these are, are suggestions
from people, you know. And the person introducing

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:13.281
the man with the beard is the person that
suggested this. We need a place where we can

00:39:13.281 --> 00:39:22.110
have a cultural knowledge exchange across
different communities. And then I will conclude

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.110
with another three minute clip. [video begins
playing]

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:28.780
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Oh. That's the building
over there. That's the parking lot right there.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.090
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: It is.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:34.020
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Yeah. I see the painting
on the wall.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.970
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Yeah. Except it's a fantasy.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:41.610
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #1: Huh. It'd be nice if it
looked like that.

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:46.860
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: So when I get your, your headdress
and like the color of your shirt. All right.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:54.510
Stay right here and I'll take a picture. Okay.
Like maybe here or maybe we can add another

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.510
one.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.510
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #1: Yeah.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.510
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Somewhere in here.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.510
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #1: Yeah.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.510
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Somewhere in here, having some
food.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.510
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #1: Yeah.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.510
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #2: Yeah, you'd rather be
there, huh?

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.510
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #2: Uh huh.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.780
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #2: I don't blame you. That's
where I'd want to be too.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.790
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #2: Oh, this the future?
See, that's beautiful. That is what it's going

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.720
to look like. That's what I see this looking
like too. Another way. That's what it is too,

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720
another way.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.520
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #3: That's Roberta with
me sitting with my eyes open.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:26.000
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Yep and that's the art. Let
me see. Is that one of the ones that I did

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
or similar? Yeah, look it's -

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #3: Yeah.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: It's this one, look, with the
tree.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
&gt;&gt;Female in Video #3: Oh my.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.910
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #3: So much things going towards
the green and the space out here is so limited.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.720
Everybody these days are going for more green
areas especially the city because everything

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.850
is concrete. We need more green areas period.
We realize how much tension there is right

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:45.020
here now. With something like that, think
about how much relief of tension it would

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.450
be if that would really exist.

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:47.810
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Yeah.

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.320
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #3: That's a good sounding
board right there.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.320
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Yeah, it's great.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.650
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #3: That's a perfect sounding
board. What should we do with this place?

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:58.750
They'd come by and see something like this
and well - maybe they couldn't do it all but

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:09.130
they could start on a small.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:17.530
&gt;&gt;Child in Video #1: Wait. I'm lookin'. You
got me yet?

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.930
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Not yet.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:19.930
&gt;&gt;Child in Video #1: Where's my daddy again?

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:20.930
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Your daddy's right here with
your sister.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:21.930
&gt;&gt;Child in Video #1: You got me yet?

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:32.040
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: No. Not yet. Not yet. You're
gonna be there in a few days. Okay? Not so

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.040
fast.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:39.050
&gt;&gt;Male in Video #4: Power to the people, my
brother.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:43.470
&gt;&gt;Child in Video #1: Power to the people,
my brother. [laughs]

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:46.430
[video clip ends]

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.430
[pause]

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.000
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: And that concludes my presentation.
Thank you so much [applause]

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.990
&gt;&gt;Paul Stout: Don't go away. Don't go away.
So any questions, definitely feel free. We

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:57.840
got definitely a few more minutes on the video
tape. So if you - could you step to the mic

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.840
if you have a question.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:06.840
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Oh - just - is
there a list of places that you can see your

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.430
murals that you have for people? Can you email
it to -

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:12.660
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: As a matter of fact, I have
a Google Map of all my places. [laughs] Not

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:19.120
only that, you know what I've done, in the
information panel of my latest mural? I put

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:26.010
one of those thing a ma jig, those little
barcodes. So if a tourist comes by with a

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.680
phone and has no clue, they get to my website
where I explain a little bit what this is

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.680
about.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.820
Not that they need it because actually what
I've kept hearing ever since this was finished

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.320
is some friends of mine tell me, "You know,
I went to see your mural finally. I went down

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.820
there and I was looking at the mural and this
person comes up and gives me the whole, the

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.990
full tour".

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:49.930
So I'm like, "Well, who was it?" And they're
like, "I don't know. I think it was a homeless

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.510
person. I don't know. I don't know."

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:59.970
But people - and I love, I kind of get a kick
out of the fact that the experts on this particular

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:05.460
work of art will always be the people in the
neighborhood. Like no expert intellectual

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:10.090
fine art critic will ever get this mural as
well as the people there, you know what I

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:16.100
mean? It's, it's kind of great, you know,
but yes, I have a Google Map and I have a

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:21.200
website. I guess I always have a link to the
Google position of each mural but I also have

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:32.500
a little
mappy thing that is not quite - yeah, yep.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.720
[pause]

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:44.650
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: So the mural you
did in the Tenderloin. How long did that take

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:45.650
you and how long were you there for from the
initial inception and around toward the actual

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:46.650
finish of filming?

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:47.650
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Umm, forever.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:48.650
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Approximately?

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.650
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: I'm gonna tell you. So I basically
started with the whole research, you know

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:55.500
going on tours and walking around the neighborhood
in the summer of 2008, Fall 2008; started

00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:06.400
painting in January 2009 and I finished in
March of 2010. So I was actually, I lived

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:14.380
on that sidewalk - like I was a complete sidewalk
fixture there. That was my little spot and

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.600
for over a year and I did have a break in
the middle.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.860
I went away for a month. I kind of needed,
you know - I was going nuts basically. And

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.580
what it
was is like putting those little people in,

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:33.801
I have almost 300 real people in there. You
know it takes a lot of time like you know

00:44:33.801 --> 00:44:39.720
especially when they're nearby, in a day I
could do like maybe five of those.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:47.190
So it was never ending and I felt like everybody
was like, "Oh, I want to be in it too." And

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:52.170
I wasn't able to put everybody in, you know,
and I still now when I go back somebody spots

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.010
me and says, "When are you going to put me
in the mural?" and it's like ahh, I had to

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.010
just stop, you know?

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:04.010
But I could go on forever and so I feel bad
for all the ones that I didn't get to but

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:09.440
I tried my best, you know? So. So yeah. [pause]
Other questions?

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.630
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: So I really like
the community aspect of it. Have you tried

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:19.960
at all in possibly like a small town or suburbia
or somewhere that's not -

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:25.340
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: That would be really interesting
actually. Whether I've done it?

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:29.177
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Yeah. Or have you
ever thought of trying it somewhere else?

00:45:29.177 --> 00:45:34.030
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: You know, I don't actually - the
projects, these mural projects have come to

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:41.730
me. I don't really come to them so much so
if - I'm also an illustrator and I do pictures

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.730
for books and magazines. But the mural thing
is kind of something that happened to me.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:51.350
You know, it started with one big mural I
did in the city and it's like the Duboce Bikeway

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:55.850
Mural. It's a mural behind Safeway when you
come out of the tunnel from the J and N-Judah

00:45:55.850 --> 00:46:02.680
if you guys are San Franciscans. But anyway
I did one and that one started all the other

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.350
ones rolling and I never thought I was going
to be a muralist. It's just something that

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:13.650
kind of happened but like if I get invited,
you know, I'm open.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:19.120
After this one, I did a project in Bolivia,
in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which is - okay, I

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.900
could do a whole talk just on that one. It
was unbelievable. On the outside wall of the

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:29.030
Factory Workers Union of Cochabamba, Bolivia,
and on the occasion of the 10th anniversary

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:35.731
of the Water War uprising there. It was fascinating
and so anyway. So those are things that happen.

00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:36.731
[pause]

00:46:36.731 --> 00:46:37.731
Whoa. [laughs] Yeah.

00:46:37.731 --> 00:46:42.970
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: Where's the funding
come from to do these murals? Because you're

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:48.050
talking about like years worth of work that's
done.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:55.131
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Oh, yeah, well - so the funding
for some of the public murals in San Francisco,

00:46:55.131 --> 00:47:04.700
most of the them come from grants. It's the
non-profits that I go through that apply for

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.610
the grants. In this case, it's the Tenderloin
Community Benefit District is an entity that

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.840
applied for a grant to do a mural at this
particular location.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:19.680
And it's often been the Community Challenge
Grant Program in San Francisco which is, it's

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:27.830
funded by the voluntary one percent allotment
of your business taxes towards city beautification.

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:34.700
So basically if you owe business taxes and
check that one box, it doesn't increase your

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:39.530
taxes. It just funnels one percent toward
city beautification and a little bit of that

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:40.530
goes towards murals.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:44.250
[pause]

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:54.690
Yeah. Needless to say, it's definitely a labor
of love 'cause there's - sometimes when I

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:59.210
have my down moments, I go like, "Why don't
have a simpler style?", you know? It's just

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:00.660
like [laughs] but it's -- that's just how
it comes out. Yeah.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.660
[pause]

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.660
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: But on that level,
there is so much detail. You already said

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.660
you have Google Maps. Do you have a detailed
image where people can zoom in on it online

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.660
and see all these different things, all the
vivid details? Like you said, you can see

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:33.570
it's great from a distance but there's so
detail to see up close so it's really hard

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:34.570
to -

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.570
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: It's true.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:36.570
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: appreciate it without
being able to see all of it.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:37.570
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: It's true and I kind of want
to do that. I really want to - obviously I'm

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:41.250
not super great at it but I try to do what
I can on my website. On the other hand, you

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:47.700
know, I want to privilege the pedestrians
and the bicyclists that actually go out into

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.481
the world and do that. You know, that's something
because that's kind of part of it.

00:48:51.481 --> 00:48:55.771
If I make it too comfortable for people to
just appreciate, then they will actually go

00:48:55.771 --> 00:49:01.670
to the Tenderloin and maybe experience what
an amazing place that is, you know? But definitely

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:08.980
I want to try. It's just I'm limitedly tech
savvy I guess is the issue like - maybe you

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:09.980
guys can help.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.170
[pause]

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:16.770
Yeah.

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:36.660
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: So the one question
I have for you is I know it seems like your

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.660
early work is [inaudible] So of your murals,
which one is your favorite and why?

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.660
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: What was your question?

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.660
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: We all couldn't
hear the question. Use the microphone.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:40.660
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: I just want to
know what's your favorite mural because there

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.630
such a distinct difference between like say
something [inaudible]. The Tenderloin was

00:49:42.630 --> 00:50:00.640
like a different collaboration.

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:07.420
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: I would have to say the Tenderloin
one is my favorite one so far because - precisely

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:11.961
because of that. Like in a way, in terms of
what I'm trying to achieve, this whole thing,

00:50:11.961 --> 00:50:18.180
the convivial use of public space, the neighborhood
is actually so much further along in achieving

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:24.240
that than other places that it was an absolute
pleasure and again despite all the societal

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.680
problems which are really real.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:34.290
It's very, very real and believe me – and,
but, therefore, I find there's so much potential

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:40.070
there, you know? So in a way it gave me a
lot of hope that way despite being around

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:45.720
a lot of, a lot of pain and desperation as
well so –

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.900
[pause]

00:50:47.900 --> 00:51:02.180
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #5: So I really enjoyed
the video clips that you had and I just have

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.670
- it would be really interesting to see more
of your research like that, the whole talking

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:08.771
about the journey. Have you thought at all
about collaborating with a filmmaker and making

00:51:08.771 --> 00:51:09.771
a documentary of one of these projects?

00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:11.780
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Well, there's a filmmaker in
the city called Paige Bierma who's actually

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:18.490
made a short documentary about the, about
the mural and I think that my friend Nick

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:23.160
Kasimatis may be working on something as well.
That's him in there and he's the one who made

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:29.900
these clips for me so like that's Nick Kasimatis
right there and so there is Paige Bierma's

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:37.430
movie, I believe it's called "A Brush with
a Tenderloin" or something. It wasn't just

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.580
a brush with. I really inhabited the place
quite intensely.

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:47.020
But it's actually going to be shown publicly
on May 13th – I hope I get this right -- during

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:58.320
- on the same day of the Art in Storefronts
on Market Street arts commission event so

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.890
if you want to know more, actually I'm sure
that's a good idea - I have a Facebook page.

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:03.890
Please join it.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:10.320
I'm going to announce when it is. Yeah. Go
like my page. [laughs]

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.360
Yeah so.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.380
[pause]

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.920
Yes, I agree - it will be great but it's kind
of oceanic like the amount of stuff. I could

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.920
write a book about it this thick.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.920
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #5: Yeah, I was thinking
that, that it could almost even make a history

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.920
book of the neighborhood or sort of the documentation
of it and stuff like that.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.920
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Yeah. Anyone else? Ooh, sorry.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:31.600
&gt;&gt;Paul Stout: Okay, no more questions. Thank
you again for coming.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:40.590
&gt;&gt;Mona Caron: Thank you so much for having
me. A real pleasure.
