Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.460
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.280
Well, we got a little bit of a tradition going on here.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.520
Every single time a DC film comes out, I always have to review it, because let's face it, DC films give you hope.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.980
The hope that one day, they'll actually make a good DC film.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.520
(Booing)

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.160
DC MOVIES SU-UCK! DC MOVIES SU-UCK! DC MOVIES SU-

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.920
OW!

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.240
Wonder Woman: Not anymore.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.260
NC: Wonder Woman, I was just about to talk about your inevitably crappy movie.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.220
WAAH!

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.260
WW: That was the old DC.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.440
This DC brings back what we loved about our classic heroes.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.340
NC: Okay, look Jesse the Cowgirl, I've heard this shtick before.

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:24.040
'Oh, this is the DC film that's going to change everything. This one's actually good. But, the trailer looks so great!'

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580
Well, you know what, I'm not falling for it!

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.300
Only film I'm getting excited for this year is the Emoji Movie!

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.920
WW: What?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.420
NC: What?

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.120
Damn Lasso of TRUTH!

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.040
WW: Come with me, and I'll show you that I'm the hero that the DC movies have been waiting for.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.400
NC: Sure about this?

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.800
WW: Did the creator of Wonder Woman also create the lie detector?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.780
NC: I don't know.  Did he?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.280
WW: He did.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.780
NC: He did?

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.280
WW: Yeah.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.060
NC: Huh. The more you know.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.240
NC: Okay. Give me a second. I gotta do the intro here first. 
WW: What am I supposed to do?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.820
I don't know. Get us hyped up with the totally inappropriate yet amazingly awesome electric guitar theme?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.620
You may be awesome, but you're not Wonder Woman playing electric guitar awesome!

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.549
Wonder Woman has been a popular icon since the 40's, being one of DC's

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.740
top three most marketable brands. Yet while their top two most popular brands, Batman and Superman,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.240
have gotten several movies and cinematic suicide notes in the past, Wonder Woman has been strangely absent.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.860
She had a hit TV series in the 1970s--

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.180
Hey, you may be cool, but you're not Wonder Woman skating with appropriate helmet and kneepads cool!

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.260
--and made a few appearances in animation.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.180
But a cinematic movie never happened. Hell, they would make a film out of "Steel" with Shaq before giving her her own movie.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.760
But, with cinematic universes being all the rage and DC trying to catch up with Marvel's success,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.240
They debuted the character in Batman V Superman,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.400
and she was said by many to be one of the few saving graces of the film.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.080
What could her kick-ass cameo translate well enough to make a big hit with audiences and critics?

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.080
Well, let's take a look and find out. This is...

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.740
What, what, what is this. What.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.120
HAH! This movie is not nearly feminist enough and we need to talk about it!

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.000
Man, no! We have to talk about how if this movie isn't good, it'll end all female superhero movies!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.960
YEAH!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.940
No no no, forget it!

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.800
I'm not grabbing at any of your complaint bait.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.320
But there is so much to get needlessly upset about.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.280
MAN YES!

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.700
Now look. Ughh!

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.000
other people can talk about the political, social, equal, not-equal whatever issues.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.440
I just want to judge this movie as a movie so piss off! 
-But as a feminist,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.180
- I'm deeply insulted.
- I actually thought that the movie was pretty good.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.440
Shut up, I'm being offended for you. 
We need to talk about--

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.220
Hey, thanks Wonder Woman! 
You fight for my right to wear satin tights.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.420
DAMN LASSO OF TRUTH! Now everybody knows.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.380
- Yeah, I don't think you could pull that off. 
- Just start the review.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.960
We start off with our main character Diana as a child on the island of Themisc-- uh, Ther-- Thermis...

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.760
THAT.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.620
And she's raised by a society of Amazon women who enjoy their bright colorful landscapes in the beautiful-

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.160
- No, no, no, mm-mm.
- Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.880
Oh, God.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.320
What is this? Color?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.420
It's stupid, dude.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.820
Yeah yeah, and what's that, the sun?

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.180
What DC movie have you been watching?

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.240
- Hey can you get rid of that for me? 
- Yeah, I'm on it.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.020
No more sun.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.820
Alright out of the way, out of the way. 
Gotta make some changes here

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.320
All right, all right, all right.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.760
There we go! MUCH better, much better.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.600
Now THAT'S how you do a DC film!

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.260
Felt a bit naked for a while there.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Will you get out of here?! We are trying 
to do something different and better.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.680
Oh, I'm sorry we're not Marvel.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.260
You can do something different and better
 and not be like Marvel!

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.180
- Really?
- I didn't know that.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.380
ARCHERS!

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.919
Piss off, She-Ra!

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.899
Diana's mother, the queen of the Amazons, explains the history of where they came from.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.829
Long ago the God Zeus told the God Ares not to try and overthrow him. Ares agreed,

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:22.140
But he was totes lying and
 Zeus was like "bitch, I am Zeus".

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.540
And he threw his Ares-skinned ass out.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.460
To make sure a psychotic monster like that never took over again,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.800
Zeus created the Amazons.
 And then he destroyed the electoral college.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.500
And I get to be an Amazon when I grow up!

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.760
No, because I sculpted you from clay and brought you to life.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.820
- Really?
- No.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.360
But it's easier than telling you where babies really come from.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.980
- But I want to be a warrior!
- She's right, sister.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.940
She's a frustrated princess longing for more 
and going against her parent's wishes!

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.420
If we stay this route, we'll be a Disney movie.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.920
Well, only if she saves a handsome man from the sea

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.600
- Let me train her.
- No.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.110
- You Must!
- Okay.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.720
Wow, that was fast.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.680
It's a two and-a-half hour movie, yo. 
We gotta move it along.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.140
Okay, good point.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.200
So Diana is trained as an Amazon, but her mother is afraid she'll find out the truth about who she is.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.360
The nice thing is this is a DC origin story where not everything is told in the beginning

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.700
They save some of it as a mystery.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.680
A mystery that's answered in one movie,
rather than the sequel.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.700
- Don't ask about that.
- I really think that I should.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.420
It's a two and-a-half hour movie, people take bathroom breaks--

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.600
Okay, okay.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.740
- But Diana sees a plane crash into the sea and saves the pilot inside.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.200
- You're a man?

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.200
- Yes, I'm World War one pilot, Steve Trevor.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.940
- Really?

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.340
- You're World War one pilot Steve Trevor?

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.700
I just thought you'd be more Chris Pine-ish.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.340
Look, there's not a lot of black people in this movie,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.440
I mean, if we played it for real,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.440
The only role I'd have would be the black Amazon.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.400
Well, it's a good thing I saved you from that fake CGI effect.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.260
Oh, don't worry. There's much more of those in this movie.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.020
Just look at that slo-mo bullet from the enemy soldier following me.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.760
[GUNSHOT]

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.640
Huh. Yeah, that is really fake.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.160
Well, a lot of good that training did...

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.440
Auntie!

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.600
If only there were some way I could deflect bullets!!

To find out all about the Great War.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.020
- Could this be the work of our sworn enemy Aries?

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.180
I...can't prove that it's not?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.340
Mother, we have to stop him and his evil ways!

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.100
No.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.260
Mankind is much too violent and dangerous.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.300
We're better off serving our crazy gods.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.080
Who are so bloodthirsty, we literally have one named

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.320
"the god of war"

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.080
Steve, is there anything that you're not telling us?

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.360
They'll kill you if you don't confess!

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.460
Truth be told, I'm okay with that.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.280
I always fantasized I would die on an island full of nothing but Amazon women.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.800
I just never thought it would actually happen.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.120
Though I could do without... that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.920
[CRINGES] Why did I agree to film that?

known as "the god killer".

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.600
And saves Steve from his prison

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.900
to get him back to the war.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.580
But, she is stopped by her mother.

Diana, what are you doing?

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.380
I'm off, mother.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.980

Nope.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.980
Who's kind of like an alternate version of Michael Crawford's Phantom of The Opera,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.100
Half the face is covered, the acting is over the top, and the voice is clearly that of a woman.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.920
- General, send in the next subject.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.800
These two are trying to create a gas that can kill someone, even if he wears a gas mask.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.120
Steve is aware of this and tries to get the information to War council member, Sir Patrick.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.140
Tell me, Trevor. Who is this young woman?

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.080
Diana, princess of Themysc--

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.380
Prince! Diana Prince is her name.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.020
Really? Because it sounded like she said "princess of Themyscira".

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.580
D-Did you think I would just miss that part?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.020
Um...It's her maiden name.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.560
Really?

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.180
Yes.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.640
Ces of Themyscira is her maiden name?

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.400
It's foreign.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.100
And she says it after her married name.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.140
It's just how they do thing where she's from. You racist?

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.420
Well, it's 1918, so...yes.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.860
NC: And of course we have to put up with the sexual prejudice that you would expect.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.840
Mr. Trevor, you know a woman is not allowed in this room of men.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.780
NC: And it goes on and on, being super preachy.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.640
Never mind all that. You want to go and stop Dr. Poison and take her with you? Go right ahead. Have fun!

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.900
NC: Oh, well, that was refreshingly quick.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.240
W-Well you know the fish-out-of-water comedy is going to go on and on!

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.580
Did you try on those big dresses?

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.760
Yes, but I did not like them.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.080
Okay, lets go!

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.900
It's almost as if this movie obviously knows we obviously know these obvious-to-know tricks!

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.380
I mean, don't get me wrong,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.080
With the time period and setup, both sexism and the fish-out-of-water element have to be addressed...

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.720
But it's not hammered in to the point of annoyance!

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.820
It's confronted, dealt with, and then they move on to the cool stuff most viewers want to see.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.860
In fact, a good chunk of it is spent with her getting to know the men she's fighting with.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.720
Making a strong bond to connect with the people she swore to protect.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.720
Wrong! Wrong!

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.960
NC: Goddammit!

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.660
You're not supposed to talk with the people you save, you're supposed to talk about the people you save,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.160
To show how awesome you are!

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.720
Yeah, get a stain glass window out here!

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.780
Yeah! Check this out!

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:50.020
Symbolism. Jesus. I am Jesus. You're welcome.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.040
Yeah! That's how it's done, boi! That's how it's dooooone!!

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.140
So, what future superheroes are they going to be?

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.680
They aren't future superheroes, they're just people!

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.080
No, no, no, hang on, let me bat-splain.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.060
You see, every single side character in a superhero movie has to have a superhero spin-off.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.020
They gotta be superheroes in a future movie!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.460
Or at least be a prequel to Shazam!

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.800
Yeah! Bare minimum.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.980
ARCHERS!!!!

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.360
NC: This connection to the soldiers and the people suffering builds up perfectly in a truly inspiring scene where

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.360
Diana breaks orders and walks onto what is now, literally no-man's-land.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.620
- General! They're launching a strange und kind of arousing attack!!!

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.280
I am Diana, defender of all that is-- Whoa!

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.200
Okay, take two.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.720
Come on, men! Don't hide in the trenches like a pussy! Get out there and fight like a pussy!!

00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:01.020
NC: The men rally around her as her God-Killer does exactly that, destroying a chapel, serving as the control base for a town of tortured people.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.760
She makes her way to a party to kill General Ludendorff and Dr. Poison, but Steve says it'll result in tons of people dying.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.860
Thus, he stops her, resulting in tons of people dying.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.160
The very town she saved is now up in gas and smoke.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.060
Wonder Woman says "Screw harsh reality! She wants her comic book bullshit back!"

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.000
So she finds General Ludendorff at his base and tries again to finish him off.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.960
- What are you?

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.140
Shortening your subscription to life!

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.420
Here! I made these god pills. Now you can totally fight her!

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.420
Woooooo!!

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.980
Thank you, Herr Hamburglar!

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.280
(snorts pills)

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.200
Ha! Now I am as strong as you!!

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.680
(Punches; grunts)

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.140
Not even a god can stop me now!

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.100
(stabs)

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.180
But, a god with a really sharp object...that'll do.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.780
Good for me!

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.200
NC: But, as par for most movies nowadays, there has to be a surprise villain: Ares.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.260
- Wait, what?

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.320
Yeeesssssss.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.160
Hello!

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.140
This is a joke for the review, right? That's not really the God of War, right?

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.220
NC: No, it's totally in the movie. That is the God of War.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.480
You see, he didn't cause people to start the war, but he did plan ideas for them to do it well.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.520
- You know what's awesome? Killing people.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.460
Your idea, not mine.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.380
Killing people would be awesome, and that's my idea, not Ares'.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.440
He creates war through humanity's hunger for violence, and he serves as their muse for creativity.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.640
Have you ever thought of a body-crushing gas for peaceful purposes?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.600
I'll create Nickelback!

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:54.620
No! Don't do that! Even I'm not that evil. Just get to the gas...I mean, if it pops in your head, I don't know!

00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:02.640
NC: Okay, so here's the thing. As much as I'm sick of the villain being a surprise at the end, it does kind of match this hero's journey.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.920
Wonder Woman thinks it's a simple good vs. evil tale,

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.240
but discovers things are not so black and white.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.220
Hell, even this particular war was not so black and white,

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.880
So it creates more of a challenge for ethical loyalty.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:21.280
But here's the problem. Ares, the God of freaking War, an entity so powerful, it took on Zeus...

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.080
...is a pasty old British guy.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.520
Hey, I am very intimidating! I once asked to pass the salt, and I didn't say please.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.040
You are as intimidating as the Monopoly guy!

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.720
Hey, we used our crappy effects to Photoshop my head on a muscular body!

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:41.980
See? I am totally worth nightmares! And I should know, I had a bad dream last week that I played cricket with no knee-pads. Ho-ho-ho!

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.880
Oh, enough of this, Professor Plum!

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.620
I always saw myself as a Colonel Mustard.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.820
I am going to kill you with my disintegrating sword, and, brother, when it disintegrates, it disintegrates!

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.280
Well, what do you know? It disintegrated.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.200
And now, I will show you my real form, which I'm sure you'll be more comfortable with.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.660
NC: Alright, now this is what I'm talking about! This is the Ares from the comic, this is the God of War! This is...

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.800
- Hello!

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.600
...still a old British fop!

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.040
Oh, come on. Just because it's this face under all this armor doesn't mean I'm any less cruel! Look, I'm going to throw things at her!

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:34.200
There now, you see? That was very intimidating. Fire, lightning, all commanded by a Monty Python character. Come on!

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:42.120
NC: Things don't get any better when Wonder Woman realizes Steve is flying a plane filled with the poisoned gas into the air to blow it up, sacrificing himself.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.980
Well, it could be worse. I could be killed by a dickless Doomsday.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.600
Noooo!

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.640
Oh wow! That pilot died faster than your 2011 TV series.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:05.360
Yes Diana! Now you realize the sword was never the god killer; you were the god killer!

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.100
And now I will kill you with every DC villain's ultimate weapon!

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.840
And what is that?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.800
Overwritten dialogue!

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.560
Mankind is inherently evil. It is in their nature to destroy themselves... (BLATHERING CONTINUES)

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.620
(GROANING) So... pretentious...

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.120
...there have been systematic changes...

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.920
Hey! Now we're back on track.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.640
This guy gets it! So long-winded! So needlessly detailed!

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.000
It's like watching a bedtime story for Christopher Nolan and the Wachowskis. 
- Yeah!

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.820
Oh Christ. Archers!

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.780
- Okay, okay. We're heading out.
- You're gonna miss us!

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.600
Now, Diana, kill the one responsible, symbolically representing how you've given up on humanity...

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.180
... even though you've already killed like a bajillion of us already.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.440
No. I will not kill her, because I have faith in love!

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.780
But I will kill you for that same faith in love!

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:11.020
Okay, none of that makes sense. You let her go, you kill me, and somehow you worked love into all that?

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.000
You are bonkers.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.620
Oh, yes, what are we at? The two hour ten minute mark? Yeah, I should probably die.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.380
(EXPLOSION)

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.360
NC: So Diana destroys the fop of war, and vows to keep the fight for love alive.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.680
... By laying low in France for a hundred years.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.720
Okay, I'm not gonna lie, I totally don't get most of this ending.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.760
But for only the last few minutes not to add up, instead of the majority of the film? That's a DC miracle!

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.620
And that was Wonder Woman!

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.240
Is it as good as everybody says it is?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.740
...Yeah, and for a reason probably actually a little different from most superhero films nowadays.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.480
See, here's the thing. When superheroes started, they were gods, icons.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.900
The people you looked up to for being better than you. They did the right thing just because it was the right thing.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.800
But after a while, it was becoming old.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:11.600
They started to seem way too perfect, so superheroes went the more personal route, making it more about the individual...

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.120
...portraying flawed rebels, like their readers, as opposed to orderly role models, like their parents.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.240
And it was great! They got more angsty, more dark, more human than ever before.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.640
But something interesting happened when Wonder Woman walked onto that battlefield in the middle of the film.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.800
It wasn't Batman walking to avenge his parents. It wasn't Spider-Man walking to be responsible for his powers.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.660
It was just a hero who wanted to help people.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.980
There was no tragic backstory, no arc. No terrible event that made her compelled to do it.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.680
She did it because that's who she is. That's what she knows. That's what she connects with.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.040
And it's not her powers that make her that way, it's her character.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.800
It's still a hero's journey, but this hero makes it about the people she saves.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:02.720
She always wants to help them, always wants to do what's right, and for no other reason except that she just wants to.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.220
This is the type of hero we haven't seen for a while. And, honestly, for good reason!

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:15.860
We needed the personal touch, the brooding, the angst, and we still do! It led to some of the most popular, greatest superheroes of all time!

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.800
But sometimes we forget that we need this type of hero too.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.660
Not Superman fighting Zod while ignoring the debris falling on people...

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.820
...not Batman trying to kill another hero for hypocritical reasons...

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:32.800
...but a warrior walking onto a battlefield because she feels it's the most she can do.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.180
We haven't seen this kind of hero on the big screen since the Richard Donner Superman.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.800
I think he was starting to be seen as too corny and not dark enough, and that's understandable.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.020
But that's the genius of setting it in World War One. It's the perfect paradox.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:52.400
It was real, but far back enough for distance. It was filled with extremes, but subtleties as well.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.660
The worst of humanity, the best of humanity; an environment where a comic book hero can save the day...

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:04.140
... but still witness the harsh outcomes of reality, creating both light and dark perfectly.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.560
This! This is what DC is at its best.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.560
If Marvel is humans becoming gods, DC is gods becoming human.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:22.440
And this is that done right. This reminded me of what's wonderful about DC, and why its characters are still timeless.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:29.720
When done correctly, it blends myth with reality; the ordinary with the extraordinary; mortal with immortal.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:37.320
It's the closest we have to current Greek mythology. It's honest, it's powerful, it lasts forever.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:43.700
This is the movie that made me remember why I love DC in the first place.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.860
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, and...

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:52.800
Here.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.580
What's this?

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.900
It's your cake.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.680
And you can eat it, too.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.460
Actually, I have diabetes.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.000
- Oh! I didn't know that.
- Yeah, right here.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.880
I mean the magic hand already gave it to me. It's hand cake.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.500
- I will literally die.
- Okay.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.720
You, uh- mind if you play us out while I eat hand cake?

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.880
Oh, yeah. Sure.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.920
You may be awesome, but you're not eating hand cake next to Wonder Woman playing electric guitar awesome.

Hey! Doug Walker here, doing a charity shout-out, and this week we are doing Public Color!

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:11.060
Public Color engages at-risk students in their education, and empowers them to plan and prepare for college and a career...

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.540
through a continuum of youth development.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:19.340
In their educational programs, that start with teachers teaching them how to paint vibrant colors in their schools...

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.440
they're creating a new sense of school community and safety.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.820
Their model starts with struggling, under-served inner-city schools, but that's not where it stops.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:35.720
Once they finish a school, they extend to the community, to local police precincts, and the collective neighborhood facilities.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:45.060
Since 1996, Public Color students and corporate volunteers have transformed over 400 schools, community facilities, and playgrounds...

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:50.780
from dreary, dark, and dangerous, to safe, bright, and vibrant educational and community centers.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.800
If you check out their site and their youtube channel, you can see all the great work that they've done...

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.620
... as well as projects you can either donate to, or volunteer with.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.320
Take a click, and bring a whole new world of color into the world!
