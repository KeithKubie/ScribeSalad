00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.280
Because shyness can grip us in such powerful ways,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.240
it's tempting to think of it as an immutable part of our emotional make-up

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.720
with roots that extend far into our personalities and perhaps biology,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.100
and that we would be incapable of ever extirpating.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.080
But in truth, shyness is based on a set of ideas about the world that are eminently amiable to change

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.300
through a process of reason, because they are founded on some touchingly malleable errors of thought.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.520
Shyness is rooted in a distinctive way of interpreting strangers.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.940
The shy aren't awkward around everyone-- they're tongue-tied around those who seem most unlike them

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.500
on the basis of a range of surface markets: age, class, tastes, habits, beliefs, backgrounds, or religions.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.680
With no unkindness meant, we could define shyness as a form of provincialism of the mind

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.820
and over-attachment to the incidentals of one's own life and experience that unfairly casts others

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.780
into the role of daunting, unfathomable, unknowable foreigners.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.580
On contact with a person from another world or province, the shy allow their minds to be dominated

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.000
by a forbidding aura of difference.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.140
They may silently and awkwardly say to themselves that there's nothing to be said or done

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.280
because the other is famous while they belong to the province of the obscure,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.060
or because the other is very old while their province is firmly that of 20-somethings,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
or because the other is very clever while their province is that as a non-intellectual,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.620
or because the other is from the land of very beautiful girls

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.460
while they hail from the province of average-looking boys.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.180
This is why there can be no grounds to laugh, hazard a playful remark, or feel at ease.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.760
The shy person doesn't intend to be unpleasant or unfriendly; they simply experience all otherness

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.580
as an insurmountable barrier to making their own goodwill and personality apparent.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.540
We can imagine that in the history of humanity, shyness was always the first response.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.600
The people over the hill would have triggered the feeling because they were farmers while you were fishermen,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.860
or they spoke with a lilt in their vowels while your diction was monotone and flat.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.340
Yet gradually, there emerged a more worldly, less exclusive way of relating to strangers--

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.940
what we might call a psychological cosmopolitanism.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.760
In the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.780
prompted by ever increasing encounters between peoples

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.300
who lived very different and mutually unfamiliar lives,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.360
thanks the developments in trade and shipping an alternative to shyness developed.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.880
Greek travelers who worshiped human-like divinities learnt that Egyptians revered cats and certain birds.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.300
Romans who shaved their chins met barbarians who did not.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.740
Senators who lived in colonnaded houses with underfloor heating

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.740
encountered chieftains who lived in drafty wooden huts.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.960
And among certain thinkers, an approach developed that proposed that all these humans,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.340
whatever their surface variations, shared a common call...

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.760
and that it was to this that the mature mind should turn in contact with apparent otherness.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.380
It was to this cosmopolitan mindset that the Roman playwright and poet, Terrence, gave voice when he wrote,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.540
"I am human so nothing human is foreign to me."

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.160
And that Christianity made use of, in rendering universal sympathy, a cornerstone of its view of existence.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.860
Someone becomes a cosmopolitan not on the basis of having a buoyant or gregarious nature,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.920
but because they are in touch with a fundamental truth about humanity...

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.960
because they know that irrespective of appearance, we are the same species beneath--

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.860
an insight that the tongue-tied guests at the party or awkward seducer in the restaurant

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.240
are guilty of implicitly refusing.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.820
Traditionally, rank or status have been major sources of shy provincialism.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.340
The peasant felt he couldn't approach the lord,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.120
the young milkmaid stammered when the earl's son visited the stable.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.420
Today, in an echo of such inhibitions, the boy of average looks feels he could never hang out with a beautiful girl,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.600
or the modestly off will lose any ability to talk to the very wealthy.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.140
The mind just fixates on the gulfs.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.140
My nose looks like a child modeled it out of plasticine...

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.880
yours is as if it had been carved out by Michelangelo.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.440
I fear losing my job while you fear that the expansion of your business into Mexico

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.700
won't be as profitable as you'd forecast.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.320
The cosmopolitan is well aware of differences.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.280
They just refuse to be cowed or dominated by them.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.840
They look beyond them to perceive, or in practical terms, simply to guess at a collective species' unity.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.380
Shyness does have its insightful dimensions.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.680
It's infused with an awareness that we might be bothering someone with our presence.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.600
It's based upon an acute sense that a stranger could be dissatisfied or discomforted by us.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.060
The shy person is touchingly alive to the dangers of being a nuisance, yet in most cases,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.640
we simply pay an unnecessarily heavy price for our reserve around people

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.040
who might well have opened their hearts to us if only we'd known how to manifest our own benevolence.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.580
We cling too jealously to our province.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.720
The pimply boy doesn't discover that he and the high school beauty share a taste in humor

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.580
and a similarly painful relationship with their father.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.380
Races and ages continue not to mingle to their collective detriments.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.340
Shyness is a touching, yet ultimately excessive and unwarranted way of feeling special.
