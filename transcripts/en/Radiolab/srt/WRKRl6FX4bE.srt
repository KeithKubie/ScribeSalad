1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,680
Listening to radio lab radio

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,460
from W N y. S. E n.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,080
N. P. R. Ladies and Gentlemen,

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,750
please welcome to the stage
your host for this evening.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,930
Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,103
[inaudible].

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,230
Okay, so Robert and I have been
on tour for the last two months.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,100
We went to city after city after city,

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,600
something like 21 cities. We went
to year. We were both like, yeah,

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,410
sick kicked their asses,

11
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:50,490
but it was so much fun and the show was
called apocalyptical is about endings,

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,670
which is not the most obvious topic
to choose to invite people to do with

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,110
theaters. Hey,

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,120
we're going to just tell you different
stories that end really brilliantly,

15
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,550
but these are, this is a
series of ending stories.

16
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:06,210
That's what we did that night and we
did it with some amazing musicians and

17
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:10,410
comedians and video artists who projecting
beautiful images on these massive

18
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:15,030
screens above our head and also we
had puppets, enormous, beautiful,

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,110
articulate, gorgeous puppets,
and you can see all this.

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,730
We are releasing a really nicely shot
video of this entire performance at the

21
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:25,740
same time as this audio podcast.

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,040
Go to radiolab.org/live you
can watch the whole thing.

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,490
He knows some of the best moments
of the show were purely visual,

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,140
so we'd encourage you to check it out.

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,480
But what follows is the audio
podcast version of that show,

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,080
which we recorded live at the paramount
in Seattle. This show actually

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,660
truly begins with a radical rethinking
of one of the most important ending

28
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:52,060
stories that has ever
happened on planet earth,

29
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,430
which is the story about
the end of the dinosaur.

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,170
There's all kinds of, uh,
dinosaur puppetry, beautiful
stuff at the beginning,

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,930
uh, which we're going to skip over.
But again, you can check it out at

32
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,440
radiolab.org/live we're going to jump to
the part where we hear from scientists

33
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,280
who had been forensically probing this
moment and have a totally new way of

34
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,460
thinking about it. Okay, we're going
to start you off with a guy. Well,

35
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,870
the guy who started it off for us,
it's a guy named Jay Jay Malosh

36
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,120
professor at Purdue University,

37
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,540
and I study impact craters
among other things.

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,990
Not only can Jay Malosh create
impact craters with his mind,

39
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,220
but he and his colleagues have been
investigating this moment almost as if it

40
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:33,390
were a crime scene that happened not
60 million years ago, but yesterday.

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,780
And the story that they've put together,
it's more than just interesting.

42
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,643
It's frankly,

43
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,410
frankly terrifying and weirdly
specific as it happens.

44
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:50,430
Take for example the seemingly simple
question of when, when did it happen?

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,610
You don't mean like the year, cause
that would be a little too specific. No,

46
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,820
I don't know if you remember what Jay,
you got even more specific than that.

47
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,070
This was a casual question that I
threw out. Listen to his answer. By

48
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,340
the way, do we know anything
about seasons? Was this
hit at warm particularly?

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,640
Actually it was between, well
this is a bit of a stretch,

50
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:11,360
but it was some time between June
and July. Helium, you can say that.

51
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,400
And so specifically, how would you
know that the reasoning is we can,

52
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,730
for example, um, this was the
a, this was the first surprise.

53
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,540
Kind of a controversial idea, but
that basically goes like this. J says,

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,150
scientists have found
some pollen in rocks,

55
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:29,020
which date from that time to different
kinds of pollen and based on an analysis

56
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,460
of those two kinds of pollen,

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,500
we know that the um,

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,190
impact took place between the flowering
of the Lotus and the flowering of the

59
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,440
water and only [inaudible]. Okay,

60
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,400
so that's what Lotus you see
flowering on the left gets a water,

61
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,600
the leaf flowering on the
right, you can see this.

62
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:47,440
If you look at our video online fossils
found at the impact site that had pollen

63
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,320
from both of these
flowers in the same rock,

64
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,490
which suggest that the impact did in fact
take place somewhere between June and

65
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,690
July. It's one of those
things in geometry, we,

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,700
we get a glimpse of a a
moment far, far back in time.

67
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,650
So let's go deeper into that moment.

68
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,383
[inaudible]

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,710
all right, everybody, let's collectively
rewind our minds back in time.

70
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:22,711
10 millions of years into the past
66 million years ago to be precise.

71
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,700
There they are, majestic beasts

72
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,480
hanging out on the plains,
eating their lotus leaves

73
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,920
sometime in June,

74
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,013
June 17th let's say,

75
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,810
and everything on this day.

76
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,910
Pretty much normal.

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,120
This particular fateful day
was no different than any
of millions and millions

78
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:58,010
of previous days as far as
the dinosaurs were concerned,

79
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,640
but if there were any strong numbers
at the time, which they weren't,

80
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,150
they might have had some inkling that
something was coming because they looked

81
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,750
up. They would have seen

82
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,330
tiny

83
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,930
no dot have lightened
the sky wars planets,

84
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,300
the moon move with respect to the stars.

85
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:21,590
This would have had a constant bearing
and the old semen could tell you that if

86
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:26,180
you see something constant bearing
that's on a collision course with you and

87
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:29,870
that thing of course is are
asteroid zeroing in on the earth.

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,230
I want to say that we do know quite a
bit about this asteroid from the size of

89
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:39,140
the creator and from the amount of
certain minerals found at the impact site.

90
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:44,141
We know that the asteroid was roughly
six miles wide and then again roughly six

91
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:46,221
miles long,

92
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,750
which makes it approximately the size of
Manhattan island or our Mount Everest.

93
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,680
It's roughly the size of Mount
Everest. That is Doug Robertson,

94
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:56,840
a geologist who knows quite a bit about
this asteroid and by the way it has a

95
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,930
and that it's, it's the
asteroids called Baptist

96
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,820
Stena Baptist Dema y that
Stena Baptist in, I dunno,

97
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,420
update the name asteroids
on another subject.

98
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,460
We do know that the Earth's moon was
probably produced by a collision with

99
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,780
something the size of Mars.

100
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,820
Well I just threw that in cause it's
cool. It doesn't really relate to us.

101
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,920
Sorry, we don't have the whole evening
here. Let's just stay to it. Okay.

102
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,710
The dinosaurs are here on earth. They
are eating near leaves. Meanwhile,

103
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:31,210
up in space, our asteroid Baptist Dina
is now hurtling towards the earth,

104
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:36,211
20,000 miles an hour area fast 20 times
faster than a very fast rifle moment and

105
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:39,490
scientists couldn't be sure what
would happen mathematically.

106
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:43,510
I mean when in a Mount Everest size
bullet traveling at 20,000 miles an hour,

107
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,080
it's our atmosphere. The
atmosphere is really just a very,

108
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,450
very thin skin over the rest of the earth.

109
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
So scientists that, all right, if
we're going to construct this story,

110
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:56,370
let's just take it piece by piece and
first figure out what would happen when

111
00:06:56,371 --> 00:07:00,210
this big ball hurling through
space slams into our atmosphere,

112
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,390
which is made of gas of course.
So just to approximately,

113
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:05,340
let's fire a bullet through some gas

114
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,090
and watch what happens.

115
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,780
Now here we basically showed a super slow
motion video of a gun firing a bullet

116
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,660
underwater. You can see it on our
website, radiolab.org it's very beautiful.

117
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,690
You see the bullet coming out and
freeze it right there at the edge. Okay.

118
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,510
Basically what you see is this
bullet steaming through the water.

119
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,270
And by the way, we use water
as an approximation for gas.

120
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,170
Cause in gas you'd have this same effect
I'm about to describe creating a wake

121
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:34,610
behind it and the week gets wider and
wider as it trails away from the bullet.

122
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:37,010
And if you imagine this
shape in three dimensions,

123
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,410
really what you're looking at is a
kind of a cone, like a funnel shape.

124
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,170
And inside the the, the, that,

125
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,280
the wallets of the funnel
inside that cone is nothing,

126
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,800
nothing, nothing. Because it's in water.
So you're saying there's, there's,

127
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,070
it's like a hole in the water. That's
what I'm saying. There's nothing in there.

128
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,950
It's a vacuum in there because the,

129
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,680
the bullet is sh is
shooting through the water.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,980
It pushes the water out
of the way and for a beat,

131
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,650
the water doesn't have time to come
back together and so all you have is

132
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,540
emptiness in there. Right there. This,

133
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,220
what you're seeing is a massive hole
in the water created by a tiny little

134
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,054
bullet.

135
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,010
Now imagine that that bullet is six miles
wide and the hole that it's making is

136
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:18,660
right above your head.
Well, what does that mean?

137
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,670
If you're a dinosaur looking
up would, what would happen?

138
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,271
Well,

139
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:24,900
if you were in the right place and this
is going to be the wrong place in the

140
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:28,090
secondary to you, we're
in the right place to,

141
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,890
to look behind the asteroid as it came in.

142
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,880
You'd probably be able to, to
see clearly through the space

143
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:40,970
[inaudible]

144
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,980
what does that mean?

145
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,990
You would suddenly be looking
at a nighttime hole in a
daytime sky. Right. Whoa.

146
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,150
To be fair, Jay did tell us that, uh,

147
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:55,770
you would need special kinds of
eyeballs to see this knight hole

148
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
in the day sky and the
Dinah's didn't have that.

149
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,740
So science still,

150
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,300
I mean just imagine what a last image
that would be to see day and night come

151
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:10,380
together in the same moment.
But according to Jay,

152
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,410
you better not blink because before
you could open your eyes again

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,330
[inaudible]

154
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,200
the asteroid would have hit the surface.

155
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,380
And if you are in a position to see that,

156
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:30,150
then you're going to be in Gulf by the
violence that is just about to occur.

157
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,631
By the way,

158
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:34,140
the audience was just laughing at a dinos
de Los Muertos graphic that just came

159
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,860
on the screens. So we know it was a big
explosion, fine, and it was violent,

160
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:38,520
fine.

161
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,790
But I think we should be a little bit
subtle about this because obviously if an

162
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,640
asteroid is the size of Manhattan
and it lands on your head,

163
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:48,610
you're not going to feel very good
about that. But if Manhattan is,

164
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,180
is hitting the planet earth,

165
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,320
that's a little bit like a pebble
hitting an enormous beach ball. Yeah,

166
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,300
and I can imagine that the,

167
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:59,850
the little pebble size relativistically
speaking the pebble would create some

168
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,160
damage in the spot where it landed.

169
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,760
But let's suppose that you are um,

170
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,560
alleviating mother of three Hadrosaur
living in New Zealand. Right?

171
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,590
And you're just spent at the
moment that the asteroid comes in,

172
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,830
you're on your Antipolo going
the other side of the planet.

173
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,140
Would you have any idea
that this was happening?

174
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,030
That was the next question
that we talked to Jay.

175
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,530
How much damage would this thing
actually do? Well, we can do experiments.

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,530
We can produce things,

177
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,510
situations like this in small
quantities in the laboratories gay.

178
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,510
Y'All send in here, which
brings us, we're good to hear.

179
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,990
You're good to this guy.

180
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,940
Peter Schultes and I like
to do impact experiments.

181
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,550
Pete Schultz basically has
every 13 year olds dream job.

182
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,410
He gets to blow shit up for living.

183
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,160
Basically what B does is he works at this
place that you're seeing right here on

184
00:10:56,161 --> 00:11:00,300
the screen. This is the NASA Ames
laboratory in California. And uh,

185
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,700
the thing that they're putting together,
they're in the middle of frame.

186
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,390
That is a giant three story tall canon.

187
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,230
What beat does is he takes
projectile. So for example,

188
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:14,130
you're going to see him take a little
glass bullet over there and he's going to

189
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,880
load it into the top of the cannon and
then he's going to fire it right into a

190
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,840
standup for planet earth, which
for him will be a sand pit.

191
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,640
And lucky for us when we called Pete,

192
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,190
he was just about to pull
the trigger on this thing.

193
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,720
So you're are calling you on a day in
which you are trying to IX re-experience

194
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,140
the day. I actually, yeah, but I think
for him to survive, that's our plan

195
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,550
it in recent. Okay. Hold on.

196
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,110
We've got to assume the position.
Okay. We have to cross our fingers.

197
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,010
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

198
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,730
We have all, I'm already like,

199
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,483
here we go.

200
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,463
Rolling.

201
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,283
Um,

202
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,710
that is gorgeous. Oh my
gosh. Are They gonna?

203
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,590
Is that get instant
playback thing. Oh my gosh.

204
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,290
That is the sound of a man.
Very happy with his explosion.

205
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:18,730
Yeah.

206
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,390
You can see every piece of
this, of what's happening.

207
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,890
So based on experiments like this,

208
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:27,940
people like p can figure out precisely
what happened when the asteroid hit the

209
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:28,480
earth.

210
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,380
They can quantify the explosions power
by basically leveraging up experiments

211
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,490
like this. So according to Doug,

212
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:37,520
the amount of energy that would have been
on leash when that thing came rushing

213
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,430
in onto earth

214
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,480
is roughly this.

215
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,180
Oh, we hit the earth with an explosion
that's 100 million mega ton. Yeah.

216
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:52,850
And [inaudible]. Okay,

217
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Sara Lips Date Sarah, our guitars
Kinda swung her guitar around,

218
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,640
had a metal moment. Don't look
at her wrong or she'll do that.

219
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,920
Okay. So here's essentially how
Doug broke that down for us.

220
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,870
Two tons of tea and tea. We're
talking tons of, you're not mega tons.

221
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,260
Two tons of T. And. T.
We'll essentially do this.

222
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,603
Okay.

223
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,380
On one of the three screens, you
see a 10 story building imploding,

224
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,510
two tons of t and t will take down
a building. Now 15,000 tons of TNT.

225
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,260
That is what the United States dropped
on Hiroshima in 1945 on a second screen,

226
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,720
we see archival footage
of the atomic bomb.

227
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,970
That chaos has 15,000 tons of TNT. Now
these days, according to Doug Robertson,

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
a hydrogen bomb current hydrogen bombs
are typically of the order of 1 million

229
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,310
tons of TNT equivalent.

230
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,990
Now 1 million tons of TNT equivalent.
That's what we call a mega ton.

231
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,463
If you remember,

232
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,790
Doug said that the asteroid impact was
the equivalent of 100 million mega tons,

233
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,360
so really what he's saying in concrete
terms is that that impact was the

234
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:13,361
equivalent of 100 million of those bombs
going off all at once in the same spot,

235
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,210
which is a lot.

236
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,440
That is true. That is true.
However, it means it's,

237
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,000
it really depends on what you mean
by a lot because I was doing a little

238
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:28,430
googling and I was surprised to learn that

239
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,810
110 million mega tons is not nearly
enough to destroy the planet,

240
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,380
to destroy the entire planet. You
would need, you ready for this?

241
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,890
110 quadrillion mega tons of GT,

242
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,830
which is 100 million times 110
million mega tens of t. And. T.

243
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,820
So going back to your head resource
situation, mother of three in New Zealand,

244
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,640
if the thing came in Auntie portal to her,

245
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,550
maybe she would feel
the shake a little bit,

246
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,520
but after a minute she'd be like whatever.
And she'd go back to eating leaves.

247
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,050
You probably wouldn't notice it.

248
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,930
Well, no, no, no.

249
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,550
Cause that's not what we were taught in
homeroom by Mrs McGrew or whoever your

250
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:06,810
teacher was. Here's the
classic explanation. There
was an impact of course,

251
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:09,270
and it kicked up an enormous amount
of dust. You'll remember this.

252
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,210
The Dustin kind of covers the
planet. It blankets the earth,

253
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,930
makes the earth very cold, makes the
earth very nasty. All the big plants die.

254
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,260
The little plants get sick, the dinosaurs
get hungry, the dinosaurs get sick.

255
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,640
And then gradually, you know,

256
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:25,530
they get dead deader and deader and deader
from different things. 10,000 years,

257
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:28,320
30,000 years, four to
till you get like, oh,

258
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,450
like 900,000 years later
you've got a shivering.

259
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,960
Last dinosaurs sitting
there in the cold cold,

260
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,740
and that's the end. That's the
story we were told in school

261
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,420
is a long, slow wintery
collapse. Yeah, no, no.

262
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,530
Why we tell these good people that tired
old story from Mrs. What does it Miss?

263
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,200
Some recruiters make. I made her
Magruder tonight. Okay. Yeah.

264
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Let us offer up a completely different
Tabish night, right? Scottish. All right,

265
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,570
we'll go with that. Let's actually
flip the understanding completely.

266
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
I think we should based on
new science, so all right,

267
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,290
here's what we're going to do. Keith,

268
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,920
pull up that a ballistics video that
we showed earlier with the red sand.

269
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,340
Can you sort of pull that up and blow it
up to the three screens and then, yeah,

270
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,000
rewind it back. If you just thank,

271
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,680
you wouldn't go back just a bit. Okay,

272
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:20,210
so this is a 6,000 frame.

273
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:23,570
A second video that you're
seeing here is from Pete's lab.

274
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,350
At this point on the screen, all you're
seeing is a pit of red sand. Now,

275
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,110
what you see in the first few frames is
you see the laser hitting right there,

276
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,120
red sand flying in the air, super
slow Mo. And the next frame forward,

277
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,320
right there, you see some fire,

278
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,710
you see a little bulb of fire
erupt near the impact site,

279
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,210
right where the laser hits the sand.

280
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:44,180
There's this little clump of
flame and we freeze on that spot.

281
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,350
Now scientists can now measure the
temperatures in that spot right there.

282
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,210
Oh yeah. Right there. Okay.
And just to state the obvious,

283
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,260
we know from those measurements that
that spot right there would have gotten

284
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,670
very, very, very,

285
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,930
very, very hot.

286
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,480
No, we beyond the temperature of the
sun, I mean we're talking temperatures,

287
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,340
maybe 20,000 degrees,

288
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,240
will sun's temperatures
about 5,000 degrees.

289
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,390
And if we're talking temperatures
four times hotter than the sun,

290
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,770
well anything that's that hot is going
to instantly, instantly turn to gas.

291
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,120
A very, very high temperature,
high pressure gas.

292
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,090
It's actually rock vapor rock esteem.

293
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,360
So imagine this thing comes
barreling in his asteroid.

294
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,600
It doesn't just bounce off the
earth. It plows into the earth.

295
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,220
It goes into the surface. Two miles
in, five miles in, seven miles in,

296
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,800
10 miles in 20 miles into the earth.

297
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,300
It goes all the rock that's it's plowing
into is turning into a liquid and then

298
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:57,150
into a gas and now
watch what happens next.

299
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,420
This is a basic physic experiment
we're going to show you on the screen.

300
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:02,520
You see it's very lovely video.

301
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:07,521
Actually have a hand dropping
a metal ball into some sand.

302
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,040
This is just a dude dropping a ball
and some sand. Watch this right here.

303
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,260
Paul goes in and like a
millisecond after it makes impact,

304
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,460
disappears into the sand.

305
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,270
A little spear of sand go shooting
back in the opposite direction.

306
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,410
Sort of a bounceback effect. Does this
always happen? This whatever this is,

307
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,510
it's like Newton's law of something. Yeah.

308
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,140
Newtons love sand hook say, yeah,

309
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,540
but what you see is you see this fine
plume of Samuel shooting back in the

310
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,300
opposite direction as a
sort of rebound right now.

311
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:42,710
Imagine that that ball is an
asteroid and that sand over there,

312
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:45,410
that's the planet earth to
Keith. Play that one more time.

313
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,680
You play the video again, but
this time as the ball drops,

314
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,560
it gradually morphs into
an astroid. [inaudible].

315
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,003
Yes,

316
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,440
thank you for the south where you would
get the same effect you would get the

317
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:07,900
[inaudible].

318
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,820
The simple point is just something we do.

319
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,350
You wonder how where we get all of our
sound design is out of that man's mouth.

320
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,940
That's where you would
get that same bounce back
effective of fine blue shooting

321
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:22,180
back in the opposite direction, but
we know from what we just heard,

322
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,230
Doug described that it would
not be, would not be sand.

323
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,800
In this case it would be rocking gas. Yes,

324
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,050
we'll move hot gas expands upward and
pushes right on through the atmosphere up

325
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:34,830
into space.

326
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,390
Some fraction get the moon [inaudible]
some fraction of that hit Mars.

327
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,360
Okay, so now you've got this sneeze
of rock vapor. It's out in space.

328
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,080
Basic physics says that as it travels
out farther away from the earth,

329
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,650
what's going to happen is it's going
to start to cool down a bit and when it

330
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:51,300
cools, Yep.

331
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,950
Recondense is into little droplets that
a basically formed glass very quickly,

332
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,890
little droplets of glass
about the size of sand.

333
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,020
Now if you look at one of these little
droplets of glass under a microscope,

334
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,930
this is what it looks like
right there on the screen.

335
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,660
You see what looks kind of
like a translucent snowball.

336
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,990
That is actually an a magnified
image of one of these bits of glass.

337
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,340
It fell from space that day. Most
of them didn't land on the ground.

338
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,090
Talk about that in a second. There it is.

339
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,030
I don't know about you but I find
that totally terrifying cause that's,

340
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,940
it looks like a little Baptist
Dino, right? Tiny last joy. It's up.

341
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Now imagine trillions of these things
in a cloud and a cloud of shrapnel going

342
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,343
out out,

343
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,490
away from the earth and what's going to
happen next is that it's going to start

344
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:39,080
to lose momentum. That cloud,

345
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,960
when it does the earth's
gravity is going to grab back,

346
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:46,250
hold it and say come on back. And
90% of them come back to the earth.

347
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,330
Well

348
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,770
does falling glass do harm? Yes.
Because what happens is that the,

349
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:57,771
the glass out in space starts to spread
out like north and south and east and

350
00:20:57,811 --> 00:21:01,890
west and eventually it
will appear in the sky over

351
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,260
New Zealand. It's now a global
phenomenon and you know,

352
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:07,260
it's really hard to imagine what
the Hadrosaur would've seen.

353
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,590
But the thing to keep in mind is that
these things, as they're coming in,

354
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:14,910
these bits of glass, a 90 some odd
percent are burning up in the atmosphere.

355
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,330
So very few of them are hitting the
ground. So from her point of view,

356
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,780
probably would have looked
like the greatest media
shower any one has ever seen

357
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,420
with one significant
bummer, which is this,

358
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,190
when these little bits of glass come in,

359
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,480
each one that burns up is the positing
a little bit of heat into the sky.

360
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,040
And collectively there's such a
massive rain of these things coming in.

361
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,320
Well, the heat would build
up, the sky would turn red,

362
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,550
that would be getting hotter and hotter.

363
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:54,880
[inaudible]

364
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,610
and at a certain point,
Jay wondered, well,

365
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:02,611
how hard exactly would it have gotten the
how much heat exactly would have built

366
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:05,800
up there in the sky and then
started to radiate down.

367
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,710
Um, we, uh, calculated the amount
of heat that would come down, uh,

368
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,120
number 10 kilowatts per square meter
and yeah. Okay, well we get this number.

369
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:20,090
Well, what, what does that mean?
Well, I went home and I, um,

370
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,190
hooked up a, uh, uh,

371
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,100
current meter and pride to measure the
amount of heat produced in my oven for

372
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,300
different amounts of power.

373
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,900
And I could get about seven kilowatts
per square meter in my oven on broil.

374
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,810
Oh, like 500 degrees broil you
mean? But that wasn't quite enough.

375
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,370
Not nearly. So Jay started
measuring other kinds of ovens

376
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,230
and then I finally found out
that the heat would be in fact,

377
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:49,700
like being in a pizza oven,

378
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,190
a pizza oven is about right.

379
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,420
Which means that if you were addressed
real dinosaur anywhere above the ground

380
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,230
on the earth on that day, you
would have experienced some heat.

381
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,660
It is almost unimaginable.

382
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,670
Maybe it started at a hundred degrees
because it was June, it was summer,

383
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,300
but within minutes it would
have been 300 degrees,

384
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,450
500 degrees, 700 degrees,

385
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,450
900 degrees.

386
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,620
Estimates are on that day.

387
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:28,310
Temperatures topped out at
something like 1200 degrees

388
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,620
at that temperature. Nothing
can protect you, your scales,

389
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,470
your for whatever you got,
it's not going to do any good.

390
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,530
Your blood will literally start to
boil inside your body and you will die.

391
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,403
[inaudible]

392
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,413
[inaudible],

393
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,723
[inaudible], [inaudible]

394
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:15,320
[inaudible]

395
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,960
so essentially according to this theory,

396
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,560
the dinosaurs and everything else on earth
that day would have been incinerated.

397
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,790
Doug thinks that's what the
domain, not so much the impact,

398
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,850
but all that objective,
it went up into the sky,

399
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:31,970
came down as glass rain and created
that heat. That's what did the men,

400
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,520
he would argue it didn't just do some
of the men or even many of them in.

401
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:41,390
He would say it did all
of them in all at once.

402
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,930
There is zero evidence that
any dinosaur made it through.

403
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,260
And the crazy part of this theory is
that Jay and Doug thinks that the whole

404
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:52,630
process from the impact of the glass
rain to the incineration of all of these

405
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:55,550
species on the planet, it
would have taken a few hours.

406
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,050
His best guess, he thinks maybe two hours.

407
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,270
I mean, that's less time
than a a business lunch.

408
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:11,750
Yeah.

409
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,340
You try getting east northwest anywhere
on Mercer Street at rush hour in too,

410
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,280
and do that. I mean,
if you think about it,

411
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,000
that is less time than you will
spend in this theater tonight.

412
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,623
[inaudible] [inaudible]

413
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,563
[inaudible]

414
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,763
[inaudible]

415
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,760
[inaudible] [inaudible]

416
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,770
that means that you're saying that

417
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,080
an animal that had been supreme

418
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,360
on the planet for 200 million

419
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,890
disappears in a few
hours. Completely. Yes.

420
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,570
Yup. That's

421
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,720
what the evidence suggests. That's right.

422
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,143
[inaudible]

423
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:28,510
well, you can consider the evidence, but
also you could consider common sense.

424
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:32,620
I mean, we've got a world filled
with terrestrial dinosaurs.

425
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,290
They were on every continent.
They were even in Antarctica.

426
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,690
And to say that they all
disappeared in two hours.

427
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:44,160
I mean all that would,
that suggests that there's

428
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,120
none of them out of harm's way.
None of them, many caves somewhere.

429
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,520
None of them in the
grotto, none of them in a,

430
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,560
in a protected forest of any kind.
The word all in that connection,

431
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,730
it's just too much a, I
just don't buy it. But yeah,

432
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:04,731
I mean the truth is that the science is
never going to be so exact as to say.

433
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,430
Yeah, all of them disappeared
or it happened on a single
day or on an afternoon.

434
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,850
I mean now no tool that
we have is that precise,

435
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,260
but what Jay is saying is that
it happened fast, very fast.

436
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,220
Nothing made it through.

437
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,070
What I find interesting is that ultimately
you don't need the ballistics or

438
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,581
anything.

439
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:27,960
We've shown you so far to
know that something major
and sudden happened because

440
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:31,680
you can see evidence of it
literally etched into the earth.

441
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:38,410
Here's the thought where we
first found within the boundary,

442
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,890
you can see it really well
out in Colorado actually.

443
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,420
We sent one of our producers,

444
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:45,930
Molly Webster out there to meet a
paleontologist named Kirk Johnson.

445
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,860
They hiked over a couple of hills.
They found this one specific spot,

446
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,630
Mike ready for a dinosaur to come around
the corner and the minute they started

447
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,464
to dig,

448
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,920
taking down like a foot
from where we were.

449
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,730
Turns out for every three feet you
get down 10,000 years in time. See,

450
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:10,960
the earth has layers,

451
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,410
kind of like a tree has rings
and every three feet down you go.

452
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:19,270
You're going back in time about 10,000
years and when you go all the way down,

453
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:23,110
all the way back to 66.0 9 million years,

454
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,190
you will find this one
little skinny strip of rock.

455
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,493
Okay?

456
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,450
That's the kiddie boundary that

457
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,810
this one skinny gray line,
this, this gray, crappy,

458
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,680
this. No, in a very real way,

459
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:49,681
that line that you're seeing
that represents the day
the asteroid hit the day

460
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,170
just above that line. That's
a little bit after the day.

461
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,540
Just below that line was
a little bit before today.

462
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,190
The line is called the KT boundary.

463
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,560
And what's cool is you
can actually touch it.

464
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:03,760
You can touch evidence of that
moment. And in fact, Kirk,

465
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:06,790
what he did that day was he
took his finger and he dug
a piece out and he handed

466
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:07,624
it to Molly.

467
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,380
We're hold, I'm holding.
You're holding the shake.

468
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,030
It's like a, it's almost
like chunks of coal. Yeah,

469
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,560
but it's not what you're holding.

470
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,540
Dark Gray mudstone the
carbon rich bud stone.

471
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,970
And in that mudstone you'll find
all kinds of things. I mean,

472
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:27,971
you'll find very rare minerals
like iridium that probably
came in on the astroid

473
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:30,200
and got smooshed into that line.

474
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,550
Those little glass balls I was talking
about this a little hell balls. Well,

475
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:37,070
if you get out a microscope
and you look at that rock,

476
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,070
you will see them in there. We put a funny

477
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,250
cartoon of the little hell
balls. They're all in that line.

478
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,720
How thick do you think that line is?

479
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,990
Which is about an inch
is like hidden in there.

480
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,830
It's sort of a story of that day.
Absolutely. And here's the crazy thing.

481
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:56,620
If this is the line right
here, this little strip here,

482
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,280
Robert traces a picture of the KT boundary
with his finger and then you dig just

483
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:04,570
below the line you were going to find
over and over again, dinosaurs everywhere.

484
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,470
I mean not going to be alive.

485
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,280
Of course he says putting
some toy dinosaurs under the
line and making them move

486
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,100
by giving them a certain amount
of energy, which I shouldn't,

487
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,160
but they are fossils and you will find
dinosaur fossils from Europe and Idaho

488
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,360
and Montana. This one
says it was made in China,

489
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,040
but if you just go above the
line, you don't find any done so,

490
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,000
so below the line,

491
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,320
scientists have looked everywhere
above the line and they haven't.

492
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,170
Well, everywhere they have looked
anyway, they found nothing, nothing,

493
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,710
nothing. It's a different world. That's
the amazing thing is a different world

494
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,250
and it's pretty rude, young.
This is one world. Nothing.

495
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,920
You're literally just pointing Pinky
to point. Your fingers spread. Yeah.

496
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,170
[inaudible]

497
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,930
this is another moment where I
would urge you at some point,

498
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:03,620
not now keep listening, but at some point
watch the video of this performance.

499
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,480
Cause what Sarah, Darren, Glen and
Keith do in this moment digitally.

500
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
It's pretty amazing.

501
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,560
A

502
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,940
[inaudible] [inaudible] eh,

503
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,290
a

504
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,813
[inaudible].

505
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,313
Okay.

506
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,873
[inaudible] [inaudible]

507
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,893
[inaudible] [inaudible]

508
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,473
[inaudible] [inaudible]

509
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,373
[inaudible] [inaudible]

510
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,833
[inaudible] [inaudible]

511
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,403
[inaudible]

512
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,531
before we go to break,

513
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,740
I just want to give a very special
thanks to the people who shared the stage

514
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:31,640
with us. Sarah lip state from no velour.

515
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,180
Darren grey on the base in
Glen Coachee and the drums.

516
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,040
They're both from the band on Fillmore.

517
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,750
We were so lucky to share the stage
with those guys along with, um, uh,

518
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,330
video maestro key scratch
who was doing the live video.

519
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,000
[inaudible] brilliant puppet here,
Myron Guso. Oh my God. That guy.

520
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,350
So good. Check out all of them.

521
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,400
Radio lab.org/live. You can see
them doing what they do. Uh,

522
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,300
visually it's pretty, it's
pretty worth watching. Anyhow,

523
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,090
we'll be back in a second.
