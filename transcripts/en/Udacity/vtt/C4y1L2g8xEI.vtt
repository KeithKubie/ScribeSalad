00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.891
The earliest versions of the camera have been known to have existed from 300 BC

00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.784
where even philosophers like Aristotle were actually looking at

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:13.522
how they can capture light onto a background plate and be able to use that for

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:14.749
looking at scenes.

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.008
The earliest forms of the camera started appearing in mid 1800s, and

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.030
this is one of those traditional classic examples of

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.835
a camera where basically a box with a lens or an optical capturing device,

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:30.480
which could be a pinhole, was used to generate images.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.790
Then of course came various types of processes where you could now

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.090
be able to save those images onto print forms, and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.400
this is various types of printing mechanisms that started in the early 1900s.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.870
1948 is where we started getting more of these compact representations.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.380
1986 perhaps is when we start seeing examples of these disposable cameras.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.652
This is an instance of a first generation digital single-lens reflex,

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:57.415
or SLR, camera,

00:00:57.415 --> 00:01:03.190
a professional camera that was a digital camera came about in early 1990s.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.700
And this was about to 1 to 2 megapixel resolution image.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.494
And more interesting thing was when I started my career on research and

00:01:11.494 --> 00:01:16.010
computation photography, this camera was available for about $25,000.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.716
And I actually got access to going to the lab to

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:22.518
be able to use this to take a few pictures so I can actually start get

00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:26.600
playing around with the images that came from these specialized cameras.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.740
Of course, 2000 is where the first generation of mobile cellphone cameras

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.050
started coming about.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.688
So if you really think about it, we've gone a long way, where first instance of

00:01:38.688 --> 00:01:42.911
a real camera that actually was into a form that we think of a camera to be in

00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:46.607
right now, was in mid to early 1800s, to where we are now.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:51.820
And of course, cameras have taken very interesting shapes and forms since then.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.810
Interesting things to note now is cameras can be really small.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.740
Just few examples.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.875
As small as a pencil or

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:02.650
even as, you know, small enough to be on your, just your fingertip.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.864
Most popular cameras that you see these days are,

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:06.707
of course, the cellphone cameras.

00:02:06.707 --> 00:02:08.130
They provide a good resolution.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.270
We played around with them a lot, I'm sure.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.080
And of course, these days, people wearing them in different forms, including,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.190
of course, much more variable cameras like this one.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.450
One thing I'd like to note is one of the other things that has changed is how we

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.240
interact with these cameras.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.402
In the old days, when we had the cameras in much more of a bigger form factor,

00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:31.628
we had much more of a formal relationship,

00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:35.923
where we basically use this tripods and all that kind of stuff.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:38.058
Then we went to much more of a standup, but

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:42.572
if you notice, most of our camera interaction is much more now stand-away, and,

00:02:42.572 --> 00:02:47.320
you know, we use viewfinders to be able to see it, and it's become more casual.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.260
We've gone from more formal types of photography to

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.350
more casual photography more and more now
