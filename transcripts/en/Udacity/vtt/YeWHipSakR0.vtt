00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.035
These two graphs are the only two that show step functions. The other two

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.326
aren't, because this one has linear parts, with slopes that aren't just 0, and

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:13.854
this one has a part that's a problem. This third one is sort of a funny case,

00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:17.394
you might call it a trivial case of a step function, because it's just one

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:23.517
constant function. This is just f of x equals 3. This step function only has

00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:27.594
one constant piece, so it's sort of a silly example, but it still counts. This

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:31.570
first one is a more classic example of a step function. And probably something

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.259
you'll see more typically when people talk about step functions.
