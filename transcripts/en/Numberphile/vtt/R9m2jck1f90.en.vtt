00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.870
THOMAS WOOLLEY: So the number
we're talking about now is 60.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.030
Now, it's quite a big number,
so you may not

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.490
meet it all the time.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.800
But you do use it a lot when
telling the time, which, of

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.050
course, there are 60 seconds
in a minute, 60

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.370
minutes in an hour.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.220
But why 60?

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.900
Why this random number 60?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.600
Well, it all goes back
to the Babylonians.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.390
Thank you, Babylonians.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.000
Because what they wanted back
then was a very nice number

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.395
that divides quite easily.

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:30.560
So if you think about
the number 60,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.240
what divides it cleanly?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.550
1, of course, 2,
3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.550
And in fact, it's the smallest
number that's

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.130
divisible by all of these.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.130
But why is this important?

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.130
Because you can take
half of it.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.130
You can take a quarter of it.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.050
You can take a fifth of it.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.390
You can take a third of it.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.430
You can divide 60 up
in a lot of ways.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.000
So if you're cooking in this
base, you can cook with lots

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.020
of fractions of that.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.685
So if you don't want to cook a
whole meal, you can cook half

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:01.340
a meal, or a third of a meal,
or things like that.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.030
Again, if you're telling
time, you can have a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.580
quarter of an hour.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.310
You can have 20 minutes.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.600
You can have half an hour.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.590
You can have three-quarters
of an hour.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.250
It all divides 60 very nicely.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.370
And when you don't have
computers, you need a number

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.990
that you can divide nicely so
you get nice, round numbers at

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.950
the end of it, because they're
easier to work with.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.393
So I mean, 60, if 60's so
nice, why do we use 10?

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:22.404
BRADY HARAN: You just asked
my next question.

00:01:22.404 --> 00:01:23.820
Go on, tell me why.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.690
THOMAS WOOLLEY: Well, the idea
is that we use 10 because we

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.560
have 10 fingers.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.530
so you can just count along.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
As you're a child, you'd count
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.170
Well, what's thought is that
the Babylonians actually

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.350
counted to 60 on two hands.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.840
They would use each knuckle on
one hand to count to 12, and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.660
then count the number
of 12s on the other.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.430
So you'd go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.030
One set of 12.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.880
And then you do it again.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.470
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.050
Two sets of 12.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.060
And again and again, until
you get five sets of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.000
12, which is 60.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.100
Highly divisible, and you can
use it on your hands.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.710
So when the Babylonians were
working with this number 60,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.770
they were also very
good astronomers.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.850
And what they found is
that the year is

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.660
pretty much 360 days.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.040
So that's the length of time it
takes for the Earth to go a

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.820
full circle.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.910
And that's why the circle is
divided up into 360 degrees.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.710
And further, each
degree is then

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.850
divided up into 60 minutes.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.470
You can have an arc minute,
which is a 60th of a degree.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.640
And that, further, is then 60
seconds, 60 arc seconds of

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.020
that 60 minutes.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.653
BRADY HARAN: I wonder if we
came close to living in a

00:02:41.653 --> 00:02:44.440
world where 60 became
our base?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.890
THOMAS WOOLLEY: Like I say,
it's very, very difficult.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.590
I mean, you could write,
well, there's 57.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.570
We use it, two numbers.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.570
For a Babylonian to write 57,
they would have to write 1, 2,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.340
3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.150
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.670
It's a lot easier to write
like that than that.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.680
So these are how they drew their
numbers, because they

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.090
had a little stylus that
they would into clay.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.920
And the stylus had
a triangular end.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.160
So the stylus would look
something like that.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.390
And so when they were doing
ones, they'd use the tip, and

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.170
go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
all the way up to 10.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.620
And the 10, they'd turn the
stylus on the side and create

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.430
one of those shapes.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.930
So each one of those is 10.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.810
Each one of these is a 1.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:40.310
And so there we have 57.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.360
BRADY HARAN: That's their
version of a Sharpie.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.255
Exactly, yeah.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:43.700
It's really good.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.230
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.480
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba.
