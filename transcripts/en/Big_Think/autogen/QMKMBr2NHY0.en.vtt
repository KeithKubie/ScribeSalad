00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.269
I gave a talk at the first Ted in 1984

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279
I gave a talk at the first Ted in 1984
 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.150
I gave a talk at the first Ted in 1984
that was two hours long and it had five

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
that was two hours long and it had five
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.499
that was two hours long and it had five
predictions in it that more or less all

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
predictions in it that more or less all
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.410
predictions in it that more or less all
came true and people called them

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
came true and people called them
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.390
came true and people called them
predictions but they really weren't

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
predictions but they really weren't
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.170
predictions but they really weren't
predictions they were extrapolations the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
predictions they were extrapolations the
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.060
predictions they were extrapolations the
reason I talked for two hours is not

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
reason I talked for two hours is not
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.279
reason I talked for two hours is not
because I was Fidel Castro and I was

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
because I was Fidel Castro and I was
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.700
because I was Fidel Castro and I was
giving a rally it's because I had 15

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
giving a rally it's because I had 15
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.090
giving a rally it's because I had 15
years of research stored up was about to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
years of research stored up was about to
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340
years of research stored up was about to
open the Media Lab and it was real easy

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
open the Media Lab and it was real easy
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.920
open the Media Lab and it was real easy
to talk about what we were going to do

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
to talk about what we were going to do
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.430
to talk about what we were going to do
and some of it even seemed old hat even

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
and some of it even seemed old hat even
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.110
and some of it even seemed old hat even
though in retrospect people thought oh

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
though in retrospect people thought oh
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.080
though in retrospect people thought oh
this is amazingly predictive 30 years

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
this is amazingly predictive 30 years
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.950
this is amazingly predictive 30 years
later they say make a prediction as if I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
later they say make a prediction as if I
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.240
later they say make a prediction as if I
had made predictions the first time

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
had made predictions the first time
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.090
had made predictions the first time
which I hadn't so this here actually did

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
which I hadn't so this here actually did
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880
which I hadn't so this here actually did
make a prediction and it is in the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
make a prediction and it is in the
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310
make a prediction and it is in the
prediction category in the sense that

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
prediction category in the sense that
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.170
prediction category in the sense that
it's not an extrapolation of work I've

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
it's not an extrapolation of work I've
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.960
it's not an extrapolation of work I've
been doing for 15 years but it's part of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
been doing for 15 years but it's part of
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270
been doing for 15 years but it's part of
work that some of my colleagues have

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
work that some of my colleagues have
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.960
work that some of my colleagues have
started at the Media Lab which is really

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970
started at the Media Lab which is really
 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.960
started at the Media Lab which is really
looking at the brain not just mapping

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
looking at the brain not just mapping
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.350
looking at the brain not just mapping
the brain but how do you interact with

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
the brain but how do you interact with
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.480
the brain but how do you interact with
the brain pretty directly and almost

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
the brain pretty directly and almost
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.179
the brain pretty directly and almost
everybody who's done that has done it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
everybody who's done that has done it
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.300
everybody who's done that has done it
from the outside you know with sticking

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
from the outside you know with sticking
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.440
from the outside you know with sticking
pins and needles or you know EEG or M eg

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
pins and needles or you know EEG or M eg
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.740
pins and needles or you know EEG or M eg
or other ways and the key to my

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
or other ways and the key to my
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.340
or other ways and the key to my
prediction is best way to interact with

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
prediction is best way to interact with
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.700
prediction is best way to interact with
the brain is from the inside from the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
the brain is from the inside from the
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.780
the brain is from the inside from the
bloodstream because if you inject tiny

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
bloodstream because if you inject tiny
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.710
bloodstream because if you inject tiny
robots into the bloodstream they can get

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
robots into the bloodstream they can get
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.060
robots into the bloodstream they can get
very close to all the cells and nerves

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
very close to all the cells and nerves
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.300
very close to all the cells and nerves
and things in your brain really close so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
and things in your brain really close so
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090
and things in your brain really close so
if you want to input information or read

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
if you want to input information or read
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950
if you want to input information or read
information you do it through the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
information you do it through the
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.499
information you do it through the
bloodstream so by extension and this is

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509
bloodstream so by extension and this is
 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.240
bloodstream so by extension and this is
you know by its predictions because it's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
you know by its predictions because it's
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.610
you know by its predictions because it's
by extension you could

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
by extension you could
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.089
by extension you could
theory load Shakespeare into your

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099
theory load Shakespeare into your
 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.440
theory load Shakespeare into your
bloodstream and as the little robots get

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
bloodstream and as the little robots get
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.210
bloodstream and as the little robots get
to the various parts of the brain and

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220
to the various parts of the brain and
 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.190
to the various parts of the brain and
they deposit little pieces of

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
they deposit little pieces of
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.380
they deposit little pieces of
Shakespeare or little pieces of French

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
Shakespeare or little pieces of French
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.030
Shakespeare or little pieces of French
if you want to learn how to speak French

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
if you want to learn how to speak French
 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.930
if you want to learn how to speak French
so in theory you can ingest information

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
so in theory you can ingest information
 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.460
so in theory you can ingest information
and that was my prediction I won't be

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470
and that was my prediction I won't be
 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.440
and that was my prediction I won't be
around to see whether it's true but you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450
around to see whether it's true but you
 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.289
around to see whether it's true but you
know like many of these predictions it

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299
know like many of these predictions it
 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.990
know like many of these predictions it
doesn't have to be true as long as it

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
doesn't have to be true as long as it
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970
doesn't have to be true as long as it
gets people thinking and there are

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
gets people thinking and there are
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.009
gets people thinking and there are
people thinking about this and looking

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019
people thinking about this and looking
 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.860
people thinking about this and looking
at it quite seriously and I think it's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
at it quite seriously and I think it's
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.610
at it quite seriously and I think it's
it's a area in in sort of synthetic

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
it's a area in in sort of synthetic
 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.069
it's a area in in sort of synthetic
biology and and sort of the interface

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079
biology and and sort of the interface
 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.099
biology and and sort of the interface
between biology and silicon that is

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109
between biology and silicon that is
 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.410
between biology and silicon that is
really what the future is about the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420
really what the future is about the
 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.000
really what the future is about the
digital world today is like plastics

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
digital world today is like plastics
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.360
digital world today is like plastics
were 25 years ago it's important field

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
were 25 years ago it's important field
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.619
were 25 years ago it's important field
but kind of over digital world is like

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629
but kind of over digital world is like
 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.400
but kind of over digital world is like
plastics and the biotech world is the is

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410
plastics and the biotech world is the is
 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.069
plastics and the biotech world is the is
the next phase
