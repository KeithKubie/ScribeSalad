00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.714
- Hi y'all man, my name
is Vandaveon Huggins.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.049 align:start size:97% position:3%
This my boy Mike right here.
- 'Sup.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.484 align:start size:84% position:16%
And, you know,
we're tryin' to make

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.219 align:start size:94% position:6%
like a little documentary
thing and what not.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.588 align:start size:97% position:3%
We really are liking
Bonnaroo, like we are enjoying

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:22.655 align:start size:75% position:25%
it and what not.
- Woo!

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.790
- But how could it be better,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.025
you know what I mean?

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.326 align:start size:84% position:16%
Y'all got any ideas
about how the festival

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.761
could be better, though?

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.029
- More chairs.
- More chairs.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.630
- More chairs and less rules.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.365 align:start size:81% position:19%
- And less rules?
- In reality.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.867
- More music, all the time.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.035
- More music all the time?

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.002
- All the time.
- All the time.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:36.970
- Hey, we got an idea.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.937
Tell us if you like this idea.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.140
We already floated this one.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.108 align:start size:94% position:6%
Sometimes bands be playin'
in different places.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.376
- Right.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.477 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And what if they all
play the same place

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.045 align:start size:81% position:19%
at the same time?
- Yes.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.012
- Right?

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.180
- Everyone together, woo!

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, everyone
together, give me a woo.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.416
- [Both] Woo!

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.650
- I love it, man, amen.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.951
And we saw that this
jar was makin' lemonade

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.353
and what not,

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.754 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I was thinkin'
sometimes what you wanna do

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:57.791
is put comedy up into
what you be doin'.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.160
Would you be willin'
to, you make a lemonade

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.495
and then go like
this and be like,

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.763
and then say,

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:04.964
"Oh, is that lemonade
or is that pee juice?"

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.433 align:start size:88% position:13%
See, and then it's like
a mystery for them,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.367
you know what I'm talkin' about?

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.334
- He bein' stupid right now.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:09.803
- Would that make it better?

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:10.470 align:start size:94% position:6%
You think that would make,
would that be better?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.671
- Not really.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.472 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Naw, you don't think so?
- No.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:13.406
- You know what I think?

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.607
Y'all got corn dogs, right?

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.376 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah.
- Giant corn dogs.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.677
- They giant corn dogs, man.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.579 align:start size:88% position:13%
- They should be
sellin' giant porn dogs.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.114
- See y'all, he said
y'all should be sellin'

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.482
giant porn dogs.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.017
See, see that's funny, isn't it?

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.719
And in the comedy you can put
the comedy inside the food,

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.887
you know what I'm talkin' about?

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:28.721
- Burning Man.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:29.556
- What's that?

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.757

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:31.991 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, like have a
burning man back there.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.426
Like a wicker man and

Or like a big pretzel,

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.097
- What about you burn his dick?

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.164
- You ask 'er.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.666
- And then burn its dick.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.201
Like set his little
wicker dick on fire.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.535
Like it'd be like

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.637

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.428 align:start size:97% position:3%

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:09.462

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.231
"Your dick gotta be this high

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.732 align:start size:84% position:16%
"to be on a ride."
- Ha, that'd be great.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.268 align:start size:81% position:19%

- I can't get on.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.436
- Get a ruler out.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.104 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, every
single person, man.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.539

Burning Man with the
