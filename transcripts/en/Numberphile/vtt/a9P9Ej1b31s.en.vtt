BRADY HARAN: I shall be
with you shortly.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.480
Thank you everyone.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.050
How are you all?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.910
My name's Brady Haran, and I
make the Numberphile videos.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.680
I also make several other
YouTube channels, which I

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.160
might talk about in a minute.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.720
I'm not going to be here
for very long.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.050
I guess this is kind of
a test run for me.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.750
I want to see how a few things
are working with the webcam

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.260
and lights and things
like that.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.800
I've been having all
sorts of problems.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.010
And I'm also having a new
computer delivered, so to show

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.920
you just how live this is, if
the door knocks, I'm going to

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.000
be out of here very quickly
because I missed the delivery

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420
yesterday and I don't want
to miss it again.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.930
The main reason I'm here is
I want to tell you about

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.680
something like this that I'm
going to be doing tomorrow at

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.340
around the same time.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.990
Except it won't be just me
sitting here, I'll be here

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.039
with Dr. James Grime, who's in
loads of Numberphile videos.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.890
And we're going to be doing a
bit of a live thing where I'm

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.460
going to ask him questions.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.250
But more to the point, I'm
hoping that you're going to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.770
ask him questions.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.970
So if you do nothing else,
please leave some comments

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.640
underneath this video with
questions for James and things

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.600
for us to talk about.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.450
Especially in case you can't
make it tomorrow, I'll read

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.580
your questions here in the
comments and try and make sure

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.430
we cover some of that stuff.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.150
Basically I just want to make
sure we've got something to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.280
talk about from the start, so
please leave any questions.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.880
I'll remind you again about the
James thing because that's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.340
the most important thing that I
want you to take from this.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.350
And we're going to be doing it
at 4:00 PM UK time, which is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.490
11:00 AM on the East Coast in
America, 8:00 AM on the West

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.270
Coast in the US, and 2:30 AM
if you are in Adelaide,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.060
Australia, where I'm from.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.350
I always like to give things
in Adelaide time as well.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.600
Shooting for that.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.810
In the meantime, you can ask me
any questions quickly now.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.290
I'm having a quick look at
some of your comments.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.666
There's lots of them basically
saying hello.

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:15.916
So, hello.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.790
Here we go.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.810
"Did you hear about a French
podcaster who talked about

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.690
you?" No, I didn't.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.250
"What do you think about
Russia?" I've never been to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.460
Russia, but I would like to go
for Periodic Videos because--

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.640
Periodic Videos is my chemistry
channel for people

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
who don't know about it--

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.950
the periodic table obviously
has its birth in Russia.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.540
So we do plan to go there
sometime and make some

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.790
Periodic Videos.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.050
People are asking me about
numbers and mathematics.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.150
That's probably not such a good
idea because I'm not a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.600
mathematician or
a math expert.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.820
Tomorrow James will be here,
that will be a good time to

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.010
ask some of those questions
perhaps.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.560
I'm asked which one
is James Grime.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.910
He's in the most Numberphile
videos.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.200
You can go back and have
a look who he is.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.450
He's really good value.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.360
"How many do you have?" How
many channels do I have, I

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.279
guess that means.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.110
I think there's about
12 channels.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.620
Numberphile, Deep Sky Videos
, Periodic Videos, Sixty

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.400
Symbols, Nottingham Science,
Bibledex, Words of The World ,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.570
Backstage Science, My Favourite
Scientists,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.100
Philosophy File, PsyFile, did
I say Words of the World?

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.400
"Hey Brady, greetings
from Spain."

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.010
So the last video I put
up was the one about

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.380
statistics in football.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.910
I live in the UK and I do call
football "football", although

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.060
I am from Australia, so I grew
up calling it soccer.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.870
I've had a lot of comments about
that, so I thought I'd

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.530
discuss that as well.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.050
A lot of people don't like
it when I call it soccer.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.930
And I don't know, I think it's
kind of the right thing to do.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.370
I said at the start of the
video, "It's football, but

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.450
some people call it soccer,"
and then I called it

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.860
soccer a few times.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.060
Soccer obviously being a
shortening of Association

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.840
Football apparently.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.330
And I think it's OK to call
it soccer in that context.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.760
I mean a lot of Numberphile
viewers are American and a lot

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.680
are Australian.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.540
And I think if I say soccer,
everyone knows what I'm

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.540
talking about.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.260
And if I start staying football
all the time, some

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.630
people don't.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.830
And they might get confused,
so I don't think there's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.810
anything wrong with a few
"soccer's" in there amongst

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.945
the "football"s.

00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:44.782
I know people feel passionately
about it.

00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:46.740
But there you go.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.000
And another thing I get asked a
lot about is the brown paper

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.940
in Numberphile videos,
so I thought I'd

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.220
quickly discuss that.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.260
I've written a blog
about this.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.230
My blog, if you ever want to
look it up, is called Periodic

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.290
Videos blogger or blogspot .

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.765
If you just google Periodic
Videos and blogger, you'll

00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:03.730
find my blog.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.430
And if you google Periodic
Videos and brown paper, you'll

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.460
find the blog that I
wrote about this.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.440
And I always point
people to it.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.300
But let me talk you quickly
through the brown paper.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.700
Basically when I started
Numberphile, I knew there was

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.080
going to be a lot of writing
involved from the people in

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.370
the films, the mathematicians
and

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.730
scientists and other guests.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.700
And I wanted to make that a
feature of the videos .

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.590
I considered blackboards, I
considered buying little

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.840
slates and chalkboards, because
I thought that might

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.670
be nice, but in the end I
thought that would be messy,

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.380
it wouldn't work very well.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.870
There are lots of reasons
it wouldn't work.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.060
When you wipe them out, they
look really messy unless you

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.050
clean them really nicely.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.540
And in the end I kind
of abandoned that.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.720
I hate whiteboards.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.400
They also look pretty mucky
when you rub them off.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.620
But also it's just, whiteboards
just remind me of

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.380
corporate conferences and school
and I don't really want

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.170
Numberphile to be like that.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.950
Obviously you could do something
with electronic

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.860
tablets and whatnot but I
thought that might be a little

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.480
bit Khan Academy.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.240
And I quite liked the
idea of brown paper.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.800
I didn't like the idea of
white paper because--

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.130
and this is another reason
whiteboards aren't too good--

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.500
a really white background is not
very good for filming when

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.930
you're filming people's faces
and the whiteboard.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.810
It becomes very difficult to
control certain aspects of the

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.480
picture while you're filming.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.050
Whereas brown paper is
a bit nicer for that.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.740
And I also just like the kind
of the rustic, rich,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.230
ruggedness of the brown paper,
that kind of back of an

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.180
envelope, napkin type
feel that I like

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.830
Numberphile to have.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.110
I like it to feel
very informal.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.200
And I also really like the idea
of being able to keep the

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.010
artifacts afterwards.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.910
Initially I was putting
them all onto Flickr.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.760
And I still put a lot
of them onto Flickr.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.360
If you look at the Numberphile
Flickr, you can go and look at

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.790
previous bits of paper
we've used.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.750
I will say lately I've started
putting a few of them on eBay

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.930
for various reasons, to either
raise money for charity or to

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.750
raise a bit of extra money for
some of the things we do with

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.870
Numberphile that cost money.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.120
I've got some here.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.160
Here's a whole bunch of brown
papers from some previous,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.650
some upcoming videos.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.780
So I've started keeping them.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.300
I used to throw them away after
they'd been scanned and

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.060
put onto Flickr.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.610
And now I realize that some
people quite like them and

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.640
would like to keep them.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.530
So I'm hanging on to
as many as I can.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.540
Occasionally I'll give one away
or put one on eBay for

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.920
some reason, so keep an eye out
for that kind of thing on

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.990
Twitter and Facebook
and whatnot.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.470
So anyway, there are
few other reasons I

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.000
quite like brown paper.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.380
I won't go into them all now.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.370
I know some people don't like
the noise of the markers on

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.620
the brown paper.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.150
And we've changed the markers
since the start, because the

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.070
first markers we used were
a bit of a mistake.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.370
And I also am trying
to do a bit more

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.620
with the sound editing.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.193
I'll have a look at more of your
comments for a moment.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.110
"Out of focus." That's
interesting.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.920
I am experimenting with the
camera and I'm having a few

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.530
problems with the lights as
well causing flicker.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.490
So if you want to leave
some more comments--

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.970
but any problems with the camera
at the moment, I'll be

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.520
looking back over this
video and trying to

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.360
sort out so, apologies.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.850
It's a bit of a learning
curve.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.100
You guys are helping me learn.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.250
"Are you sponsored by a brown
paper company?" No, but if you

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.730
know one, put them in touch.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.500
I'm being asked things about
Planck length and

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.510
the speed of light.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.010
And again that's one
for the people I

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.910
interview more than me.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:50.930
Sorry about the focus,
I'll work on that.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.750
Then again if you watch my
videos you're probably used to

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.190
things being out of
focus, aren't you?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.540
"What about a channel about
computer science?" That's

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.900
something that some thought
has been given to.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:17.480
"Australia has many things
called football." I do call it

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.030
football at home by the way.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.460
Or, home, now that
I live in the UK.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.170
"Greetings from Israel."
Hello, Israel.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.495
If you watch my Bibledex
channel, we actually went and

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:30.870
filmed a whole bunch of
videos in Israel.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.640
Which I really enjoyed.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.890
I really enjoyed it there.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.500
"How do you manage so many
channels?" I don't know.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.190
It's hard work.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.090
"What time will the stream
start tomorrow?"

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.350
I'm glad you asked.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.700
And again that's the point of
this whole video, that I'll be

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.660
here tomorrow with
James Grime.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.990
Hopefully more in focus
after I've played with

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.490
the camera some more.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.880
That's tomorrow, Valentine's
Day, yes I'm spending

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.120
Valentine's Day with James.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.430
We're also going to be making a
bunch of Numberphile videos

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.040
beforehand.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.030
And then we'll be doing this.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.720
So we might be able to tell
you about what we'd filmed

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.270
beforehand so you'll have
a bit of an exclusive.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.805
Tomorrow, Valentine's Day,
February 14, 2013.

00:11:16.805 --> 00:11:19.490
4:00 PM in the UK.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.500
You can do the math for
most other people.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.440
Notice I called it math there
for the Un-American viewers.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:30.480
That's 11 AM on the East Coast
in US, AM on the West Coast,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.880
and 2:30 AM in Adelaide.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.130
And a reminder, if you don't get
to watch live, you'll be

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.180
able to watch the recording
at your convenience.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.060
And also if you want to ask a
question, you can put the

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.610
question in this comment section
and I'll be reading

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.680
through this later on with my
hand over my eyes, judging by

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.550
some of the comments.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.180
And I'll take some of the
better comments and

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.880
interesting questions and throw
them around with James.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.570
I'll just refresh the comments
here from you guys.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.380
"I'm from India." Hello.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.010
We have also filmed in India.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.660
If you watch Periodic Videos,
the chemistry channel, we've

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.320
done a whole bunch of
films in India.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.750
"Have you ever been to Austria?"
My brother-in-law is

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.180
Austrian, and I have been
to Austria many times.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.230
And I've been to his home
village of San Johann in the

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:29.140
Tirol several times, where he
and my sister ski very well

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.160
and I ski very, very badly.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.240
"Can you please do more
Philosophy File videos?" I

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.990
bumped into the people from
philosophy just today and we

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.890
were discussing that.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:47.010
We'll try and get some more
soon, hopefully later in the

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.900
year, maybe.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.070
It just depends on time
and other factors.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.060
But I do enjoy doing the
philosophy ones.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.100
And stay subscribed to that
one, because there will be

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.350
more coming.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.720
My fish doesn't have a name.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.360
People who come obviously
call him Nemo because

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.680
he's a clown fish.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.280
But I haven't actually given
this one a name.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.825
But he is a very hardy,
very hardy fish.

00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:20.440
He endures a lot.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.060
Some people are saying
the focus is fine.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.540
I don't know, I did notice it
dropping in an out a bit, but

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.990
I'll go back and have a look.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.940
I'm trying my best, all
this technology.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.930
"Do I meet up with people at
Nottingham University with the

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.070
professors who you do the videos
with?" someone says.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.000
We have done one video which had
Professor Poliakoff, from

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.720
chemistry, Professor Merrifield,
who was in Deep

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.110
Sky Videos and Sixty Symbols,
Professor Moriarty, and

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.380
Professor Copeland.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.820
And I had the four of
them sitting there

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.070
like in a firing squad.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.680
And I think we did that on the
Periodic Videos channel or the

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.100
Sixty Symbols channel.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.660
I can't remember which, but
it wasn't that long ago.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.880
I'll put the link if I remember
in the description

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.000
for this video when this video
becomes an archived video.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.270
But you can go and
watch those guys.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.940
And we have got plans to do more
this year, which is half

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.110
the reason I'm sort of
testing this camera.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.560
My computer has arrived,
I think.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.810
I'll be right back.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.450
Here's part one.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.420
He's just gone back to his truck
to get the other part.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.170
I shall return.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.420
I'm very excited.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.770
There we go.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.652
You might be able to tell from
the box what it is, but I'm

00:17:19.652 --> 00:17:21.310
not going to discuss it because
I don't want to start

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.950
one of those conversations.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.455
I'm so sorry about that.

00:17:25.455 --> 00:17:28.560
Those are the joys of live
broadcasting, but I wasn't

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.875
going to miss that delivery
after missing it yesterday.

00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:36.180
I'll have a quick look
at more comments.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.300
For those who have just joined
us and were greeted by a blank

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.960
screen, I'm sorry, I was just
taking delivery of a computer

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.096
that I've been waiting
for for a few days.

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:50.800
This is a bit of a test run
that I've been doing--

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.220
sorry I'm a bit puffed
out now from

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.810
running after that computer--

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.100
this is a bit of a test run.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.240
We're doing a live hangout
tomorrow with Dr. James Grime.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.170
He'll be sitting here with me,
if you want to ask any

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.290
questions you can join
us tomorrow.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.430
You can put in some
questions now.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:14.270
Tomorrow, 14th of February,
4:00 PM UK time, 11:00 AM

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:19.390
Eastern US, 8:00 AM Western
US, 2:30 AM Adelaide time.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.640
I'm just going to update
the comments.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.120
"Putting comments here is like
dropping rubber ducks into a

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.400
fast flowing stream." I
know what you mean.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.427
"I like the Eiffel Tower." You
probably joined and were just

00:18:35.427 --> 00:18:37.270
looking at the Eiffel
Tower on the wall.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.570
Sorry about that.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:45.120
"He's getting a new computer."
"He's getting it from a

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.990
delivery guy." I'm truly
sorry about that.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.010
"Mac or PC?" Let's not go
there at the moment.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.460
"Mac or PC?"

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.890
"What you up to fish?" I did
leave you alone with the fish.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.940
I'm really sorry about that,
I'm just finding out if

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.560
there's anything else here
I can answer for you.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.880
"Where did you complete
school?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.350
England or Australia?" I
completed school in Australia.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.690
If you watch Periodic Videos, we
did a film where I actually

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.990
went back and met my Chemistry
and Physics teacher, called

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.890
Mr. Dinowski.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.770
That's a video you can watch.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.430
"Livestream the un-boxing." I'm
not going to do that, I'm

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.500
not even going to set up the
computer for a couple of days.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:34.030
I'm so worried and intimidated
by the idea of trying to get

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.740
my whole life from one computer
to another that you

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.990
wouldn't want to
watch it live.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.530
"Greetings from Finland."

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.380
I won't be doing an
un-boxing video.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.420
"Is zero an even number?" Now
I have said that I'm not a

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.700
mathematician, but I can tell
you that zero is an even

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.820
number, because we did
a video about that.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.180
I think I'm back at the
end of the comments.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.510
I think that's everything
for now.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.610
"Greetings from Germany.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.850
Do you speak German?" Nein.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.940
"Greetings." I like how everyone
puts greetings from

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.470
their country.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.150
"Do you have a pet?" Yes.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.200
I do have a pet.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:47.610
I have my fish, and I have
a dog that is not

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:48.500
very good at coming.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.170
Hang on.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:50.430
Lulu.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.845
Lulu.

00:20:51.845 --> 00:20:57.130
Come here, come here, come
here, come here.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.250
This is my pet.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.500
Come here.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.330
This is Lulu.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.980
She's a retired racing
greyhound.

00:21:08.595 --> 00:21:10.870
What's that?

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.370
She has appeared in several
videos for the

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.640
eagle-eyed among you.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.020
The first yahtzee video
she ate the number

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.270
Spaghetti at the end.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.090
Good girl.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.340
Good girl.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.230
"When is Phil coming back?

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.740
I'm seeing Professor
Moriarty on Friday.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.980
And we're planning to film some
Numberphile and Sixty

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.230
Symbols videos.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.225
Probably more Sixty Symbols ones
I think we have planned.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.670
Remember the main point of the
comments section here as well

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.024
is to, even if you watch this
later on and you're not

00:22:02.024 --> 00:22:05.260
watching it live, put some
comments for James tomorrow so

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.510
we've got something
to talk about.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.560
"Have you ever played
Minesweeper?

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.020
What are your best times?" I
have played Minesweeper quite

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.350
a long time ago and I can't
remember any of my times.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:27.640
"What was your favorite subject
in school?" I liked

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.250
maths and Physics
and Chemistry.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.210
But also liked English.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.850
I always wanted to
be a journalist.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.520
I always wanted to be newspaper
journalist and a

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.350
writer, so I also really
liked English.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.830
"How long have you been
interested in number facts?" I

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.650
think I've always been
interested in number facts.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:51.130
"What was your first job?" My
first job was a journalist for

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.141
a newspaper in Australia.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:02.700
"Are you ginger, strawberry
blond, or mouse brown?" You

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.950
can decide that one.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.310
"What are the specs for your
computer?" I can't even

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:21.125
remember, I ordered that
about a month ago.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.090
"Please make a video, talk to
the astronomers about the

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.970
Great Attractor." I think that's
something we will do

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.310
for Deep Sky Videos or Sixty
Symbols quite soon, because

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.390
I'm quite keen on the idea
of that one as well.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.160
"Greetings from Chile."
Where we might be

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.090
traveling later this year.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.930
"What did you do before these
videos?" I used to work for

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:51.110
the BBC as a video journalist
making films for the news.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.960
And before that I worked
in newspapers.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.780
"What got you into video
journalism?" I said I worked

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.470
for the BBC.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.440
When I first worked for the BBC,
I worked for the website

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.810
and I was doing lots of stories
and things for the

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.060
website that they quite liked.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.920
And they thought that I should
learn how to make films about

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.940
them as well so what I was doing
could also go onto the

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.440
news and television programs.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.000
So they taught me to be
a video journalist.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:28.205
"What is that golden orb behind
you?" I'll put it out

00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:29.730
just a little bit.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.120
It's actually a globe
of the moon.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.480
Like an Earth globe, except
its the moon.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:40.290
And it's like a vintage antique
one so it was made

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.610
before they knew what
the other side of

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.410
the moon looked like.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.260
Because obviously the moon
always has one face pointing

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.690
towards the Earth pretty much.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.750
And for a long time we didn't
know what the other side

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.780
looked like until we got
probes around there.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.510
So when you turn that globe
around, it's like

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.430
a map of the moon.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.350
You turn the back around and
there's a big blank area where

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.290
it was unknown.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.170
Which of course is very
well-known now.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.990
I'll do one more refresh
of these comments.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.680
248.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.920
"You should do a video with
Minute Physics." Well I have

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.560
done some videos with
Minute Physics.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.920
If you have a look at a video
I did on Sixty Symbols, I

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.210
actually interviewed Henry from
Minute Physics and talked

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.220
all about how he makes
his films.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:26.020
And Henry from Minute Physics
also appears in our favorite

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.460
number videos.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.035
"What football team do you go
for?" I actually support

00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:37.470
Liverpool for various reasons,
although I live about 10

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.390
minutes-- no, I don't I live
about a five minutes walk from

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.990
Nottingham Forest's
home ground.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.950
"Would you like to do a video
with V-Source?" I have done

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.010
some videos with V-Source.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.610
He has actually sat
in this very chair

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.760
in one of the videos.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.710
He's a very busy man but
he makes very good

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.960
videos, very popular.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.330
"What university did you go to?"
I went to the University

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.660
of South Australia in Adelaide,
where I'm from,

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.610
doing journalism.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.430
But I didn't finish the degree
because partway through the

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.135
degree I was offered a
cadet-ship at a newspaper I

00:26:17.135 --> 00:26:19.510
wanted to work for and
I took that job.

00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:27.850
"Have you been drunk
yesterday?

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.890
You look a bit hungover and
sleepy." No, this is just

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.990
unfortunately what
I look like.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.440
I always look a bit sleepy
because I don't sleep.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.690
I'm too busy making videos.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.150
"Are you aware of internet
cultures like Reddit, 4Chan?"

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:51.190
I'm aware of Reddit, I really
enjoy browsing Reddit.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.340
I'm aware of 4Chan, but it's
not one that I use.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.370
"What kind of fish are in your
tank?" It's a clown fish.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.600
There will be more videos coming
on my channel Foodskey

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.560
which has stopped for
quite a while, which

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.820
is about food science.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.690
But there's a few more
in the works, so keep

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.020
an eye out for that.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.180
I don't think I'll be starting
a yoga channel.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.940
Hello to everyone
in Lithuania.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:24.390
"Would you ever kill someone to
maximize your math skills?"

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.640
No, I wouldn't do that.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.960
"Do you spend more time in the
university--" and other places

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.410
I assume-- "filming, or at home
editing the videos?" More

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:40.890
time is spent on the editing
overall definitely.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:45.620
That's a more time consuming
activity.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.740
But sometimes when you're
going to film in other

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.690
countries, obviously, you spend
a lot of time traveling

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.170
and getting to the
things you film.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.730
When you do those sort of films,
then you spend less

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.410
time editing and more time
traveling and filming.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.250
"Where can I find Numberphile
merchandise like shirts and

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:05.580
stuff?" Funny you should say
that, because a friend of mine

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.160
runs a business making shirts
and things like that.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.370
And I've been talking
to him about--

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:14.510
I know a lot of YouTubers have
shirts and stuff like that and

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.260
it's something we're starting
to think about.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.290
So if you think it's something
you might be interested in

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.890
leave some comments and ideas of
things that you might like

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.500
and we might sort
something out.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.190
"Are you musical?" I am not.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.986
I have no musical ability.

00:28:34.986 --> 00:28:36.670
Well, I like some music,
I'm going out

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:37.920
to see a band tonight.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.490
"How long is this video
going to be?"

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.100
That's a good question.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.270
It's too long already
isn't it?

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.620
Especially with my little
interlude in the middle, which

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.180
I'm really sorry for.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.960
Thank you for everyone who
hung around despite that.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.760
There's a lot of comments now.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.220
"Have you ever thought
about setting up

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.690
Tumblrs?" Yes, I have.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.745
I should do that, I really like
the Tumblrs I've looked

00:29:15.745 --> 00:29:18.910
at and it's something
I haven't done yet.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.570
You've just reminded me that's
something I want to look into

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.870
doing with all that
spare time I have.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.750
Thank you for everyone
who is saying nice

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.220
things about the channels.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.230
And thank you for contributing,
everyone who's

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.890
not saying such nice things.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.490
"Do you have a list of all your
YouTube channels?" If you

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.416
go to my blog, which is called
Periodic Videos, so go to

00:29:49.416 --> 00:29:51.190
Periodic Videos blogger,
or Periodic

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.790
Videos blogspot on Google.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.040
On the right hand side of the
blog there's like a little

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.250
link saying, "Here's a link to
all my channels." And you can

00:29:59.250 --> 00:29:59.920
click on that.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.790
And when this video becomes an
archived video and it's not

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.990
live anymore, I'll go into the
description and put a list as

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.945
well for people who want to
check out other channels.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.770
Yes it is hard work,
running them all.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:22.130
"Greetings from the
Netherlands." Greetings back

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.560
to the Netherlands, and I'm
sorry about featuring the goal

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.770
that cost you the World Cup in
our last Numberphile video.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.320
A lot of people have said it
really hurt to see that and I

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.590
understand, I understand.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.630
"Do you know Minute Physics?"
Yes, I do know Minute Physics,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.505
as I've said before.

00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:44.810
He makes excellent videos,
of course.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.410
"Would you do an AMA, Ask Me
Anything, on Reddit?" I would,

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.205
but I don't think I'm
particularly famous enough, I

00:30:51.205 --> 00:30:53.305
don't think it would be
very well attended.

00:30:56.006 --> 00:30:58.530
I don't think it would
be a smash hit.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.830
"What software do you use?" I
edit on Avid Media Composer,

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.470
which I usually like.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.450
But I don't like when
it crashes.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.940
"What camera equipment?" My main
camera at the moment is a

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:18.140
Sony Z7, but I'm about to buy
another one, so any advice is

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.390
gratefully received.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.970
"Why do you have such a gorgeous
accent?" That's not a

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.250
question I've ever been
asked before.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:34.430
It's a hybrid Australian
and British accent.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:38.480
"Do you like Minecraft?"
I'm not a Minecrafter.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.480
But at Christmas it was shown to
me, and I'm very intrigued

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.545
by it and it looks like
something that, at a time in

00:31:45.545 --> 00:31:47.690
my life when I had time for sort
of games and activities

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.250
like that, I would have
really liked.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.660
I think it looks really cool.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.650
I can see why people
are really into it.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.470
And I actually have some
Minecraft ideas of things I'd

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.770
like to do with Numberphile
videos and things like that.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.180
"Brady, I saw your video
on sand--" which was on

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.430
Sixty Symbols --

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.940
"that person said you can get
work experience there.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.960
I can't find anything on the
website, can you help?"

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.020
Unfortunately I can't help,
because I don't actually know

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.440
where on the website
these are.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.550
I think I would just do what all
of you guys would do and

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.350
google and find things out.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:30.220
The guy who was in the video, a
guy called Steven Goldfarb,

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.820
has actually gone into the
comment section on that video,

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.015
which is one of the most recent
Sixty Symbols videos if

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:37.940
you haven't seen it, and he
wrote an answer to someone

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.080
else who asked that comment.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.860
And it had a lot to do
talking to people at

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.250
universities and things.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.660
So go and have a look in the
full comment section under

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.585
that video and some light may
be shed on the problem.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.270
"Do you own a different shirt?"
Yes, I do own a

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.520
different shirt.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:02.760
This is my favorite
shirt, though.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.350
It is clean, it's clean every
time I wear it, I promise.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.940
Yes, we will do a Numberphile
about imaginary numbers.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.910
"Where are you now?" I'm
in my office at home.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:25.850
"Have you ever shot a
gun?" Yes, I have.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.100
Hello, everyone in Poland.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.210
Someone said they missed
the first 17 minutes.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.210
You didn't miss much, you mostly
missed me going and

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.300
picking up a computer
from the front door.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.580
But at the end of this video,
when I shut it all down, I

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.930
think YouTube will process it
and do whatever happens, and

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.270
then it will become live
and you can enjoy that.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.660
Someone says they'd like to see
more Bibledex, which is

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.230
something I don't
often see on my

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.990
mathematics and science videos.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:00.200
And actually I filmed some
Bibledex stuff today, because

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.870
of the news with the
Pope resigning.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.850
I thought it was a good
opportunity to go and ask some

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:10.860
of the theology experts and
academics and religion experts

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.980
about what the Pope's all about,
and what they think

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.350
about the resignation.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.790
And hopefully I'll be popping
something onto the Bibledex

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.050
channel soon because obviously
I don't do many videos for

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:22.321
that anymore, now that we've
done a video about every book

00:34:22.321 --> 00:34:23.571
of the Bible.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.870
Some of these questions I don't
understand and I'm not

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.345
going to read them, because
they're probably some joke I

00:34:34.345 --> 00:34:38.389
don't get, and I'm going to
make a fool of myself.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:41.389
"Are you on Facebook?" Well
Numberphile is on Facebook, as

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.850
is a lot of my channels.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.969
Usually in the video
descriptions I include

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.739
Facebook addresses if you want
to go and follow there.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:51.960
And I do put extra stuff on
Facebook that you won't find

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.409
in the video so much.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:03.880
"How do you get to do videos
with the people at Opta?" You

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.100
ring up and you ask.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.290
And sometimes people say yes,
and sometimes they say no.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.810
But you never know
until you ask.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:17.240
"Did you attend Nottingham?"
No, I did not.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.430
I do a lot of work with the
University of Nottingham, but

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.750
I grew up in Australia, very
far away from Nottingham.

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.460
"I'd love to see you do a video
with Vihart." I have

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.000
done a couple of collaborations

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.230
of a sort with Vihart.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:40.630
I was in her video about number
two, and she made a

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.410
video for me about
tetrahedral dice.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.580
And she's also in my favorite
number videos.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.770
And hopefully maybe we'll do
some other things sometime.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.590
I do talk to her occasionally.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.920
She's obviously a busy
lady as well.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.660
"What does C.G.P. Grey look
like?" You know I

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.910
can't answer that.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:12.770
"What do you usually eat?"

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:16.380
"Do people recognize you?"
Not incredibly often, but

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.895
occasionally it happens, usually
at strange times.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.740
I'm not going to give you
a walk around my house.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.020
"Are you interested in hiring
an editor so that you have

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.620
more free time?"
I do need help.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.496
"Do you like Twitter?"
It's OK, I waste a

00:36:41.496 --> 00:36:43.330
lot of time on Twitter.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.790
You can follow me on Twitter
@PeriodicVidoes or

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:51.560
@Numberphile, depending on which
aspect of my personality

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.970
you wish to follow.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:56.780
"Will you be present in the live
chat tomorrow?" Yes, I

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.470
probably will be.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.550
I'll be with James, trying to
make sure it all goes smoothly

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:03.620
and asking him questions if
you guys don't ask enough.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.560
Somehow I think you will ask
enough, though, judging by the

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.830
response today.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.020
So a reminder, for those who've
just joined us, for the

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:16.840
final time, tomorrow,
Valentine's Day, February 14,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.130
I'll be here again.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:21.380
This time it won't just be me
waffling and reading my screen

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.510
and picking up a computer
from the front door.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.810
I'll be here with Dr. James
Grime, who's the guy that's in

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.120
the most Numberphile
videos of anyone.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.080
And we'll be talking
about whatever you

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.040
want us to talk about.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.540
Leave some suggestions here
under this video, or just come

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.060
back tomorrow.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.460
It will be at 4:00 PM UK time,
11:00 AM if you're on the East

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:47.120
Coast in the US, 8:00 AM on the
West Coast in the US, and

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.970
2:30 AM if you are from
Adelaide, Australia.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.380
I don't know.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.030
I could do this all day,
but I guess we have to

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.420
stop at some stage.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.820
Thank you very much for everyone
who has put questions

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.500
and comments, good and bad.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.580
This has been interesting
and fun for me.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.555
I don't know what it's been
like for you because I can

00:38:09.555 --> 00:38:11.040
only see what you write.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.100
But if these things go well, and
you guys show an interest,

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.010
we'll try and do more of
them, because it's fun.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.680
And I like you to see people
as unedited as possible.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.480
That's why I make my videos the
way I do, and you can't

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.630
see us more unedited
than live.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:29.100
It's been fun.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.300
Thank you very much.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.550
Cheers.
