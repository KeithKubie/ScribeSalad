00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.930
These alien worlds, about 40 light-years away
from Earth, are believed to be the most likely

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.080
place for biological life beyond our solar
system.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.840
TRAPPIST-1 is a dwarf star with at least seven
exoplanets orbiting around it.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.460
The full system was discovered in 2017, and
it marked a monumental milestone for astrophysics,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.360
because at the time, it was the greatest number
of Earth-like planets

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.440
ever found around a single star.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.169
We now know more about this planetary system
than any other beyond our own, and it could

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.820
help us understand the potential for other
life in our universe.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.400
Astronomers first discovered TRAPPIST-1 in 1999.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.190
They classified it as an ultra-cool dwarf
star, which means its temperature is low enough

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.559
that liquid water could likely survive on
planets orbiting very close to it.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.309
Over a decade later, scientists discovered
the star was host to three exoplanets using

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.560
the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small
Telescope aka TRAPPIST.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.460
And then, after about a year, NASA's Spitzer
Space Telescope helped reveal even more exoplanets.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.600
Scientists realized that the TRAPPIST-1 system
also set a new record for the greatest number

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.440
of planets in the so-called habitable zone.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.820
Experts say that almost every normal star
has a habitable zone, which is the range of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.240
distance from its star where temperatures
are right for water to remain liquid.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.860
Four of the seven TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets are
in this zone.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.880
Well, technically the jury's still out on
where planet d lies, which is an indication

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.140
of just how new this discovery is.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.900
The Hubble Space Telescope conducted
a spectroscopic survey to learn more about

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.240
the habitability of the planets.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.860
It revealed that planets d, e and f don't
seem to have

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.420
puffy, hydrogen-rich atmospheres like gas giants.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.439
This is good news in the search for life because
hydrogen is a greenhouse gas and can make

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.360
planets orbiting close to their parent star
too hot and thus inhospitable.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.440
Planets d, e and f instead appear to have
atmospheres

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.440
similar to terrestrial or rocky planets.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.200
So far, scientists consider planet e to be
the most Earth-like in terms of its estimated

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.740
radius, mass and the amount of radiation that
it receives from its host star, and they believe,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.640
of all the planets, it's the most likely to
have liquid water on its surface.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.480
That's not to say the other TRAPPIST-1 planets
are devoid of water.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.020
In fact, researchers found that some of the
planets could have as much as

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.520
250 times more water than Earth.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.240
But too much water may be a bad thing.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.040
Planets with too much water likely don't have
any land and thus lack important geochemical

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.440
or elemental cycles necessary for sustaining
complex organisms.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.720
The thing is, the TRAPPIST-1 system is such
a fresh discovery

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.200
and there is still so much we have to learn.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.420
Astronomers are looking to the upcoming James
Webb Space Telescope

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.480
to help better understand these alien worlds.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.180
Unlike Spitzer, Hubble and Kepler, the Webb
telescope has extended wavelength coverage

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.260
that will be able to detect atmospheric properties
of the planets with greater precision.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.380
But the new telescope won't begin its cosmic
journey until the 2020s, so in the meantime,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.440
astronomers will have to get creative to uncover
more about TRAPPIST-1's life harboring potential.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.740
