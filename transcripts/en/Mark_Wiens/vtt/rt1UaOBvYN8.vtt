00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:01.983
- Oh, look at all that skin!

00:00:01.983 --> 00:00:04.316
(crunching)

00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:09.955
You know how I always tell
you that I love to eat salty

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:11.953
instead of sweet things?

00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:13.870
Now I know exactly why.

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:16.687
It's in my DNA!

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:20.187
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:25.471
I just received the testing
kit from 23andMe in the mail.

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:29.260
First, you have to register
your kit online, then spit,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.967
and then discover, you gotta
wait for your DNA results.

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:33.662
The first instruction, though,

00:00:33.662 --> 00:00:36.175
is that no food or drink for 30 minutes.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:37.995
Okay, I think I need to
wait about 15 minutes

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:39.051
until I do this.

00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:41.139
Alright, here it goes.

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:42.389
Close this lid.

00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:47.003
Grab this lid, screw this on tight,

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.827
put it into this little
bag that they provide you,

00:00:49.827 --> 00:00:51.679
peel this back, seal your bag,

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.577
and you just ship it back to the lab,

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:55.268
and you'll get your results,

00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:59.198
your DNA test results pretty soon online.

00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:01.203
I just received an email from 23andMe

00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:03.527
saying that my DNA reports are ready.

00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:05.215
And before I share them with you,

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:06.710
I wanna just make it clear that this video

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.836
is sponsored and paid for by 23andMe,

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.644
and they're making this possible,

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:13.378
but it's a real honor to be invited

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:14.295
to take part in this.

00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:17.103
Probably the top question
that I always get asked,

00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:21.050
both online, and even in person,
is, "Where are you from?"

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.390
And I'm sure you can relate to this too,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.704
I think it's one of the
things we always wanna know

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:26.247
about another person.

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:29.792
And up until this point, I
was born in the United States,

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:33.372
my mother is Chinese, her parents,

00:01:33.372 --> 00:01:37.262
my grandfather came from China to the US,

00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:40.276
and then my father is Caucasian,

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:41.874
and I've just sort of thought

00:01:41.874 --> 00:01:46.492
that he has always come from
the Germany-Austria region,

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:48.624
but I'm not totally sure, and that's

00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:50.226
all that I've known so far.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:53.768
So as soon as we open my DNA report,

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:55.831
I'm gonna be able to share with you

00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.038
exactly where I'm from.

00:01:58.038 --> 00:01:59.215
And on that note, I think I need

00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:00.587
a quick sip of tea.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.914
Recently, I've been really
getting into matcha.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.550
(upbeat electronic music)

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.493
Okay, let's check out my report.

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:09.410
Whoa, okay!

00:02:10.492 --> 00:02:11.948
The first figure that I see,

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:13.669
remember how I told you
that I'm 1/2 Chinese,

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.351
or how I've told everybody
so far in my life,

00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:17.692
that I'm 1/2 Chinese?

00:02:17.692 --> 00:02:22.226
The first number that I see
here is that I'm 44.4% Chinese.

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:24.627
So I really am almost
1/2 Chinese, but then,

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:26.370
there's a full breakdown if you click

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.620
on your full ancestry composition, and,

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:35.150
oh wow, I was like almost,
I kinda was exactly 1/2,

00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:40.199
I kinda am exactly 1/2
Chinese and 1/2 European,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.901
French, German, oh, but
there's a little bit

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:47.804
of Southeast Asian, British and Irish,

00:02:47.804 --> 00:02:50.721
Scandinavian, and Eastern European.

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:54.564
Wow.

00:02:54.564 --> 00:02:57.403
It says that most likely, you had

00:02:57.403 --> 00:02:59.964
a second great-grandparent,
third great-grandparent,

00:02:59.964 --> 00:03:02.501
fourth great-grandparent,
or fifth great-grandparent

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.240
was 100% French or German.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.407
So it says, East Asian and
Native American, I'm 51.3%.

00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:12.017
Exactly.

00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:14.684
And then European is 48.7%.

00:03:15.847 --> 00:03:19.516
Whoa, so I really am
like exactly 1/2 Asian,

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:22.553
well, almost exactly 1/2
Asian, and 1/2 European!

00:03:22.553 --> 00:03:26.399
But then what's also
cool is that there is,

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.955
there's a few food-related tests.

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:32.510
Caffeine consumption,
likely to consume more.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.312
I do love my coffee and my tea, so much.

00:03:35.312 --> 00:03:37.174
And when somebody asks me
what I don't like to eat,

00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:38.698
I usually don't like sweets,

00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:40.062
I'm not a big fan of sweets,

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:42.567
but I do love salty food and salty snacks,

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:44.879
and so, this says it exactly right here,

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.304
it says that I'm likely to
prefer salty or savory snacks,

00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:50.594
71% of the time.

00:03:50.594 --> 00:03:51.969
My taste exactly!

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.534
I've only been scrolling
through the information

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:55.592
for a few minutes now, but already,

00:03:55.592 --> 00:03:57.122
I'm getting so into the information,

00:03:57.122 --> 00:04:00.489
because it's so interesting
to learn more about yourself,

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.427
and 23andMe is offering a
special promotion right now,

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:07.677
I'll leave the link in my description box

00:04:07.677 --> 00:04:10.126
so you can click on the link
to check out all the details.

00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:14.373
You have a chance to win a
trip to a place of your choice

00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:15.762
from your ancestry.

00:04:15.762 --> 00:04:19.412
Link is in the description
box, so check that out,

00:04:19.412 --> 00:04:22.252
and as for me, I'm also traveling too!

00:04:22.252 --> 00:04:24.060
Traveling for some food,
so I need to decide

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.137
where I'm gonna go.

00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:27.476
I'm gonna head back to my ancestry report,

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.725
I'm gonna break it down
by specific destination,

00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:33.237
and choose a certain place
that's in my ancestry,

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:35.896
and then I'm gonna travel
to that destination to eat.

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:39.396
(upbeat electronic music)

00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:49.401
Micah!

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.967
(pilot speaking over intercom)

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.157
Bye-bye, thank you!

00:05:04.157 --> 00:05:06.607
- Bye!
- Hey, welcome to Germany,

00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:09.837
this is my first time, and
I am excited to be here.

00:05:09.837 --> 00:05:11.601
Micah, we made it to Munich!

00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.851
Your first time in Germany!

00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:18.725
And both Micah and I have
some German ancestry.

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:23.333
The weather here is fantastic!

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:39.863
From the airport, we
checked into the place

00:05:39.863 --> 00:05:42.146
that we're staying, which is
an apartment that we rented,

00:05:42.146 --> 00:05:45.415
and now we are out walking around.

00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:47.283
But I am just, I'm already loving it,

00:05:47.283 --> 00:05:49.684
I love how peaceful and calm and organized

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:53.101
it is here in Germany, and it's so quiet,

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:58.097
even the roads and the streets
and the traffic is quiet.

00:05:58.097 --> 00:05:59.690
We're walking towards
the center of Munich,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.756
an area called Marienplatz,

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:04.183
and that's kind of a public square,

00:06:04.183 --> 00:06:08.100
and I cannot wait to have
my first German meal.

00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:20.126
It's really, really nice in Munich,

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:21.690
and it's all pedestrian-friendly,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.342
it's all, lots and lots
of people here today,

00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:26.477
there are cafes and
restaurants, and shops,

00:06:26.477 --> 00:06:30.310
and we're on our way to
go eat the first meal.

00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:34.229
- Hi, my name is Shosu Takaya,

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.505
just ran into Mark Wiens,

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:39.922
and I hope he has a great time in Munich.

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:43.651
- We're walking down a side street

00:06:43.651 --> 00:06:45.663
a little bit away from
the hustle and bustle,

00:06:45.663 --> 00:06:48.556
it is just action-packed
in the square today.

00:06:48.556 --> 00:06:51.559
And we're walking over
to a restaurant to eat at

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:53.553
that many of you recommended,

00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:57.720
they are famous for a very
well-known Bavarian dish,

00:06:58.564 --> 00:07:01.683
and my mouth is watering
thinking about it.

00:07:01.683 --> 00:07:05.348
And this place is known for
their roasted pork knuckle,

00:07:05.348 --> 00:07:08.060
and actually, I haven't even gone inside,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.838
but you can just see them roasting,

00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:12.432
slow roasting, slow revolving over the,

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.370
there's charcoal going,
you can see the hot coals,

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.415
and you can just see that
skin and those juices

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:21.925
from that pork knuckle, just
slowly bubbling and juicing,

00:07:21.925 --> 00:07:26.806
and I got this like, almost
a asana sensation aroma

00:07:26.806 --> 00:07:30.546
of pork steam, just
coming from this window

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:31.764
as I walk past here.

00:07:31.764 --> 00:07:33.465
Three adults and one baby.

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:34.715
Yes, thank you.

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.992
Perfect.

00:07:36.992 --> 00:07:39.075
Yeah, perfect, thank you.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.436
(chuckling)

00:07:42.436 --> 00:07:44.378
He's just brought out the platter--

00:07:44.378 --> 00:07:46.572
- [Waiter] Small, the biggest.

00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:50.323
(traditional Bavarian music)

00:07:50.323 --> 00:07:52.072
- You can come back here to watch them,

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:54.530
where they're roasting the pork knuckles.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.447
This is where your pork
dreams will come alive.

00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:20.415
The amount of pork knuckles that they have

00:08:20.415 --> 00:08:22.752
slow roasting there is impressive.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.085
At first, you only see
the one from outside,

00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:27.003
and even that looks like a lot,

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:28.656
but then you come inside,
you look in the kitchen,

00:08:28.656 --> 00:08:31.485
and you can see just
stacks of pork knuckles,

00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:36.461
and you can see that crackling,
crispy, ultra-crunchy skin.

00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:37.294
Thank you.

00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:42.662
When you see those knuckles up there,

00:08:42.662 --> 00:08:45.192
there's absolutely no way
you're not gonna order

00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:46.779
an entire knuckle.

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:51.250
That is just golden
crispy, absolute beautiful,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.436
and you can see the bubbling of the skin,

00:08:54.436 --> 00:08:57.612
it's just bubbled up, and it
looks ridiculously crunchy,

00:08:57.612 --> 00:09:01.064
and you can just see that
kind of fatty, oozing meat

00:09:01.064 --> 00:09:03.565
underneath there, look
at the size of that bone!

00:09:03.565 --> 00:09:06.732
I have to begin with the bone section.

00:09:08.034 --> 00:09:10.023
Oh, look at how much meat is on there!

00:09:10.023 --> 00:09:12.843
Oh, I'm just gonna pick
this up like a drumstick.

00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:15.740
Okay, that is cut into giant pieces,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.703
but that is still a giant bone.

00:09:18.703 --> 00:09:20.539
I'm gonna reach in for this.

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:21.724
Oh, that's an entire piece.

00:09:21.724 --> 00:09:23.531
Oh, come close up, look at that!

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:25.423
That is where the skin meets meat,

00:09:25.423 --> 00:09:27.011
and all of that, all of that,

00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:28.275
oh yeah, that's fatty.

00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:32.220
Okay, I'm gonna start with
this piece right here.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.553
(crunching)

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.292
Oh wow.

00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:45.168
That is awesomely good.

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.543
That skin is just ridiculously crispy.

00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:51.876
And then the meat is tender, it's moist,

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.579
and you have that creamy
fatty layer as well.

00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:59.912
The trio of those different
textures is sensational.

00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:03.830
It's salty, you can taste that
slow-roasted flavor in it,

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.728
just embedded into both
the skin and the meat.

00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:09.895
Oh, look at all that skin!

00:10:14.452 --> 00:10:15.426
Very good.

00:10:15.426 --> 00:10:19.333
(man speaking German)

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:20.645
Amazing.

00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:22.228
Amazing, thank you.

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:27.159
Oh, that was a fatty bite.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:30.255
That skin is just ridiculous.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.382
Bubbly pig skin.

00:10:31.382 --> 00:10:33.880
Another dish I ordered
is a plate of sausages,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.797
there's six sausages over
a pile of sauerkraut.

00:10:39.883 --> 00:10:43.133
This is the vegetable dish of the meal.

00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:46.807
Oh yes.

00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:48.330
I think these are the white sausages,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.163
I'm gonna get some of the sausage,

00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:54.563
dig out some of that sauerkraut.

00:10:54.563 --> 00:10:55.730
Oh, wonderful.

00:11:00.356 --> 00:11:01.189
Mm!

00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:02.985
Mm!

00:11:05.193 --> 00:11:07.302
Oh, it's been a very, very long time

00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:08.718
since I've had sauerkraut.

00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:12.143
I have had it before, and
sometimes at my grandma's house,

00:11:12.143 --> 00:11:14.840
but that is some amazing sauerkraut,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.491
it is really nice and juicy,

00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:20.719
and you can taste some
herbs in there as well,

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:24.308
and then the sausage has a nice
light herbal flavor as well.

00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:25.771
The only thing that can make it better,

00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:28.451
actually, hold on, I almost forgot.

00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:31.701
We got a huge jar of mustard over here.

00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:34.434
And I do love mustard.

00:11:38.235 --> 00:11:39.068
Alright.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.780
Okay, back to that bite.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.613
Mustard.

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:45.076
Sauerkraut.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.283
Mm!

00:11:54.439 --> 00:11:56.819
It must be the German in
me that loves mustard,

00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:59.208
but I've loved mustard
ever since I've been a kid.

00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:03.294
And these are some kind
of potato, potato balls?

00:12:03.294 --> 00:12:05.831
I'm not really totally sure.

00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.809
I'll break one open so we
can all see what's inside.

00:12:08.809 --> 00:12:12.637
Whoa, that's kinda like
rubbery, it kinda bounces back!

00:12:12.637 --> 00:12:14.827
You stick your spoon in
it, it kinda bounces back!

00:12:14.827 --> 00:12:16.964
And, oh, feel kinda sticky,

00:12:16.964 --> 00:12:20.631
and then they're submerged
in a gravy sauce.

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:26.259
Oh, you almost need a
knife to break them apart.

00:12:32.578 --> 00:12:35.049
In my mouth, I can taste potato,

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:38.183
but then in my mind, I'm
almost kinda thinking noodle,

00:12:38.183 --> 00:12:41.386
because it has kind of a sticky,

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.288
almost like a ball of noodles,

00:12:43.288 --> 00:12:45.692
like if you took noodles
and made them into a ball,

00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:48.015
that's sort of the texture that it is.

00:12:48.015 --> 00:12:52.652
But this is a very typical
German, Bavarian dish, side dish,

00:12:52.652 --> 00:12:56.621
potato dumplings, and then
that's kind of a salty,

00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:59.845
mostly like a salty gravy sauce

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.099
that it's submerged in.

00:13:01.099 --> 00:13:02.601
The mustard just takes
it to the next level,

00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:06.684
I think it will be fantastic
on the pork as well.

00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:09.012
Mm.

00:13:09.012 --> 00:13:09.845
Yeah.

00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:12.161
We have reached the end of this meal,

00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:16.821
I just saved one more final
bite to share with you, but,

00:13:16.821 --> 00:13:19.336
whoa, that was a lot of meat.

00:13:19.336 --> 00:13:22.321
Managed to clean the entire bone,

00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:24.585
and there were three of us eating,

00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:27.316
me, my wife, and my wife's sister,

00:13:27.316 --> 00:13:29.435
but they did not give me that much help.

00:13:29.435 --> 00:13:31.822
That was a lot of meat.

00:13:31.822 --> 00:13:33.597
Okay, my final bite.

00:13:33.597 --> 00:13:36.798
My final bite I saved to
share with you is this,

00:13:36.798 --> 00:13:41.175
this, like crinkly piece
of skin, look at that,

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:42.133
and actually, I'm just gonna go

00:13:42.133 --> 00:13:45.139
straight on with some mustard.

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:46.230
Come on.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.063
Boom.

00:13:47.063 --> 00:13:49.396
Okay, there's my final bite.

00:13:52.757 --> 00:13:56.924
(crunching)
(chuckling)

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.934
That's so crispy.

00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:03.570
You have to be careful that
it doesn't cut your gums.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.249
I would be lying to you if I didn't say

00:14:05.249 --> 00:14:07.381
I felt like a little
bit sluggish right now,

00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:10.837
partly due to the jet lag,
and just arriving this morning

00:14:10.837 --> 00:14:12.133
and not sleeping last night,

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:15.448
and partly due to that
massive pork knuckle.

00:14:15.448 --> 00:14:17.781
But wow, that was delicious.

00:14:18.982 --> 00:14:20.604
I'm to that point where if I sat down

00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:21.774
for more than two minutes,

00:14:21.774 --> 00:14:23.944
I would just fall into a deep sleep.

00:14:23.944 --> 00:14:27.447
We're gonna keep on walking
around to keep myself awake,

00:14:27.447 --> 00:14:31.371
and that was my first
meal ever in Germany.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.871
(upbeat electronic music)

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:40.403
One of the things I'm
also just loving so far

00:14:40.403 --> 00:14:44.126
since being in Munich is
the color of the blue sky,

00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:46.100
and the clouds, I'm not sure if we're here

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.956
just on a lucky day today,

00:14:47.956 --> 00:14:52.461
but the contrast of the
really deep blue sky,

00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:55.333
with the really white
clouds, and the puffy clouds,

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:59.000
and the architecture,
it's beautiful to see.

00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:06.882
We walked around for about an hour,

00:15:06.882 --> 00:15:10.050
and we just walked over
to this beer garden,

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.452
and there was no way I
could come to, what's up?

00:15:14.452 --> 00:15:17.484
Without, on my first
day coming to a famous

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:18.936
German beer garden.

00:15:18.936 --> 00:15:23.704
And wow, this place is huge,
it's really nice, under trees,

00:15:23.704 --> 00:15:25.906
there are just lots and lots of tables,

00:15:25.906 --> 00:15:28.734
people are hanging out, having fun,

00:15:28.734 --> 00:15:31.224
really a social, friendly atmosphere,

00:15:31.224 --> 00:15:34.474
and gotta find a place to sit down now.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.743
This is just a gigantic area,

00:15:40.743 --> 00:15:42.629
there are so many seats here,

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:44.859
and there's one section
I think on the other side

00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:47.507
where we came in where it's
more of a sit-down restaurant

00:15:47.507 --> 00:15:49.072
where you can be waited on,

00:15:49.072 --> 00:15:51.219
but then over on this side of the park,

00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:53.824
it's a self-service, kinda like a,

00:15:53.824 --> 00:15:57.095
oh, they have all sorts of
things, all sorts of food,

00:15:57.095 --> 00:15:59.375
and of course, lots and lots of beer,

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.047
but this is the self-service walkthrough,

00:16:02.047 --> 00:16:03.790
almost like cafeteria-style,
you walk through,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.184
you get what you want,
and then you just find

00:16:06.184 --> 00:16:08.842
a picnic table somewhere under the trees.

00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:13.140
It's beautiful though, the
weather is perfect, it's shady.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.728
This is a perfect way to
spend the afternoon in Munich.

00:16:15.728 --> 00:16:19.478
(traditional Bavarian music)

00:16:29.192 --> 00:16:30.025
Oh man.

00:16:32.722 --> 00:16:33.555
- 14.50.

00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:38.362
- They do not take beer
lightly in Germany.

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:40.862
Look at the size of this beer!

00:16:42.487 --> 00:16:45.070
You could lift weights
with this, it's so heavy.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.244
And I got one gigantic super-sized beer,

00:16:48.244 --> 00:16:51.846
and one gigantic super-sized pretzel.

00:16:51.846 --> 00:16:53.699
Look at the combination of this!

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:57.866
Yeah, I gotta take a sip
of this beer immediately.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.587
Wow, that is incredibly refreshing.

00:17:09.922 --> 00:17:11.306
Tear into this.

00:17:11.306 --> 00:17:14.913
Oh, and it kinda collapses,
you can feel how crusty it is,

00:17:14.913 --> 00:17:18.580
but how soft and fluffy
it is on the inside.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.163
Mm.

00:17:25.561 --> 00:17:26.741
Oh, that is amazing!

00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:30.040
So nice and salty, and
then, it's really crusty

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.921
around the edges, and
slightly gooey on the inside.

00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:35.504
Oh, it's wonderful.

00:17:39.777 --> 00:17:41.130
Wow!

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.772
I love the outdoors, I
love eating outdoors,

00:17:42.772 --> 00:17:43.861
I love sitting outdoors.

00:17:43.861 --> 00:17:45.828
This is just a perfect environment,

00:17:45.828 --> 00:17:48.911
and some of the areas over
there are really, really loud,

00:17:48.911 --> 00:17:51.937
and people are cheering and cheersing,

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:54.198
this area over here is
more kinda calm and quiet,

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.030
and relaxing.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.780
(traditional Bavarian music)

00:18:00.803 --> 00:18:03.319
I've never felt so
German in my entire life.

00:18:03.319 --> 00:18:06.454
Have never been so German, ever
been to Germany in my life,

00:18:06.454 --> 00:18:10.621
this is my first time in
Germany, this is awesome!

00:18:17.587 --> 00:18:19.299
It's been a really, really long day,

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:21.918
I'm starting to get into
that kind of blurry stage

00:18:21.918 --> 00:18:23.656
that I didn't sleep last night,

00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:26.181
and then been out walking
around and eating all day,

00:18:26.181 --> 00:18:27.767
or maybe that's from my pork knuckle

00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:29.490
that's making me a little blurry.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.107
But anyway, it's been a fantastic day,

00:18:32.107 --> 00:18:35.271
first day in Germany, this is
my first-ever trip to Germany,

00:18:35.271 --> 00:18:39.438
and I always knew that my
dad had roots in Germany,

00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:42.707
or somewhere around this region of Europe,

00:18:42.707 --> 00:18:44.996
but then being able to take the DNA test,

00:18:44.996 --> 00:18:48.749
and knowing for certain that
I had ancestry in Germany,

00:18:48.749 --> 00:18:51.227
this region, and then
being able to travel here,

00:18:51.227 --> 00:18:54.436
it's really been special, and
I've just been thinking about

00:18:54.436 --> 00:18:57.986
that I have ancestry and
relatives and history

00:18:57.986 --> 00:18:59.364
here in Germany.

00:18:59.364 --> 00:19:02.499
And yeah, that's really
cool, that gives you

00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:04.681
a different kind of
perspective when you travel,

00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:06.683
so I wanna say a big thank you to 23andMe

00:19:06.683 --> 00:19:10.850
