[Applause]

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.090
&gt;&gt; Randall Macon: I'm kind of a nervous presenter
so I tend to walk around a lot. So I apologize

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:25.310
if it gets distracting. Am I on? Sounds like
it. [adjusting mic] How's that? Is that better?

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.140
Oh, there we go. Excellent. How are you guys
doing?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.140
&gt;&gt; Audience: Good.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.480
&gt;&gt; Randall: Excellent. I got my clicker thing
here. So I was working on this presentation.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.989
It was actually an interesting little exercise
for me. I was telling Dave that the program

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.620
that we have -- one of the exercises is you
have to give a life giving speech. And so

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.510
I said, you know, what? I need to eat my little
dog food a little bit if I'm going to be the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.180
CEO of this organization. I should start doing
some of the exercises I'm expecting our customers

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.480
to do. And so, this is what I'll refer to
as a minimum viable presentation. If it's

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.150
a little bit bumpy. If it doesn't completely
click, then you guys can ask me questions

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.431
at the end and we'll fill in gaps. The thing
I wanted to talk about today is a question

00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:23.550
that's really core to a lot of what we focus
on with the company and also a lot of what's

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.890
important to me. And it's a really simple
question. And it seems like, "Hey, I can answer

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.960
that question." What do I really want? And
it's interesting. What I'm gonna do is use

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.190
my story, my journey what I've gone through
as a bit of a framework to think about what

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.940
is it you really want. And hopefully this
is an opportunity for you to be thinking about

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.710
that in a different way. And thinking about
that in a way that will get you further than

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.110
where you are whether it's here at Google
or some place else. I think as part of the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.970
invitation there's also a optional exercise
that's called eulogy and epitaph. How many

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.910
of you guys got a chance to read that. One,
two. Okay, you guys get called on just so

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.739
you know. [laughter] So let's start out with
this interesting quote. It says "as for those

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.000
considering taking the time some day to plan
their final weeks and months, three words

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.780
of advice, Move it up." Now this was a gentleman
-- anybody recognize that quote first of all?

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.569
Sound familiar? It's a guy named Eugene O'Kelly.
Ringing any bells yet? No, not yet? Well,

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:52.249
he's actually the CEO of KPMG. Was at KPMG
for 30 years. And is an award winning author.

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:59.579
And why that is a compelling statement or
quote is that he actually wrote that in a

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.739
book called Chasing Daylight. He found out
he had basically three months to live. Had

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.340
brain cancer. And he wrote a book about what
it was that was really important. And so,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.790
what I wanted as we go through this, I want
to try and give that same kind of context.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.739
Because what's really powerful for him, yet
at the same time really unfortunate for him

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.739
was, he gained a lot of clarity and focus
and a real sense of urgency at the end of

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.389
his life. And it was interesting -- I was
reading an article about Steve Jobs' book

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:44.950
just came out. And he was -- the person who
wrote it said that the reason that Steve Jobs

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.599
wanted to write the book was because he wanted
to tell his children why he wasn't there.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.540
And that becomes a really -- for me becomes
a really poignant question. Because I have

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.569
a two and a five-year-old. And it's also really
important because are you going to wait till

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.730
the last 100 days and look at it and say,
"okay. Now I'm going to cram everything that

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.519
I really wanted into that last 100 days? Or
are you going to start doing things now that

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:22.850
will empower you to think about what it is
you really want. So when I was graduated from

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:31.810
college in 93. So I was getting the tour from
Veronica and she was walking around talking

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.820
about old school music. I [chuckles] was kind
of sad to realize I'm now old school. [laughter]

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.900
Slightly depressing. But I try to get my street
cred up by naming rappers that were a little

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:55.090
unknown. Guru. Anyone a Guru fan? Nice. Nice.
It's how my wife and I met actually. But it's

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.370
interesting. When I got out of college, I
wasn't really sure what it was that I wanted.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.010
But it was a lot about me. And so, what I
thought that I wanted -- it's not me. This

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.300
is actually a friend of mine. A really close
friend of mine. John Sore and Mack Dog. Probably

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.060
one of my best friends in the world. We lived
together for awhile. We were rock climbers

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:26.750
and we had a really amazing time going on
trips together. Rock climbers? Yes. You all

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.850
get called on, too. But at that point when
I was asking that question what do I really

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.150
want? What I wanted was to go hang out with
John and Mack Dog. I wanted to go climbing.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.280
I wanted to figure out how I could have more
fun in my life. And so, I was part-time rock

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.960
climber and part-time start up guy. Not starting
things up but working in startups because

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.640
apparently those were the only people who
were going to let let me go rock climb part-time

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:01.270
and get paid some amount of money. And when
I say startup, keep in mind at that time it

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:09.131
was a dial up, start up. We were offering
14.4 dial up service when you could actually

00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:15.060
do that. It was weird. But that was a part
of my life that was -- it was really important

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:24.190
to me. John, as amazing as he is, he moved
away. He moved to Seattle and ultimately to

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.820
New Zealand. And he's doing amazing things
at Weta Studios where he's doing animation

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.460
design for King Kong and I, Robot and doing
amazing things. And I had to ask myself that

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:43.340
question again, "what is it that I really
want?" And I had to reevaluate that. And at

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.993
that time, my now wife and girlfriend, we
were thinking about it and we were saying,

00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:55.790
"okay, what is it we want?" Our friends, the
lifestyle we thought we were building is not

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.680
there anymore. So how do we go about figuring
that out again. And so, at that time, that

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.370
was in the late 90s. I was like, "I have an
idea." I've been in start-ups. I'm going to

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.570
find a start up and I'm going to get some
of that IPO money. I'm gonna figure that out.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.200
My plan was get rich and go rock climbing.
That was my grand plan. Very, very thorough,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.060
deep thought -- thinking that I was doing.
At that moment in time. And I had actually

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.870
planned it all out. I was going to find a
company. They were actually going to build

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.770
a company that their whole exit strategy was
they were going to get bought out by somebody

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.670
really soon so I only had to work really hard
for a couple years then I'd get some of that

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:39.360
IPO money. Well, that didn't really work out.
I did end up working for an Internet consultancy

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:46.350
that I won't name. And I kind of had an IPO.
It's more in the form of a severance package

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:52.800
and they asked me to leave. [laughter] But
I got a little bit of money. It wasn't anything

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.710
I was going to retire on. Kind of made me
pause and say hey I got a little opportunity

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:08.450
and a little space. What is it I really want?
That question over and over. You emphasize

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:14.170
each word differently. You say "what do you
really want? What do I really want? What do

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:21.260
I really want? What do I really want?" Start
flipping those phrases over and over and it

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.330
starts meaning something different, depending
on where you are in your life. But, if you

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.390
don't start asking yourself that question,
then it becomes very difficult to even get

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:37.640
on track. And what I find myself doing even
at this point, I'm just kind of meandering.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.150
I thought I was going to be climbing a lot.
I thought, at this point, I'd have all the

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:50.180
money I needed; wanted. I wouldn't have to
worry about it. It wasn't what I really wanted.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:58.200
About that time, after I was offered my own
personal IPO, the severance package, the Lance

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:04.420
Armstrong Foundation was in its early stages
and there I think ten employees at the Lance

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.860
Armstrong Foundation. It was out of a house.
I happen to know was introduced because some

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:17.009
of the board members of the Internet consultancy
I was at were also board members on the Lance

00:09:17.009 --> 00:09:24.029
Armstrong Foundation. So I had a bit of an
"in." And it was also the topic of cancer

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:27.990
was something that was pretty important for
me and my family. Because my mother-in-law

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:35.310
had been -- is is a cancer survivor. She had
breast cancer; last year had bladder cancer.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:40.399
Hopefully when I -- I didn't tell her I was
going to do this so hopefully when she sees

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:45.420
this on YouTube, she won't be too annoyed
with me. But she's an amazing woman and she

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:53.110
does some amazing things. She's very much
an inspiration for me. So cancer was important

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:59.990
not only because of her but my grandfather,
my grandmother, my aunt, all passed away because

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:07.180
of cancer. And so, this was like, "hey", that
question, "what do I really want?" It's like

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.220
I want to make an impact. I want to have an
opportunity to e able to impact people's lives.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:18.250
And so, I think that was a really a big part
of what was motivating. It was motivating

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.459
me to say, "what is it that I can do that's
going to have an impact?" Didn't have a lot

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:27.170
of clarity around that. Didn't really have
a lot of urgency. And the thing that happened

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:33.449
with LiveStrong, even though we put a lot
of effort into it, it was something that was

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:42.209
really meaningful. At the end of the day,
I did a quick search on Google images and

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:49.920
this is what I found when I typed in LiveStrong.
And at first it kind of made me sad, because

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.870
I was looking at it and it was like, "you
know, it's awesome that they raised all this

00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:00.620
money. They have this amazing database of
millions of potential people who can be advocates

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:07.959
on their behalf. And it started and I was
like, "man, was all that just about merchandising?

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:15.639
Did I just kind of throw myself at something
just so I could say that I was a participant

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:19.680
in something like that?" Then I started kind
of digging through my own files and also digging

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.370
online a little bit and I couldn't find this
image, but I did find this particular image

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:32.269
which, there's a story that goes with this
that's pretty powerful. Not this guy in particular,

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:39.579
but what -- in the early days of when we were
selling wristbands and it got really crazy

00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:44.180
where we were selling 100,000 wristbands.
It seemed like we were paying more attention

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.870
to whether or not we could get OS Commerce
to actually handle the load or whether or

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:56.269
not it was about the people who we were supposedly
doing this for. And this guy sent in a picture.

00:11:56.269 --> 00:12:04.259
And he, in these gang Gothic letters, put
LiveStrong across his back. Similar to what

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:12.519
this guy did. And it made me stop and I was
like, "that's why I did it." I did it because

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:18.949
this gives somebody an opportunity to express
a perspective that they have and allows them

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:26.759
to connect. There's another interesting story
that at, one point I was -- this was back

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:31.329
in like 2004 -- I was at an airport and very
few people knew what the yellow wristband

00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:35.480
was. And quite honestly we were looking at
it and going -- Nike had come to us and said,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.879
"we're going to make these 5 million wristbands
and sell them." And we're like, "Sure, that

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:48.559
seemed like a ridiculous idea." But when I
was in an airport, there were two people in

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:52.269
that airport who were wearing wristbands who
didn't know each other. Then they came and

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:58.970
started talking to one another. Then they
started sharing their own stories. They provided

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:06.129
that opportunity for connection. And that
to me was like, "that's something that I really

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:10.889
want. I want to see something like that. I
want to have that ability to affect that kind

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:17.249
of change." Not necessarily change but affect
that kind of relationship and connection in

00:13:17.249 --> 00:13:26.110
people's lives. And that worked out for awhile.
But then I kind of got antsy. Tell my wife.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.500
She agrees. We go on these two year cycles
where it's like" hey yeah this is great" to

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.079
"not satisfied". Gotta kind of figure it out.
Had to ask that question again what is it

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:43.480
that I really want? Well, by this time I had
had my daughter, Lila, who my father refers

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:53.240
to as Lila the amazing. And my son who is
the antithesis. His name is Boon. But he refuses

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:59.449
to use only Boon and he's just Boon Macon.
And my favorite story -- this is actually

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:03.519
just going to turn into a story about family.
But my favorite story is he got pushed in

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:08.829
school. He's two years old. He got pushed
in school and he turned around and looked

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:17.980
at the kid and got dead panned serious, "Don't
push Boone Macon." [laughter] So apparently

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.990
they wanted to make T-shirts out of it that
said "Don't Push Boone Macon." [laughter]

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:30.029
He's turned into Napoleon Dynamite at age
2. [laughter] The the point of that was these

00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:34.899
people are enormously important to me. My
family is enormously important to me and I

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:41.730
have to stop and ask that question what do
I really want? What is it I want. More importantly

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:50.320
how is that going to impact my children. And
I have a tendency to think way over the horizon.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.089
I started to ask that question, what's the
world going to be like in 20 years for them?

00:14:55.089 --> 00:15:03.790
Is it going to look like it looks today? I
don't know. So this is an important question.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:10.230
And since not everybody got a chance to go
through and do eulogy and epitaph exercise.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:15.709
I want to do this exercise. I want everybody
to just close your eyes for a second. We're

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:20.090
just going to go through this and I'm going
to talk through a couple of thing. But I want

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:28.240
you to fast forward into the future a little
bit. And visualize that you're at a church

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:35.449
or you're at a cemetery. It looks like your
friends and family are gathered. You take

00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:45.980
a closer look. It's actually your own funeral.
The question that I should ask yourself is,

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:56.300
"who steps forward?" Who's the first person
to speak? Is it your wife? Your girlfriend?

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:06.920
Your parents? Your children? What is it they're
going to say about you? What is it that you

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:18.769
want them to say? Now, hold on to that. Come
back just a little bit. When you're there,

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:34.579
you might have seen a grave stone. Might have
had your epitaph on it. What did you see?

00:16:34.579 --> 00:16:40.589
You can open your eyes. I want to hear from
you guys. What did you see? Be completely

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:57.949
honest. Lived fully, loved openly. Who else?
I'll call on people. People who raised their

00:16:57.949 --> 00:17:19.360
hand said that they got it. I'll call on you.
Who else? One more. C'mon. One more. [pause]

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:41.919
Awesome [laughing] Who had trouble seeing
anything? Yeah. Why do you think that is?

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:51.169
No sense of urgency? No sense of "hey, I've
got to pay attention to this?" It's an important

00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:58.120
question to ask yourself. You have to stop
and think whether you are 55 or whether you're

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:06.960
20, what are people going to say about you?
Got to just -- it's a basic question that,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.420
if you don't ask those kinds of questions
of yourself and they're simple questions,

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:19.100
but they're hard. They're really hard questions.
That's what's going to give you the power.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:25.490
One of the things that we talk about at our
new venture is that we're about building the

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:31.549
individual before we build the business. And
that's one of the fundamental questions you've

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:37.179
got to ask yourself. What is it that you really
want? And doing an exercise like that brings

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:43.600
it into focus. You just sit down take an hour
or so to ask that kind of profound question

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:52.940
about where it is your life's going to be.
And it sounds morbid. But it's also deeply

00:18:52.940 --> 00:19:03.480
freeing. So I did this exercise. And one of
the things that I read to my children. And

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:09.880
let's see if I can actually get it to work
out for me. But Oh the Places You'll Go. I

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.090
don't have it all here, but starts out with
congratulations. Today is your day. You're

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.590
off to great places. You're off in a way.
You have brains in your head. You have shoes

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:25.720
in your feet. And I can't see the rest. Hopefully
you get the gist of it. Is that you've got

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:32.450
an opportunity. You've got a grand journey
ahead of you. And asking that question, "what

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:40.250
do you really want?" Emphasizing those words.
I ask that question right after I left LiveStrong.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:46.850
And I spent probably about two years trying
to explore some kind of way that I could shape

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:52.190
the future for my children. What is it going
to look like in 20 years and started talking

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:57.540
to as many people as I could talk to. And
I started thinking through all these ideas

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:03.510
of how we can create this social impact. And
how you can create this fancy ecosystem of

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:10.070
conscious consumers and social entrepreneurs.
And, you know, social venture capitalists

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:15.740
who are going to come together, "hey, this
is going to be a utopia." And it was ambitious

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:24.779
and probably substantially naīve. But I did
that. And it's the thinking of that that then

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:32.389
led me to a couple of folks who I met. Actually
friend of mine Ed Perry who then introduced

00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:38.370
me to another guy, Jeff Sandefer. You guys
don't know Jeff, he is the founder of the

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:43.320
Acton Foundation for Entrepreneurial Excellence
here in Austin. They have the Acton MBA program

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.120
which if you haven't seen it you should check
it out. It's an amazing program. That's where

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.100
we spun off of. But as I was talking to these
guys and I was showing them this. They were

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.270
just kind of looking at me and being really
polite to me at the same time [chuckles] and

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:03.430
just kind of shaking their heads. My question
was like where am I going to fit in? I've

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:09.490
got this big grandiose. I've gone through
thinking what I want. How am I going to get

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:16.710
started? Where is that first step? And for
me, that first step actually became -- came

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:23.580
with thinking about the individual. And I
started thinking about it and this idea of

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.150
entrepreneurship -- not necessarily social
entrepreneurship, because that has a lot of

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:35.500
people fixated on what that means and trying
to define entrepreneurship. For me it started

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.970
looking like how can I start impacting the
lives of people who are entrepreneurs who

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:47.350
are going to be entrepreneurs and what is
it I could do to provide them something that's

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:52.419
going to accelerate where it is they're going
to be. They're not going to kind of meander

00:21:52.419 --> 00:22:00.799
around. And as Jeff put it, they're not going
to make the same kind of mistakes. And so,

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:05.630
it starts with the individual. Building the
individual before building the business. And

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.790
then, the framework that we use and we think
about -- it's based on a framework that's

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:17.241
in the MBA program called a Life of Meaning.
And it's starting with the individual. What

00:22:17.241 --> 00:22:25.039
is it that you really want? Then layering
in what are the people around you. So if you

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:31.700
think about on a day-to-day basis, who are
the people around you that are really most

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:39.440
important? And how do you do things to support
and empower one another? And then, finally,

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.549
how are you going to start creating some action
around that? What are those milestones? What

00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:49.500
we do is we actually set it up so our program
goes through and you talk to people. This

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.880
is not a sales pitch. It's a good exercise
to start talking to people who are ten, 20,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.630
30, 40 years older than you. Start trying
to understand where are they? What regrets

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.282
did they have? What did they do well? And
what is it that you want to do and where do

00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:11.010
you want to be? Just asking yourself that
question, "who am I going to interview?" When

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.549
I started doing that, that's a hard question.
Because then I started saying, "I want to

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:19.450
interview this guy. I don't want to interview
that guy 'cause he's not in the industry.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:29.389
Or I'll interview this guy but not that guy"
But you got to start. Time's precious. You

00:23:29.389 --> 00:23:36.549
got to make sure that you don't waste the
opportunity you have. And you guys -- I mean,

00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:48.820
obviously working at Google, you're enormously
intelligent individuals. Don't waste the time.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:55.580
Ask yourself, "what is it that you really
want?" If you can ask yourself that fundamental

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:05.289
question, you start moving down the path of
getting to where you really want to be. So

00:24:05.289 --> 00:24:12.701
apparently we've got questions. Oh, that was
a cheering ending wasn't it? [laughter] So

00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:13.701
thanks.

00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:21.400
&gt;&gt;Male Interviewer: Ooh, this is really loud.
Lower this. Better.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.320
&gt;&gt; Randall: Oh, we're sitting in chairs.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Sure.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.440
&gt;&gt; Randall: Are you Oprah or Phil Donahue.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.039
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Neither. You haven't my bank
account.

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:36.090
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Okay, so if you still want
to submit questions on the DORY, it's go slash

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:57.330
Randall. We have some great questions here
so far. I can pull them up. [pause] Okay.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:04.150
What are the top five mistakes that an entrepreneur
makes.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:15.830
&gt;&gt; Randall: Top one? Not asking questions.
I think that that sounds my presentation solved

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:21.710
the question. I think it's a lot about trying
to figure out where you're going to be and

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:28.899
how you're going to get there. Making sure,
that if money is what you want, that's fine.

00:25:28.899 --> 00:25:35.010
But be honest with yourself that's what you
want. But try and think about what are the

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:41.130
things I want to do. Where do I want to be
in my life. If you can start connecting what

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:48.909
you are passionate about. The idea of identifying
what's your calling. What is it that your

00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:55.550
unique gifts are that you do better than anybody
else? Most passionate about. Then what's that

00:25:55.550 --> 00:26:01.889
need in the world that you could fulfill?
If you could figure that, that's still. But

00:26:01.889 --> 00:26:07.350
if you could figure the intersection of those,
that's something that becomes I think pretty

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:13.880
powerful. And you start being able to then
move forward in very deliberate way as opposed

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:21.789
to being driven by what investors say or what
employees say. And you start trying to give

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:24.190
yourself some kind of a compass that allows
you .

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:31.160
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: I do want to open it up because
I'm sure people have thought of questions.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.100
But the next question is a good segue. That's
great, fine and dandy; you've figured out

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:42.700
what you want. But, what if, the window has
passed. So what about us old folks who are

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:49.570
old school and you have mortgages to pay and
children to feed. I can't just take that risk

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:55.359
and follow my dream. What advice would you
give then.

00:26:55.359 --> 00:27:04.630
&gt;&gt; Randall: It goes back to just kind of explore.
I'm 40. So I qualify for the old school record

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:15.140
collection. And it's -- I don't think that
it's ever late. I mean, my dad who was Southern

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:22.120
Baptist preacher and now is an entrepreneur
himself. The cycle that he went through is,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:30.679
he was in the military. He went and became
a preacher. They he went to a start up. Then

00:27:30.679 --> 00:27:35.930
he went to Fidelity Investments. And he's
got his own thing that he started five, ten

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:43.460
years ago. I don't think it's ever too late.
I think it's about making sure where it is

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:50.190
that you want to be. If you can identify that,
then I don't think it's ever too late.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:55.909
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Any questions in the audience?

00:27:55.909 --> 00:28:04.681
&gt;&gt;Male#1: If you use this mic, the we can
get it on the YouTube channel.

00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:07.759
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Thanks. Are the kind of some of
the answers that you're figuring out now could

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:12.429
you come up to those answers without those
experiences you had as a 20 year old rock

00:28:12.429 --> 00:28:15.970
climbing? Is that something, that if you had
asked those questions earlier, you would have

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.200
come to a different place?

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.830
&gt;&gt; Randall: Yeah, that's a good question.
I don't know. I think that when I look at

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:27.250
this -- because there are questions that are
still really valuable and important to me

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:34.520
as well. But I think it's about the intentionality.
Part of what our mission is that we really

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:42.100
want to inspire, equip, and connect purposeful
and passionate entrepreneurs. And you know,

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.120
I think you can get there. I mean, there's
tons of examples of people who have gotten

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.950
there without the questions. And it's not
like the questions are rocket science. But

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:56.669
it's a matter of just sitting down and having
a habit of asking yourself those questions.

00:28:56.669 --> 00:29:02.950
And that becomes enormously valuable in and
of itself. Especially if you start asking

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:08.809
yourself those questions in connection with
other people that are either essential business

00:29:08.809 --> 00:29:13.649
partners or close friends. You start thinking
about the quality that those relationships

00:29:13.649 --> 00:29:20.370
start to change. And you start kind of asking
yourself the questions that maybe don't have

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:28.490
-- there isn't a real sense of urgency around
them. I mean, not everybody is Eugene O'Kelly.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:36.029
But if you start spending some of that time,
it provides at least an accelerant. As one

00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:41.259
of the guys who went through our program was
actually telling Dave, and I use because he's

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:48.470
our shining rock star. But he just opened
up a business down in Westgate that it's called

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:56.570
TreeHouse. You guys go check it out. Evan.
That's like free advertising here. But he

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:02.509
went through the program. This guy -- Rick
is smart. I look up to him in a lot of ways.

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:07.789
He was doing M and A, mergers and acquisitions,
at Citibank and he decided he was going to

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:12.559
go start something up. While he was raising
his series A, he decided to go through our

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:17.320
program because somebody recommended it. And
the way he described it was rocket fuel. And

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:23.330
I think that that's -- that's the way you've
got to view it. Whether it's our program or

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:27.899
something else. You got to ask yourself, "where's
that rocket fuel?" Where am I going to find

00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:40.860
that material that's going to allow me to
get there faster and sooner. Does that answer

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.299
your question.

00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:47.840
&gt;&gt; Female #1: What happens when you figure
out what you really want to do but it conflicts

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.759
what your friends and family want for you.
Do you pursue that and do you sacrifice those

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:54.759
relationships.

00:30:54.759 --> 00:31:06.590
&gt;&gt; Randall: Wow. [laughing] I don't know.
That's a personal question. I think that you've

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:14.350
got to -- you've got to ask them -- those
folks -- what is it that they really want

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:23.049
for you. And if that's something that you're
passionate about -- I don't know. That's a

00:31:23.049 --> 00:31:31.419
tough one. I've had the luxury of having highly
supportive people. But I think that it may

00:31:31.419 --> 00:31:37.039
be a question of can you go and start seeing,
are there other people who share that same

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:45.389
kind of passion. And are there ways of cultivating
those kinds of relationships so that you can

00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:52.889
really ferret that out. And, you know, understand
why is it that they don't want? Is it -- like,

00:31:52.889 --> 00:31:57.139
my person who heads up my product department
decided to go to Kenya for the next two weeks.

00:31:57.139 --> 00:32:06.220
Why is she going to do that? But it's a passion
of hers. I didn't want her to do that, but

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:17.410
it's something that she needed to do. All
cross our fingers she doesn't get killed.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.410
Did that answer your question? Sorry.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:22.220
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: I said something earlier.
I'm going to kind of mix something you said

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220
with the question here. You said something
earlier about asking someone five years older

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:29.090
than you. Ten years older than you; twenty
years older, to see what they think. And I've

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:35.850
heard something similar to that where when
you were five, you're left to your own devices,

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.760
you will surely kill yourself. And ten years
later when you're 15, you ask yourself were

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.610
you an idiot when you were five, you say,
yes. But reality is at least half of the students

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:50.080
who make it to 15 the rest probably end up
killing themselves. 25 year, your target rate

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.789
gets a little better. But when you ask yourself
when you're 25 if you were an idiot when you

00:32:54.789 --> 00:33:03.499
were 15. The answer is yes. So when you're
45, 55-year-old says "you're an idiot now".

00:33:03.499 --> 00:33:09.010
&gt;&gt; Randall: [laughter] That's my operating
assumption on every. I don't have the answers.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.010
That's a qualifier.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:14.580
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: If you can look back on the
questions. What's been the most difficult

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.590
thing you learned throughout the time being
in your own start up. And the question I'd

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:23.409
add to that what do you think you're doing
now that might be a mistake.

00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:33.730
&gt;&gt; Randall: Oh. I think that -- wow, when
I look back at the things that -- and the

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:40.360
startups that I worked at. I think there were
a lot of people who were really focused on

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:46.080
getting rich. And there is absolutely nothing
wrong with making money. Please, do not ever

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.389
interpret it that I think you should go into
poverty [chuckles] in order to really find

00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:58.570
out what you want. But it ends up driving
a lot of decisions. Especially when you get

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:04.010
into a situation where, you know, when I was
working at a company that was public and it

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:11.520
was during the Internet start up. The decisions
became more about how do you make those quarterly

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:19.629
numbers and less about what's the long-term
value. And so, those decisions get truncated

00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:23.809
and a lot of times they start making -- and
I'm guilty of this as well -- start making

00:34:23.809 --> 00:34:30.319
decisions that are good for what's going to
happen in the next month but horrible for

00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:36.620
what you're going to be doing in two, five,
ten years from now. And that's a big mistake.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:42.800
I think the mistake in terms of what we're
doing right now is, I don't think you can

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:50.580
ever get enough of talking to your customers.
I think the thing that we're probably haven't

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:59.240
done an effective job yet is really understanding
them. The deep passionate needs of what our

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.809
customers want. I think we've got a little
bit and we've got people who are excited about

00:35:03.809 --> 00:35:08.240
it, but we've got to have more. We've got
to connect with people. So if anybody wants

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.930
to participate with any research effort, I'll
sign you up.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:21.680
&gt;&gt; Male #3: So what did you learn from working
with a guy like Lance Armstrong? And why did

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.200
you leave LiveStrong? I heard it's doing really
well.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:37.480
&gt;&gt; Randall: I think one of the biggest values
of working with and around somebody like Lance

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:49.000
as well as a lot of the other folks at LiveStrong
is that there's a constant sense of dissatisfaction.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.690
That you aren't doing enough, you can do more.
And that constantly pushes the boundaries.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:59.570
And it's nice to have that. And also, in that
kind of business, there is a sense of urgency

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:13.320
because it is about people's lives. That becomes
poignant. I think the reason that I left the

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.319
LAF was I think it was more about when I started
asking myself the question, "what kind of

00:36:18.319 --> 00:36:27.500
impact can I have?" And "am I able to still
contribute and make that impact at LiveStrong?"

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:32.290
Or "had I kind of contributed what I was going
to contribute?" And I think I contributed

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:40.050
what I was going to contribute to that. Could
I have stayed there longer? Probably. Could

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.780
I have done some other interesting things?
Without a doubt. But I think the stuff I'm

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:51.119
doing now energizes me as much if not more
to think about what is it that I can do to

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:56.540
impact and bring what I saw as urgency in
individuals who were cancer survivors, -- urgency

00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:04.180
they had in their lives and try and kind of
create that urgency for individuals who are

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:12.000
entrepreneurs or becoming entrepreneurs. That
gets me up in the morning. Hey, 20 years from

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:20.470
now am I potentially going to be planting
a seed that my children are going to be able

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:27.049
to benefit from. That's what's driving me
more than anything.

00:37:27.049 --> 00:37:38.300
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Okay. So I know a lot of us
here are recently college graduates. And some

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:43.020
people are further into their careers. But
if you were were where we are sitting now,

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:49.940
what would be the strongest advice you would
wish when you were here someone would give

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:50.940
you.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.920
&gt;&gt; Randall: First of all, you're probably
light years ahead of where I was [chuckles]at

00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:03.410
that point, because I was rock climbing. [laughter]
For people who know, rock climbers -- they're

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:13.869
not the most ambitious folks. Really fun to
hang out with. But that's a big question.

00:38:13.869 --> 00:38:25.440
What's the biggest piece of advice? I think
it's don't be afraid to make mistakes. Take

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:31.559
risks. I was talking about my father and the
best piece of advice he's ever given me was

00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:40.080
'life's forgiving'. And he's proof positive
of that. He restarted what he was doing in

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:49.430
his life so many times and he's doing great.
He loves what he's doing. And he's got a lot

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:56.220
to show for that. But it was being able to
take those risks. And I think you've got to

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:04.230
sit down and assess along with that is a question
of how well you can deal with ambiguity. You

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:09.579
probably deal with ambiguity a lot better
when you're younger. But I'm trying to understand

00:39:09.579 --> 00:39:13.619
how comfortable are you being in a place where
nobody's telling you what you should be doing.

00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:21.680
You've got to figure it out. And getting to
that point comfort with that kind of ambiguity.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:27.030
Then I think you become, whether you're at
Google or you're somewhere starting your own,

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:31.150
you become a lot more powerful and focused
however you can make it in life. Whatever

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.150
it is.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:37.460
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Let's take a question on DORY
and then go back to the audience. You mentioned

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:43.820
something I really liked earlier. Building
the individual before you build business.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:51.680
And so, this question is similar to that.
It says, "what attributes do you look for

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.520
in a partner? What're your feelings about
partnership versus going solo?"

00:39:54.520 --> 00:40:00.359
&gt;&gt; Randall: Partnerships versus going solo.
It's funny. I actually asked that question

00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:08.480
of somebody yesterday I was meeting with.
He said -- it becomes a question of -- with

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:15.380
a partnership how -- so part of what we do
is, when we're going out we try to identify

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.099
potential customers. we have kind of the direct
to consumer but then we're also partnering

00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:25.050
with universities. And part of what we're
asking ourselves is do they share that philosophy?

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:31.020
If they don't care about the individual and
they don't really care about building that

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:37.119
individual, then that's probably not a good
partnership. And so, as long as it's something

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:43.670
that allows us to stay focused on what our
mission is and really creating those passionate

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:49.720
and purposeful entrepreneurs, then I think
we're more than open to that. But, if it's

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:58.869
not, then we have to probably take a pass.
And we've passed -- we've actually fired customers

00:40:58.869 --> 00:41:06.180
because of that. It's a hard one.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.730
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Well, I guess I have a 2-part
question. First one being I don't think, maybe

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.690
I just wasn't hearing well --. What is it
that you really want or are you still figuring

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.700
it out?

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:23.740
&gt;&gt; Randall: Yeah, I think what I really want
is a world for my children that isn't caught

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:30.660
up with the things that we're dealing with
right now. Like, European debt crisis. Or

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:40.530
a world where people on Wall Street are calling
each other and giggling about how they screwed

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:47.530
a grandmother out of her pension. And that
-- I mean, that's a big chunk of this new

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:55.440
venture is, you know, my bigger kind of 20-year
desire is I want to change the business culture.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:00.380
I mean, I think Google does a good job of
doing that as well. We need, there needs to

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:06.930
be a systemic change how people think about
what they're doing in business and how it

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:12.390
impacts people. And that, you know, people
can define that as social entrepreneurship.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:17.140
But I think that's just being a good person.
And so, that's what I would do.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:23.420
&gt;&gt; Male #4: And I guess it helps if you said
you want to change the world for your kids.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.960
But before you had kids, what you really wanted
would have been something else. You just changed

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.740
ten, 15 years down the line and you figure
you want something else, how do you deal with

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.740
that?

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.980
&gt;&gt; Randall: Part of when I was putting together
this presentation that was -- I started realizing

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:46.370
is that what I really want -- it's going to
change. Change is constant. You have to ask

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:51.109
yourself constantly, "am I doing what I really
want? And is it getting me to where I want

00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:59.670
to be?" As long as I can continue to say,
"well, at the end of my life I want my children

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:08.240
to say that I was there for them and that
I did everything within my power to create

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:14.589
a better world for them." If they say that,
and what I'm doing today, I can kind of see

00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:22.829
a line of sight and I think see milestones
getting to that, then I feel like I'm on the

00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:28.170
right track. But yeah -- I mean having kids
provided a lot of clarity. I clearly didn't

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:37.200
have that in my 20s. [chuckles] Say, a good
chunk of my 30s as well. But yeah. It's a

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.200
hard question. It's a hard question.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:45.739
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: We have another question here
from the moderator.

00:43:45.739 --> 00:43:49.770
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: If you don't necessarily consider
yourself to be a Visionary entrepreneur, what

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.890
are some of the ways to try to get involved
with entrepreneurs to try to create a business

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:56.500
plan [inaudible].

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:07.319
&gt;&gt; Randall: Yeah, I think there's plenty of
-- I'm sure you guys know tech stars -- start

00:44:07.319 --> 00:44:13.520
up weekend. All the seed accelerators that
are out there. Those seem to be like the low-hanging

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.691
fruit for everybody. And it's something we
really struggled with because it's a question

00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:26.130
of, people can go there and get engaged and
have this really coding marathon and do some

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:31.980
pretty amazing stuff. But I think that when
you start trying to figure out what kind of

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:37.599
team -- something I definitely struggle with,
too, is trying to hire people is making sure

00:44:37.599 --> 00:44:45.849
there's a shared passion and a shared vision.
And the way you can do that is by making sure

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:51.650
that you kind of ask those folks, partners,
team that you're working with, "hey, does

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:56.940
this all connect up with what everybody wants
longer term?" If everybody just wants to get

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:03.089
rich, great. But make sure everybody on the
team wants to get rich. Otherwise people are

00:45:03.089 --> 00:45:07.760
going to get really annoyed and they're going
to walk away. You're going to have trouble

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:14.200
keeping people together. But if you can have
a shared vision of what that business is and

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:20.250
that connects with what people really want,
then I think that that becomes pretty powerful

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:29.230
way of approaching it. And I think that to
a certain extent the idea of being a visionary

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:36.109
that you have to be a visionary to be an entrepreneur
-- I don't subscribe to that. Because I'm

00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:42.680
far from being a visionary. [chuckles] And
-- but I feel like that I can still classify

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.920
myself as an entrepreneur.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:51.630
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: You mention something earlier
you were kind of showing [inaudible]. I'm

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:57.040
hearing that consistently from entrepreneurs.
They say as part of the ingredient of somebody

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:03.190
successful. You have to break it up in a pie
how much of it is luck, how much of it is

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:05.740
capital, how much of it [inaudible]-- what
would you break it into.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:15.710
&gt;&gt; Randall: Wow. I'm not really good with
math. So I may not come up with 100 percent.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:25.990
It may be a mis-shaped pie. [laughs] I think
that -- what were the options again? This

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:28.020
is like a math problem -- word problem.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.140
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Well, you can make up your
pieces -- luck, capital, being educated.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:37.720
&gt;&gt; Randall: Oh I can make them up? I think
that a lot of it has to do -- there's timing.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:44.470
I mean, people call it "luck," but I think
you make your own luck. You constantly are

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:51.910
trying to push forward. Like, the concept
model that I sketched up -- well, I think

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:56.970
people could say, "well, you're lucky that
you were introduced to Jeff Sandefer because

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:03.740
he's now funding this new venture that you're
doing." And my argument would be, "well, yeah,

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:10.140
but I spent three years." I mean, I did that
sketch in 2009. And I was thinking about it

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:17.339
for a good year, year and a half before that.
And it's -- you're going to create your own

00:47:17.339 --> 00:47:23.710
luck. I think that that -- it's more about
putting some kind of stake in the ground and

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:29.910
moving forward. One of the concept you're
asking about -- like, this Idea of advice

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:35.430
being able to put that stake in the ground,
the sense of ambiguity. That's going to have

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:45.549
to change. And really saying, "okay, I'll
have to, you know, move when it comes there."

00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:54.339
Like, a big part of it is just say, 50 percent
is, you know, having the right plan and team

00:47:54.339 --> 00:48:01.791
in place. And 50 percent is being comfortable
with all that comes along with that. And with

00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:08.000
all the people who tell you it's not going
to work. That you're too naīve. All the employees

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:17.390
that tell you that you're not doing the right
thing. That's always fun.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:21.970
&gt;&gt; Male #5: What about the 'why' behind -- I
mean, I think it's such an important question

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:27.370
what do you really want. Breaking it out like
that is really powerful. What about the 'why'

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:34.170
that's behind that; how do you answer that?
And second, who is your mentor now? Who are

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.099
they and how important is that?

00:48:37.099 --> 00:48:43.950
&gt;&gt; Randall: Yeah. Not sure clearly understand
so I'll try the why question. But I think

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:50.079
embedded in that question of what do you really
want, there is a why in that. Because if you

00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:56.270
want -- if you want to be -- interesting we've
been doing, running ads. Doing AV Testing

00:48:56.270 --> 00:49:03.660
on ads. And the people -- one of the things
we were testing -- we've got this message

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:08.020
of, "well, we can help you make money and
be a successful entrepreneur and we can also

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:15.309
help you discover what you're passionate about."
People want passion. So we started running

00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:22.280
these ads. And one of the test ads was "discover
your real passion." Another one was "be a

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:29.140
millionaire by 30." And we had this simple
little quiz that we would send them to. Almost

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:34.339
everybody -- the vast majority of everybody
clicked on millionaire. But then the quiz

00:49:34.339 --> 00:49:41.770
was actually broken down so that the output
would say, "well, you know, you really want

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:47.210
to kind of discover your passion." Or "no,
you're all about money." What was interesting,

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:52.740
everybody clicked on I want to be a millionaire
by 30 or 35 and then they answered this question

00:49:52.740 --> 00:50:00.809
and 70 percent of them said, "I want to follow
my passion." And so, I think the why -- you

00:50:00.809 --> 00:50:08.299
can say "I want to be a millionaire by 30,,"
but is that what you really want or is being

00:50:08.299 --> 00:50:14.410
the master of your own destiny what you really
want. So peeling back those layers and getting

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:22.470
beyond the initial gut reaction is important.
What was the other question? There was another

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:34.640
one. Mentors -- yeah, I've got quite a few
people who I would consider my mentors. And

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:41.180
some of them are actually pretty close in
age to me, because they've done things that

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:46.270
I wish that I was skilled and talented enough
to be able to do. Evan is highly -- I don't

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:51.990
get a chance to talk to him as much, but he's
definitely. He's a mentor in the sense that

00:50:51.990 --> 00:51:02.250
he's doing things that I wish I had the discipline
that he has. And there's other people who

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:08.670
are mentors -- I think a lot of the way I
look at it is, I can't find that one mentor

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:14.740
that does everything. And so, I end up trying
to take this design-thinking approach to mentors.

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:19.641
Where I'm going to get a multi-disciplined
panel of mentors. [chuckles] Get somebody

00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:25.420
over here who's really focused in design and
design thinking. And somebody over here who's,

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:31.200
you know, really much more about the spiritual
aspects of it. Somebody over here who is a

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:39.170
lot more the nuts and bolts and gets it done.
And, you know -- yeah, I actually never really

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:44.380
thought of it that way, but that's kind of
the approach. I have a Frankenstein mentor

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:50.729
that I go to different parts of them [chuckles]
depending on what's going on.

00:51:50.729 --> 00:51:56.059
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Do you have any advice for your
-- like about social entrepreneurs you work

00:51:56.059 --> 00:52:01.789
with balancing what they want and then also
with the needs of the communities they're

00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:06.300
working in. Like, concrete advice in terms
of how they can address those--.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:10.613
&gt;&gt; Randall: When you talk about the communities
that they're working in what do you mean by

00:52:10.613 --> 00:52:11.613
that.

00:52:11.613 --> 00:52:13.050
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Well it seems like the social entrepreneurship
you're trying to have some impact on community,

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:17.579
right? What add And that's part of your goal.
So I mean what advice do you give your budding

00:52:17.579 --> 00:52:21.369
social entrepreneurs in terms of finding how
to balance their needs and passions and finding

00:52:21.369 --> 00:52:23.970
ways to fit the needs of the community.

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:32.569
&gt;&gt; Randall: Yeah, it's -- when probably about
a year ago we started going through the exercise

00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:37.650
of -- the standard exercise of the mission,
vision, core values -- those kinds of questions.

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:45.789
And I totally got called to the carpet by
Jeff who's practically the chairman of my

00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:52.440
organization. And he was like -- I started
I was putting in my grandiose " hey, I'm going

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:58.160
to create an ecosystem. I'm going to change
the world." And he's like, "yeah, that's cool.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:07.569
That doesn't really talk about your customers."
And I think that that's the question. Because

00:53:07.569 --> 00:53:11.460
I don't view us as trying to create social
entrepreneurs. We're trying to create some

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:17.150
kind of social impact per se. We want to have
an impact on individual's life and allow them

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:24.309
to define what it is they want to do. Everything
is, you know -- we don't profess to have any

00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:33.150
kind of magical answer. And I think anybody
who does is probably lying to you. And so,

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:39.099
you've got to go back and make sure that what
you're doing, what you're passionate about

00:53:39.099 --> 00:53:43.609
is actually connects with those people who
are your customers and that it's something

00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:50.280
that they really both need and want. And there's
a delineation. That's one of the things we

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:58.240
struggled with was the need versus want question.
Do people want money or do they need, you

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:05.999
know, a mechanism that and frameworks that
allow them to become much more effective entrepreneurs.

00:54:05.999 --> 00:54:15.150
&gt;&gt; Female #2: I have a question. What are
some of the books that have been Most influential

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:19.790
in your life in defining I guess both your
personal life as well as what you really want

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:21.480
and your passion.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:27.940
&gt;&gt; Randall: I have to admit I am the slowest
reader in the world I'm pretty sure. I tried

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:33.560
to do the speed reading thing. It inhibits
my ability to get through a lot of books.

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:40.180
When you said that first one that jumped into
my mind was Jonathan Livingston's Seagull.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:52.500
Short little powerful kind of inspirational
piece. I think that Letters to a Young Poet

00:54:52.500 --> 00:55:05.559
is another one that I think has shaped the
way I think about a lot of things. And so,

00:55:05.559 --> 00:55:12.800
that's kind of the touchy-feely side. The
one that actually kind of turned on the light

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:20.980
bulb for me which we use in our program is
called E-myth. It's by Michael Gerber. And

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:27.960
it talks about this idea of -- I don't want
to give it it away, but thinking about what

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.410
it is you -- what kind of entrepreneur you're
going to be. And making sure you don't put

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:40.980
yourself into a position where you are basically
in a self-employment trap. And so, it's -- I

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:45.910
think that one becomes like, "yeah, duh."
But sometimes it's like the really simple

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:47.859
things. [chuckles] "wow, probably should have
read that a long time ago.."

00:55:47.859 --> 00:55:53.970
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: We're out of time, so we're
going to ask a question off the Dory. Since

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:59.020
I'm up here, I'm going to ad lib it a little
bit. You had mentioned the exercise and you

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:07.140
mentioned your goal was to make a better world
for your children. A lot of changes to that.

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:15.819
And so, it sounds like greed. And you also
mentioned bottom line. [inaudible] Effectively.

00:56:15.819 --> 00:56:21.770
&gt;&gt; Randall: Now, I think I -- yeah, it gets
important to say -- and this is actually something

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:29.119
I've kind of come to a conclusion on over
the past probably year or two. I definitely

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:33.900
think was of this mind set of yeah social
entrepreneurship. Money shouldn't be your

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:42.770
bottom line. That's just not -- that's not
realistic. I think that it's important that,

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:51.160
if the idea of money being the only criteria
by which you measure success -- I think is

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:59.250
very risky. Because it's -- that's going to
drive -- that's going to become more important.

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:04.609
And then that then creates the incentive structure
for everybody in your entire organization.

00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:11.450
We look at our core metrics or what we pay
attention to, is both sales -- because we

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:19.339
can't stick around. Otherwise, we're just
giving it away for free. We should just do

00:57:19.339 --> 00:57:25.760
that. But sales are really important as well
as what's the experience that our customers

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:32.950
are having? How are they telling us it's good
or it sucks? And being able to understand

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:38.450
those pieces. So since our mission is about
really empowering those individuals, then

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:41.170
we have to use -- we have to balance those
things. It can't be one or the other.

00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:46.640
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Well, that was the question.
Because earlier you had also said that if

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:52.010
money was what you really want, then that's
OK [inaudible].

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:57.799
&gt;&gt; Randall: Sure, no -- I mean -- yeah, I
think that that -- and this is also important

00:57:57.799 --> 00:58:04.450
is, this is my decision. This is the way that
I'm viewing it and that I -- my perspective.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:12.840
But if you don't share that perspective, that's
completely legitimate. And I shouldn't -- I

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:20.660
think it's way arrogant for me or for anybody
else to say, "well, since you only value money,

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:28.849
you're a horrible person." That's not to say.
I think that -- if I implied that, then that's

00:58:28.849 --> 00:58:29.849
wrong.

00:58:29.849 --> 00:58:32.969
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Well, we're out of time. Thank
you so much for.

00:58:32.969 --> 00:58:35.460
&gt;&gt; Randall: Yeah, thanks, guys.

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.080
[Applause]
