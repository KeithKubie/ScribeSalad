Matt massacred that name says who has a
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.330
Matt massacred that name says who has a
higher IQ a really gifted mathematician

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340
higher IQ a really gifted mathematician
 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.330
higher IQ a really gifted mathematician
or a really gifted painter very

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340
or a really gifted painter very
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.430
or a really gifted painter very
difficult to say but I would say that

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440
difficult to say but I would say that
 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.349
difficult to say but I would say that
gifted method because if they're both

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
gifted method because if they're both
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.210
gifted method because if they're both
gifted they both have high IQs you can

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
gifted they both have high IQs you can
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.010
gifted they both have high IQs you can
be certain of that it's very difficult

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
be certain of that it's very difficult
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.679
be certain of that it's very difficult
to do anything that's truly gifted say

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
to do anything that's truly gifted say
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.529
to do anything that's truly gifted say
above the average above the norm without

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
above the average above the norm without
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.650
above the average above the norm without
being without having a very high IQ and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
being without having a very high IQ and
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330
being without having a very high IQ and
in a creative realm I mean you hear

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
in a creative realm I mean you hear
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.700
in a creative realm I mean you hear
about these idiot savants who have like

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
about these idiot savants who have like
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.799
about these idiot savants who have like
one area of extreme expertise but

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
one area of extreme expertise but
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.350
one area of extreme expertise but
generally in those cases it's not so

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
generally in those cases it's not so
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880
generally in those cases it's not so
much that they have one area of extreme

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
much that they have one area of extreme
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.979
much that they have one area of extreme
expertise it's that they have one area

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
expertise it's that they have one area
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.979
expertise it's that they have one area
of above-average expertise that really

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
of above-average expertise that really
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.420
of above-average expertise that really

of true geniuses mathematicians are kind

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
of true geniuses mathematicians are kind

of an odd Bunch though because you they

peek really really early like if you're

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
peek really really early like if you're
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810
peek really really early like if you're
gonna be a mathematician and truly

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
gonna be a mathematician and truly
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.060
gonna be a mathematician and truly
gifted then you're going to show signs

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
gifted then you're going to show signs
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.609
gifted then you're going to show signs
of that when you're like seventeen to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
of that when you're like seventeen to
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.370
of that when you're like seventeen to
twenty something like that whereas

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380
twenty something like that whereas

painters can can be creative through in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
painters can can be creative through in
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.190
painters can can be creative through in
their entire lifespan I would say

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
their entire lifespan I would say
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.679
their entire lifespan I would say
probably on average I would guess this

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
probably on average I would guess this
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.990
probably on average I would guess this
is a guess that if you took a hundred

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
is a guess that if you took a hundred
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.789
is a guess that if you took a hundred
really gifted mathematicians and a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
really gifted mathematicians and a
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380
really gifted mathematicians and a
hundred really gifted painters that the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
hundred really gifted painters that the
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.240
hundred really gifted painters that the
mathematicians would have far higher

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250
mathematicians would have far higher
 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.249
mathematicians would have far higher
nonverbal IQs but the painters might

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259
nonverbal IQs but the painters might
 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.340
nonverbal IQs but the painters might
have higher verbal IQs so that also

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
have higher verbal IQs so that also
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.210
have higher verbal IQs so that also
complicates things see with IQ also you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
complicates things see with IQ also you
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.789
complicates things see with IQ also you
know there's there's this factor called

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
know there's there's this factor called
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.830
know there's there's this factor called
the G factor which is the central

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
the G factor which is the central
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.889
the G factor which is the central
element of intelligence and it seems to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
element of intelligence and it seems to
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.200
element of intelligence and it seems to
be associated with such things as head

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
be associated with such things as head
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600

size and brain size relative to body and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
size and brain size relative to body and
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149

neural conduction speed and simple

reaction time like really basic

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
reaction time like really basic

physiological markers and it's a pretty

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
physiological markers and it's a pretty
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.639

tight single factor say as opposed to

tight single factor say as opposed to
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.340
tight single factor say as opposed to
the personality dementia may where

the personality dementia may where
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.160
the personality dementia may where
there's five quite clear factors but I

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
there's five quite clear factors but I
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139
there's five quite clear factors but I
think it was Earl hunts research

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
think it was Earl hunts research
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.080

sort of like there's a lot of ways to be

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820
sort of like there's a lot of ways to be
 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.520
sort of like there's a lot of ways to be
really smart but there's only one way to

really smart but there's only one way to
 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.930
really smart but there's only one way to
be not very smart so that's another

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940
be not very smart so that's another
