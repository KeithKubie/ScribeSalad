00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.670
And the answer is no. These functions are actually not inverses of one another.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.018
It might look like they are right off the bat since we've been talking about

00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:13.126
how inverse functions undo what the other one does. However, these operations

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:18.920
performed by f and g are not actually opposites. F divides x by 4, but g of x

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.134
divides 4 by x. We can tell by taking their composites that they are definitely

00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:27.863
not inverses of one another. They're definitely not undoing each other's

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:33.378
operations. If we take f of g of x, we end up with 1 over x. And if we take g

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:39.263
of f of x, we get 16 over x. Hm, I wonder what the inverses of these functions

00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:40.199
are, then?
