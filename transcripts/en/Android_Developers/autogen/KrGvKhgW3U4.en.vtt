00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.160
 [Funny Music] 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.800
 O'Neill: StoryToys is a company 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.160
 Design and publish the content of children's applications. 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.200
 We do a large number of activities including original IP content, 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.080
 He wrote classic anecdotes, 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.520
 Licensed content and much more. 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.000
 Barrett: We are interested in combining reading experience 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.040
 And provide interactive scenes. 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.920
 It is a wonderful combination that combines my educational reading experience 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.880
 And interaction with simple gaming style. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.080
 This does not distract the child during the reading experience 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.360
 But remains interested in follow-up, 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.760
 He feels part of the story. 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.200
 O'Neill: One of the biggest challenges 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.040
 Work in the area of ​​children's applications 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.640
 You target two types of audience. 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.720
 The first type is the children's audience, 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.760
 But when it comes to selling an application, 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.560
 The experience should be attractive to children 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.800
 And be satisfactory to parents as well 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.680
 In terms of providing good value 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.880
 As well as educational values ​​acceptable to parents. 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.600
 Thus ensuring parents' satisfaction with leaving their children 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.200
 Interact with content. 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.080
 Bennett: Since the launch of the Family Section 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.240
 On Google Play, we've seen a radical shift in 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.760
 Our Android experience. 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 We've seen a huge increase in earnings and downloads as well. 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240
 This makes Google Play the most important channel for us, 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.280
 StoryToys has benefited a lot from this store, 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.880
 We are therefore happy to participate. 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.200
 O'Neill: The Family section is available on the Google Play Store 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.880
 An innovative, safe and reliable center 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.200
 Where families can find new content. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.440
 Android has tremendous testing power 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.600
 Continuous and rapid development. 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.400
 It offers the best service with very little effort. 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 It provides experimental use on the store. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.760
 We have benefited greatly from this 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.160
 As we reach a wider audience. 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.760
 Bennett: The Play Store provides universal access. 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.200
 As a distribution channel, it has achieved unparalleled results. 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.680
 The Google Play store lets you customize prices by market. 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.720
 This is a wonderful and very helpful tool. 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.600
 You can also benefit from Google Play translation services, 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.040
 They are effective services through which all content of an application can be translated 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.360
 Very quickly. 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.040
 O'Neill: The Google Play store has allowed the application of "My Very Hungry Caterpillar" 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280
 To reach huge numbers of audiences. 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.560
 We have found that children generally interact with this application 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.440
 For 80 to 120 minutes. 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.400
 We also discovered that children were cumulative in their ability to make 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.920
 More than a million butterfly 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.520
 They also managed to feed the hungry butterfly 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.680
 More than 1/4 million fruit fruit within the application. 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.600
 Bennett: We have a great interest in the future of StoryToys 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.960
 Over the next few years, 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.360
 We are also particularly interested in education 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.160
 And this area is full of opportunities.
