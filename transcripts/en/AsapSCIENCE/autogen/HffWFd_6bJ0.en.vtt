00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Social networking sites are used by 1/3 people around the world 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 They have had a great impact on society 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.020
 But what about our bodies? 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.740
 Here are 5 ways of social networking and the Internet 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.540
 Influence your mind at the moment 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.730
 Can not you stop? 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.070
 It is surprising that 5-10% of Internet users 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.280
 Are not actually able to control the amount of time they spend online. 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.470
 Although it is self-addiction and not drug addiction, 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 Examine the brains of these people 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.669
 Revealed weakness in areas similar to those of drug addicts. 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.469
 Specifically, there is a clear decline of white matter in 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:33.779
 Areas that control emotions, attention and decision making. 

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:37.519
 Because social media provide immediate rewards for little effort, 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.189
 Your mind begins to re-install itself, so you want these stimuli, 

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:45.279
 As you begin to want more of these neurological excitements after each reaction. 

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.619
 Looks like drugs. Is not it? 

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:49.809
 We also see a change when we look at multitasking. 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.219
 You may think that those who use social media 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.109
 Or permanently switch between work and websites 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.199
 They are best at multitasking, 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.649
 But studies revealed that when compared to those who use the means of communication frequently to others, 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.499
 Their performance is much worse during task switching tests. 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.009
 Increasing online multitasking reduces your brain's ability to filter out overlaps, 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.509
 It can even make it harder for your mind to learn information in a way that you can remember 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.089
 Like your phone rings in the middle of a product. 

00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:14.309
 Or wait .. Is it really Ren ?? 

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:18.039
 Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively new psychological phenomenon 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.909
 Where you think you felt your phone was shaking, while it did not vibrate. 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.679
 In a study, 89% of those who underwent it said 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.709
 They face this at least once every two weeks. 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.419
 It seems that our minds now explain any accentuation as a real vibration of our phones. 

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:31.759
 As far as the madness of the subject seems, 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.619
 The technique began to re-install our nervous system 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.149
 Our minds have become more exciting than they were before 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.619
 Social media also stimulate the secretion of dopamine- 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.749
 A chemical that gives a feeling of improvement. 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.669
 Using MRI, scientists have found that 

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:47.969
 The reward center in people's minds is much more active when they talk about their own opinions, 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.299
 Unlike when they listen to others. 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.799
 Not surprisingly - we all like to talk about ourselves, right? 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.349
 But it turns out that while 30-40% of the talks are face-to-face 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.289
 Including talking about our own experiences, 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.129
 80% of communication through social networking sites 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:02.329
 Are just about ourselves. 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.919
 The same parts of your mind regarding sexual prominence, motivation and love 

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:08.289
 They are stimulated through your use of social- 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.879
 And even more when you learn that you audience. 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.059
 Our bodies physiologically reward us to talk about ourselves online! 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.969
 But it's not all about ourselves. 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.989
 In fact, studies on relationships have found that 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.289
 Partners tend to be more impressive when they first meet online 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.609
 Rather than face to face. 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.919
 Whether it is because people are more unknown or perhaps because they are more clear about their future goals, 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.019
 There is a statistical increase in the success of relationships that begin over the Internet. 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.309
 Thus, while the Internet has changed our oral communication with increasing physical distances, 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.769
 Perhaps the most important people ended up being even closer. 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.089
 By talking about social media, 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.559
 We've made you ask us questions on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Templer, Google + 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.659
 All the social networks that we have found, 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.759
 We made "Q &amp; A" videos on! AsapTHOUGHT 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:54.389

 Try it using the link in the description! 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.829
 Have a question that makes you want an answer?

 Ask him in comments or on Facebook and Twitter 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.879
 Finally we also have a mailbox for all the amazing science lovers 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.489
 Who have asked to send mail or other things over the years. 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.319
 We will love to hear from you all!
