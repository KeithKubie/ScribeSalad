00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.410
 to me 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.860
 on average 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.570
 this is the moment that we 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.040
 we enjoyed seeing each other even though 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.040
 seconds a few minutes 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.020
 we do not know how seriously I am 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.360
 talking about the construction of the wall 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.910
 and I think that is the biggest fear 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.860
 that we had to carry out since 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.460
 we would lose the opportunity to see them 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.460
 even if it's a few minutes 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.860
 this is the only way I have of 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.780
 see my family because obviously they 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.890
 they can not come or I can go to 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.360
 there we can not a brother go there 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.770
 this and of course clear that we are concerned 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.390
 I think to all the people who are here 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.390
 we are very worried about that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.400
 I think he's going to start with 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.320
 verify those in the jobs because I 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.690
 I think the weak point of all people 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.760
 in jobs because without employment one does not 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.979
 can live here until now has not 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.130
 there was no president to express himself 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.960
 so in such a racist way towards the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.960
 Hispanic Mexican people
