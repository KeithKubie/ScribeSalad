00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.960
Before I go on with problem 143,
I actually have a bone to

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.200
pick with problem 142.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.940
We actually went through it
correctly, although I probably

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.510
did a couple of more steps
then I had to.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.350
Because when I do them in real
time my brain wanders.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.200
But now that I've had time to
sit and look at it a little

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.540
bit, I realize that I think
the GMAT people

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.150
may have made a mistake.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.540
So what was the problem?

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.170
The problem itself was 9 to the
x plus 9 to the minus x is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.940
equal to b.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.980
The problem is, do we have
enough information to answer

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.640
this question?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.460
That's how they phrase it.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.480
They don't say do you have
enough information to say that

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.600
this is true.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.030
They say do we have
enough information

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.050
to answer this question.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.440
So if I have enough information
to say, no, this

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.530
is not true.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.320
That statement should
still be good.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.010
So we can ignore statement
number 1.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.390
In the last video I showed
that that was sufficient.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.130
I still agree that that is
completely sufficient.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.410
But let's look at statement
number 2.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.010
According to the GMAT people,
they say that statement number

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.570
2 is not sufficient to
answer this question.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.890
I'll argue that it is.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.890
Because they say that statement
number 2 says that x

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.900
is greater than 0, which
is equal to b.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.320
I take this to mean that x is
greater than 0 and 0 is equal

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020
to b or b is equal to 0.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.340
Maybe I'm misunderstanding that,
but that's the only way

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.810
I can think of interpreting
this thing.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.780
So if b is equal to 0, what is
the statement that we're

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.710
trying to see if we can answer,
or the question that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.270
we're trying to answer?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.710
What does that boil down to?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.850
Well then the question boils
down to 9 to the x plus 9 to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.210
the minus x is equal to 0.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.040
My question to you is, if I'm
taking 9 to any power, to any

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.070
power whatsoever, can I ever
get 0 or a negative number?

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.010
In fact, the only way I can get
to 0 is if I do 9 to the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.890
minus infinity power, right?

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.820
Because that equals 1 over
9 to the infinity.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.030
So that might approach 0.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.910
But even if I said x was
infinity here, on this side I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.520
would have 9 to the
infinity here.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.310
This would be infinity plus 0.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.610
So it would still approach
infinity.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.630
So there's actually no way-- and
that's the limit and all

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.690
that, I don't want to get
confused-- but there's no way.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.340
Some people think, oh, if I'm
taking it to a negative

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.639
exponent, maybe that becomes
a negative power.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.070
No, a negative exponent
just means an inverse.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.560
So this could be written as 1
over 9 to the x is equal to 0.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.610
So if x becomes a very large
number, this becomes very

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.830
positive and this
approaches 0.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.350
If x becomes a very, very, very,
very small fraction,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.080
this number becomes
a small number.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.150
But then this is the inverse
of a small number, so this

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.420
becomes a large number.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.520
Actually, if x becomes
negative,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.050
these just switch places.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.710
This becomes 1 over 9
to the positive x.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.400
You got the point.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.750
These are just negatives of each
other, these exponents.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.810
If x was 0, then both of
these are equal to 1.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.050
So then you get 2
is equal to 0.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.980
The way I see it, statement
2 answers our question.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.670
But the answer is no, 9 to the
x plus 9 to the minus x does

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.010
not equal b because statement
2 says b is equal to 0.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.290
But anyway, I don't harp on
this too much, but I think

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.350
they actually made a mistake.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.620
Because statement 2, in my mind,
answers the question.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.960
It just doesn't say that
the question is true.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.480
Let's move on to the
next question.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.930
But it's good.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.820
I think discussions like that,
even though some poor chap--

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.530
because apparently these are
real GMAT questions-- some

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.850
poor chap might have
gotten it wrong.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.550
But we can use that as a
piece of instruction.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.910
So anyway, 143.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.030
They say if m is greater than 0
and n is greater than 0, is

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:47.910
m plus x over n plus x greater
than m over n.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.870
Interesting.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.240
So they're essentially saying,
if I have m over n and then I

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.090
add the same number, we call
that x, to both the numerator

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.380
and the denominator
does that make the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.080
whole fraction bigger?

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.740
I'll just give you a little
intuition right now.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.370
If I had a very small number for
x, relative to m and n, it

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.330
doesn't change the
fraction much.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.600
Well, let me put it this way.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.320
If I had anything, whatever x
is, and the larger x is, the

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.510
more that this fraction is
going to approach 1.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.260
You think about it, if m is
1, and n is 2, and x is 1

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.300
million, and x is 1 million,
then that million is going to

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.620
overpower the m and the n.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.520
You probably remember that a
little bit from your limits.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.770
But I just want to give
you that intuition.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.620
Regardless of what m and n are,
if x gets suitably large,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.670
than this will approach 1.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.010
But I don't know if that's
going to help us.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.010
Let's look at the statements.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.600
Statement 1, m is less than n.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.800
So if m is less than n, this
says that this is going to be

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.470
less than 1.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.260
So it's going to
be a fraction.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.990
I just said that if I add an
x to the numerator and the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.630
denominator of something, you're
going to approach 1.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.595
But we have to be careful
because they didn't tell us

00:05:00.595 --> 00:05:01.900
that x is positive.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.070
So I might be subtracting x.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.330
Maybe this x is a negative
1 million.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.450
Let me give you that example.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.290
So let's say m is less than n.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.070
So let's say that m is equal
to 1, n is equal to 2.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.270
So we could say if x is 1
million-- let's say something

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.140
similar, let's say x is 100-- so
m plus x would be 101 and n

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.960
plus x would be 102.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.390
That is easily greater
than 1/2.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.505
You say, oh, excellent.

00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:34.320
Statement 1 is sufficient.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.060
First of all, that doesn't prove
sufficiency, but it's

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.340
easy to prove that it's
not sufficient.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.600
Because what if x
were minus 100.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.740
Then it would be 1 minus
100 would be minus 99.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.880
Then 2 minus 100 would
be minus 98.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.810
Is that a greater than 1/2?

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.900
Well, no.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.470
This is a little over minus 1.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.220
So it's actually a
negative number.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.660
It's going to be
less than 1/2.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.730
So statement 1 alone
is not sufficient.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.320
Because I can pick an m and an
n using statement number 1,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.440
and then an x.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.430
I could pick different x's where
the statement is either

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.830
true or not true.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.780
This one is not true.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.230
I'm trying to cross that out.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.380
Let's look at statement
number 2.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:22.860
Statement number 2 tells us
that x is greater than 0.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.940
So let's think about just x
being greater than 0 alone.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.720
Does that help us?

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.900
Well, it does help us
if m is less than n.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.890
Because I just gave the example
that if m is less than

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.840
n-- so if you're starting with
some fraction that's less than

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.940
1-- and you add a positive
number to both the numerator

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.340
and the denominator, you're just
going to get a little bit

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.240
closer to 1.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.980
So you're actually going to
increase the value of that

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.030
fraction

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.320
You could test it out
on a bunch of

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.300
different numbers, right?

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.410
If you add 1 to the numerator
and the denominator of 1/2,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.970
you get 2/3.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.830
If you add another
1, you get 3/4.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.980
If you add another
1, you get 4/5.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.170
So you see how this continues.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.980
As you add more and more to
the numerator and the

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.990
denominator, it approaches 1.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.600
This x greater than 0 satisfies
our problem with the

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.900
first statement.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.020
Because our first says, oh,
what if x is negative?

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.680
Then it doesn't work.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.160
But let's think about whether x
greater than 0 by itself is

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.060
enough to answer
this question.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.790
It works when m is
less than n.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.190
So it works in conjunction
with statement 1.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.020
But what if n is
greater than m?

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.235
What if we start with an
equation like 4 over 2?

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.990
4 over 2, is that-- let me make
sure I get that-- is that

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:55.130
less than 4 plus x over 2 plus
x for any x greater than 0?

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.250
Well, let's add 4 to the
numerator and the denominator.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.290
So then this would be
equal to 8 over 6.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.580
This number right here is 2.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.870
This number right
here is 1 1/3.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.340
So it's not true.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.660
If x is equal to 0, this
statement still doesn't work

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.710
if n is greater than m.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.360
So in order for this statement
to be true, or in order to

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.400
answer this question, you
actually need both pieces of

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.010
information.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.300
So both statements together
are sufficient

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.910
to answer this question.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.190
Next problem, 144.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.260
If n as a positive integer-- so
they tell us n is greater

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.640
than 0-- is 1/10 to the
n less than 0.01?

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:53.100
So what they're saying is 1/10
to the n less than 0.01.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.340
Well, what's 0.01?

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.780
Well, let me write it out.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.470
So this statement, that's
another way of saying 1/10 to

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.750
the n less than-- 0.01 is 1 over
100, which is the same

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:13.140
thing as 1/10 squared.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.640
Well let's just think about
it a little bit.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.300
Let me look at the statements
before I go

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.850
off on my own tangent.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:26.920
So statement 1, they say
n is greater than 2.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.320
So if n is greater than 2, as n
increases, is that going to

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.750
make this whole number
smaller or bigger?

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.450
Well, if I take a fraction,
especially 1/10, and I

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.510
increase it to more and more
powers, I actually end up

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.760
going more and more behind
the decimal point.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.670
If n is greater than 2, at
n equals 2, you get 0.01.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.100
Then if n is equal to 3,
although it doesn't have to be

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.460
an integer.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.890
Actually they tell us
it's an interger.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.450
So if n equals 3, what is it?

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.050
So they say n has to be at
least 3 because it's a

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.350
positive integer.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.010
So what's 1/10 to
the third power?

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.320
It's 0.001.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.290
That's definitely
less than 0.01.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.600
What's 1/10 to the
fourth power?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.980
That's 0.0001.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.160
That's definitely
less than 0.01.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.770
So this statement alone
is sufficient

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.700
to answer the question.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.790
Statement 2.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.420
Another way you view this is,
this inequality could be

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:27.810
written as 10 to the minus n
is less than 10 squared.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:33.710
Then this is only going to
happen if minus-- no, actually

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.530
that's not a good way
to go about it.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.365
I think the way I explained it
the first time is probably the

00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:38.110
better way.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.510
All right.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:49.110
The second statement they say
is 1/10 to the n minus 1 is

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.130
less than 0.1.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.500
So what we could do here is just
multiply both sides of

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.420
this equation by 1 over 10.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.000
What happens?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.700
You get 1/10 times 1/10 to the
n minus 1 is less than--

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.520
what's 1/10 times 0.1?

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.130
Well, it's 1.01, right?

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.520
It's 1/10 of that.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.270
What does this simplify to?

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.700
You have 1/10 to the first
power times 1/10

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.510
to the n minus 1.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.320
You add the exponents.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.220
You could put a first
power there.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:29.160
Well, this is equal to 1/10 to
the n is less than 0.01.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.200
which is the statement that we
originally had, 1/10 to the n

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.530
is less than 0.01.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.730
So statement 2 is actually
equivalent to the original

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.930
problem statement.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.410
So each of these statements,
independently, are sufficient

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.780
to answer the question.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.970
See you in the next video.
