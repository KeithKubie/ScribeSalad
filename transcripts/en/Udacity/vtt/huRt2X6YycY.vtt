Great, I'm loving that the app now
has login functioning, but now what?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.970
The app looks exactly the same.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well the Firebase database
knows you're logged in but

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.600
the Android app doesn't.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.980
And therefore it isn't
doing anything different.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.450
So I've got access to this AuthData
object immediately when the user

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.985
logs in.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.200
I"m just not sure what the best
thing to do with it is.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.470
&gt;&gt; Yes, sheesh,
I'm just reading about this.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.650
There's actually a couple ways you can
get information from Firebase about

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.490
the user's authentication state besides
just the on authenticated callback.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.619
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.720
Tell us more.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.220
&gt;&gt; Sure, let me screen share.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.140
&gt;&gt; So you want to keep track of
users authentication states, and for

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.010
that there are several methods.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.550
You can use a callback method,
an event listener, or

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.230
specifically retrieve the current
authentication data for a user.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.590
You've already learned
about on authenticated.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.480
With this method you can trigger
code as soon as the user logs in.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.320
But sometimes you might move to
different activities in the app and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.970
continue to need the user's
authentication state.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.150
You can use an authentication state
listener, just like the normal Firebase

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.865
listeners, will tell you exactly when
data changes in the Firebase database,

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.470
an authentication state change
listener will tell you exactly when

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.570
Firebase knows a user is logged in or
logged out.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.710
And when you don't need the listener,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.730
you can use removeAuthStateListener
to remove it.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.260
The getAuth method retrieves
authentication data for

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.970
the currently authenticated user, or
null if the user is not authenticated.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.280
This method is synchronous,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.900
which is useful when restricting access
to valid users of your application.
