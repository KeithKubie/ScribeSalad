00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.290
Oh you’re sarcastic?

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.120
You must be so smart.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.230
Hi smart alecks, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.559
My parents always told me when I was a petulant
teenager that, “Sarcasm is the lowest form

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.559
of wit.”

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.750
To which I replied, “Yeah whatever,” and
totally won the argument.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.920
Now I’m a petulant adult and I’m happy
to report science seems to agree with me.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.450
A new study published in Organizational Behavior
and Human Decision Processes examined if there

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.700
was a link between sarcasm and creativity.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.360
Participants were randomly assigned to behave
sarcastically, sincerely, or neutral.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.270
They were paired with another participant
and went through a simulated conversation.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.390
In a variation of the experiment, participants
were asked to recall an exchange they had

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.210
had in their life that was either sarcastic,
sincere, or neutral.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.140
After they had simulated or recalled a conversation,
they were given 3 tests to measure their creativity

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.940
and another to measure how well they could
think abstractly.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.970
The researchers found that after a sarcastic
conversation, participants were more creative

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.670
and better abstract thinkers.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.260
And it didn’t matter if they were the ones
being sarcastic, just being on the receiving

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.510
end bolstered their cognitive functions.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.510
So just hearing sarcasm makes you more intelligent.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.690
You’re welcome.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.780
But why would being sarcastic help with anything
aside from being the funniest person ever?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.470
Coauthor of the study Francesca Gino explained
in an email to the Harvard Gazette that “To

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.070
create or decode sarcasm, both the expressers
and recipients of sarcasm need to overcome

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.520
the contradiction between the literal and
actual meanings of the sarcastic expressions.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.700
This is a process that activates and is facilitated
by abstraction, which in turn promotes creative

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
thinking.”

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.520
So decoding when someone says, “You look
nice today,” needs more thought than just

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.920
hearing “You look nice today,” and it
gets your brain in gear.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.350
But then another problem arises: it may also
make you want to punch that sarcastic jerk

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.400
in the face.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.700
So how do you get the benefits of being sarcastic
while remaining un-face-punched?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.420
The researchers looked into that too and discovered
that the key is the relationship you have

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.420
with the other person.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.110
If a sarcastic exchange happens between two
friends, they know the other is joking and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.110
don’t mind.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.570
But if a stranger is sarcastic towards another,
the recipient isn’t sure if they’re being

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.570
mocked and may take offense.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.640
So to practice safe sarcasm, the researchers
recommend doing it with friends.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.579
To which I say, “Duh.”

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.739
Sarcasm is my second language and comes easily
to some, but it actually requires more mental

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.420
gymnastics than you may have realized.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.879
People with some forms of brain damage or
autism may have a tough time picking up on

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.879
it.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:34.569
Anthony explains 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:43.769
why here.
