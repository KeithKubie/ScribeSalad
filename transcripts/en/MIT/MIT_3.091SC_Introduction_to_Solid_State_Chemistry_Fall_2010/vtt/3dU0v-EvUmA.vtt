00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.170
PROFESSOR: OK, OK,
settle down.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.410
It's time to start learning.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.210
One announcement.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.570
Tomorrow we'll have
the weekly quiz.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.530
In lieu of the Tuesday
celebration, we're going to

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.940
move to Thursday, since the
holiday moved everything,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.260
compressed the week.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.510
So last day, we were talking
about doping of

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.790
semiconductors, and I want
to finish up that unit.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.370
Just to refresh your memory,
we looked at how we could

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.850
change the behavior of the
semiconductor by introducing

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.000
impurity atoms. And when the
behavior of the semiconductor

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.300
is dominated by the impurity
atoms, we term

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.750
that behavior extrinsic.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.080
In other words, it's not the
behavior of silicon itself,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.880
but it's the behavior of silicon
as determined by the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.750
presence of some dopant atom.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.880
And we looked at the special
case of doping with a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.530
supervalent impurity.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.630
And here's the energy level
diagram for that situation,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.590
where we've got the valence
band down here, we've got

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.720
conduction band up here,
separated by an energy gap.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.370
That's all characteristic of
plain vanilla silicon.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.170
But then when we dope with the
supervalent impurity, there is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.800
an extra electron.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.900
And that is put into a donor
level that lies just a tiny

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.850
bit below the bottom of
the conduction band.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.750
And then, thanks to thermal
excitation, which gives us an

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.810
average energy of about 1/40 of
an electron bolt, we get,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.780
for all intents and purposes,
100% excitation of the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.650
electronics that sit in the
donor level, excitation up

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.340
into the conduction band.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.450
And this is what electrical
engineers term ionization.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.310
And I also reminded you last
day that this is the donor

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.210
level, and for each donor atom,
there sits a donor level

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.570
at the same value of energy,
but these are so far apart

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.150
point, owing to the dilution,
the dilute concentration of

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.900
the impurity, that we
don't violate the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.610
Pauli Exclusion Principle.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.590
So these are all sitting at the
same level and that's why

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.540
they've given temperature
promotes all of them up into

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.830
the conduction band, where
they are mobile.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.410
And then, just to complete the
review, we call this n-type

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.690
because, thanks to doping, we
generate electrons in the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.230
conduction band, and electrons
are negative.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.220
Supervalent doping
gives us n-type.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.080
Then the total number of
electrons in the conduction

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.440
band is the sum of those that
would have been generated by

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.530
plain old thermal excitation.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.620
Thermal excitation operates
all the time.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.500
So with thermal excitation,
recall, we promote from the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.160
valence band up into the
conduction band.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.080
So we break one of these bonds,
shoot an electron up

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.280
here, and leave a hole behind.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.100
So this generates the pair.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.870
Hole in the valence band,
and electron in

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.320
the conduction band.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.410
That's always operative, but
owing to the energies

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.650
involved, the band gap is on
the order of one electron

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.420
volt, whereas the donor level
sits only about 1/50 of an

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.470
electron volt below the
conduction band.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.820
So we get very, very little
promotion at room temperature.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.680
And in fact, it's something like
10 to the minus 19 is the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.110
fraction of promotion, and if
you say roughly 10 to the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.260
twenty-third per cubic
centimeter, that means you've

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.650
got about 10 to the fourth
electrons per cubic centimeter

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.680
due to this thermal excitation
from the valence band to the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.120
conduction band.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.880
Normally, when you dope a
semiconductor, you dope it

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.080
around parts per
million level.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.110
And parts per million, that's
10 to the minus 6.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.680
If you take 10 to the minus 6
times 10 to the 23, you get

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.960
about 10 of the 17.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.600
Now you can see, 10 of the 17
is vastly larger than 10 of

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.360
the fourth.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.180
So for all intents and purposes,
once you've doped

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.780
something, this contribution is
essentially 0, and so the

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.140
electron population, the
conduction band, is that

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.070
dictated by the impurity atoms,
which is why we say

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.130
that this is exhibiting
extrinsic behavior.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.850
The intrinsic properties
are not

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.135
visible, they're not palpable.

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:47.610
They're immeasurable.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.180
So intrinsic is substantially
less than extrinsic.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.070
Now, the last thing I wanted
to do for you before we say

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.030
goodbye to this fascinating
topic, which lays the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.730
groundwork for everything that
we know in the modern

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.790
electronic era, parenthetically,
is to look at

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.250
the other type of doping.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.810
I've showed you how to make
an n-type semiconductor.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.100
How do we make a p-type
semiconductor?

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.930
So in that case, what
we can do is dope

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.560
with a subvalent impurity.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.860
What do I mean by subvalent?

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.770
Well, the valency of silicon
is 4, so I want

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.020
something less than 4.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.770
So a good example is
boron into silicon.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.640
So boron is group 13, or 3, all
right, if you look on your

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.600
periodic table.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.190
And silicon is group
14, according

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.220
to the IUPAC notation.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.900
So let's go back and take a look
at how that might appear.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.440
So I'm going to draw the
silicon crystal.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.380
Remember, this is going into a
single crystal of silicon.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.650
So silicon is sp 3 hybridized,
and we have silicons

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.660
everywhere in the structure.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.560
So we're going to
put silicons.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.150
And I'm trying to show
sp 3 hybridization.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.680
So this is 3 legs each in the
plane, then you've got 109

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.340
degrees here.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.020
So that's silicon, and so on.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.450
I get the three of them
just to complete

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.510
enough of the picture.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.940
And now what we're going to
do, is introduced boron.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.590
And boron goes into the
silicon lattice

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.300
and covalently bonds.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.950
It doesn't go sit in some void
space in between the silicons.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.900
It actually sits on
a silicon site and

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.990
substitutes for the silicon.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.390
Now, boron is group 13.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.400
It's got 3 valence electrons.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.920
And so it forms bonds
with 3 silicons.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.480
And now there's a fourth silicon
here, and that silicon

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.890
has an electron, but
the boron doesn't

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.270
have a fourth electron.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.150
Here's where it gets
interesting.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.900
The driving force to complete
the picture here is so great

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.840
that the system will actually
pull an electron out of a

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.340
silicon-silicon bond--

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.420
and so I'm going to use a
different color chalk, and I'm

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.370
going to indicate, just for
argument's sake, that we're

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.170
going to pull an electron out of
this bond here, break this

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.490
bond, and shoot that electron
over to here.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.450
That way, we get r months
around the boron.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.220
It says p3 hybridized.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.100
It just doesn't have that
extra electron.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.510
But now it rips the electron
out of this

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.120
silicon-silicon bond.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.640
And what's the consequence
of breaking this bod?

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.770
What's the electrical feature
that we've created here?

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.790
A hole.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.300
So now we've created a hole
somewhere else in the crystal

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.400
in order to satisfy the
desire of boron to

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.330
get that fourth bond.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.370
And now can you see that for
every boron that I introduced

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.060
into the crystal, I'm
going to make a hole

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.640
somewhere in the crystal.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.080
And on the energy level
diagram, where

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.330
do those holes live?

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.080
Those holes live in
the valence band.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.750
So let's go make the energy
level diagram.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.520
So up here we have the
conduction band, and

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.220
downstairs, we have the valence
band, as before.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.520
And I'm going to assume that we
got the thermal promotion.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.220
But it's so tiny in comparison
to the amount of boron we're

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:16.760
going to put in.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.150
I'm not going to muddy the
water here and show that

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.340
you've got pair formation.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.720
Because the extent of it is so
small, it doesn't make any

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.540
difference.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.850
So now what happens?

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.010
Now, I know I'm going to
generate holes here, and I've

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.980
got to show this energy level.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.090
And this bonding level
is different from

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.060
this bonding level.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.810
Agree?

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.440
Silicon-silicon bond has
different bond energy from

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.460
boron-silicon bond.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.500
So that means the top
of the valence band

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.810
is different from--

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.920
because this valence band is
silicon-silicon-silicon.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.150
So it turns out that, and this
is not to scale, that the

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.330
energy level of this bond is
just a little bit higher.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:02.170
And this is an energy level that
involves the accepting of

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.000
electrons, whereas in
the other case, we

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.900
were donating electrons.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.760
Hence, that's called
the donor level.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.780
This is called the
acceptor level.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.530
And it's about 1/50 of an
electron volt above the top of

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.670
the valence band.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.020
And so what happens is that in
order to make this bond, we

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:31.630
move something out of the
valence band up into the

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.410
acceptor level and
generate a hole.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.930
And so for every boron that
we put in, we have

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.080
another broken bond.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.900
And all of these lie at the same
level, but the dilution

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.720
is so high, that they're so
far apart, that they don't

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.080
violate the polyexplosion
principle.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.410
They're thermally promoted
up, and away we go.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.640
So now, under these
circumstances, the number of

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.930
negative charge carriers no
longer equals the number of

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.600
positive charge carriers.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.140
Because I've got all these
positive charge carriers.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.990
Thanks to the introduction of
boron, p is greater than n.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:13.820
So we've made a p-type
semiconductor, by the

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.390
introduction of a subvalent
impurity.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.520
And we can redo the entire
central part of last day's

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.850
lesson, which was
the Bohr model.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.860
Now, this is the sexiest
part of the Bohr

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.450
model I've ever seen.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.750
This is really, really cool.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.840
The hole is mobile!

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.620
The hole is mobile!

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:41.980
And the boron is a little bit
shy of protons, right?

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.620
It's 3 in a land of 4.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.580
So it's negative.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:57.000
So I've got a stationary
negative center, and I've got

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.340
something positive revolving
around a negative center.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.670
This is an inverse Bohr model!

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.140
Because the Bohr model has a
honking big positive center

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.340
with a dinky little electron
revolving around.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.660
We've got the immobile negative
center, and the

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.810
mobile hole revolving around.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.340
Go through, you get the
same set of quantum--

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.600
I mean, there's a whole bunch
of quantum levels in here.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.940
Fantastic!

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.200
How far that Bohr model
can take us.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.130
So now you know how to make a
p-type semiconductor, you know

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.100
how to make an n-type
semiconductor.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.830
And then what you can do
is put them together.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:41.190
And you can put, say,
boron-doped silicon opposite

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.310
phosphorus-doped silicon.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.050
Be careful here.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.680
The fonts are really critical.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.530
This is uppercase P,
for phosphorus.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.090
This is lowercase p, for
positive doping.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.190
So don't go, oh, P, phosphorus,

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.450
that means it's p-type.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.970
No, P gives you extra
electrons.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.360
It's n-type.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.980
So that's what uppercase P.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.720
This is a lowercase p.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.450
This is p-type.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.820
So now I've got p-type,
n-type, and so

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.020
what do I have here?

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.600
I've got a p-n junction.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.750
And this is the beginning
of solid state devices,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.810
rectification of A/C current,
diodes, you name it.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.960
And it all starts with
this, the chemistry.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.290
This is the birth of the
transistor, and all the modern

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.980
electronics that we have
based on that.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.735
Later on, we'll show you how you
get the boron in, and how

00:12:43.735 --> 00:12:44.940
you get the phosphorus in.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.130
You don't just come in and
sprinkle it on top, and hope

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.920
that it goes to the
lattice site.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.110
There's a lot of processing
involved.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.740
OK.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:57.670
So this is where I want to
hold for the unit on

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.910
semiconductors, and how
it fits into the

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.190
grand scheme of things.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.790
So in the books, you'll see--

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.020
this is a very crude drawing,
because this is showing n-type

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:14.410
semiconductor with grossly
exaggerated numbers of donor

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.540
electronics up here.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.350
There's no mention of
the donor level.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.420
So this is sort of

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.390
semiconductivity, sort of pre-3091.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:27.900
This is extrinsic semiconduction
for idiots, I

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.960
guess you'd call it.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.910
And then, same thing here.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.550
You see all of the holes
in the valence band.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.800
We know better, because we know
there's an acceptor level

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.340
and there's a donor level.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.990
OK.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.850
So now we're going
to switch gears.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.390
Now here's the big transition,
right now.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.600
If the last two lectures didn't
leave high school

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.090
behind, today we leave
high school behind.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.090
So those of you who have been
coasting up until now, thanks

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.230
to your very good high
school background,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.390
start paying attention.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.700
Because it's high
school no more.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.790
So just to remind you
where we've come.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.630
We started over here, at the
beginning of the semester.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.980
And the big theme is going to
be, electronic structure

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.530
informs bonding, which informs
state of aggregation.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.890
State of aggregation is
solid, liquid, or gas.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.330
So I want to show you how
we get to where we are.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.300
So we did all of these
topics, right?

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.980
Bohr, or Sommerfeld quantum
numbers, multielectron.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.110
And then we came to
octet stability.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.430
And with octet stability,
we went a long way.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.980
We got into ionic bonding.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:32.300
We got into completing
the valence shell.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.270
And in fact, all of this
is a consequence

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.060
of the octet stability.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.430
And that led us into
the various

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.610
types of primary bonding.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.720
Ionic, covalent, metallic.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.510
And in some instances,
van der Waals.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.940
Solid argon is van
der Waals bond.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.840
It's the only kind of bonding,
so it's the primary bonding.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.980
But in some cases, like HCl,
how do you get liquid HCl?

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.290
How do you get solid methane?

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.690
So we had invoke secondary
bonding for some of these

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.880
covalent molecules, and that
invoked dipole-dipole

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.150
interaction, the London
dispersion force, which is the

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.710
same as the van der Walls bond,
but I decided to mix

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.650
things up, so that both men get
a little bit of attention,

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.290
none of them feel slighted.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.700
And finally, hydrogen bonding,
in those special instances.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.480
And that allowed us to then
determine whether something

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.700
was a gas, a liquid,
or a solid.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.140
And when it's a solid,
we're happy.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.320
Because this is 3091,
and we're interested

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.910
in the solid state.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.280
By the way, what is a solid?

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.420
Well, here's an operative
definition.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.210
That which is dimensionally
stable, has a

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.620
volume of its own.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.370
It doesn't distort in
a gravity field.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.750
All right?

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.880
Liquids will distort.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.490
Fluids, gases will distort.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.870
Now, there's two ways of
classifying solids.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.900
One is bonding type.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.310
That's what we did here.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.860
But the second way of
classifying solids is based on

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.355
atomic arrangements.

00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:50.150
All right?

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.910
So let's look at that.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.550
There's only two types of
atomic arrangement.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.820
Ordered and disordered.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.670
I love these taxonomies
that split everything

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.160
into a choice of 2.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.790
That way, you just sort of go
through life and decide, is it

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.900
left or is it right?

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.650
Is it up or is it down?

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.150
Is it ordered or is
it disordered?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.380
So what are the characteristics

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.510
or an ordered solid?

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.100
It has a regular atomic
arrangement.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.680
That means it's got a
long-range order.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.710
And I'll show you that in an
ordered solid, I know not only

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.690
where my next nearest neighbor
is, where my tenth nearest

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.100
neighbor is.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.690
I know where my hundred and
fifty second nearest neighbor

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.350
is, because it's an
ordered solid.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.720
And we have a simple Anglo-Saxon
word for an

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.590
ordered solid.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.710
It's called crystal.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.460
So when I say something is a
metallic crystal, I don't mean

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.510
it's something that's got
magical properties, and if I

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.600
put it over my head, I get
powerful or something.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.080
It just means I've got atoms
in an atomic regular

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.540
arrangement.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.190
Now contrasting to that
is a disordered solid.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.010
And in that case, we have
a random arrangement.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.980
But I put an asterisk here
because, as they say in

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.610
California, it's not
totally random.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.460
It's only random
up to a point.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.470
No long-range order.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.930
There may be short-range
order.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.050
In other words, I know what my
next nearest neighbor is, but

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.550
I probably don't know where my
tenth nearest neighbor is

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.850
Because the coordination shell
is established, but the next

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.420
coordination shell, and the
next coordination shell,

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.410
they're not established.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.590
And I'm going to show you, with
examples, what that means

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.160
So we call those kinds of
disordered solids amorphous

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.100
solids, as opposed to the
regular solids, which are

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.380
crystalline solids.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.580
And there's a plain Anglo-Saxon
word for a

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.790
disordered solid.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.910
It's glass.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.380
Now you might think, well, gee,
doesn't glass mean that

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.230
it's transparent in
visible light?

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.330
No, no.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.540
Maybe up until now, but I want
everybody who's ever taken

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.660
3091 from me to be disabused of
the notion that glass means

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.620
transparent.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.260
How do we think about the
question of transparency?

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.990
And here I mean transparency
vis-a-vis visible light.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.830
I'm not going to say, what's
transparent to x-rays?

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.560
That's pedantry.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.310
So how do we think about
whether something is

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.430
transparent to visible light?

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.230
We just ask ourselves, is the
band gap greater than 3

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.090
electron volts?

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.210
The band gap is greater than 3
electron volts, visible light

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.185
zooms right through.

00:18:20.185 --> 00:18:23.430
It doesn't have enough energy
to excite the electrons, be

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.780
absorbed, and re-emit.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.980
So that's what transparency
means.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.130
So I can have the kind of
material that's used in things

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.820
like eyeglasses.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.300
It's transparent to visible
light because of

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.940
its high band gap.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.390
Diamond, diamond is transparent
to visible light,

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.950
and you wouldn't dare insult
diamond by saying

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.700
that diamond is glass!

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.030
In fact, watch the old gangster
movies from the

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.790
1930s, that was the derogatory
term for fake diamonds.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.270
You call them glass.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.340
So how is it that diamond, which
is crystalline, it's

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.850
transparent to visible light,
and yet the window glass that

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.740
we have is transparent
to visible light?

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.800
It has nothing to do with
state of order.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.100
Has everything to
do with this.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.650
In fact, David, if we could
shoot to the document camera,

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.700
I'll show you a piece of glass
that's not transparent to

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.340
visible light.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.240
How do we zoom in
on this thing?

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.890
OK.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:21.460
Auto focus.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.530
So what I'm showing you is
a piece of obsidian.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.320
It's a naturally occurring
mineral.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.680
It's rich in silica, and it's
turned dark because it's got

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.810
some iron impurity, and the iron
absorbs in the visible.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.050
And this is clearly not
transparent to visible light,

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.760
and yet, it is a disordered
solid.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.510
This is a glassy solid.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.920
In fact, the white
speckles there

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.730
are devitrified obsidian.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.440
It's actually started
to crystallize.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.040
So the crystalline form is the
part that's transparent.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.220
If you could peel off this
crystalline form, you'd

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.370
actually end up with
something that's

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.430
transparent to visible light.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.920
So here's an example of where
the crystalline form is

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.930
transparent to visible light,
and the glassy form is opaque.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:11.240
So glass has nothing to
do with transparency.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.290
This is how you think about the
question of transparency.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:15.600
OK.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.950
So let's cut back to the
slides, David, please.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.100
So we're now going to start by
looking at ordered solids.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.900
So we're going to take next
several lessons and talk about

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.760
ordered solids, and then after
that, we're going to take a

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.150
few more lessons and talk
about distorted solids.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.510
Now first of all, what's
the term crystal?

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.310
Where does it come from?

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.100
It comes from the Greek word,
crystallus, which is the Greek

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.570
word for ice.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.720
That's where we get
the term crystal.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.190
So we're going to start
with a history lesson.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.670
That's how we start everything
in 3091.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:50.550
A history lesson.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.950
So we go way, way back to
Isaac Newton's time.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.070
The Reformation, Charles, Oliver
Cromwell, all those

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.900
exciting times.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.990
In merry old England, there
was Robert Hook.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:06.120
You know him from Hook's
Law, in mechanics.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.060
So he was doing military
research in 1660.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.320
He was trying to understand what
was the optimal way to

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.010
stack cannon balls.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.160
So when you're on a battle
front, you want to figure out

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.310
how to keep your material
compactly arranged.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.810
You don't lie them
on the ground.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.690
So from that, he concluded that
crystal that is a regular

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.560
array must owe its shape
to the packing

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.142
of spherical particles.

00:21:30.142 --> 00:21:31.320
So that's what he was thinking,

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:31.980
or trying to imagine.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.410
Remember, Democritus said that
we have these indivisible

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.800
particles, but no one had
ever seen them before.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.790
Then in 1669, a Dane by the
name of Steenson who was

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.980
working in Italy was looking
at quartz crystals.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.040
And he was studying various
quartz crystals.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.740
By that I mean, quartz crystals
of different sizes.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.900
And what he observed was, didn't
matter what the size of

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.050
the crystal was.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.690
They always had the same
angles between

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.240
corresponding faces.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.340
So if I give you a big crystal
and a smaller crystal of the

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.220
same material, and a smaller
crystal, and they all have the

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.770
same shape, Can you imagine that
you might conclude that

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.460
that is reflective of something
down at the atomic

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.200
level, and if you could get down
to the atomic level, that

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.700
spacial arrangement would
hold right now?

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.940
Because that's how
it grew, right?

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.810
It started from a small number
of atoms and grew, grew, grew.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.470
Why would it start with one
shape, and all of a sudden

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.430
change to another shape?

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.800
It doesn't make any sense.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.770
At least, not to me.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.780
And certainly not to Steenson.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.840
And then we go to
Holland, 1690.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.610
Christiaan Huygens.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.160
And he was studying
calcite crystals.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.350
And he drew drawings of atomic
packing and bulk shape.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.180
This is 1960.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.010
I'm going ot show you an
image from his book.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.860
This was drawn in 1690.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.260
See, this is stacking of
cannonballs, but he was

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.690
looking at a calcite crystal.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.950
Actually, Dave, could we cut
back to the document camera?

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.400
We're going to do a
fair bit of this.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.660
I'll show you calcite crystal.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.710
This is what he had
to work with.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:56.960
It looks like this.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.100
To give you a sense of scale--

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.165
what do I have?

00:23:05.165 --> 00:23:06.760
Do I have anything
you'd recognize?

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.980
OK, here's a soda can to give
you a sense of scale, OK?

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.890
This is one honking big
calcite crystal.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.960
I got it as a gift from someone
who watched 3091

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.180
lectures on OpenCourseWare.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.680
And he said, if I ever
come to town, can

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.600
I attend your lecture?

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.280
I said, sure.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.180
And he showed up, he attended
the lecture.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.990
He was a man probably in his
early 40s, and as a pastime he

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.180
collects gemstones.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.180
And he gave me this giant
calcite crystal, because the

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.040
one I was using before
was so pathetic.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.530
He said, I've got
to give you one.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.920
And then, I thought, jeez,
if I could ever come upon

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.180
somebody who's in the
gold business--

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.110
and you know, he might give me
a big honking crystal of

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.080
face-centered cubic metal
called gold--

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.860
which broke $1,000 an ounce
yesterday, but--

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.770
anyways, if you're out there,
and you're watching these

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.820
lectures, I'm here.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:01.500
It's 8201, and you can
see any anytime.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.410
My assistant's name is Hillary,
she'll take the call.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:04.820
All right.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.230
So let's go back
to the slides.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.770
Dave, could we cut to
the slides, please?

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:11.880
Thanks.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.140
All right.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.940
So now--

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.030
oh, I'm going to show
you a few others.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.850
Remember, here's the idea, that
we're looking down to the

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.690
elemental level.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.965
So if you look on your periodic
table, it says 10,

00:24:21.965 --> 00:24:24.560
you see, 10, it's supposed
to be tetragonal.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.930
So here's a crystal of 10.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:26.940
Dave, cut back, please.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.526
We're going to go back and
forth today a lot.

00:24:29.526 --> 00:24:32.170
There's a piece of ten 10.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.610
So you might look at it
and say, gee, that

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.380
looks kind of cubic.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:41.120
But if you look carefully, the
vertical dimension is greater

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.930
than the horizontal.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.080
In fact, it's got
a square base.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.870
And then, this is
the tall one.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:51.000
Which, if we cut back to
the slides, let's see.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.520
And that's what tetragonal
looks like.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.440
And we'll study all of these
in a few minutes.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.990
These are some giant crystals
I didn't dare drag in.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.050
This is sort of human-sized
scale.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.190
This is balsalt, which is a
magnesium iron silicate.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.170
It's on a coast of Iceland.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.180
Dave, let's show them
a few more.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.180
Here's one more, if we go
to the document camera.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.680
This was beryllium aluminum
silicate.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.910
This is a barrel.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.215
And you can see, this has
got a hexagonal habit.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.780
So something's going on at the
atomic level that's different

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.360
as we go from one crystal
structure to the other.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.250
What else have I got here?

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.320
Here's some calcite, here's
some fluorite.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.410
Look at this one.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:39.420
This is square pyramidal
but it's ionic.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.190
So don't give me any of
that sp3 d2 stuff.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.740
Because it's not going
to work here.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.850
All right.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.960
Let's go back to the
slides, please.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.570
So then we jump to
1781, to France.

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:01.100
Rene Juste-Hauy was at the
Sorbonne, and he was studying

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.900
the cleavage of calcite
crystals.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.890
In other words, he was
taking these things

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:05.670
and breaking them.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.040
So he'd go to work every
day and break things.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.710
And he studied the shards, and
he found that the shards were

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.300
all rhombahedral.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.150
the same shape as the
parent crystal.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.070
No matter how small the
shards got, they

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.650
always looked like this.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.580
He didn't end up with
cubic shards.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.245
He didn't end up with
long slivers.

00:26:22.245 --> 00:26:25.830
He always ended up with
rhombahedral slices.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.960
So the other thing is that he
didn't end up with any voids.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.790
No matter how he cut this thing,
he never got voids.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:36.740
So he reasoned that this must be
the way things are packing

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.330
in three space perfectly.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.100
So then he said, gee.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.540
If they pack perfectly
rhombahedrally--

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.370
we all know that we can stack
boxes together perfectly,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.510
cubes together.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.100
So he, being a Frenchman, said,
what's the mathematical

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.160
formulation?

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.280
They were steeped in
mathematics there.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.320
That wasn't a slur against
the French.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.300
It's a compliment.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.720
He said, what are the
mathematically distinct

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.370
shapes, that if we stack them
together in three space they

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.800
will fill three space
with no void?

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.370
And the answer is seven.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.870
Seven space-filling
volume elements.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:17.890
By the way, the gabled milk
carton isn't one of them.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.850
And so he called the crystal
system, so I call seven

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.050
distinct shades of
milk cartons.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.850
And these are the seven crystal
systems, and they're

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.680
described geometrically, and
you'll get a chance to go

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.010
through them.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:30.940
The cube is one of them.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.690
Tetragonal.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.850
Here's the calcite,
rhombahedral.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.725
There's barrel, hexagonal,
and so on.

00:27:36.725 --> 00:27:40.510
The seven different ways you
can feel three space.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.680
And this is from the archival
readings of my predecessor,

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.080
Professor Witt.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.680
Actually, just to give your
a sense, here's the

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.940
two-dimensional analogy.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.190
If I said to you, we're going
to open a company, and we're

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.890
going to make bathroom tile, and
we want to make it sort of

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.840
an upscale company, you know,
not everybody wants boring old

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.160
square tiles.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.910
But definitely, I can cover two
space with square tiles by

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.540
putting them side by side,
one on top of the other.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.180
What's another way I can fill?

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.800
I can go with rectangular
tiles.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.210
So this dimension is different
from that dimension.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:12.970
What's another way?

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:17.770
I can use a rhombus, right,
at 60 degrees.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:22.540
Or I can use just a plain old
parallelepipede at some

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.620
arbitrary angle.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.550
And if you go over to the Stata
Center, to the Gehry

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.400
building, take a look at
the shape that they

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.850
chose as the unit cell.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.870
This is the repeat group, if
you like, or the unit cell,

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.770
because that's the one that's
going to be cookie cutter

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.660
replicated, side by side.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.470
When you're putting the skin
on a building, you have to

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.830
make everything fit with
no holidays, right?

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.810
Because you don't want gaps.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:54.340
what they chose was
this area element.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.680
And all the pieces of stainless
steel are cut to

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.670
this shape.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.340
And that's how you
make things fit.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.510
How you take something and make
it fit around a three

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.160
dimensional object is tricky.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.270
It's the same thing as the
clothing problem, right?

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.510
How do you take a flat piece of
cloth and make it fit the

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.100
contour of the human body?

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.750
At least, you know, in men's
clothes, you know, we've got

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.220
dimensions.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.540
We've got sleeve length, got
waist, chest. We've got all

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.110
these numbers.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.890
For a woman, 8.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.920
One number?

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.070
One number?

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.572
Fashion designers don't
know crystallograpy!

00:29:27.572 --> 00:29:29.700
If they knew crystallography,
they'd know how

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.480
to specify the shapes!

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.860
If you understand this, you can
start your own business

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.950
and make clothes that fit.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.310
And I guarantee you, there's
a market out there for

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.420
clothes that fit.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.560
What about this one?

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.320
Pentagon.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.820
We're going to make pentagonal
bathroom tile.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.560
Well, when we install these,
we're going to have to use two

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.170
different colors.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.050
You can see this
up here, right?

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.390
This is pentagonal
bathroom tile.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:53.970
It doesn't fit.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.960
You've got all these
white spots.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.550
So this is not a unit cell.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.900
This is not one of the crystal
systems for two dimensional.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.850
So this one's no good.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.370
We better put an x through it,
in case someone fell asleep,

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:09.100
and wake up, and then tell
me that that's OK.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:09.540
All right.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.400
So then we move about half
a century forward, to the

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.560
turbulent year 1848,
also in France.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.300
Auguste Bravais.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.970
And what Bravais did, is
he said, all right.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.120
This is just filling space.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.320
But where are the atoms?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.310
I haven't told you where
the atoms are, right?

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.430
You know, as far as you're
concerned, maybe there's one

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.270
atom in each of these boxes.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.890
Or maybe there's atoms at
the corners of the box.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.410
Or maybe there's atoms
at the corner and the

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.080
center of the box.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.120
Where are the atoms?

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.700
I've simply told you that I
can fill three space with

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.350
boxes, or with these rectangular
boxes, and so on.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.470
So he set out mathematically
to prove how many different

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.500
arrangements of points
there are in space.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.640
It's sort of like saying, if I
want to tell you where all the

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.930
apples are in the orchard, I'm
going to tell you where the

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.850
trees are, and I'm going
to tell you where the

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.370
apples are on a tree.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:04.120
So where do the atoms go
inside these boxes?

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:09.130
Turns out there's 14 different
arrangements.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:10.140
And what do I mean by that?

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.190
This is a good example.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.980
So we've already established
that the cube is a

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.690
space-filling volume element.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.020
It's one of the seven.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.850
But look.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.660
If I'm one of the atoms at the
corners here, I've got six

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.350
nearest neighbors.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.780
This is also a cube, but it's
got atoms at the corners and

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.610
an atom in the center.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.130
You might say, well, what's
the big deal?

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.220
If you're in the atom in the
center, and you look to the

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.020
nearest neighbors, you've got
eight nearest neighbors.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.190
Here you only have six
nearest neighbors.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:42.900
So this is spatially
differentiated from this.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.340
So what why don't
we keep going?

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.410
And by the way, the same
environment of that central

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.530
atom that's coded green is the
same environment of any of the

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.440
atoms on the corners.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.860
They're all symmetric.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.230
So both are cubes, but they
have different space point

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.240
environments.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.070
And here's a third one, where
we put atoms at the corners

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.620
and atoms on each
of the faces.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.550
So this atom on the face, you
can see, it's got one, two,

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.030
three, four atoms in
the plane, three

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.800
behind, three in front.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.210
It's got 12 nearest neighbors.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.910
This has got eight nearest
neighbors, this has got six

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:12.980
nearest neighbors.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.350
So Bravais went through and he
said, let's take those seven

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.780
crystal systems. Let's put atoms
in distinguishable ways.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.240
How many distinguishable ways
can we come up with atom

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:24.810
arrangements?

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.345
And the answer is 14.

00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:29.130
Now, what we're going to do in
3091, is we're just going to

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.570
confine our conversation
to the cubics.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:36.500
Because you use orthogonal
vectors, they're all the same

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.010
length, the mathematics
are simple, and the

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.120
principles are the same.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.200
And by the way, boatloads
of materials are

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.270
in the cubic system.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.400
So it's not as though we just
chose something that's

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.070
convenient but irrelevant.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.450
So here are the different
Bravais lattices.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.710
So you can see the cubic,
there's simple cubic,

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.700
body-centered cubic,
face-centered cubic.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.250
With tetragonal, there
is simple tetragonal,

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.100
body-centered tetragonal.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.490
There's no face-center
tetragonal.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.550
If you try to make face-center
tetragonal it's degenerate,

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.980
reverts to one of the
other systems.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.450
So these are the distinguishable
systems. And

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.910
everything, including
crystalline proteins--

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:20.180
if the protein crystallizes, it
forms atomic arrangements

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.300
in one of these Bravais
lattices.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.770
Everything conforms to one of
these Bravais lattices.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.760
And if it doesn't, it means it
lacks long-range order, in

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.620
which case it is a glass.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.870
That's it.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.930
So here's face-centered cubic.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.280
You can see the placement.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.670
But there's something that's
been simplified here.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:47.540
Right now what you see is a
single atom, designated by a

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:48.470
hard sphere.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:52.660
But at each of these lattice
points, I can put

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:53.550
more than one atom.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.450
So let me show you what
I mean by that.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:00.120
What I want to do, is put
different numbers of atom

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.930
arrangements at the
lattice point.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.090
So those positions, the
distinguishable positions, are

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.450
called lattice points.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.890
And now I want to define
the crystal structure--

00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:13.080
the crystal structure is the
complete accounting of atomic

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.300
arrangement.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:20.630
It's the complete description
of atomic arrangement.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.510
And we don't have to go too far,
because we just have to

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.920
get the base unit, the unit
cell, and then just

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.840
repeat the unit cell.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.020
Complete description of
atomic arrangement.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.540
And so how we going
to go about this?

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.250
We're going to start with
a Bravais lattice.

00:34:42.504 --> 00:34:44.140
And what is the Bravais
lattice?

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.479
The Bravais lattice is simply
a point environment.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.610
And this will mean something to
you in about three minutes,

00:34:53.610 --> 00:35:00.490
when I give you the rest
of the description.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:09.190
So it's a set of points in
space and the basis.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.140
And what is the basis?

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.740
The basis is the atom group
at each lattice point.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.260
So what do we mean by that?

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.270
Well, let's look at what's
up on the board.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.800
What's up on the board is
face-centered cubic.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.810
So let's do all of these.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:37.440
So we're going to say that the
Bravais lattice, in this case,

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.990
in face-centered cubic, FCC.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.100
That's what this one is,
up on the board.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.870
And we've got dots indicate
the points.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:45.130
Because really, the points
are nothing.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.080
It's a concept.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.850
See, it's French.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.430
It's a concept, right?

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.930
What's this?

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:50.760
See what I'm holding?

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.100
I'm holding a Bravais lattice.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.050
It's just a set of points.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:58.910
It's like a John Cage piece,
you know, a bunch of rests.

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:01.820
So if I go to the piano
and I play rests in

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:05.050
five four time, listen.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:05.680
Isn't that great?

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.040
Man, it's fantastic.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.660
All the different rests,
and different--

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.130
So this is a set of
lattice points.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.060
Now I'm going to put
something on them.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.880
You think I'm kidding.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.640
I'm not.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:15.910
All right.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.160
Now what's the basis?

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.455
If I put a single atom, we have
what's up on the slide.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.880
And so that's the representation
of metal.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.280
So for example, gold is FCC,
with a single gold atom at

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.300
each lattice point.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.870
Aluminum, copper, platinum.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.540
These are all FCC metals.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.570
So there's a single atom at
Bravais lattice point, and so

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:49.190
the crystal structure
is known as FCC.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.780
It's the same as the
Bravais lattice.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.660
It's called FCC.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.420
OK.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.960
Now, we can also put a molecule
at each lattice site.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.940
So I'm going to put
up the FCC here.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:03.800
Here's the FCC.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.790
There's the cube, the set of
lattice points, and the

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.050
lattice points are--

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.220
I'm going to just illustrate
on the front face.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.870
One, two, three, four, and a
fifth atom at the front face.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.080
Now these are the points.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.690
I could either put simple atoms
there, and the central

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.900
image there shows what happens
when you have the close-packed

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.510
arrangement, the atoms are
so big that they touch.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.940
Or what I could do, at
each lattice point,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.640
I could put a molecule.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.640
So for example, I could
put methane.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.890
I could put CH4.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.260
A methane molecule.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:40.660
Because when one of you gets
to Jupiter, and you see the

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.360
methane ice, and you go, oh.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.250
That's FCC.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.860
Because everybody else on the
mission hasn't taken 3091.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.390
They don't have a clue what
they're looking at.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.500
But you go, that's face-centered
cubic.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.410
And they go, huh?

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:57.560
And this is at each
lattice site.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.290
You see, my point is, now look,
here's the difference.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:06.970
All five of these, the carbon
and the four hydrogens, sit at

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:08.010
this lattice site.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.260
All five atoms sit at
this lattice site.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.110
It's not that the carbon goes
here, one hydrogen goes over

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.760
at one lattice site, one
hydrogen over here.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.960
You don't have the methane
straddling the unit cell.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.360
You have all five atoms
here, five atoms here.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.750
At every lattice point, I
have all five atoms at

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.690
each lattice point.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.580
So in that case, we also
have, it's FCC.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.430
So methane ice is face-centered
cubic.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:39.350
Because it's spherical.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:43.040
They pack just like gold
atoms. You know, from a

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.650
distance, we can model this
as a sphere, as a point.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.352
Or we could put an ion pair.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:55.720
An example of that is sodium
and chloride, and this is

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.350
called rock salt crystal
structure.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:58.950
Rock salt.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:59.820
Let's look at that one.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.420
So at each last lattice point,
I'm going to put two ions.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.980
Not one, two.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.980
This is taken from your text.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.880
So you might look at this and
say, well, here's the front.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.340
You might look at this and say,
well, isn't this kind of

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.250
like simple cubic?

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.190
Because I've got one, two,
three, four, but I've got

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.090
different atoms if I
try it that way.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.800
See, this is taken from
a different book.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.930
I did some highlighting on it.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.450
So this is sodium
chloride again.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.440
One, two, three, four, five.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.810
With this lattice site, I put
the chloride atom and the

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:31.670
sodium atom.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:34.310
The pair of atoms are
associated with

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.080
this lattice site.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.930
You might say, yeah, but
this is way over here.

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.030
Doesn't matter.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.610
I'm going to anchor all of those
to this lattice site.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.830
To this lattice site, I'm going
to anchor this and the

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.170
sodium ion.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.050
So this is not simple cubic.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.150
Because if I try to call this
simple cubic, I have different

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.880
atoms at different lattice
sites, and that's a no-no.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.050
Has to be the same.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:01.330
So if I associate the pair,
chloride ion and sodium ion,

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.590
chloride ion and sodium ion,
chloride ion and a sodium ion

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.300
not depicted.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.790
It's off the diagram here.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:11.230
And I put these dots at the
center of each chloride ion.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.810
Can you see that I'm
at the face of FCC?

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:18.990
So that's an FCC Bravais
lattice, but it's got two

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.970
atoms, in this case, both ions,
associated with each

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:23.220
lattice point.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.890
I will come to the
dogs in a second.

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:30.420
And now there's a last
one I can do.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:35.380
And that's got two atoms,
but not an ion pair.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.680
We're going to put
an atom pair.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:45.440
Got an atom pair, and that
looks like this.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:50.160
I'm going to put a carbon atom,
one carbon atom, and a

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.900
second carbon atom.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.610
And this angle here
is 109 degrees.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.090
And I'm going to put this pair
of carbon atoms together, and

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:01.510
when I do that, and I replicate
that through FCC, I

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.970
end up with diamond cubic.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:12.380
And I'll show you a
three-dimensional example of

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.330
that next day.

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.490
So just bear in mind that if you
have an ion pair, you end

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:18.290
up with rock salt.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.640
If I show you this pair,
this is due to the sp3

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.600
hybridization.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.390
And so examples of this one
are diamond, not graphite,

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.970
just diamond, silicon--

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:32.630
so everything that I've shown
you about single crystals, and

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.770
intrinsic and extrinsic
semiconduction, is diamond

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.490
cubic crystal structure.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.850
But it's not one of the
Bravais lattices.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:43.790
It's an FCC Bravais
lattice with two

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.040
atoms per lattice site.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.850
That's diamond cubic
crystal structure.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.980
But it extends to
two dimensions.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.710
So here's an Escher print.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.520
It's got all these dogs.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.460
In two dimensions, what's the
crystal structure here?

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.100
Well, there's no such thing
as body-centered cubic.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.310
There's no third dimension
in two dimensions.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:10.690
So you've only got simple cubic
or face-centered cubic.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:11.940
So what do we have here?

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.640
Well, you see, you've
got a problem.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.820
Because the black dogs are
facing the opposite direction

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.540
of the white dogs.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.200
So you can't go one, two,
three, four, and make

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:23.960
anything that way.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:29.040
So instead, I put dots on the,
I don't know what you call

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.090
this part of the dog.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.250
I don't know.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.340
This part of the dog.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.380
The leg?

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.880
Whatever you call this thing.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.070
Yeah.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.430
You put it on the same
spot of the dog--

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.940
maybe I should have used his
eye, I know how to call it.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:40.220
Anyway.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.760
So I put these things
up, right?

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.040
And that means that if I
associate the four dogs with

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.440
this point, the two dogs facing
the right, and these

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.830
two dogs facing the left.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.730
So these four dogs are
associated with

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:52.920
this lattice site.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.090
Then I move up here, and I've
got the same thing.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.560
One, two, three four.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.850
Two dogs facing right,
two dogs facing left.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:06.040
So that means I've got a simple
cubic bravais lattice,

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.650
and the basis is four dogs.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.390
Four dogs as my basis.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.770
And with that combination of a
simple cubic lattice and four

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.900
dogs is the basis, I can make
the entire structure.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.100
That's what this is all about.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.880
That's my unit cell, that's
my repeat unit.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.060
So there's simple cubic,
right there.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.300
So instead of a single atom at
each corner, or these are

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.340
spheres that are touching,
we got the four dogs.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:34.980
Here's another one.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.480
Once I got the Escher, I kept
flipping through the book.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.860
I don't know what this thing
is, but it's creepy.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.540
Anyway.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.040
It's wallpaper.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.100
If it's wallpaper,
it's ordered.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.440
If it's ordered, it's a
two-dimensional crystal.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.080
If it's a two-dimensional
crystal, it has to conform to

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.520
one of the 14 Bravais
lattices.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.190
So which one is it?

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:57.750
So I looked at this for a while,
and I took this happy

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.570
entity here, and I put
a dot in its belly.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.660
So wherever I found one
of these, I put a dot.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.010
and then I connected the dots,
and what do I get?

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:09.230
I got the rhombus.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.990
Now, what's the basis?

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:13.470
That's the Bravais lattice.

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.630
What is the basis?

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.210
So I went over here and I said,
well, if I start from

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.630
this thing and I go all
the way up, I got some

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.350
tail, blue tail here.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.900
And this thing way down
here looks like

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.920
it's missing a tail.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.350
So if I start from this, go all
the way down to here, and

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:32.560
capture all of this material
in between and associate it

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.510
with that lattice point,
that can be my basis.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.580
And then I take that set of
imagery, and I put it on top

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:45.250
of this, where it's centered at
about this thing's navel,

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:46.690
and put it around here.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:49.170
You can see, the translation
is obvious there, and the

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.730
translation is obvious here.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.270
There's the wallpaper.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.300
So it's part of a Bravais
lattice, only in two

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.060
dimensions, you see?

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.170
This is crystallography.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.180
That's all it is.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.310
Crystallography.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.130
All right.

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:06.240
So the next thing that we have
to do, it's kind of a little

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.310
bit boring, but you need to know
this stuff, because it's

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:12.290
formative for the next unit.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.060
It's the characteristics
of cubic lattices.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.200
Now what do I mean, the
characteristics?

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.880
I mean the geometric
characteristics.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.270
So there's a table here that
I've taken out of your

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:21.880
archival reading.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.290
If you go to the website,
there's a set of notes that

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:27.880
were written by my predecessor,
Professor Witt.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.560
And if you go and look
this up, this unit on

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.610
crystallography, there's
this table.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.780
And it shows such things as
the unit cell volume.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:36.610
Well, what's the unit cell?

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.190
The unit cell is this cookie
cutter cube that's the repeat

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:44.340
unit, and it has a dimension
here called a, which is the

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.985
lattice constant.

00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:49.440
It's the size of the box.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.440
So what's the volume
of the unit cell

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.750
Well, duh, it's a cubed.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.100
That's obvious, all right?

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.200
Doesn't matter whether it's
simple cubic, face-centered

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.900
cubic, body centered cubic.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.740
How many lattice points
per unit cell?

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:05.385
Well, that's-- how many atoms
do I get per unit cell?

00:46:05.385 --> 00:46:08.120
If you look at this, you
say, well gee, it's--

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.960
you know, if you've got the
simple cubic, you've got them

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.820
at the eight corners, so
it's eight, right?

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.800
Well, no, because each atom on
the corner is inside this

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.950
cell, but it's also inside the
neighboring cell, and it's

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.200
inside each of the eight
neighboring cells.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.725
So I have eight times
one eighth.

00:46:23.725 --> 00:46:28.000
So the total amount of atom
within the cube is only one.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.110
That's why you've got to go
through this derivation.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:32.540
So here's an example for
face-centered cubic.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.190
You see the corners, one,
two, three, four?

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:36.580
There's eight of those.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.300
Eight times one eighth is one.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.770
And then you've got these atoms
on the face, and there's

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:43.130
one, two, three, four,
five, six, right?

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.850
Six faces.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:46.870
But each of these atoms
on the face is only

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.170
half inside the cube.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.420
The other half is in
the other cube.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.850
So I got six times one half is
three, and that gives me four.

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:55.270
So that's how you go through,
and figure out

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.990
what's going on.

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:58.270
And then you can look at things
like nearest neighbor

00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:00.920
distance, and what's the
relationship between the

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.860
radius, if you're looking
at hard sphere packing.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.650
So here's a good example.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:07.240
Here's the hard sphere
packing model.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.920
So I've got atoms all
the same size, and

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.360
they're packed to touch.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.830
And they're packed to touch so
that in the end, I end up with

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.000
a face centered cubic
arrangement.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.370
And so what's the relationship
between the radius and the

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.370
lattice constant?

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.170
And it's just simple
trigonometry, right?

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:27.500
4r equals 2a squared, and you go
through it, and that's how

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.090
you end up with all
these formulas.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.880
So that's what going on.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:32.220
All right.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:36.350
So I think we're going to move
to the last five minutes here.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.570
So just a couple of comments.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.340
Today we played music
when you came in.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:44.630
It was Burning Down the House.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.620
An old piece by Talking Heads.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.280
Why was I playing Burning
Down the House?

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.740
Well, I want you to study
this painting.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:54.532
This is a painting by Georges
Braques, from 1908, And it's

00:47:54.532 --> 00:47:57.510
called The Houses at L'estac,
or if I speak Canadian, The

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.042
Houses at L'estac.

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:01.440
And you see the thing
about these houses?

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.280
You see the ones in the
background have better

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.620
definitions than the ones
in the foreground?

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.550
And the ones in the foreground
are all distorted, and kind of

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.240
falling over?

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.710
Well, when this was exhibited
at the Salon, on the critics

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:15.590
lambasted it.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.590
They said, this thing is
absolutely childish.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.860
And one of the critics
said, this isn't

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:21.790
a painting of houses.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.240
This is nothing but
a stack of cubes.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.550
And from this painting, and that
negative comment, came

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.160
the term cubism.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.600
And so the entire movement of
cubism comes from this.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.780
And since we're studying the
properties of cubic crystals,

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.060
I thought the connection
was pretty tight.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.220
And that's why I chose
that piece.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.120
Don't go anywhere yet.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.880
We still have a couple
of minutes.

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.090
It's not better out there
than it is in

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.770
here, I guarantee you.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:48.030
All right.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:49.730
So now I want to show you
one of the properties.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.840
Why do we care about atomic
arrangement Suppose some of

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.590
you are interested
in fiberoptics.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.620
One of the things you have to
do in fiberoptics is make

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.710
junctures, because you can't run
a cable 100 miles without

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.030
making some junctures.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.340
Well, atomic arrangement
reflects microscopic

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:04.870
properties.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.730
And one of the properties that
you can have in a crystal is

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:10.220
something called birefringence,
depending on

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.470
the atomic arrangement.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.740
So what happens is if you have
a ray that comes in from the

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.760
left here, it splits into two.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.340
And that's no good, in
certain instances.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.110
In other instances, if you want
a beam splitter, you want

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:23.360
something birefringent.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.910
So look at all these crystals.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.470
Quartz is birefringent.

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:29.130
Ice is.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:30.490
You've seen it.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.310
Calcite is birefringent.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.260
What do I mean by that?

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:39.900
Well, Dave, can we cut to
the document camera?

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.070
Right.

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:43.310
So here's a here's
a crystal of--

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.580
well, this is my handwriting.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.550
It's beautiful.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.240
Let's write-- here's more.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.870
Isn't that beautiful?

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:50.090
OK, enough about me.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.085
Now let's--

00:49:51.085 --> 00:49:51.590
All right.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:52.840
So this is birefringent.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.800
But what happens if
we rotate it?

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.870
We can change the degree.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:04.070
And if we're really clever, and
we get it onto the optical

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:07.770
axis, we can actually get these
things to superimpose.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.210
Here's a piece of cryolite.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.460
This is the stuff they
make aluminum out of.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.670
They dissolve aluminum in it.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:16.280
And you can see that, see, I
loaned it to somebody, and

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.070
they dropped it.

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.970
And when they dropped
it, they damaged it.

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.470
That's what happens.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.300
Look, it's all crunched
up there.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.120
But anyway, I don't want
to get into that.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.630
But so you can see, if we turn
this and we get it right on

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:32.010
the optical axis, we can
actually make these things

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:36.060
line up sometimes.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:36.680
Anyway.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.090
So you can see the property
of birefringence.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:41.010
OK.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:44.310
Let's go back to documents,
Dave. One more thing.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.110
Last thing I want to show you.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:49.840
You know gold.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.840
Gold looks like this.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.770
It's yellow, right?

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.830
Well, depending on how you, you
know, those of you have

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.660
seen certain wedding bands know
that if you want to make

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.240
a white gold, you add
nickel to it.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.695
And once the nickel content gets
above a certain level,

00:51:01.695 --> 00:51:03.020
the gold looks white.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.030
In other words, just metallic
reflective.

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.490
In Eastern Europe, it was common
to add high levels of

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.410
copper, in which case, you get a
beautiful rose-colored gold,

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:12.710
or pink gold.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:16.080
I'm going to show you
some blue gold.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.020
This isn't a joke.

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.360
This is 14 karat.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.270
It's 40 plus percent
by weight gold, and

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:24.745
the balance is indium.

00:51:24.745 --> 00:51:28.950
And when you add indium
to gold, you get blue.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:30.400
Document camera, please.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.940
Just so that you remember.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.160
OK.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.950
That's gold.

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:38.950
This is gold foil.

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:41.200
Rutherford, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.520
You know, this is yellow gold.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.760
Ho-hum.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.940
This is white gold.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.660
Same deal, but with
some nickel.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.770
Now it's reflecting off
of the yellow gold.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.314
Boy, there's a lot of
yellow in here.

00:51:53.314 --> 00:51:55.980
Where's that coming from?

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.610
It's hard to tell.

00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:58.870
All right.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:00.120
Now Let's look at
some blue gold.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:04.620
This is blue.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:10.820
So, but it's brittle.

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:12.380
So you know, what are you going
to do with something

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:12.810
that's brittle?

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:13.580
You can't shape it.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.790
So I have an idea.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.170
So here's my idea.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.420
See, what we do is--

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.030
see this?

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:26.550
We do, instead of this,
we put this.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.520
We drill a hole in it, we put
hands on it, we sell it for a

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.360
lot of money.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.560
It's blue gold.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.180
It's blue karat gold.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.170
What you can do if you
understand crystallography.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.840
All right, get out of here.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.720
I'll see you on Friday.
