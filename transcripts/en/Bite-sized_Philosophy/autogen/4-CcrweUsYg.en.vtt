00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.520
 ... People feel a lot of guilt 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.760
 There is a section of social psychology that claims to be 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.000
 Most people think they are better than others 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.360
 But I do not believe it. This is not what I have noticed in my life. 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.400
 I may be biased, because I am a psychiatrist 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.460
 I see people suffering in secret more than others in general 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.360
 But I'm not sure about that 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.580
 You do not have to go much deeper into people's lives 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.160
 So you find something tragic 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.900
 I do not mean the tragedies that are so superficial, I mean, for example 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.060
 That your mother is suffering from Alzheimer's, or that your close friend has committed suicide, or 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.040
 A relative of you suffers from cancer, or your child may have a disease 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.160
 Or, for example, there is a bug in you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 Because everyone suffers from at least one very serious sermon 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.280
 If you do not suffer, you will suffer from it soon. 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.100
 This sense of tragedy is always in the hearts of people 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.900
 Also, in my personal experience, it is rare to meet someone who says: 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.620
 "I do everything I can, I'm a wonderful person, 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.060
 I do not think I can do better " 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.640
 If you meet someone like that, you're going to be cocky, are not you? 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.720
 And with you the right, 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.300
 But most people do not think so 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.460
 But feel that they can improve themselves 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.480
 They are fully aware of their mistakes and do not feel that they are the best image of themselves 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.420
 What happens in the story of Adam and Eve also is that 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.800
 (When you open the eyes of people) and become aware, and this is what I think, 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.900
 They are expelled from Paradise, and become within history 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.880
 History is where there are birth pains 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.100
 And your husband controls you 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.960
 You have to work hard, which is not done by another animal, because you are aware of the existence of the future 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.480
 You have to work and sacrifice the pleasure of the present for the future, always! You know that death is inevitable 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.240
 And carry it all on your back. 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.040
 For me, there is nothing more realistic than that 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.660
 This is the case as I see it 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.920
 Unless you are naive to the fullest, there is a part of your life 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.760
 Can be linked to this picture! 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.720
 And why? I mean 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.840
 We are truly fantastic creatures, because we do not really belong to existence. 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.740
 This is expressed in the idea of ​​falling (from Paradise) 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.700
 "The people feel that they have a religion, and they have to push it into existence, 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.400
 For the crime of their existence. something like that. 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.520
 Perhaps because we are aware that we have to offer something of value to those around us 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.180
 In order to be tolerated during our work 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.860
 But it's deeper than that! 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.120
 Humans live in a post-devastation world 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.300
 This is expressed in Genesis. It is interesting. 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.280
 Because there is the story of Adam and Eve, there are two disasters in principle 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.540
 There is a catastrophe opening the eyes of Adam and Eve, to which we will speak in detail, 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.340
 And become aware, and know they are naked 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.880
 And open their eyes, right? Those are the words used. 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.840
 Open eyes means gaining awareness 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.380
 Because the eyes are linked to consciousness in humans, because we are very theoretical animals. 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.440
 The expression "open-eyed" 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.700
 Is the expression of getting awareness 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.140
 Adam and Eve soon became conscious, naked. 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.300
 The traditional interpretation of this is linked to the sin of sex. 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.740
 But I do not think so. I do not think that's what it means. 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.420
 Although it is related to this. 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.960
 But I think it means to realize that you are a disgrace, 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.580
 If you dream that you are a disgrace on a stage in front of people, this is not a sex dream! 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.000
 Unless you're a pervert, right? 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.920
 But you want to cover yourself, and go down quickly from that theater! 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.860
 So, being naked before an audience is to receive the rule of society 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.840
 And its focus on ... clear folds 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.260
 This makes people conscious of themselves, and that is the case of a human being. 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.680
 It's tied to neurosis in the five attributes model, but people do not like it at all! 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.160
 Do not like to make their weaknesses the focus of the group. 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.500
 It is one of the great concerns of the people. 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.160
 One is social humiliation, the other is limited life and death 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.440
 For example 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.040
 The person who greets the community, is both shy at the same time. 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.520
 Because she (usually a woman) believes she will suffer 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:45.400
 A large heart attack attracts attention in a public place, making itself a laughingstock during its death 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.260
 If so 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.880
 This is a good example of the common fears, which represent human beings.
