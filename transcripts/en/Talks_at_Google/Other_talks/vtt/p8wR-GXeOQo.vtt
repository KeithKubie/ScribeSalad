&gt;&gt;Karen: Hello, everybody and greetings to
everybody on VC. I'm Karen Wickre and it gives

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:15.269
me great pleasure to introduce our guest,
Clay Shirky, today. Clay, his day job is teaching

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.940
at NYU in the Interactive Telecommunications
program, but the guy manages to sneak in a

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.960
lot of writing and speaking somehow through
his schedule.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.839
I, I still have "Here Comes Everybody" half-read
and now here comes "Cognitive Surplus", so

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:42.440
he's busy all the time. He's a really insightful
speaker and thinker on Internet and the collision

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.079
of online and offline worlds and I know you're
gonna enjoy his talk. So, please give a welcome

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.449
to Clay.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.449
[applause]

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.109
&gt;&gt;Clay: Thank you, am I on? Yes. Thank you
very much and hello everybody in VC land.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:03.300
That's what you heard and we can go to slides.
Got a book came out, it came out last Thursday,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600
"Cognitive Surplus," it's, in fact, available
for sale in the back, exit to the gift shop.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.420
[audience member laughs]

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.240
[Clay clears throat]

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.259
Rather than talk about Cognitive Surplus in
the abstract, I want to start with a story

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.380
that I think illustrates what's, what's happening
now with this, with this collective resource.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.259
So, the story starts January of last year;
January of 2009 in Mangalore, India--

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.780
[clears throat]

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.810
where a Hindu fundamentalist group, Sri Ram
Sena, attacks women in pubs. They drag the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.229
women out of the bars, slapping them, hitting
them. When men step in to try and defend,

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.499
the men are also attacked and as, by now,
usual all of this is documented with photos

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:47.249
and videos and camera phones uploaded to Flickr
and YouTube.

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:50.960
I just have, have to say Picasa and YouTube
here, but uploaded to photo and video sharing

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.659
sites. And after these images become widespread,
Sri Ram Sena says, "We attack those women

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.119
because they were not living up to our ideals
of Hindu womanhood. They were not being sufficiently

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.450
chaste. They were not being sufficiently private
and our next attack is going to be on Valentine's

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.600
Day. If you're a woman in Mangalore and we
catch you out of doors with a male who is

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.849
not your blood relative, we will attack you
again." Right?

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.000
So, this puts the women of Mangalore into
a classic collective action problem. Each

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.209
woman, faced with a question of what do to
on Valentine's Day, can say quite reasonably,

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.280
"I'm staying home." But, of course, by doing
that, collectively they will be capitulated

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.930
to, to seeing his demands. Or, each woman
could say, "Perhaps there will be strength

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.250
in numbers. If enough of us turn out, maybe
we can, maybe we can see off this threat."

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.530
But they have to make that calculation without
knowing what the other women facing the same

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.380
decision are also, are also deciding, right?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.610
So, against, against this threat, by Pramod
Muthalik, who's the, who's the, the leader

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.430
of Sri Ram Sena, steps up a woman who offers
a third option to this collective option dilemma,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.480
Nisha Susan, who is a Mangalore resident and
Susan proposes a way to solve the collective

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.379
action problem collectively, rather than having
the solution have to be worked out by, by

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.239
each of the individuals. And so she founds
my favorite Facebook group, the Collection

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.100
of Loose, or the Association of Loose, Forward
and Pub-Going Women.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.100
[laughter]

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.140
And it's a very popular group as you might
imagine.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.260
[laughter]

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.950
Thousands of people pour in, become members
of this group, and their first announced action

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.940
is the Pink Chaddi Campaign. Now, the members
of Sri Ram Sena are derided as underpants

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.750
wearers because they favor these khaki shorts,
which people say look like diapers.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.019
So, the women of the Association of Loose,
Forward and Pub-Going Women decide that they're

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.620
going to mail pink underwear to Promud Muthalik
and the members of Sri Ram Sena. And so, they

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.939
get a lot of pink underwear, they write messages
across the back, they mail it in. And this

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.510
has three immediate effects. One of the effects,
of course, is to enrage Sri Ram Sena who says,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.099
"This is terrible. We're going to mail these
women appropriately covering garb in return."

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.130
They didn't actually do that, they just said
they were going to do that.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.970
The second effect was on the Indian government
who saw an organized group of citizens who

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.030
cared about a particular issue and vote. And
so they decided to arrest Muthalik for the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.000
attacks, Muthalik and some of the senior leaders
of the Sri Ram Sena on February 13th. Thus,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.550
clearing Valentine's Day from, from the attacks.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.320
And the third group, the third group benefiting
from this was the Mangalore women themselves

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.730
who saw that here was a way that they could
pool their otherwise uncoordinated actions

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.110
to achieve an outcome that wouldn't have been,
wouldn't have been possible without, without

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.390
this coordinating effect, right? So this,
this ability--

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.550
[clears throat]

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.780
to pool, to pool those kind of resources together
is what I'm calling "cognitive surplus," right?

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.200
Cognitive surplus has two pieces, right? One
of them is the free time and talents available

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.200
in the educated world, right? Cumulatively,
as a population, we have over a trillion hours

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.081
a year to give over to activities we like
or care about. And--

00:05:21.081 --> 00:05:22.450
[clears throat]

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.690
it is, it is that free time and talent that
are used in places like the Association of,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.990
of Loose, Forward and Pub-Going Women. But
we had that free time in the 20th century,

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.100
too. In fact, that free time built up dramatically
after the second World War; rising educational

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.090
attainment, rising life expectancy and rising
population. In the 20th century, we didn't'

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.500
get events like this.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.100
That's the second piece of cognitive surplus.
It's not just that we have free time and talent,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.430
but now we have a medium that can allow us
to find each other and to pool our efforts.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.770
Not to use free time to be used up as an individual
level, but rather treat it as something that

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.240
can be used in aggregate at the group level.
Here is another example of that. Whoops, I'm

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.581
sorry. So, to, to express, right, what is
possible now with cognitive surplus--

00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:18.581
[clears throat]

00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:23.800
I need a metric and there wasn't an obvious
one. So, I called up my friend, Martin Wattenberg,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.610
at IBMs research lab who studies Wikipedia
and together, we hashed out what we thought

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.520
might be a measurement of, of what's possible.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.960
So, Wikipedia is our, our oldest and largest
example of general public participation in

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.700
a shared project. And Wikipedia, Martin and
I kind of worked out in a kind of back of

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.630
the envelope way, has taken something like
a hundred million hours of cumulative human

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.250
thought. Every page in every language, every
edit, every talk page, something on the order

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:05.601
of a hundred million hours, right? So, take
the number one use of free time in, in the

00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:11.410
developed world, which is of course, watching
television, right? If you imagine graphing

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.320
the total number of hours, right?

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.470
Imagine a graph of the total number of hours
of television. In the US, we watch 200 billion

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:29.590
hours, right, every year, right? Wikipedia
would be here, right? So, there is such an

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:36.460
enormous amount of free time that even very
slight increases in our ability to pool it

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:43.220
together and even very slight upticks in our
desire to participate can lead to dramatically

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.020
different effects than we were used to from
the media landscape in the 20th century. So,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.830
here's an example of that--

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.900
[clears throat]

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:57.400
another story of that at work. This story
from, from Kenya at the beginning of 2008,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400
right?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.410
Kenya had a presidential election, hotly disputed,
and in the aftermath of the election, electoral

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:08.270
violence broke out, or rather, ethnic violence
broke out post, post the election. And Ory

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:14.720
Okolloh, a lawyer living in Nairobi, was blogging
about this at her blog, Kenyan Pundit, which

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.970
became one of the sites of the discussion
of the events in Kenya.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.620
And as she was blogging about this in the
aftermath of the election, the Kenyan government

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:31.120
announced a complete media blackout on all
live reporting of any sort. And so suddenly,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.810
the Kenyan blogster went from being part of
the media landscape to being one of the principle

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:41.959
sources of information about what was going
on, given the lockdown of the traditional

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:45.420
press. So, Okolloh began soliciting narratives--

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.420
[clears throat]

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.589
from her commenter's. They would come; offer
things to her, Okolloh would post them on

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:58.060
the site, aggregate things. And each, she,
Kenyan Pundit, her blog, became so indispensible

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.709
that she said, "I can't, I can't keep up,
right? I could do this 24 hours a day and

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:08.250
I couldn't publish all the information that's
coming in from my own commenter's. If only

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.779
there was a way to do this automatically."

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:14.649
Two programmers showed up on the comments,
held their hands up and said, "We can build

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:21.100
that." Right? Seventy two hours later, Ushahidi
launches. Ushahidi, I was actually chastised

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:30.470
this morning for mispronouncing it, it's "oo-sha-hee-dee,"
is a very simple tool for crisis mapping.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.160
All it does is it takes reports from the field,
whether over the web or email, or critically,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.680
SMS off the mobile phone. It aggregates them
and it puts it on a map. What it does is it

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:48.160
takes what the population knows as a whole,
in a tacit and distributed way, and aggregates

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.350
it and makes it public and, and observable.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.880
[clears throat]

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.060
And in doing that, right, they, they take
a diffuse, general knowledge that isn't of

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.060
much use, and they turn it into an actual
resource.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.980
This worked well enough in Kenya that the
programmers who had been working on it decided

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:15.529
to turn it into a platform and it's now become
a general purpose crisis mapping tool; all

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:22.050
volunteer labor, open source project. It's
been used in Mexico to track the risk of electoral

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.579
fraud. It's been used in Washington, D.C,
to track snow removal, right, first world

00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:28.180
problems.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:33.740
It's been used, most famously, in Haiti in
the aftermath of the awful Port-au-Prince

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:40.779
earthquake to track both emergencies and also
places where there's security threats, public

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:46.080
health outbreaks, infrastructure, medicine,
all of it, right? It has gone, in less than

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.311
three years, it has gone from its East African
origin to become a worldwide tool and when

00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:55.899
you go on the site, you look at the map, right,
and you see the places where, where Ushahidi

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:59.930
has been implemented. It's everywhere but
Antarctica.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.379
[clears throat]

00:11:02.379 --> 00:11:10.790
What, what Ory Okolloh did would not have
been possible without digital technology.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:16.970
What Ory Okolloh did would not have been possible
without human generosity. And what's interesting

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.589
to me now is the stories where both of those
things are true. The stories that become possible

00:11:21.589 --> 00:11:24.019
because both of those things are true.

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:28.290
Not just shiny new technology making new kinds
of things possible; that's a story that's

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:33.740
well told. But rather technology providing
an opportunity for ancient human motivations

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:38.890
of generosity and participation to manifest
themselves on a public stage in a way that's

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:44.300
much larger covers a larger geographic area
and is much longer lived than what we were

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.839
used to generous acts, acts being performed.

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:56.259
So, taking this combination of human generosity
and digital opportunity, we are seeing in

00:11:56.259 --> 00:12:01.160
examples like the Nisha Susan story, like
the Ory Okolloh story, incredible use of the

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.519
cognitive surplus. And when you look around,
right, you can see this everywhere. Cognitive

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:14.850
surplus is leading to amazing efforts in scientific,
literary, artistic, political creativity of

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:21.019
the sort that we would not have expected to
see, right? It also leads, of course, to lots

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:24.170
and lots of lolcats, right?

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.999
Lolcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter
with the addition of cute captions, are also,

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:34.649
are also use of the cognitive surplus, right?
Because free time is free time, experiments

00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:39.120
are experiments. There's no need for it to
be high-minded. It can be all over the map

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.529
and in fact, it is.

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:46.160
Now, it's tempting, it's tempting to want
Ushahidi without the lolcats; to get the good

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.089
stuff without the throw away culture. But
that's not the way media revolutions work.

00:12:52.089 --> 00:12:58.439
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment.
Full stop, right? This isn't the only revolution

00:12:58.439 --> 00:13:00.360
when that had happened.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.819
[clears throat]

00:13:01.819 --> 00:13:08.999
When we got the sacred printing press, we
got erotic novels 150 years before we got

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:10.540
scientific journals, right?

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.540
[laughter]

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.540
So--

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.540
[snorts]

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.610
first example of each separated, as you can
see, by some span of time. So, this is actually

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:25.230
the normal case for large changes in the abundance
of media and for greatly lowered costs of

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:31.819
participation and creation. The key thing
here is not whether you get a mix of, of low

00:13:31.819 --> 00:13:35.860
and high culture, of throw away and stuff
that lasts through the ages.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:43.149
The key thing here is on this side of the
equation, right? How much of what matters

00:13:43.149 --> 00:13:48.670
isn't about the technology itself, but about
the culture that forms around it. And that,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:53.959
I think, and this is one of the central theses
of the book, that's the moment we're in right

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:59.589
now. Not fighting over the technology, the
basics of which we have largely sketched in,

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:04.420
and it's not fighting over the possibility
of participating, which is manifesting itself

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:10.110
visibly and daily in all kinds of ways. It's
really the cultural assumptions around those

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.959
possibilities that, that are, I think, are
the big open question now.

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:13.959
[clears throat]

00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:17.930
So, to make an analogy, again, continuing
on, on, on the comparison of the printing

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:25.180
press, here is an image of an alchemist's
laboratory. And here is an image of a chemist's

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.990
laboratory. Spot the difference? No, of course
not. There is no difference, right?

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.320
The interesting thing about the transition
from alchemy to chemistry is that alchemists

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.999
and chemists had the same tools. They had
braziers and vials and, and, and scales, right?

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:45.580
Alchemists and chemists had the same techniques.
There was no technical revolution that kicked

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.790
off chemistry, right?

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.980
Alchemists and chemists were, in many cases,
the same people who simply converted from

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.980
one way of doing things to another way of
doing things. The difference between alchemy

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:02.689
and chemistry, the thing that kicked off chemistry
as a science, was not about the tools, was

00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:08.269
not about the techniques, it was about the
culture. In the 1640s, a group of people who

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:12.579
got together calling themselves "natural philosophers"
as, as scientists, you know, essentially the

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:17.529
precursor to scientist, got together in the
United Kingdom and called themselves "The

00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:18.529
Invisible College."

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:23.480
And the Invisible College was invisible because
they had no physical home, neither in Oxford

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.949
or Cambridge. They met in coffee houses and
they communicated through letters. And they

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:33.629
set themselves on a remarkable task, which
is that they decided, formally and as a group,

00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:36.520
that they would not believe anything that
was not true, right?

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.529
Now this is hard because we are not as a species
well equipped to subject our own beliefs to

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:47.740
the kind of withering scrutiny that would
tell us when our beliefs are wrong. We do,

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.149
however, have a related skill. We're very
good at subjecting other people's beliefs

00:15:52.149 --> 00:15:53.560
to withering scrutiny, right?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560
[laughter]

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560
[clears throat}

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:01.399
Enter the Scientific Journal, right? The thing
that moved us from alchemy to chemistry was

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:07.819
the decision to publish; to make public. And
in fact, the member of the Invisible College

00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:12.850
wrote quite bitterly about the writings of
the alchemists because it was incredibly obscure.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.619
And even if an experiment was described, there
was no guarantee that you could recreate it

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:19.810
and even if you could recreate it, there was
no guarantee that you could understand the

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.319
results.

00:16:21.319 --> 00:16:26.920
And so the chemist's motto, "Nothing from
words," meant that they would not believe

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.339
any assertion without seeing it published
in such a way that someone else could try

00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:40.589
it to test the results, right? That kind of
cultural shift is, is, I think, both the opportunity

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:45.980
and the challenge we face now. Not with the
tools make possible, right, but what culture

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.379
we can build around the tools to make the
tools useful.

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:55.759
The printing press did not cause the Scientific
Revolution and also, the Scientific Revolution

00:16:55.759 --> 00:17:00.519
would not have been possible without the printing
press. Both of those things are true and the

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:05.130
thing that balances those statements are the
cultural decisions around the use of the tools,

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.820
not the tools themselves.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.910
[clears throat]

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:16.760
So, I'm gonna talk about an example where
I see people trying to make this kind of cultural

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.280
change part of their world. This is one of
the most audacious attempts I know of presently

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.680
to do this kind of thing. This is a screen
shot from a site called patientslikeme and

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:35.260
patientslikeme aggregates patient data from
long-term degenerative diseases with, with

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.110
either few or no cures.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:41.740
They are, among other things now, the holder
to the largest data set on Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:48.060
And on patientslikeme, individual patients
set up a username and list information about

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.830
themselves. This is a 23 year-old female from
Scotland who has depression and anxiety and

00:17:53.830 --> 00:18:00.210
she graphs her mood, right? Both in point
moments and she talks about her mood over

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:05.390
time, how is she, is she high functioning,
is she low functioning, is she feeling a lot

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.510
of distress?

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:12.560
And, this will be no, this is giving away
no state secrets inside Google, the ability

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:19.050
to aggregate data across a bunch of small,
unreliable sources, changes things, right?

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.930
Quantitative data at large enough scale becomes
qualitative data. So, they are able to do

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:29.050
things like, say, what drug are you on? What
dosage does your doctor got you on? And they

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:36.710
can see the consensus view of the medical
profession as a graph of the dosage of these

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.780
various drugs.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:43.450
The pharma companies do not have this data.
Only patientslikeme is able to aggregate this

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:53.030
at large enough scale, right? Now, this, this
is an attempt to create an alternate medical

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:59.990
culture, right? And it's, right, patientslikeme
is itself a commercial site and yet they're

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:06.060
plainly engaging the participants in cultural
ways, right? So, it is a mix of for profit

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.930
and non for profit motivations. It's a mix
of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. And

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:11.930
that seems really strange.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.820
In fact, there's a thesis that's been proposed
by Nicholas Carr, an idea proposed by Nicholas

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.290
Carr, that he calls the "digital sharecropper"
situation. Why are people contributing their

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:28.430
data in a way that's making other people rich?
Why are people uploading videos or, or photos

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:34.070
adding to Google or Yahoo sharecropping, right?
To which my response has always been that,

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:41.301
that Flickr and YouTube are nothing compared
to Lego, who's tricked two generations of

00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:44.640
the world's children into assembling their
products for them--

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640
[laughter]

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.630
thus saving billions of dollars at the factory
while violating international child labor

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.630
laws, right?

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:52.630
[laughter]

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:58.360
And once, once you see that, once you see
that model, it's obvious, well the kids like

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:04.530
putting the tools together, right? So, in
fact, there is this mix in commercial operations

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.300
of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The
only real surprise is that's its now happening

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.770
in the media landscape, where in an environment
where previously only professionals had access

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.170
to the public sphere, now we all do.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:20.440
Now to curiosity of our historical era, and
I don't think we'll ever know whether this

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:26.570
was co-, coincidence or some kind of deep
conversion, that as experiments like this

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.580
are going on, as people are using the cognitive
surplus to bring users together to create

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.870
resources, services, value that couldn't have
existed otherwise.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:42.040
Social scientists are also starting to tell
us a lot about human motivation and, in particular,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.530
the ways in which our intrinsic motivations
matter more than we'd been, then we'd been

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.130
told in the 20th century, right? The 20th
century picture of humanity, that it was the

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:58.840
kind of consensus view, was that humans are
rational, self-maximizing, self-interested

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.020
actors who will always try to get the better
deal in any given transaction with another

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.200
human being.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.680
But as Elinor Ostrom, who, who is the most
recent Nobel Laureate in Economics, has shown

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:18.780
in her work, the irony is if you design systems
to assume that the actors are selfish, you

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:25.020
end up designing systems in which the selfish,
the most selfish actors do best, right? And

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:34.030
what we're starting to learn instead, is that
we have intrinsic motivations, non financial

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:41.040
motivations, that affect our behavior in profound
ways that aren't demonstrated, aren't explained

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.810
by neoclassical economics or the sort of attended
social [inaudible].

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:52.020
Here's an example of one of those explanations
from recent research. This is, this is a graph

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.020
from--

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.020
[clears throat]

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:59.830
excuse me, from an essay published by Uri
Gneezy and Alfredo Rustichini in the Journal

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:04.770
of Legal Studies in the beginning of this
decade. And Gneezy and Rustichini set out

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:10.610
to examine what they called the "deterrence
theory," a very simple theory widely, widely

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.090
held, particularly in the legal profession,
hence the journal they published it in.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.470
And deterrence theory is very simple. If you
want someone to do less of something, add

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:23.070
a punishment. If you want someone to do more
of something, take a punishment away. Straightforward,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:28.961
common sensical, also largely untested. So
they said, "We're gonna test it." So, they

00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:33.730
went and observed ten day care centers in
Haifa, Israel. And they observed those day

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:39.960
care centers at the moment of highest tension,
which is pick-up time. Because at pick-up

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.980
time, the teachers have been with your children
all day--

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.090
[laughter]

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.020
and they would like those children returned
to your care at the appointed hour and no

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.890
other. Meanwhile, well, maybe you're a little
late at work, or maybe you're running an errand,

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.050
there's traffic, you want a little slack to
pick your kid up late.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:01.910
So Gneezy and Rustichini said, "How many episodes
at these te-, ten day care centers, how many

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:09.790
episodes are there at late pick-up time on
average?" The x-axis is weeks elapsed of observation,

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.480
y-axis is number of late pick-ups and you
can see that there are between six and twelve

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:19.150
late pick-ups a week across these ten day
care centers. So they took these day care

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.360
centers, they put them in two groups. The,
the group in the white squares is the control

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.610
group; they did nothing. The group with the
black diamonds is the experimental group and

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.810
to the half the day care centers that were
the experimental group, they said, "Ok, we

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:38.340
are changing the deal as of right now. You
pick your kid up more than ten minutes late,

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.590
ten shekels added to your bill, no if's, ands
or but's; automatic fine."

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:49.310
And the minute they added the fine, the behavior
at those day care centers changed. Late pickups

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:55.610
went up every week for the next four weeks,
topping out at triple the pre-fine average

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:59.080
and then fluctuating between double and triple
the pre-fine average for the remainder of

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:04.900
the experiment, right? You can see immediately
what happened, right? The fine broke the culture,

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:09.860
right? When Gneezy and Rustichini communicated
to the parents that paying ten shekels they

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.950
had discharged the whole of the debt to the
day care center and there was no residue of

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:20.840
social concern or guilt left? The parents,
quite reasonably said, "Ten shekels to pick

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.000
my kid up late, what could be bad?"

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
[laughter]

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.340
So, this goes on for awhile and then they
said, "Ok, thank you very much. The fine is

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.440
over. We're done with this experiment." And
then a really interesting thing happened.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.980
Nothing changed, right?

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.980
[laughter]

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:45.570
Not only did the fine break the culture, but
once it was broken it stayed broken even though

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:51.790
the fine was removed. So, they have now contradicted
both halves of the deterrence system. They've

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:56.210
added a punishment and made their behavior
worse. They moved, they removed a punishment

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.980
and not made the behavior any better. Now,
the new, classical explanation of these day

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.750
care centers says that in the absence of a
contract that a fine in some kind of formal

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:10.670
agreed behavior, the parents and the teachers
were operated together with no constraints,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.920
but that's not true.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.280
They were just operating with cultural constraints
and as we can see from the control group here,

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:24.170
humming along as they were, the cultural constraints
actually created a more generous environment

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:29.790
than the contractual ones. This doesn't mean
we never need contracts. It does mean we need

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:35.720
to be very careful about designing social
systems that assume that contracts can either

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.980
automatically augment or automatically substitute
for cultural norms as a way of coordinating

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.000
group behavior.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:55.210
So, back to patientslikeme. There's a 23 year-old
woman in Scotland who's uploading her diagnosis,

00:25:55.210 --> 00:26:04.290
her symptoms, her medications, the amount
of the dose; all of these things violate every

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:12.150
message that comes in public about medical
privacy. "Oh my God! Don't share that information.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.770
Don't tell people you're manic-depressive,
don't tell people you suffer from anxiety,

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:21.960
don't tell people you're taking this drug,
don't tell them how much of it."

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:29.440
What patientslikeme has in mind isn't just
a kind of alternative that will help the people

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.580
that come together on this site. What they
have in mind is nothing less than breaking

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:41.130
current culture around sharing. At the bottom
of every page, they have a privacy policy,

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.640
as one would if you were in their business
and they say, "We will keep your data private

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.300
to the degree that you want us to."

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.760
But they also have something called an "openness
philosophy" and it is linked to, not by accident,

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:57.120
next to the privacy policy wherever it appears.
And on that page they make a really dramatic

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:04.060
argument to the users of the site saying,
"We're abiding by what the law requires of

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:10.060
us to keep your data private and we recognize
that we're operating in a culture that assumes

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:15.500
privacy as the norm," and a really tightly
held to the chest privacy at that, and notwithstanding

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:22.271
all of that, "We think that all our lives
will be better if we share this data. We can

00:27:22.271 --> 00:27:27.730
accelerate medical research. We can find panels
of sufferers of the disease faster. We can

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:34.490
get more variable panels. We can lower the
cost and increase the outcomes of cures for

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:43.240
these diseases." If all patientslikeme does
is succeeds in making its own users feel better,

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.360
they will actually have failed, right?

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.680
They've set out to do nothing less than change
the prevailing culture of the business they

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:57.490
are operating in. And that, that is an effort,
I think, on the level of audacity that reminds

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:02.500
me of what the Invisible College was. Which
brings me back to the lolcats.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:09.730
So, cognitive surplus is a general resource
available to all of us if we can put something,

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:14.700
if we can put an opportunity out there that
attracts the ancient human motivations of

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.260
people feeling autonomous or competent, feeling
a sense of membership or generosity, the kinds

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.460
of intrinsic things that make us want to donate
our free time to these various activities.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:29.970
And there are an enormous range of activities
that are now resulting from this, from this

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.910
new shared resource, right? The story we had
in the 20th century was that we all liked

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:40.130
to be couch potatoes, that we sat around watching
TV all the time and that was our participation

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:44.110
in the media landscape because that was how
we wanted to be, right? Now, we have a medium

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:49.640
that doesn't just let people consume. It also
lets us produce and it lets us share and we're

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:56.540
seeing lots and lots of versions of that appear.
So, lolcats is one example of that.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.490
Another example, I, I pulled this off, off
mockpages, off the Lego fan site, this is

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:06.330
the Lego zombie group. It's, its people who
only build zombie-like, zombie-like models

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:11.390
of Lego's, but then, of course, share, share
their construction in voluminous detail. And

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:17.100
then, of course, Wikipedia, which I already
touched on, and finally patientslikeme, which

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:23.780
I just talked about. A kind of sketch of the
range of the use of cognitive surplus, but

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:30.800
here's the thing. There's a different kind
of value, right, being produced, there's a

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.140
different model of, of value being created
on each of these sites, right?

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.630
The value created by something like lolcats,
essentially an aggregate of funny stuff, it's

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:46.810
basically personal. If you wanna crack yourself
up or crack your friends up on a coffee break,

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:52.580
you can always go to icanhascheezeburger.com
and purveyors of lolcats worldwide. And you

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:58.830
don't have to be a member of a community in
any meaningful fashion to do that, right?

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:06.190
The value from lolcats is essentially an aggregate
of personal, personal motivation to upload

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:13.810
the cats and then personal motivation, right?
The Lego groups don't work quite that way.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:19.610
They are more tightly bound to one another,
right? You do need to be a member of a community

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:24.360
on some level to get the kind of community
of practice value of, "I saw this person do

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:30.820
this, and then I took that, I took that drawing
or that, that sketch and I built on it," right?

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:36.340
So, this is value created by the members of
the community for each other. That value is

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:42.050
created inside the community and largely captured
inside the community as well. Wikipedia, a

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.950
different kind of value yet again.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:48.580
This is value created by the participants,
but enjoyed by the public at large, right?

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:55.510
A third of a billion people check in to Wikipedia
every month, but only a tiny, tiny fraction

00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:01.160
of those people edit pages, about two percent,
and only a tiny, tiny fraction of that are

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:06.950
Wikipedians, people deeply committed to the
project. So, that small group has an enormous

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.830
amount of leverage on creating what's become,
in less than ten years, the most important

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.640
reference work in the English language. This
is public value.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:19.240
And finally, patientslikeme, for the reasons
I just discussed; civic value. Patientslikeme

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:25.950
doesn't mean to just make life better for
its users or for the general public. It actually

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:31.820
means to change the civic culture it operates
in. So, this is where the book ends and this

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:37.710
is where I will end. This seems to me to be
the great open question now, is what we do

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:43.970
with this resource on this axis, right? Now,
I like lolcats as much as the next guy. I

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.250
actually maybe like them more even than the
next guy.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.250
[laughter]

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:53.500
But, I have a hard time envisioning a future
where some Internet user is saying to themselves,

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.781
"Where, oh where, can I find a picture of
a cute cat?" Right?

00:31:57.781 --> 00:31:58.781
[laughter]

00:31:58.781 --> 00:32:06.990
That strikes me as being a largely solved
problem, right? Up here, I have no idea whether

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:12.100
patientslikeme will succeed. That is an incredibly
audacious goal they have set for themselves

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:18.090
and the forces arrayed against patients creating
the kind of value for themselves that used

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:23.080
to be captured by the market, even at the
price of great inefficiency, is going to lead

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.000
to increasing push back if they start to succeed.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.970
Expect to see attempts, to see them legislated
out of business within a year or two. I have

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:34.250
no inside knowledge about this. This is just
a prediction of about the kinds of forces

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:41.560
we have seen at work in other industries.
So, the lesson here, I think, is given this

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:47.220
cognitive surplus and given that we can take
this end of the range as a basically solved

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:52.970
problem, the action is up here, right? Dean
Kamen, the inventor and entrepreneur said,

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.830
"Free cultures get what they celebrate."

00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:05.360
The opportunity we have here is for us to
be the people who both do, but also celebrate

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:11.950
and aid the people taking on public and civic
value. It's the harder value to create and

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:17.060
the more of that kind of value there is, the
more opposition there will be from society.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:23.940
But ultimately, our ability to, to see to
it that the public and civic minded uses of

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:30.100
this succeed will be the thing that determines
how much value we end up getting out of this

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.420
cognitive surplus. Thank you very much.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.750
[applause]

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:46.320
I think I've got, yeah, time for a couple
questions. There's a mic, yeah, down in the

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.320
middle.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.550
&gt;&gt;membermale1: So, it's a wonderful vision,
I like the communal, the public, the personal,

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.550
the civic--

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.550
&gt;&gt;Clay: Mm-hmm.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.520
&gt;&gt;membermale1: and all of that and you've
been telling us really great, warm, fuzzy

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520
stories.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520
&gt;&gt;Clay: Mm-hmm.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.611
&gt;&gt;membermale1: There's the other side of the
same point that--

00:33:58.611 --> 00:33:59.611
&gt;&gt;Clay: Mm-hmm.

00:33:59.611 --> 00:34:03.020
&gt;&gt;membermale1: you're represented by things
like 4chan. Those same technologies, those

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.480
same mechanisms, can be used to create dis-,
great disruptions--

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.480
&gt;&gt;Clay: Mm-hmm.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.569
&gt;&gt;membermale1: and in the battle for the hearts
and minds of the civic/Internet/information

00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:10.569
enabled--

00:34:10.569 --> 00:34:11.569
&gt;&gt;Clay: Yup.

00:34:11.569 --> 00:34:13.999
&gt;&gt;membermale1: universe. How is this gonna
work out?

00:34:13.999 --> 00:34:15.200
[Clay clears throat]

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:21.839
&gt;&gt;Clay: Well, so this is, this is, one of
the great questions. Freedom is good, right?

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:25.730
And it sounds dumb when you say it that way,
but that's, that's kind of my animating belief.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:30.909
And one of the things I've observed is that
in-in-in our catalog of communicative freedoms,

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:35.220
freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom
of assembly, we have widespread freedom of

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.710
speech and freedom of press and freedom of
assembly have been, have been narrowly, narrowly

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.710
distributed.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:47.269
Now, those are also becoming widely distributed.
And it seems to me the, the, the question

00:34:47.269 --> 00:34:52.569
around the, the harm that can be done by groups,
4chan is, is on the list, but I think well

00:34:52.569 --> 00:34:56.929
down from say, Al-Qaeda or the pro-anorexia
kids. I mean, there's, there's lots, there's

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:03.109
lots of these examples and, and plainly some
of them, some of them in the book.

00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:08.950
What we do with free speech is we shift from
interdicting it in advance to responding to

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:15.640
it when it happens, right? We're not yet used
to that for public speech and public coordination

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.980
by amateurs because we haven't had a world
where that's been a big problem so far. But,

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.230
you know, when I talk about free cultures
getting what they celebrate, a lot of this

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:30.930
is really about putting the attention on the
people who are, who are doing that work. I

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:36.220
mean, 4chan, especially, to take that example,
is certainly out for nothing if not attention.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:43.700
And, and the, the shifting of that, you know,
by no means easy, really comes down to, I

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.420
think finding the groups that have the cultural
norms that, that use these tools. You know,

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.210
again, back to the, back to the Invisible
College example, right? The, the groups that

00:35:52.210 --> 00:36:01.520
say, "We're going to use this to create, create
positive value." The, the, at the, at the

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.839
end of any big transition like this, there
are good new things and goo-, bad new things.

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:12.490
And in some cases, our inability to stop groups
from forming; something we enjoyed quite a

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.849
lot in the 20th century and now don't enjoy
almost at all, is just gonna go in the bad

00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:18.339
column.

00:36:18.339 --> 00:36:22.369
And so our job becomes not stopping those
bad things from happening completely, because

00:36:22.369 --> 00:36:26.430
we can't, but rather making sure that the
good we get out of the good stuff is high

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:30.210
enough to counterbalance it. In the same way
that freedom of speech means Nazi's get to

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:34.319
march in Skokie, but it also gives us the
environment that we're all, you know, we're

00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:36.269
all fortunate enough to live in them.

00:36:36.269 --> 00:36:45.950
So, I don't, I don't mean to sugarcoat this,
but in a way, out of a kind of almost fatalist

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:53.700
view that there is no future in the Internet
Revolution that doesn't include new bad effects,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:58.829
our ability to recognize and highlight the
good effects is the only thing that will change

00:36:58.829 --> 00:37:01.579
the balance in the favor of the value of the
revolution over the, over the long haul, right?

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:02.579
&gt;&gt;membermale1: Thanks.

00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:03.579
&gt;&gt;Clay: Sure.

00:37:03.579 --> 00:37:11.829
&gt;&gt;membermale2: One of the things you just
mentioned in your last answer was that members

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:19.999
of 4chan do what they do for attention, but
what, what I wanted to ask you is in light

00:37:19.999 --> 00:37:23.750
of the fact that 4chan is, for all intensive
purposes, anonymous, where does anonymity

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:27.690
fit into the amount of value generation--

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:28.690
&gt;&gt;Clay: Yeah.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.660
&gt;&gt;membermale2: by this cognitive surplus?
Is it, is it something we should try to preserve

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.710
or is it something, obviously the paradigm
is shifting towards non anonymous activities?

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.710
&gt;&gt;Clay: Right.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:38.991
&gt;&gt;membermale2: And what is the, I guess, effect
of that?

00:37:38.991 --> 00:37:39.991
&gt;&gt;Clay: So I, so here's, the--

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:40.991
[clears throat]

00:37:40.991 --> 00:37:44.990
I think all attempts to say we need to have
a non anonymous Internet full stop, you know,

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:48.680
a reason-, again, this language has come out
of Italy. Periodically, the world's governments

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.240
decide this is a good idea for all the reasons
you would expect. South Korea has, is, is

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.220
going, I don't have to tell you because they've
been locked out of YouTube for awhile.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:01.730
That, that, the, every time one of the worlds
governments says that they're gonna drain

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:07.089
the swamp of anonymity, they're almost always
operating out of a desire to prevent politically

00:38:07.089 --> 00:38:13.700
motivated actors from having, having publically
accessible speech without, without national

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:19.789
control, which I think is something I think
we should be skeptical about. Where I think

00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:26.460
this is going is, is what Bob Axelrod showed
in his prisoner's dilemma work, the original

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:32.789
sort of computer modeling of just very simple
interaction patterns, which is that small

00:38:32.789 --> 00:38:38.769
groups of cooperating actors can actually
build an environment for themselves inside

00:38:38.769 --> 00:38:42.859
a larger hostile environment in which, in
which value is possible.

00:38:42.859 --> 00:38:50.690
Where I think anonymity is going is away from
a general class of availability on the Internet

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:59.160
to a, a site by site, and an area by area
decision as to whether or not to allow things

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.430
to be anonymous. So, some weblogs will say,
in order to encourage civil discussion and

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:08.109
kind of long term conversational value among,
you know, well known participants, you have

00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:11.950
to log in and you, at least, have to have
a well-defined pseudonym, right?

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.109
If you look at what Jeff and Joel, Jeff, Jeff
Atwood and Joel Spolsky are doing with Stack

00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:20.599
Overflow, a s-, you know, a really amazing
in terms of value creation around persistent

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:24.930
pseudonyms for making sure you get good, good
action. And then you look at Wikileaks and

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:33.049
you, and you think the design of Wikileaks
has to have the opposite set of characteristics

00:39:33.049 --> 00:39:37.559
in order to do what they do. Now, again, this
is without saying, you know, without putting

00:39:37.559 --> 00:39:41.339
Wikileaks in neither the wholly good or wholly
bad category, Wikileaks is an example of a

00:39:41.339 --> 00:39:44.119
site that couldn't work with those, with those
characteristics.

00:39:44.119 --> 00:39:52.210
So, I think, I think the big fight right now
is funnily enough not in the social norms

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:56.799
around anonymity or non anonymity, which we've
got relatively well worked out. It's in the

00:39:56.799 --> 00:40:03.420
technological ease of use around making the
decision, "I'm gonna make this site privilege,

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:09.099
pseudonyms or real names," right? If I could
go back in time and do anything different

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:12.039
to the Internet, other than fixing the 32
bit address space problem--

00:40:12.039 --> 00:40:13.039
[laughter]

00:40:13.039 --> 00:40:19.160
I would go back to the O OFF people and I
would beg on bended knee, beg for that to

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:24.589
be easier to implement because the, right
now, even the people who want to flip the

00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:31.170
bit to say, "We're creating a protected environment
for a less anonymous, a site of less anonymous

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:36.670
speech," can't make that choice easily. It's
better than it was, but it's not, it's not

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:41.140
great yet. Wikipedia, I'm on the advisory
board at Wikipedia, although I, I don't speak

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:46.579
for them, but one of the big conversations
there, for the obvious reason, is around,

00:40:46.579 --> 00:40:48.640
you know, well known actors.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:53.809
And it's used as an implicit heuristic right
now, but there is no identity commons good

00:40:53.809 --> 00:40:57.819
enough for Wikipedia to say, "This is low
enough cost that we can throw this in people's

00:40:57.819 --> 00:41:03.809
way and it won't significantly impact the
number of edits we get." And it's that, right?

00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:07.359
It, I mean it's funny, just given a whole
talk in which I'm saying, "Ah the technology,

00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:10.680
it's largely done now concentrating on the
social problem." This is actually one of the

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.280
places where it's really like the engineering
hurdle. For someone who wants to say, "We'd

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.281
like a conversation among well known actors
for all the good we get out of that." Like,

00:41:19.281 --> 00:41:23.599
that engineering hurdle is still too high,
so, there it is.

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:25.430
&gt;&gt;membermale2: Great. Thanks.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.260
&gt;&gt;Clay: Yes, sir.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.849
&gt;&gt;membermale3: I'm, I'm totally sure I'm gonna
screw up his name, but Jaron Lanier--

00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:32.849
&gt;&gt;Clay: Yeah.

00:41:32.849 --> 00:41:34.740
&gt;&gt;membermale3: the "You are Not a Gadget"
guy?

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:35.740
&gt;&gt;Clay: Yeah.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.000
&gt;&gt;membermale3: So, that just came out and
he's pretty anti any kind of--

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.279
&gt;&gt;Clay: [laughs] Yes, yes he is.

00:41:38.279 --> 00:41:44.180
&gt;&gt;membermale3: economized group, organization,
right? So, how would you respond to that?

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.980
I mean, obviously there's these kind of good
examples--

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.980
&gt;&gt;Clay: Right, right.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.980
&gt;&gt;membermale3: one after another, but he says--

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.980
&gt;&gt;Clay: Well.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.980
&gt;&gt;membermale3: the, that ultimately the dehumanizing
effect.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.900
&gt;&gt;Clay: Yeah. I mean, this is, this is, so,
so, so Jaron's book is out, Nick Carr's book

00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:05.989
also, "The Shallows" is out and he, yeah,
it's. Jaron is the more complicated case in

00:42:05.989 --> 00:42:06.989
a way.

00:42:06.989 --> 00:42:07.989
[laughter]

00:42:07.989 --> 00:42:12.869
Which, I guess, goes without saying for anything
having to do with Jaron. There, there is a

00:42:12.869 --> 00:42:18.650
lot in there that reads to me like pure iconoclasm,
right? The "you kids keep off my lawn" aspect,

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.380
the "Oh, the music today, these kids with
their, ah, it's awful," you know? I'll tell

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.349
you, in Brooklyn the music scene right now
is exploding. So, I, the, that, that strikes

00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:32.259
me as being interpretive in a way that doesn't
ramify outside what's going on inside Jaron's

00:42:32.259 --> 00:42:36.940
head. On the other hand, his critique of anonymity
to the, to the earlier question is exactly

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:42.190
right, right? What, what he says is wrong;
there is, is wrong.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:50.269
And this is, I think, the great shift in my,
in my period, now, now coming on 20 years

00:42:50.269 --> 00:42:56.520
of, of working on and thinking about, about
these technologies. In the 90s, the conversation

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.700
about the Internet was conducted between people
who knew something and people who knew nothing,

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:04.250
right? They were just, there wasn't a lot
of, you know, we used to talk about whether

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:08.119
people would get it or not. Now, we've got
people like Jaron, who knows as much about

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:12.559
the network as I do, but are strongly, strongly
pessimistic; Nick Carr, I'd put in the same,

00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:14.319
in the same category.

00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:18.859
It seems to me know that the big, the, the
important distinction isn't between optimist

00:43:18.859 --> 00:43:24.109
and pessimist, but between handwringers and
experimenters and that's, that's what-what-

00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:30.210
what gets me now. When I read The Shallows,
I'm, "Uh-huh, yup, yup, the Internet's distracting."

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:32.040
Like, who would disagree with that thesis,
right?

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040
[laughter]

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:38.489
You know, Carr quotes Cory Doctorow, right?
When Nick Carr and Cory Doctorow agree about

00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:42.859
something, it can fairly, safely be said to
have passed into, into the realm of received

00:43:42.859 --> 00:43:49.249
wisdom. And then you get to the part of the
book where Carr tells us what to do and that

00:43:49.249 --> 00:43:53.420
part is missing. There's nothing. There's
nothing in there. He doesn't even say what

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.920
his own practices are, right? The guy just
wrote a book while being distracted by the

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.200
Internet, so he's got something going on,
right?

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.200
[laughter]

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.359
He doesn't even tell us how he manages that.

00:44:02.359 --> 00:44:10.390
And I, I have the same, the same concern about,
about Jaron's stuff, which is if you read

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:17.509
"You are Not a Gadget," you don't leave knowing
what to do, right? Which is to say that there's

00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:23.410
no, there's such a lumping together of he
doesn't like Wikipedia and has some more respect

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:29.170
for Open Source, but he can't quite sort out
the distinction. And there's an opportunity

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:34.960
in there to say, "Wikipedia would be better
if it did X." And Wikipedia is all ears about

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:44.960
that. No X, right? And so, it, the, the, the,
the pessimists are generally right about what's

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.920
wrong with the Internet, but funnily enough,
the people who have the best position to make

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:55.950
those, those claims are not using that position
to then say, "Here's, here's an opportunity

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.970
to do something."

00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:01.349
My, my hope, I guess, is that those of us
on the experimenter side read the pessimists,

00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:05.640
read Jaron, read Nick, with, with an open
mind and say, "Oh yeah, that anonymity thing.

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:11.220
That has really been a problem in a number
of areas." Or, "Yes, I can, I can absolutely

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.789
see how I get distracted by having all of
these alerts on." But then taking that as

00:45:15.789 --> 00:45:20.730
input for, "Here's some experiments I'm gonna
do so that I, I can concentrate more, or that

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:26.819
I can set up a low-cost environment in which
anonymity is chased out of the system." And,

00:45:26.819 --> 00:45:32.609
and, you know, it, of, of the current crop
of pessimist books, that's, I think, the-the-the

00:45:32.609 --> 00:45:38.160
use I hope, you know, us and our tribe, to
speak loosely, make of that. So, thank you.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.619
[audience member coughs]

00:45:40.619 --> 00:45:45.249
&gt;&gt;membermale4: So, really interesting to hear
about this idea of trying to make significant

00:45:45.249 --> 00:45:50.599
civic change. I think we have a situation,
I'll exaggerate it to make the point where

00:45:50.599 --> 00:45:57.740
to be elected into politics, you need to lie,
ok? And what do you think, I'm probably not

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:03.220
alone here in wanting to see a system where
actually people can tell the truth, have measured

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:09.019
debate, and still get into politics. Do you
think that, do have ideas about how that could

00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:14.259
be achieved along these kind of lines and
how long it would take?

00:46:14.259 --> 00:46:22.790
&gt;&gt;Clay: Yeah, yes to the first, no to the
second. So, one of the great, one of the great

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:27.460
conundrums right now of the current administration,
right, when-when-when it became clear that

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:32.150
Obama was, was going to win and we all turned
our attention to, "Is he gonna govern like

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:36.789
he campaigned, right? Is he gonna use these
tools to run the people's business the way

00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:39.249
he used the tools to get the peoples vote?"

00:46:39.249 --> 00:46:43.619
And we seem to get an answer the day after
the election, when they launched change.gov,

00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:47.430
right? So, you come in and tell us, right,
"We're gonna put a brief on the President's

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:52.730
desk that is the, the accumulation of the
nations wisdom about the really important

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:57.130
problems." And the really important problem
turned out to be medical marijuana, right?

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:58.130
[laughter]

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:02.140
During, two words, not counting the War on
Terrorism, plus the worst financial meltdown

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:12.190
in, in 70 years, right? Medical marijuana
and, and out of the top 50, 16 other War on

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:17.670
Drugs averaged, pushed their way into the
top ten. And it seems to me that the, the

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:23.440
mistake there was to have a single cue where
there was a single name space worth fighting

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.650
over, right? Woe betide the person who implements
the single namespace worth fighting over and

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:32.200
the, the medical marijuana people were only
able to make their point, a quite reasonable

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.259
point about the War on Drugs by drowning out
everyone else. And they were able to do that

00:47:37.259 --> 00:47:42.039
because they were better organized and they
had a clearer mission statement.

00:47:42.039 --> 00:47:46.750
So, when you go and you go back and you look
the, you know, the design of the US Constitution,

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:51.359
James Madison, one of the, one of the architects
of the Constitution, spent a lot of time saying,

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:56.680
"You're gonna get factions." Right? Do not
try and pretend that there's such a thing

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.759
as special interest groups that you can get
rid of. All groups are special interest groups.

00:48:01.759 --> 00:48:05.710
Government is the place where factions contend;
not the place where we get rid of factions.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:12.150
So, it seems to me that to get, to get to
a place where we can have the kind of environment

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:17.359
you want, we're also gonna have to go back
to admitting that faction is what's driving

00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:23.599
government and that different factions are
contending for the attention of that government,

00:48:23.599 --> 00:48:27.569
rather than pretending that anybody can govern
on behalf of all Americans, as the current,

00:48:27.569 --> 00:48:32.729
as the current phrase. It is closer I-I-I
assume from your accent, you grew up under

00:48:32.729 --> 00:48:36.890
a parliamentary system; it is closer to a
parliamentary system than to the rhetoric

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:41.460
we currently have in the US, but that's, given
that that's reality on the ground, it seems

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.589
to me that getting to that point, doing something,
for example, on change.gov like saying, "We're

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:49.759
gonna group all the drug issues here and we're
gonna say we heard you, but we're not gonna

00:48:49.759 --> 00:48:54.869
let you drown out the early childhood education
people, or the War in Iraq people, or the

00:48:54.869 --> 00:48:56.170
prison reform people."

00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:01.740
So that, so that each faction has some place
on the stage, but you're not forcing them

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:07.410
to take each other out in order to get the
attention of the government. And, you know,

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:12.480
when you look at things like Google Moderator
and the, and the, the input that-that-that

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.569
Google Moderator has in, you know, in, in
the, the federal scene right now, it seems

00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:21.490
to me that those kinds of design principles
are one of the, one of the essential things

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.460
to getting to, to getting to the world you
imagine.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:29.269
Whether we can do that and how long it will
take, I don't know. The US is quite surprising

00:49:29.269 --> 00:49:34.300
in the issue which will seem intractable for
a long time, will suddenly go away in the

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:40.019
space of a couple years. But I, I certainly
don't have any sense as to whether this is

00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:41.039
one of those issues now.

00:49:41.039 --> 00:49:44.099
&gt;&gt;membermale4: Thanks very much and despite
my accent, this wasn't a dig at the American

00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:45.099
system in particular.

00:49:45.099 --> 00:49:46.289
&gt;&gt;Clay: No, no, I don't--

00:49:46.289 --> 00:49:47.289
[laughter]

00:49:47.289 --> 00:49:51.109
I don't even mean that. I just, I was conscious
while you were talking that, that what I was

00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:55.349
proposing sounds a lot more like a parliamentary
system than-than-than like the two party,

00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:58.019
possibly three party system we, we currently
have.

00:49:58.019 --> 00:49:59.989
&gt;&gt;membermale4: Thank you very much.

00:49:59.989 --> 00:50:01.559
&gt;&gt;Clay: Thanks very much.

00:50:01.559 --> 00:50:06.030
&gt;&gt;membermale5: Hi. As another person from
the same parliamentary system, my question

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:08.589
is that all, valuable things we could do with
the cognitive surplus--

00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:09.589
&gt;&gt;Clay: Uh-huh.

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:13.800
&gt;&gt;membermale5: I was wondering how do you
see social networks fitting into that hierarchy?

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.950
&gt;&gt;Clay: They don't. I think that they're more
a tool. I wouldn't, I wouldn't wanna propose

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:23.309
that, or it could say it has one particular,
one particular place there. To take, to take

00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:28.249
just the example from here, right, Nisha Susan
used the network to coordinate people to take

00:50:28.249 --> 00:50:33.779
real world, to take real world action. The
one thing I will say about social networks

00:50:33.779 --> 00:50:40.490
is that our bias, you know, technologically
our bias for the last, you know, few decades,

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:45.359
has been to lower the cost of messaging, right?
And, and it's had all of these wonderful effects

00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:50.310
that we've seen, but that around political
speech, low cost messaging has actually become

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:51.349
a problem, right?

00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:56.599
We now, you know, campaigns are routinely
conducted to affect the business of the US

00:50:56.599 --> 00:51:01.580
Congress, which are conducted on the McDonald's
business model, right? Billions and billions

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:06.779
of emails served. And the predictive value
of any one email to a representative about

00:51:06.779 --> 00:51:09.980
how their constituents feel in that district
is null, zero, right? You talk to people on

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.329
the hill; they don't pay any attention to
that. They just read the same press releases

00:51:13.329 --> 00:51:15.460
the rest of us see and see who sent the most
mail.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:21.819
So, what started as digital activism is rapidly
becoming crowd sourced PR. And that, that

00:51:21.819 --> 00:51:26.589
I think is one of the risks of social networking
by-by-by creating the idea that all valuable

00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:31.559
activities are low cost activities, you know?
You see these things go by on Facebook, you

00:51:31.559 --> 00:51:35.460
know, shout outs for ending world hunger,
or whatever and you think, you know, there's

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:39.700
a mismatch here between the effort being put
in and the value being put out. So, one of

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:44.979
the things I, I, that, that I, was so striking
to me about the Nisha Susan story, about the,

00:51:44.979 --> 00:51:49.619
about the Mangalore story is that she used
Facebook to gather the group, but then she

00:51:49.619 --> 00:51:52.009
immediately moved to a very high cost signal.

00:51:52.009 --> 00:51:56.099
I'm gonna buy a pair of underwear, I'm gonna
deface it, I'm gonna buy a box to put it in

00:51:56.099 --> 00:52:00.029
and I'm gonna put an address and a stamp on
it. That takes a lot of effort compared to

00:52:00.029 --> 00:52:04.539
filling out your name and a zip code and pressing
submit. And I'm convinced that her move to

00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:10.349
a high cost signal is one of the things that
made the government pay attention. So, social

00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:15.920
networks by providing a social graph that
allow for a greatly heightened ability to

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:21.710
find one another and to coordinate, I think
need, need to also start producing, or activists

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:27.019
like Susan need to add on as a layer the ability
to send high cost signal when they're needed.

00:52:27.019 --> 00:52:31.170
Because if all we get is billions of emails
served and shout outs for ending world hunger,

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:35.730
we actually haven't done so much to, to change
the political culture. Yeah.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:39.089
&gt;&gt;Karen: Oh. Thanks very much, Clay, for coming
today.

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:41.710
&gt;&gt;Clay: Thank you very much. Thank you for
having me, it's great, it's great to see everybody

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:42.710
here.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.711
