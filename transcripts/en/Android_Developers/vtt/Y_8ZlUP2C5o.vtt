[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.910
BRIAN KEMLER: Good afternoon.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.690
Is everybody ready for the
best accessibility I/O ever?

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.980
Woo!

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.050
Right on, right on.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.030
My name is Brian Kemler.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.760
I'm a PM on Android
Accessibility.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.220
Our goal is to ensure that
everyone can use our products

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.340
no matter what their ability.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.690
Specifically, we design and
build Accessibility Suite,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.950
Sound Amplifier, Live
Transcribe, and now Live

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.520
Caption.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.100
We've invested heavily
in the last year

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.440
to make audio on Android
much more accessible.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.310
So we'll be focusing
a lot on that today.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.280
Here with me today
are Melissa, Lauren,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.810
and Kelly, our passionate team
of researchers, programmers,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.590
and engineers.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.490
Today, I'm going to share my
perspective on accessibility's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.890
mission and why it matters.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.489
I'll discuss new products for
the deaf and hard of hearing.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.790
Melissa will show you how
we use structured research

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.960
to inform our most important
product-making decisions.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.120
Lastly, Kelly and
Lauren are going

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.400
to talk about new
products for users

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.360
with physical disabilities,
reduced dexterity, low vision,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.100
and blindness.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.150
So now let's talk
about our mission.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.260
Accessibility's mission
is integral to Google's.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.290
So integral it's in the
mission statement itself--

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.510
to make the world's
information universally

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.760
accessible and useful.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.410
Let's unpack that a little bit.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.850
Universally accessible means
everyone can use Android.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.670
We don't expect users to
adapt to our products.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.360
Rather, we adapt our
products to our users

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.140
because we think of
accessibility as a human right.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.230
If there are
barriers for anyone,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.650
we have more work to do.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.000
And it's with this mantra
that we design, build,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.990
and apply Google magic
to make both our products

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.810
and the real world
around us more successful

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.610
and more useful for more
users in more situations.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.790
The world's information
means it's not just

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.890
about making what's on
the device accessible,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.340
but it's about making the
planet more accessible.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.270
And to do this, we apply
advances in machine learning

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.170
and artificial intelligence--
what I call the Google magic--

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.640
to meet the needs of
underserved communities.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.920
Last February, we
launched Live Transcribe,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.860
an accessibility-first
experience enabling--

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.474
[MIC FEEDBACK]

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.040
--anyone to have a
conversation without feedback.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.450
Allowing anyone to
have a conversation,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.210
even if they can't hear.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.960
You can think of Live
Transcribe as captioning

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.640
for the real world.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.340
Sound Amplifier and
Lookout are also

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.190
great examples of building
accessibility-first

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.540
experiences.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.390
And you could think of
this overall approach

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.750
as a practical,
useful, and potentially

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.990
transformative application
of augmented reality.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.370
So why is this important?

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.110
Why do we care?

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.350
Many of us, in fact, including
myself at one point in time,

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.930
believe that disability was
something that only affected

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.920
a small set of the population.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.240
Even in the strictest
sense, that set is massive.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.850
It's a billion people, or 15%
of the world's population.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.670
But let's start to
think about disability

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.200
a little more holistically.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.310
So if we include people
who don't self-identify

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.070
as having a disability,
this number-- one billion--

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.580
it doubles.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.810
It grows.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.020
If we think of friends,
family, and loved

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.510
ones of folks who
have disabilities,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.000
well, then that
number grows again.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.830
And thinking of this
even more expansively,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.530
if we think about
disability to include people

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.620
with temporary conditions, like
a broken arm or a broken leg,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.670
or situational ones like
driving and texting--

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.970
don't do it-- then
our circle expands

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.130
to include nearly
the entire planet.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.330
So it's really
everyone's work to make

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.940
not just our products, but
the planet, more accessible.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.060
And when we do so, we're
affirming that accessibility

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.240
is a human right.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.080
So apart from doing
the right thing,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.670
I'm going to talk to you a
little bit today about why

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.730
there are some very positive
karmic consequences when we

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.130
design for accessibility first.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.200
So much so, a term
is coined for it,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.450
and that term is
the curb cut effect.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.270
So you see, back in the day,
there were no curb cuts,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.410
just as at one point in time,
there were no closed captions.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.700
So that meant that people who
use wheelchairs effectively

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.420
encountered a wall every
time they came to a curb.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.970
So in 1945, there was a guy
in Kalamazoo, Michigan, named

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.250
Jeff Fisher, who is disabled.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.950
And he advocated and
fought for the installation

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.780
of the country's first curb cut,
and they caught on globally.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.470
Sidewalks, and more
importantly, cities,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.210
became independently navigable
for the very first time.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.830
And this had
positive consequences

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.880
literally for everyone.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.340
For parents, with
kids in strollers,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.220
for people toting
luggage, for workers

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.710
with dollies or hand trucks.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.150
And now today, we can't even
imagine a world without them,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.120
because we're much safer and
it's much easier to get along--

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.200
to get around.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.990
And this is what was
dubbed the curb cut effect.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.700
Another realization of the curb
cut effect is closed captions.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.860
Personally, I love captions.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.030
They're great for the World
Series or the World Cup

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.800
at a loud bar.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.120
They let me listen in
silence when I'm on the train

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.480
or at the library, or I don't
want to bother my co-workers.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.410
As awesome as they
are for me, they're

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.420
game-changing for the 466
million people on the planet

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.140
who have hearing loss.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.830
So about a year ago,
we prototyped and built

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.400
an accessibility-first
application

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.530
called Live Transcribe, and
we launched it in February.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.920
I'm going to switch over
and do a little demo of Live

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.670
Transcribe.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.305
Demo-- yep, great.

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:43.430
So this is nothing special.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.980
This is a basic Android
smartphone, as you can tell.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.800
I'm just speaking
naturally and quickly,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.950
and it's picking
everything up in real time.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.570
It works in over 70 languages.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.830
And it's a great tool
or a great bridge

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.160
to carry around with
you in your inner pocket

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.290
if you need to transcribe
a conversation.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.920
It's amazing.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.430
It also captures
very subtle nuances.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.970
So I can say something such
as I bought a new jersey

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.070
in New Jersey, and--

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.280
it doesn't work for the
demo, but I usually say it,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.788
and I usually say that I bought
a new jersey in New Jersey.

00:07:20.788 --> 00:07:21.830
Well, it doesn't like it.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.140
It usually gets context,
but the demo gods

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.000
are not forgiving today.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.660
It also has a great feature,
which we call type back.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.890
So if you prefer not to speak,
or in case you can't speak,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.510
you can type a response
back to the person speaking

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.200
right here in the interface.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.750
So it's really more of a
two-way conversation tool

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.640
than it is strictly captions.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.080
Awesome.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.090
My demo didn't work.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.350
Back to the slides, please.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.490
So now that we literally have
captions in the real world,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.940
what's the next
frontier for captions?

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.620
So I'm super glad you asked.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.580
Let's turn to the
growth of online video

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.520
and build empathy for
people who are missing out

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.330
on this explosion of content.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.710
So every minute,
400 hours of video

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.590
are being uploaded to YouTube.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.660
So we saw that
this is a problem,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.530
and in 2009, we added automated
captions to all the content

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.970
on YouTube, which was an
awesome, awesome first start.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.190
But what about personal
videos, social media, podcasts?

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.090
You know, the stuff that we
love to use each and every day.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.870
They're typically uncaptioned,
meaning for the deaf and hard

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.140
of hearing, it's
effectively a silent movie.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.440
So led by the creative lab
in New York who is here

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.490
today, we started exploring
a simple question--

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.270
could we automatically
caption any media playing

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.740
across your phone?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.010
So together with a
whole bunch of teams

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.190
from Mountain View and New
York and Tel Aviv and speech

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.270
research, and the creative
lab, and audio framework

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.060
and accessibility,
we banded together

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.460
and we spent a year trying
to solve this problem.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.610
And so I'm going
to let the result,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.120
Live Caption, speak for itself
and switch over to the demo.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:41.390
So I'm using Google Photos, and
this is nothing special here.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.590
It's a video of my cat and my
fiancee, and a little message

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.970
that they recorded for me.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.160
SPEAKER 1: Hi, honey.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.870
Hope you're having a great time
at I/O. We miss you so much.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.880
[? Tico ?] misses you.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.350
Hope you're having a great time.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.700
BRIAN KEMLER: So you can
see, I can caption anything

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.655
on the device, and it went away.

00:10:03.655 --> 00:10:04.530
Let me bring it back.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.690
SPEAKER 1: Hi, honey.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.400
Hope you're having a great time
at I/O. We miss you so much.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.380
[? Tico ?] misses you.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.110
Hope you're having a great time.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.430
Hi, honey.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.998
Hope you're having a great
time at I/O. We miss--

00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:22.540
BRIAN KEMLER: So
that's Live Caption.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.510
And it works with
podcasts, it works

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.620
with videos that you record,
voicemail, or instant messaging

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.290
apps on video and so forth.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.000
And we're super excited.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.140
You may have seen that we
mentioned it in the keynotes

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.080
today.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.510
What you see there is literally
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.420
So we use recurrent
neural networks

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.910
that we've shrunk down from
these monster models that

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.450
used to run in the cloud, and we
run them locally on the device,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.120
and that gives us some
really cool advantages.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.150
So one, it lets the
product work offline.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.910
So I can be in a
totally offline mode.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.080
I can be in a plane.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.980
It's going to work.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.160
Two, audio never
goes up to the cloud.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.190
So it just sits there locally.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.640
And best of all, developers
and content providers

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.130
never need to lift a finger.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.250
If there's audio,
there are captions.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:19.090
So with Live Caption, every
app, billions of videos,

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.780
and podcasts from any
source are one step

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.470
closer to being universally
accessible on Android.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.100
Now over to Melissa to talk
about how we use research

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.130
to inform our most important
product-making decisions.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.070
MELISSA BARNHART:
Thank you, Brian.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.650
Hi, everyone.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.000
My name is Melissa Barnhart,
and I'm a researcher on Android.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.400
And today, I'd like to talk to
you about the user experience.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.630
So when you think about
the user experience,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.640
I'd like you to
think about empathy.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.390
Empathy is at the
heart of design.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.310
Without the
understanding of what

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.100
others see, feel,
and experience,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.560
design is a pointless task.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.150
And to be empathetic
technologists,

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.510
we have to set aside
our own assumptions

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.590
and consider other perspectives.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.800
Now, a great way
to build empathy

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.630
is through user research.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.990
User research focuses on
understanding behaviors

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.660
and needs through a
variety of methodologies

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.430
like interviews, observations,
or survey, just to name a few.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.650
Like a compass,
user research can

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.740
help point you and your
product in the right direction.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.930
And you can utilize
user research

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.950
at any stage in your design
and development process.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.260
Before you begin
building, user research

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.230
can uncover unmet needs
and inspire designs

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.440
that actually meet those needs.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.780
The number one reason
for startup failure

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.810
is lack of market
need for a product,

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.080
but you can minimize this
risk by conducting research

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.660
before development even begins.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.940
And when development
is underway,

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.760
user research can help you
evaluate different design

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.840
solutions and ensure that your
user experience stays on track.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.120
And then when your product
is out in the market,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.920
you can use research
to help measure

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.205
the impact of your designs
and also to show the ROI.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.060
So today, I'd like to share
an example of how we've

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.260
used user research to improve
Live Transcribe, a new Android

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.930
application that provides
real-time transcription

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.090
for the deaf and
hard of hearing.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.070
A team of research
scientists at Google

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.150
identified a new opportunity
for automatic speech recognition

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:45.100
and built the first prototype
for Live Transcribe.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.430
So we have the technology, but
what about the user experience?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.780
We had a lot of questions
about Live Transcribe

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.870
that we hoped to address through
research with the deaf and hard

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.620
of hearing participants.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.920
For example, what are
their first impressions

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.540
of Live Transcribe?

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.670
Also, how would they
expect scrolling

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.180
to work in both landscape
and portrait orientations?

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.460
Should it scroll
from top to bottom,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.920
should it kind of fade
away, or should it

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.930
resemble a physical book?

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.250
But our most pressing question
was about the visual design.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.390
What font style, type form,
text size, text color,

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.150
and background color
should we default to?

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.790
We assumed that users
would want to see

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.420
differently-colored
confidence levels to indicate

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.500
the accuracy of
the transcription,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.560
but we didn't know for sure.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.290
And good research starts
with good research questions

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.160
like these ones.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.730
So to answer our
research questions,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.740
we took a mixed
methods approach.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.040
We started with a usability
study in a Google lab

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.350
to evaluate our
minimum viable product

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.680
with people who had moderate
to profound hearing loss.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.750
But we also wanted to
know how people would

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.570
use Live Transcribe over time.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.750
How would it work in different
environments like in the home

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.990
or in the classroom,
and would people's needs

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.390
change with continued use?

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.150
So to answer these
questions, we partnered

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.750
with Gallaudet University,
the world's premier university

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.520
for the deaf and
hard of hearing.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.470
And that collaboration
allowed us

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.070
to collect longitudinal feedback
from faculty and students

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.550
who used Live Transcribe
in everyday life.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.880
And after iterating on our
designs based on their feedback

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.430
and adding new
functionality, we conducted

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.310
a second lab-based
usability study again

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.770
with participants who had
moderate to profound hearing

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.680
loss.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.320
OK, so let's dig into those
lab studies a little bit.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.480
Our protocols started
with questions

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.470
like tell me about a time when
you use real time captioning?

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.300
What did you like
about the experience

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.820
and what did you dislike
about the experience?

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.890
So background
questions helped us

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.150
understand previous experiences
as well as current needs.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.880
Then we enabled the
prototype, and we handed it

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.230
to the participant.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.410
And for the next 60 minutes,
we initiated conversation

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.920
about a variety of topics
and generally observed

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.780
how the participants
interacted with the phone.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.200
We also evaluated
different text flows

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.300
and probed for feedback
on the visual design.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.250
So in our prototype,
white italicized text

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:29.050
signified unfinalized text
whereas yellow normal text

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.510
represented finalized text.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.350
Did these participants
understand that color and type

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.530
form indicated confidence
in the transcription,

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.405
and was that information
even valuable?

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.300
So it was in this
research that we

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.720
learned that changing the
type form and text color

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.470
actually distracted participants
from the conversation.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.380
Additionally, our
participants self-reported

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.440
that italics made reading
more difficult for them,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.330
and these insights
were reinforced

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.700
by previous research
in this space which

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.609
says that a transcript is
easiest to read when it's not

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.099
layered with these
extra signals.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.310
We also learned that our
original scrolling text

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.369
flow felt natural, unlike
the other flows that we

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:15.450
showed participants.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.814
It didn't force them
to shift their eyes

00:17:17.814 --> 00:17:19.064
to another part of the screen.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.950
So because of these
insights, we removed

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.200
those colorful
confidence levels.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.950
We used a normal type forum
instead of an italic type form.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.890
And we proceeded with
the scrolling text flow.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.280
And this is just the beginning.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.830
We'll continue to
make improvements

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.120
as we conduct further research.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.360
But what I really hope to show
today is the power of empathy.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.960
So by putting aside
our own assumptions

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.540
about the visual design
and conducting research

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.110
with our target audience, we
changed the product design

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.940
to be more legible and
ultimately accessible.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.924
And next up is Lauren here to
talk to us about dexterity.

00:17:58.924 --> 00:17:59.557
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:59.557 --> 00:18:00.890
LAUREN WINSTON: Thanks, Melissa.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:01.445
Hi, everyone.

00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:03.320
My name's Lauren, and
I'm a software engineer

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.250
on central accessibility.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.430
Now let's talk a little
bit about dexterity,

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.490
the challenges users with
dexterity impairment face,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.430
and the services on Android
to help with these challenges.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.370
According to the US census,
more than 50 million people,

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.410
or more than 19% of
the US population,

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.690
has some form of
mobility impairment.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.887
Moreso in the US, more than
two million of these people

00:18:24.887 --> 00:18:26.970
have an impairment that
impacts how understandable

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.410
their speech is.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.080
Over 50 million people
have limited dexterity

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.570
in their hands, and
nearly 20 million people

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.180
have difficulty
lifting and grasping.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.250
The majority of this population
is over 65 years old.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.200
Those with severe
dexterity challenges

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.650
include those with conditions
such as ALS, cerebral palsy,

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.410
Parkinson's, or
spinal cord injuries.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.930
Some conditions result
in users experiencing

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.380
involuntary movements such
as spasms and tremors.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.450
They may also have
difficulties with speech

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.700
and having their
speech understood.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.940
Many conditions impacting
dexterity are progressive.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.200
As loss of dexterity happens,
fine motor skills may regress.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.480
People might have difficulty
with picking things up

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.520
or maintaining a hold on items.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.050
Grasping or interacting
with a phone

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.880
can be particularly
challenging for people

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.160
within this population.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.780
There are varying
levels of severity

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.050
of dexterity impairments, and we
offer various apps and services

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.420
on Android that can be
used to help users based

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.755
on their own individual needs.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.360
We introduced Accessibility
Menu last year

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.970
designed to make common
interactions easier for people

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.090
with dexterity challenges.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.760
Accessibility Menu simplifies
common actions such as power

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.100
off, locking the
screen, and accessing

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.500
notifications in recent apps.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.600
When enabled, it can
be opened via a button

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.130
at the bottom of
the screen, which

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.080
helps those with limited reach.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.960
Now we're adding new controls
for volume and brightness

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.690
so the user can continuously
adjust volume and brightness

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.490
without leaving the menu.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.700
We've also added an option
for large buttons and settings

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.330
to make the menu buttons larger.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.730
So those that may have
more limited hand dexterity

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.240
can use Voice Access to
control their phone via voice.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.030
Voice Access uses voice
commands to perform gestures

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.010
on elements on the
screen without needing

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.930
to physically touch the phone.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.580
Voice Access was
recently launched

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.380
in September of last year.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:27.020
You can download it now
at g.co/voiceaccess.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.180
Voice Access places
an overlay of numbers

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.400
over the actionable
elements on a screen.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.000
Simply speak to your phone
with actions such as "click 7"

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.760
or "go back" to interact
with your phone.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.290
When Voice Access
is enabled, you

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.300
can continue using your
usual Google Assistant

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.130
commands, such as setting a
timer or checking the weather.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.990
A feedback bar is always present
at the top of the screen that

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.820
captures your spoken phrases.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.220
You can specifically
refer to elements

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.990
by their number
such as "top seven"

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.920
or you can refer to the
name of the elements.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.680
So if you wanted to
open an app, like you

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.003
wanted to open Google Keep,
you could say "open Keep."

00:21:02.003 --> 00:21:04.170
We're also happy to announce
that we brought support

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.555
to French, Italian,
German, and Spanish.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.150
So Voice Access
is great for those

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.067
with limited hand dexterity
and understandable speech.

00:21:14.067 --> 00:21:15.650
But there's many out
there who may not

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.360
be able to speak clearly.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.630
For those Android users
we have Switch Access.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.360
Switch Access allows users
with limited hand dexterity

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.850
and limited speech to navigate
through their phone using

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.590
external buttons or switches.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.270
I'll show you what a typical
switch might look like.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.060
So a typical switch
could look something

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.430
like this with
two large buttons,

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.640
and a user can interact with
the switch with their hands,

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.250
or if they have more control
on other parts of their body,

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.000
they may use another
part of their bodies,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.290
such as their feet.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.030
In a common two-switch
case, one switch

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.430
can be likened to a Tab
that moves the highlight

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.130
on the screen when pressed,
while a second switch can

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.710
be thought of as an Enter that
selects the highlighted item

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.850
when pressed.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.700
Switches can be configured
to meet user needs,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.330
and switch access can be used
with as little as one switch.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.000
Most input devices work with
Switch Access, including

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.010
just a regular USB keyboard.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.500
So text editing is commonly a
pain point for switch users.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.340
So we recently added
text-editing menus.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.520
These menus add shortcuts for
previously time-consuming text

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.550
editing tasks, such as
highlighting and deleting

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:26.170
text, undoing or redoing
actions, copy, cut, and paste.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.960
This allows text editing to
be done much more quickly,

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.450
and with the use of as
little as one switch.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.940
I'll show a quick demo of this.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.150
OK, so in this demo,
I'm using switches

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.848
configured to the volume keys.

00:22:41.848 --> 00:22:43.390
Assigning switches
to the volume keys

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.040
is a very easy
way for developers

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.170
to test out Switch
Access on their own apps

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.600
without needing to have
an external switch.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.310
So using the volume
keys, I'm going

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.560
to go through the
elements on the screen

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.870
until I get to the text
field I wish to edit.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.290
I can select the text field,
and it brings up our text menu.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.790
So I want to move a word around.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.188
So I will go to highlight and
then choose the granularity

00:23:04.188 --> 00:23:05.230
that I wish to highlight.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.050
So I'll choose Highlight
Previous Word, which highlights

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.120
this word "peaches" here.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.300
Then I can cut the
word with the menu.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.630
And then now I want to paste
the words somewhere else.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.350
So to do this, I first
need to move the cursor.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:25.030
So I can go to
Previous, and then I'll

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.900
do previous line to move to the
beginning of this text field,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:34.820
and then I can place
the word there.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.240
But what if I made a mistake?

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.990
We have undo and redo
actions added to these menus.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.300
Text-editing mistakes can be
very costly for switch users,

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.560
so these actions allow our
users to go more quickly

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.072
back to text editing.

00:23:49.072 --> 00:23:50.530
And now I'll go
back to the slides.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.450
OK, so switching gears,
let's talk a little bit

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.730
about what's new for vision.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.320
To start with,
here's a little bit

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.600
of background on
this population.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.850
According to the World
Health Organization,

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.120
it's estimated that 253
million people globally

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.910
live with moderate to
severe visual impairment,

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.510
and people over 50
are most at risk.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.977
36 million of these
people are blind.

00:24:18.977 --> 00:24:20.810
We're here to help
people within vision loss

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.820
be able to access and enjoy
not just their phones,

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.880
but the world around them.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.660
Lookout is an Android
app that helps

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.430
make the real world
accessible for people

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.520
who are blind or low vision
by helping them complete tasks

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.590
and routines more independently.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.440
We launched Lookout
in March of this year.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.360
Now I'll show a quick
video that speaks

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.370
a little more to
what Lookout does

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.568
and how it's used by our users.

00:24:45.568 --> 00:24:46.560
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.550
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.570
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.025
All right.

00:26:45.025 --> 00:26:49.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.640
So as you saw in
that video, Lookout

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.510
is able to detect and recognize
a variety of objects including

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.480
currency and text through
computer vision and machine

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.560
learning.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.810
Lookout uses several
image classifiers that

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.070
run continuously on the device.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.880
This allows Lookout to process
video and provide results

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.070
to users in near real time.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.740
Since information is
processed on device,

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.290
Lookout can even work
in airplane mode.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.620
Results are also scored based on
a variety of signals, including

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.010
user context.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.010
Our goal is to provide
the most relevant results

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.300
to users in a timely manner.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.300
Lookout contains three modes--

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.820
explore, shopping,
and quick read.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.270
It allows users to further
contextualize their environment

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.790
and what kind of information
they want out of it.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.710
Explore is the most
widespread mode

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.300
that can be used for a
variety of daily routines,

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.440
such as cleaning the house,
cooking dinner, or visiting

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.690
a new space for the first time.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.930
Shopping includes on-device
barcode lookup as well as

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.790
currency detection.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.310
Quick read focuses
on text, and can

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.950
be used for activities such
as going through the mail

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.500
or reading labels on
items in the kitchen.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.770
Here's a quote from
one of our users.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.390
"I used Lookout
once in preparation

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.620
for making spaghetti.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.780
It very accurately
describes each item

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.120
without me having to maneuver
the device or struggle

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.437
to get the items in focus."

00:28:10.437 --> 00:28:12.020
Finding the correct
ingredients to use

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.810
when cooking is something
that many sighted users hardly

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:15.950
think about.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.400
This shows how Lookout can be
used to really change lives

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.740
by helping people who
are blind or low vision

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.770
be more independent.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.330
You can find look out on
Google Play at g.co/lookoutapp.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.610
It's available in the
US and it was initially

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.990
launched on Pixel.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.850
And we're happy to
announce that Lookout

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:39.320
is expanding to Samsung S8
through S10 and LG G7 and G8

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.400
devices.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.670
Support on these new
devices is rolling out now.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.040
We want to get Lookout in
the hands of as many users as

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.680
possible, so we anticipate
releasing Lookout on more

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.828
devices throughout the year.

00:28:50.828 --> 00:28:53.120
Now I'll hand it off to Kelly
to talk a little bit more

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.930
about what else
is new in vision.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.480
KELLY CHEN: Hello, everyone.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.410
My name is Kelly Chen.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.510
I'm the program manager
from Google Pixel team

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.670
and based in Taiwan.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.590
Let's figure out
how to make a phone

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.485
accessible for blind
and near-vision users.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:23.140
TalkBack is Android's
screen reader.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.230
We provide a spoken
feedback so that who

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.930
are blind or have
difficulty seeing,

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:34.220
they can use their phone
without looking at a screen.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.070
TalkBack can read as on screen
reader loudly, and then users

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.790
to interact with their
devices by gestures.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.710
Before we jump into
the new feature,

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.800
I want you to think
about something.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.580
What will you do to
find movie details?

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:59.140
Like what kind of movie
starts at the cinema?

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.520
You can navigate it
easily on your phone,

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.070
and it's simple for you.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.040
Now imagine that
how difficult this

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.790
would be if you couldn't
see on the screen?

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.810
Not so easy, right?

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.140
Today, we are going
to give everyone

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.070
a better user journey
in your screen reader

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.150
to have you find--

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.775
you navigate and find
your content quickly.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.360
People who cannot see well,
they need to swipe one element

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:39.280
at a time to let a screen
reader read it for them.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.220
And if you want to
find the things,

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.790
they may need to do
a lot of gestures.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:50.150
That's why we enhance the
screen search feature.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:54.190
So we provide a user interface
to perform the search.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.690
And the [INAUDIBLE]
can be triggered

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:00.710
by not only keyboard shortcuts,
but also by touch gestures

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.010
and voice input.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:09.580
[INAUDIBLE],, it provides any
languages supported by Android,

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.480
and it's always available you.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.600
You can use it in
Accessibility Suite 7.3 now.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.770
OK, let's go to the live demo.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:26.470
OK, let's say you are
curious that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.010
So you want to learn more.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.540
So let's see how this works
in TalkBack without search.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.060
[DING]

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.140
SPEAKER 2: TalkBack on.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.580
Chrome.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.990
KELLY CHEN: And just listen--

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.577
how many steps I'm doing.

00:31:44.577 --> 00:31:45.660
SPEAKER 2: Connection is--

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.150
HD-- one open-- more options--

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.330

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.700

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.370
explore some of-- products--
resources-- accessibility--

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.640
accessibility-- get
started with the--

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.650
Android OS-- from hearing aid--

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.170
Android access--
Switch Access help--

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.630
link, double-tap to activate.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:10.350
KELLY CHEN: See, it takes
like 10 or 20 swipes.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.770
And you can imagine, like,
if a link at the bottom,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:19.000
so we may need to swipe
more than 30 or 40 times.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.280
Now with search feature,
it becomes super easy.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.170
Let's try it.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:29.640
So to start search,
swipe left then down.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.830
SPEAKER 2: Android OS.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.090
Type search term.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.015
Showing English US
QWERTY keyboard.

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:35.640
KELLY CHEN: OK.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.260
SPEAKER 2: Research-- editing--

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.060
type search term-- edit box.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.920
KELLY CHEN: So it will
bring you to a search page,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.820
then [INAUDIBLE] switch.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.250
But you may wonder how
people with limited

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:54.670
eyesight how they do it,
but it's the same behavior.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.800
You just touch it on a keyboard.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.070
If you listen, [INAUDIBLE]
what do you want [INAUDIBLE],,

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:04.250
you just lift your finger
up, then it will work.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.130
So let's do it.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:12.590
SPEAKER 2:
S-S-W-5-5-T selected--

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.300
switch-- C-H-- two matches.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.460
KELLY CHEN: And a list with
matches will be showing.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.910
And then you can check which
one you are looking for,

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.280
then double-click it.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.410
It will bring you
to the details.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:29.180
Then see the first ones to which
[INAUDIBLE] is exactly what

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.993
you want, and then you go it.

00:33:30.993 --> 00:33:31.910
SPEAKER 2: Clear and--

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.550
Switch Access--
Switch Access help--

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.640
link-- Chrome-- get started
with Accessibility Scanner.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.710
KELLY CHEN: OK.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.480
SPEAKER 2: Double-tap
to activate.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.190
KELLY CHEN: It's that simple.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.580
So we-- the [INAUDIBLE]
will get the user to a place

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.590
faster, and to make people more
productive, and efficiency.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.940
OK, I'd like to go
back to our slide.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.780
Dark Theme-- this is one
of my favorite features.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.770
You know why?

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:04.270
Because when I'm in bed using my
phone in low-light conditions,

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:08.320
and I believe a lot of you may
have this kind of experience.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.670
And it may be easier for you
use your phone, like read it

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.219
and browse the phone easily.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:20.100
And it's even helpful for people
who are sensitive to light

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.409
or they have low vision.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.409
So it's as if it
were a Dark Theme.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:28.870
And you can find the
options under Settings,

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.170
and then you can find it on
accessibility and the display.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:38.920
It's coming on Android Q, and
it also saves your battery life.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.929
Now, let's talk about
not of just vision,

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.030
but all kinds of disabilities.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.820
Let's try if you want
to change your volume.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.420
So you can look at
your volume button,

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.460
and there's the right
side of the screenshot,

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.760
you can see that
there's a control panel.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.270
So either way, it'll show
only for a few seconds,

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:11.380
and you imagine if people
with physical impairments

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:16.000
or limited sight, they may
not get enough time to do it.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.150
So that, Accessibility
Timeouts, it's

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.900
a new feature which give
us a little extra time

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.650
to interact with the devices.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.910
We help people to find
a way, and then you

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:34.650
can change the time on the
accessibility settings.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:38.440
So it make people to
do it more efficient.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.540
What app developer
would need to do

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.690
is to use the
Accessibility Manager

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.810
API to get a
[INAUDIBLE] timeout,

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.870
and to follow the value
[INAUDIBLE] works.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:53.590
And this is also
coming in Android Q.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:57.040
We will have these
five sections tomorrow,

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.890
so you're all
welcome to join us.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.890
So let's hand it over to
Brian for the summary.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:03.510
Thank you.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
BRIAN KEMLER: Thank you.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.710
Thank you, Kelly.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:12.670
Thank you, Melissa.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:13.660
Thank you, Lauren.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.610
Thank you, creative lab.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.650
Today, we talked
about our mission

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.390
of making our products
and the real world

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.020
more universally accessible.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:27.430
We dove into the curb cut effect
to drive home how important

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:30.940
and what the wonderful
unintended consequences

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:34.690
of building for
accessibility can be.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.400
I spoke a little
bit about Android,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.020
and how now with
our smartphone, you

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.560
are able to caption both the
real world and almost all

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.090
of the content on the device.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:52.030
No other operating system in
the world can make that claim.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:56.710
Melissa did a wonderful job at
describing and demonstrating

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:00.880
the before and after of
how we use her research

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.470
to inform our decisions and
really upend our own biases

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.920
and make informed
decisions based on data.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.880
Lauren demonstrated
Voice Access and Switch

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.350
Access that innovate a way
to use a two-button keyboard.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:21.010
I think that is so cool that you
can text edit with two buttons.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.230
It's just awesome.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:27.190
Kelly talked about
TalkBack, Dark Theme,

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.010
and all of these
wonderful new products

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.450
that we have for vision.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.300
So I'm not going to keep
you guys any longer,

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.010
but I want to let you know
about a couple of other talks,

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.640
including one today
that we're going

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:44.590
to do on accessible audio on
Android at 5:00 PM on Stage 7.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:48.033
So if you want to dive
in on the audio topic,

00:37:48.033 --> 00:37:49.450
we'll be talking
about audiograms.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.658
It's going to be really cool.

00:37:50.658 --> 00:37:53.520
We'll do a hearing
loss simulation.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.270
Tomorrow we're
going to have a talk

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:59.290
on demystifying accessibility
development on Android.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.690
That's targeted
toward developers.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.950
And then lastly, we have
two accessibility-related

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.150
experiments tents.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:11.290
One the experiments sandbox,
and the other the accessibility

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:11.830
sandbox.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.860
So everybody, thank you
so much for coming today.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.010
Thank you for your
interest in accessibility,

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.030
and we hope you
have a blast at I/O.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.980
