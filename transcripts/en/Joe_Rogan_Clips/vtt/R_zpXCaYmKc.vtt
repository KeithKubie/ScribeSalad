00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.890
The Joe Rogan experience.
Jesus Gel was go,
are you reading about this?

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.350
There's something wrong with you.
Where do you find that stuff,
Jamie?

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:11.580
Why do you go looking for when you're saved pages?
Why do people try to sell you?

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.930
This is the images of I eat asked Florida man,
and I just started scrolling down.

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.140
Okay,
we go to Jamie's like Google ads.

6
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:22.910
It's all duct tape and crowbars and shit handled rope.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.680
What's up with all this rope?
All the handsaws.
Oh Nah man,

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.960
this is how you know that even when a clear your search engine,

9
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.390
it doesn't matter because I clear my shit sometimes and,
and even if I,

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.820
when I go back to porn hub,
it's still knows my suggested shit.
So creepy.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.290
Look into it.
[inaudible] time to look into it.
Time to look into the porn.

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
That's where there,
where people are making money.

13
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:48.321
It's from cookies and using your information and your data and finding out what

14
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:54.870
you're interested in selling it to advertisers.
It's all very,
very sorted stuff.

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.790
Does Zuckerberg has got us,
dude.
Yeah,
there was a car parked us.
It's just

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.393
this a lot.

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.460
It's weird that that sort of escaped the imagination of people that were like

18
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:12.840
looking towards the future.
Like they didn't think the data would be so valuable.

19
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.733
Yeah.
Nobody really,

20
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.360
nobody really saw that 20 years ago when the Internet was first coming alive.

21
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.870
Like nobody ever thought they'd be able to like check your searches.

22
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.020
Like when they figured out how to make a search engine,

23
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.970
then tied it into what you're searching for and selling that to advertisers.
God,

24
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.540
it's genius,
but it's,
it's crazy.

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.160
They can make so much money.

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.460
It's like you were talking about it's not right that you can make so much money

27
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.420
telling jokes.
Well,
it's really not.
Right.
Right.

28
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.150
You make so much money providing a search engine off of the materials that

29
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:48.030
you've searched,
what you're supposedly,
you're protected by,
right?

30
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.230
You're supposed to think that your searches are protected,
but on one hand,
right.

31
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
Like it's cool because you get all this data,
you get into this information,

32
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.540
but you know,
you could literally find out any answer to any question.

33
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.330
We do it all the time.
Yeah.
But then the other part it's like,
well,

34
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:04.920
what am I giving up?
You get to now they know what you like,
what kind of,

35
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:07.320
what things you're thinking about buying,
what are what you are interested in,

36
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.790
what movies you like.
They know that.
So they start selling you that like,

37
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.720
oh well I guess I want them to sell it to me.
That's is what I like.

38
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.650
Kind of that is a nice car.
Wow.
Look at that.
Right?
Hey that movie does look good.

39
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.610
You know,
and then you're like,
oh my Google is really working out well for me.

40
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.090
You want to become autonomous with the machine.

41
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.500
It's just a big net just casting out and just think if they put a chip in you.

42
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.670
Are you cool with the chip?
Got One already got the chip.
Dot.
Yeah.
Which,

43
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.840
which version though?
Um,
2.6.
I don't know.
I don't ask.

44
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:40.590
Just chip,
chip me up dog.
Um,

45
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.420
you got to go to Langley,
Virginia.
You go to where they kept Hannibal Lecter.

46
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.110
That's how they chip you.
Chip you out there in Langley,
you gotta go to the FBI.

47
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.400
They have to know you're okay.
Cool.
Cool.
Chip May,
dude,
I've chip,

48
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:58.170
chip me to fuck up.
What would it take for you to get chipped?
Like for real,

49
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.930
if there was a chip and it provided your gps tracking everywhere you go,

50
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:06.700
but you could read people's minds so the government knew where you were all the

51
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:11.050
time.
They do.
But everybody else that had a chip in it,
you can read their mind.

52
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.850
Like you could see their intentions.
You could,

53
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.940
you could find out if they're upset.
You can find out the rational or irrational.

54
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.490
Maybe you can even show them the error of their ways with your thoughts.
Oh,

55
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.600
I don't want to just take that shit.
I want to know people's head.

56
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.520
They already know where you're at,
man.
They've got your fucking phone.

57
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.331
They can have that.

58
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.980
I don't want to know what's going on in like Jamie's head leader.

59
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.500
Want to know fine.
You know he's thinking about right now her food.
Yeah.

60
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.280
Yeah.
It's like three of 20 you're gonna have to move.
We upgrade almost.
Oh yeah.

61
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.860
That is like what it was like,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Remember why he got it,

62
00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:44.140
but he was killed.
He was shot in a spoiler alert.

63
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.190
He was shot in like a robbery by armed gang members.

64
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:52.240
They shot him and paralyzed him and then this guy brought him back to life with

65
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:57.241
this chip in his spine that regenerated spinal tissue and gave them super powers

66
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.580
and he knew Kung Fu and all kinds of other shit.
Shit.
Me Dude.
Yeah,

67
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.670
John Coffee thing.
Jamie came out of here.
You're distracting me.
Shit at me today.

68
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.170
What's going on with you?
She,
I say,
I say chip me up.
Shut me the fuck up.

69
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.710
What about you Jamie?
What'd you get distracted?
If you had a chip inside of you,

70
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:16.690
would you think about it all the time?
Yeah.

71
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.030
The neural links scares the shit out of him.
That's basically the same thing,

72
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.200
right?
If you're wearing it,
yeah.
Oh,
you,

73
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.590
but do you think you'd like that would become like,

74
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:27.580
you would think about that chip all the time?
No.
No.
You'd probably,

75
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.290
you'd definitely forget about it.
Forget about.
Let's just,

76
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.310
just like you forget about anything else that you have in that you,

77
00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:33.890
you forget about this thing that this tracking device on a of,

78
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.180
as long as you can pick it up and put it down when you feel like you're not

79
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:39.340
really connected to it,
the handle you absolutely are.

80
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.950
But if you had something inside you,
you'd be like,
Whoa,

81
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.970
pull out when I really went for it.
Okay.
The chip,
are you talking to it?
Yes.

82
00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:50.890
See I didn't want to talk to it.
The upgrade movie.
Yeah.
We try to turn on my car,

83
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.160
get directions to Joe's.
Can't forget about it then it's close to it,
man.

84
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.050
You have a,
then you just did.
It becomes one with you.

85
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:57.760
It's not like you're thinking about it.
You're just acting.

86
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.080
You're woke you up in the middle of the night.

87
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:02.080
You'd be pissed by would wake me up.
Usually not too.

88
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.620
You know what I've been doing with Siri lately?
The dumb bitch tell me,
use it.

89
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.030
I tell him what to do.
Um,
I make maker make a Oh notes for me.

90
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.890
Uh,
so I go,
Hey Siri,
make a note.
And what would you like to say?

91
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.990
Exactly right there.
Whose phone was that?
Mine or yours or yours?

92
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.240
See that [inaudible] created.
She created a note.

93
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.400
She's,
she's listening to you,
dude.
Hey,
here we go.
Hey Siri.

94
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.750
Make a note.
What do you want it to say?

95
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.450
Andrew Santino was the last of the great gingers.

96
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.060
<v 0>Okay.
I created a note.
Andrew Santino was the last of the great changes.</v>

98
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.420
That's a good,
that was pretty,
beautified it out.
She's pretty good.

99
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.990
You change was to is did you say is,
oh,
she did that.
See,

100
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.710
but it's good enough for me if I have ideas.
If I'm driving around,
I have ideas.

101
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.630
I just tell Siri to do my dirty work for me.
It's the best I've got.
It's like,

102
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.180
it's made me capture so many more ideas.

103
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.890
I would never be able to capture because I'm driving.
