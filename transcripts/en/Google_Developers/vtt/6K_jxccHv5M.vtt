00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.390
Watching TV should be easy

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.080
But way too often getting to your content
isn't easy at all

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.900
Android TVs solve this problem
by allowing users

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.760
to easily search with their voice,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.340
see the recommendations, 
and jump between content and games

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.690
just as easily as they do on their phones

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.140
And for developers, if you've already
built an Android app for the phone,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.130
you're just a few enhances away

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.360
from working on your TV as well

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.170
Hello,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.090
I'm Timothy Jordan
and this is an introduction to Android TV

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.960
I'm going to give you a very quick 
overview of Android TV

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.810
and how easy it is to bring
your content to the living room.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.580
Let's start with the creative vision

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.810
for Android TV, 
which will help you understand

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.980
the difference between 
building on something,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.300
like a phone, and building for the TV

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.410
To sum this up quickly, 
You want to create

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.890
an experience that is ..
Casual, Cinematic, and Simple

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.230
By Casual we mean that 
it should be easy going

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.970
TV is not work

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.120
Picture yourself hanging out 
with your friends in the living room,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.200
watching a movie, playing a game,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.170
or just listening to some music.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.280
In a cinematic act, the interface

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.720
should fade away,
putting content front, and centre.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.460
Tell your story with 
pictures and sound

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.820
instead of text and menus.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.630
and finally, everything 
should be so simple

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.650
that it feels magical

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.080
minimize steps, avoid text entry

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.350
Just get the user to their content.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.390
Android TV gives you the tools

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.440
to easily extend your existing
app or game, or create new ones

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.130
just for the big screen.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.130
The most important thing 
to remember here

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.450
is that, "Its Android"

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.510
It's the same platform that 
you've already used

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.700
to build your phone apps

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.910
In fact, most of that code
can be used for the TV apps as well.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.360
It can even be in the same APK

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.810
Here are the differences;

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.370
First, You've got to declare the activity

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.510
that's intended to run on the TV.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.820
This is done on the manifest.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.210
Second, You want to update your UI

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.460
to use the lean back support library

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.270
It's not strictly required,
but in most cases

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.430
It'll be silly not to use it,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.870
because it makes it building a great 
TV UI easy with widgets such as,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.940
Browse Fragment, Details 
Fragment, and Search Fragment.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.510
The Leanback library 
depends on Recycler View

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.630
and the V4 support library

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.990
RecyclerView gives you classes for

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.780
managing the display of long lists
in a memory efficient manner

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.750
Super important for TV interphases

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.100
and of course, the V4 support library

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.480
gives you all sorts of goodies.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.300
The Third and final step 
is to make your app

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.470
and content available to the user.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.590
With the activity declared 
at the manifest,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.940
your app will already show up in the 
apps or games section.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.100
However, there's also the opportunity

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.590
for your content to appear
in the recommendations row

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.270
and through search.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.930
The recommendations row
is the central feature

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.600
of the home screen

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.040
It gives users quick access
to dynamic and a relevant content

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.020
It's essentially a bunch of
cards that represent a system

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.830
or app action, notification,
activity, or piece of media.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.810
You'll extend intense service
to provide suggestions

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.610
for the Recommendation
row, which will

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.110
help get your content noticed.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.710
Search is important
too, because users often

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.420
have specific content in mind,
and browsing for that content

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.980
is usually not the fastest
or easiest way to find it.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.530
However, you can
add a search action

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.340
in your app, which
you should do.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.900
But why stop there?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.380
You can also define
a content provider

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.830
to make your content available
to Android TVs' global search.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.920
Android TV brings the
Android platform

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.110
to the living room.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.320
Rich content, entertaining
apps, and gaming across devices

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.390
are now possible
in the living room

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.220
by extending the apps you
already have for the phone.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.490
To get started bringing
your service to the TV,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.220
check out the Documentation
and Code Lab as well

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.510
as these other DevBytes on the
Leanback Library and Search.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.460
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and I look forward

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.750
to seeing your app
on TVs everywhere.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:22.140
