00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.351
So now let's write the code. You've gotta put up with my coding handwriting here.

00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:09.128
What we're going to do is initialize k to our global thread index.

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:13.116
We're going to initialize chum to our next pointer, and then we're going to loop.

00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:16.357
We're going to run this routine until we run into the end.

00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:21.852
And the question is, what do we do at each stage? What do we set the new chum of k to?
