00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:01.906
- [Voiceover] Someone walks
up to you on the street

00:00:01.906 --> 00:00:06.031
and says, "2943, quick is
this divisible by nine?

00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.285
It's a matter of life and death",

00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:09.185
and you could say,

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:10.913
"Well, I can do this fairly quickly".

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:12.749
To figure out whether
it's divisible by nine,

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.481
I just have to add up the digits

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.646
and figure out if the sum of the digits

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:21.600
is a multiple of nine or
whether it's divisible by nine.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.768
So let's do that.

00:00:22.768 --> 00:00:26.942
Two plus nine plus four plus three,

00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:30.638
two plus nine is 11, 11 plus four is 15,

00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:33.007
15 plus three is 18,

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.704
and 18 is definitely divisible by nine,

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:38.032
so this is going to be divisible by nine.

00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:39.361
And even if you are unsure of whether

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.329
18 is divisible by nine you could apply

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.638
the same rule again.

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:45.422
One plus eight is equal to nine,

00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:49.165
so that's definitely,
definitely divisible by nine.

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.396
And so the person can go save their lives

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:52.883
or whoever's life they were trying to save

00:00:52.883 --> 00:00:54.351
with that information.

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:55.735
But this might leave you thinking,

00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:57.630
well, that was nice and useful,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.136
but why did that work?

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:00.388
Does this work for all numbers?

00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:01.754
Does it only work for nine?

00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:03.361
and I don't think this works for eight,

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.988
or seven, or 11, or 17,

00:01:05.988 --> 00:01:07.910
why does it work for nine?

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.443
And actually also works for three,

00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:11.284
and we'll think about
that in the future video.

00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:12.406
And to realize that,

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:16.422
we just have to rewrite 2943.

00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:19.924
So the two in 2943, it's
in the thousands place,

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:22.094
so we can literally rewrite it as

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:23.882
two times,

00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:26.402
two times 1000,

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:28.114
the nine is in the hundreds place,

00:01:28.114 --> 00:01:32.705
so we can literally write
it as nine times 100,

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:35.005
the four is in the tens place,

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.954
so it's literally the same
thing as four times 10,

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:41.349
and then finally we have
our three in the ones place,

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.759
we could write it as three
times one or just three.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.710
This is literally 2000,
900, 40, and three,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.330
2943.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.041
But now we can rewrite
each of these things,

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.157
this thousand, this hundred, this ten,

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:59.558
as a sum of one plus something
that is divisible by nine,

00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:00.714
so 1000,

00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:05.294
1000 I can rewrite as one plus 999,

00:02:05.294 --> 00:02:07.508
one plus 999,

00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:10.648
I can rewrite 100 as one plus 99,

00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:12.598
one plus 99,

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:16.577
I can rewrite 10 as one plus 9,

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:18.877
and so two times 1000 is the same thing

00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:22.184
as two times one plus 999,

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:24.023
nine times 100 is the same thing

00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:27.268
as nine times one plus 99,

00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:29.515
four times 10 is the same thing

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.611
as four times one plus nine,

00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.652
and then I have this plus three over here.

00:02:34.652 --> 00:02:36.264
But now I can distribute,

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:38.460
I can say, well, this over
here is the same thing

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.401
as two times one, which is just two,

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:43.745
plus two times 999,

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:46.383
this thing right over
here is the same thing

00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.967
as nine times one, just to
be clear what I'm doing,

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:52.588
I'm distributing the two
over the first parenthesis,

00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:54.010
these first two terms,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.959
then the nine, I'm gonna distribute again,

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.510
so it's gonna be nine,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.041
nine times one plus nine times 99,

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:04.105
plus nine times 99,

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:06.055
and then over here,

00:03:06.055 --> 00:03:07.912
I forgot the plus sign right over here,

00:03:07.912 --> 00:03:09.417
I'm gonna distribute the four,

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:11.804
four times one, so plus four,

00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:13.653
and then four times nine,

00:03:13.653 --> 00:03:16.383
so plus four times nine,

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:18.919
and then finally I have
this positive three,

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.893
or plus three right over here.

00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:23.113
Now I'm just gonna
rearrange this addition,

00:03:23.113 --> 00:03:24.343
so I'm gonna take all the terms

00:03:24.343 --> 00:03:27.010
we're multiplying by 999,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.256
and I'm going to do that in orange.

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:31.036
So I'm gonna take this term,

00:03:31.036 --> 00:03:32.341
this term,

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:35.173
and this term right over here,

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:38.794
and so I have two times
999, that's that there,

00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:41.726
plus nine times 99,

00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:43.962
plus four times nine,

00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:45.332
plus four times nine,

00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:46.506
so that's those three terms,

00:03:46.506 --> 00:03:48.982
and then I have plus two,

00:03:48.982 --> 00:03:50.331
plus two,

00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:52.058
plus nine,

00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:54.238
plus nine,

00:03:54.238 --> 00:03:56.041
plus four,

00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.361
plus four,

00:03:57.361 --> 00:03:59.356
and plus three,

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:00.124
plus three.

00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:02.641
And this is interesting, this
is just the sum of our digits,

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:04.508
this is just what we did up here,

00:04:04.508 --> 00:04:07.099
and you might see where
all of this is going,

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.514
this orange stuff here,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.598
is this divisible by nine?

00:04:10.598 --> 00:04:12.675
What? Sure, it will definitely,

00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:14.579
999, that's divisible by nine,

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.381
so anything this is multiplying by,

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.216
it's divisible by nine,

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:19.427
so this is divisible by nine,

00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:20.989
this is definitely divisible by nine,

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.626
99, regardless of whether
is being multiplied by nine,

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:25.197
whatever is multiplying by nine,

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:29.282
whatever is multiplying 99 is
gonna be divisible by nine,

00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:31.149
because 99 is divisible by nine,

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:33.726
so this works out, and
same thing over here,

00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:38.218
you're always going to be
multiplying by a multiple of nine,

00:04:38.218 --> 00:04:40.017
so all of this business all over here

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:44.097
is definitely going to
be divisible by nine.

00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:45.917
And so in order for the whole thing,

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:49.810
and all I did is I rewrote
2943 like this right over here,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.613
in order for the whole thing
to be divisible by nine,

00:04:52.613 --> 00:04:54.917
this part definitely is divisible by nine,

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:57.260
in order for the whole thing
does the rest of this sum,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.916
it has to be divisible by nine as well.

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:02.013
So in order for this whole thing,

00:05:02.013 --> 00:05:05.050
all of this has to be divisible,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.572
divisible by nine.
