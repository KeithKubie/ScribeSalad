00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.530
 The hardware screen space is small 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.321
 The multidimensional design is encouraged to be enjoyed 

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:06.734
 Applications are cleaner and easier to view. 

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:08.400
 But this is difficult for users 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.024
 Discover all the options your app offers. 

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:13.190
 I'm Joanna Smith, that's exactly why you should 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.020
 Take the navigation menu into consideration 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.020
 The navigation menu is a panel of options 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.560
 On the left edge of the screen. 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.300
 They are often hidden. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.730
 But can be detected when the user scans from the left. 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.440
 It is also possible to always be visible 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.690
 If enough space is available as on tablets 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.050
 In landscape mode. 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.630
 Owning a navigation list which 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.650
 Usually referred to as the left nav, allows your application 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950
 By offering a lot of features and behaviors, 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.022
 Without being visually obscured. 

00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:38.230
 So you can keep your important features in a prominent place 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.800
 When the user searches for more, 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.419
 He can use this list. 

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.460
 Now I am fully convinced of your need 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.210
 To build a left-hand nav. 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.010
 So let me show you what to do. 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.192
 First, you must build Drawer Layout. 

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:51.900
 It must be a <i>root view</i> 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.690
 It contains two <i>child views</i> 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.670
 The first <i>child</i> should be a view of the basic content of the screen. 

00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:58.400
 This is when the left nav is hidden, 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.260
 So when the stairs opens later, it will be in the foreground. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.400
 The second <i>child</i> is view from the navigation menu. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.900
 After you reach your design 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.870
 You'll need a list of things to fill. 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.250
 <i>Navigation view</i> makes this easier 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.405
 The frame you need for the navigation menu. 

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.530
 You only need to supply a <i>navigation view</i> with a tool 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 With two things - headerLayout, if you have, 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.940
 And a list of item names. 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.710
 The menu is very good indeed 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.720
 It allows you to populate your content from the XML resource list 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720
 Instead of running Show menu programmatically. 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.220
 Better yet, that means you 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.150
 Get your multidimensional design on a free nav tray. 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.030
 This small source can be simple 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.080
 As a simple set list of selectable elements. 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.080
 Any item currently selected will be displayed 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.870
 As a prominent nav element. 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.980
 However, you can build more complex lists as well 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.060
 Using sub-headers to group items together. 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 After you get your list of navigation elements, 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.010
 You'll need to respond to click events. 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.710
 You'll get responses to selected items 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.380
 Place <i>onNavigationItemSelectedListener</i> 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.050
 Using <i>setNavigationItemSelectedListener</i> 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.680
 This reply gives you the list of clicked items, 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.670
 Allowing you to handle selection events 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.841
 Change selection status, upload new content, and so on. 

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.340
 If it is not a navigation menu 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.090
 You are always shown in your app, which is very likely, 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.660
 You'll want to listen to the opening and closing events. 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.810
 This will allow you to make the adjustments you need before changing the display. 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.080
 The scan from the left is the default tester 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.430
 Opens the navigation menu. 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.440
 But you can also use the hamburger icon 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.200
 To open and close the tray. 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.470
 Now there is a final note. 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.960
 I was referring to the navigation menu 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.670
 The left nav b, but that does not mean 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.480
 It must always be on the left. 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.814
 If your app supports right-to-left layouts, for example 

00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:36.008
 You have learned your layout with start and end attributes instead of left and right attributes 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.750
 The system will build the right-hand nav instead of the left. 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.894
 Thus, right-to-left users will be able to scan from the left to open the navigation menu 

00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:46.377
 It will be perfectly aligned with the right side of the screen. 

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:48.710

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.320
 At your best, take a look at the rest 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.180
 The contents of our Android development styles are thought to be adhering to 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.820
 Community + G for tips, tricks and help. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.090
 But more importantly, continue to build better applications.
