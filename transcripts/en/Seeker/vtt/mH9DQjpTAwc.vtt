00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.389
These days it seems like we can stitch any
part of the body to anyone.

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.850
People are getting new livers, hands, even
faces.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.759
But what about penises?

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.769
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.440
It’s a sad reality that, as long as you
have a body, you can lose pieces of it.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.070
Accidents or tragedies can leave people missing
parts of themselves and until very recently,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.800
they would have to cope with the loss for
the rest of their lives.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.720
Soldiers wounded in war know that reality
all too often, as Improvised Explosive Devices,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.930
also known as IEDs, frequently maim the men
and women they don’t outright kill.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.670
Denise Grady of the New York Times reported
that often times male soldiers who wake up

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.010
from surgery are foremost concerned if their
genitals are intact.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.780
Sergeant First Class Aaron Causey lost both
legs and a testicle to an IED and said that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.660
the psychological trauma of the genital damage
made it so much worse than the physical loss.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.620
With that in mind, doctors are preparing to
perform the first ever penis transplant in

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.610
the United States within the next year.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.940
Two previous attempts have been reported to
journals, so the surgery is still every experimental.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.040
So much so that the surgeons at Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine have been researching

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.250
and practicing on cadavers in preparation.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.170
They’ve used brightly colored food dyes
to map out the circulatory system in the cadaver

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.180
penises and have discovered previously unknown
aspects of the blood supply..

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.990
When it comes time for the operation, they’ll
have to connect two to six nerves, six or

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.340
seven arteries, and the urethra, the tube
that runs inside the penis.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.190
If all goes well, they expect the grafted
member to be more than just for show.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.480
After allowing a few months for healing, the
doctors expect the ability to urinate and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.570
feel sensation through it will be restored.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.659
Eventually the patient will even be able to
use it for sex again.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.670
Of course if you have a penis, or even if
you don’t, the thought of having someone

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.630
else’s attached may concern you.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.340
That’s actually why the first ever penis
transplant in China back in 2006 failed.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.340
The operation was a success, but after 15
days the patient claimed the psychological

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.460
effects couldn’t be overcome, and the operation
was reversed.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.460
Dr. Gerald Brandacher of Johns Hopkins isn’t
as concerned.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.890
He’s grafted new hands onto patients since
1998, and although hands are a deeply personal

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.850
part of our anatomy every patient he’s ever
had immediately started referring to the replacement

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.090
as though it were their own.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.869
If they do regain the ability to have sex,
there’s something else that can be their

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.380
own too; their children.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.270
So long as a testicle was left intact, then
the genetic material they pass on will be

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.270
their own.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.310
In fact, the second and thus far only successful
recipient of a donor penis, a young man in

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.630
South Africa who underwent surgery in 2014,
reported this year that he would become a

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.630
father.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.640
No loss of a body part is ever easy, but the
stigma that comes with injured genitals makes

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.200
it that much more difficult.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
If the operation at Johns Hopkins is a success
and moves out of the realm of experimental

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.250
surgery, it will go a long way towards helping
wounded veterans or similarly injured civilians

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.250
heal.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.560
A transplant is more complicated than just
sewing everything together, and many of them

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560
fail.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:03:05.990
Julia explains why it’s not a perfect solution
here.
