00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.180
You know what they say, wetter is better,
and that’s true in the hunt for extraterrestrial

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.180
life.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.410
But where else is water in our solar system
besides Earth?

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.840
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.660
We keep searching for liquid water on other
planets because we think it’s a key ingredient

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.150
for life as we know it.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.359
But maybe we’re wrong, Amy talked about
how life might look on other planets in another

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.359
video.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.981
Check it out, there’s a link in the description.

00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:32.870
But tell Mulder to rejoice!

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.070
Recent research found strong evidence of liquid
water, adding two new candidates to the list

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.030
of potentials hosts of life.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.579
In the 1990s researchers found some strange
magnetic readings taken by NASA's Galileo

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.490
spacecraft of one of Jupiter’s moons Ganymede.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.630
They theorized that a layer of thick salty
liquid water was the best explanation.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.149
Now, new images from NASA’s Hubble Space
Telescope has the best evidence for it.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.450
The research, published in Journal of Geophysical
Research: Space Physics looked at images of

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.059
the moon’s magnetic field.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.130
Ganymede is rare, in that it’s the only
known moon with its own magnetic field.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.090
This field “rocks” back and forth whenever
Jupiter’s magnetic field changes.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.810
This rocking motion allowed scientists to
estimate how much water might exist on the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.890
Jovian moon.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.070
They estimate an ocean ten times deeper than
Earth’s underneath a thick layer of ice,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.060
which might make it inhabitable to life.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.060
But wait!

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.340
Don’t get too disappointed, there’s more
water - A recent study published in the journal

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.099
Nature found evidence of hot water flowing
on Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:35.030
Liquid water was long suspected, in 2005 the
Cassini spacecraft captured images of water

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.010
plumes spewing from the surface.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.760
But this new study analyzed tiny rock bits
from the moon, and found them filled with

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.099
salt and silica.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:46.601
Silica is so similar to quartz and sand, which
are formed in hydrothermal vents, that the

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:50.450
finding suggests hot water is currently flowing
on the moon.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.870
Hydrothermal vents on Enceladus would be a
huge discovery.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.020
A lot of scientists currently think that life
on Earth got its start in deep sea hydrothermal

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.020
vents.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.979
If these vents exists on other planets…
well they’d be a good place to look for

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.479
extraterrestrial life.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.539
Other celestial bodies might have water, too.

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.599
As far back as 1997, NASA has thought Europa,
another moon of Jupiter’s, has a giant ocean.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.140
Images captured from a flyby of the Galileo
Spacecraft suggested as much.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.340
But the water might be trapped beneath a thick
layer of ice which some scientists say is

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.510
“bad for biology.”

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.900
Another popular candidate for extraterrestrial
life, Mars!

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.700
It’s no secret Mars has icy polar regions.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.340
But scientists have wondered for a while now
whether or not the planet was wetter in the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.340
past.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.440
New research published in the journal Science
suggests that 4.5 billion years ago, the red

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.410
planet might have had an ocean 450 feet deep.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.830
The truth, might still be out there.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.830
So what do you think?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.970
Is wetter really better?

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.190
