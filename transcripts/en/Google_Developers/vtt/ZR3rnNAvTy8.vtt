00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.120
Welcome to this
episode of UXD where

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.970
I'll share best practices
for designing and building

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.095
location-based mobile apps
that are sure to delight

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:07.590
smartphone users
who are on-the-go.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.840
This is the first episode
of a three-part series where

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.610
we will focus on the
design implications driven

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.485
by the ergonomics of
single-handed navigation

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:16.034
and location-based
apps that use maps.

00:00:16.034 --> 00:00:17.700
I'm your host, Nazmul
Idris, a developer

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.340
advocate passionate
about design and mobile.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.940
Now before we dive
into the specifics

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.050
of building well-designed
location-based apps,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.820
we need to know more about
how actual users interact

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.420
with location-based technology.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.200
And to understand this, we
have to look at their context.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.729
So what is context?

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.390
Well, the user's context is
driven by the amount of time

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.760
a user has to accomplish a goal,
the tasks that they're going

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.620
to perform to accomplish this
goal using a variety of devices

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.790
and applications, where
they're physically located,--

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.097
for example, at home, at
work, or at an airport--

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:49.430
and what their state of mind is.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.080
Are they happy?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.049
Are they stressed out?

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:52.090
Do they want to be alone?

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.720
Or do they want to
be with friends?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.120
Now, all these things drive how
people choose devices they use,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.050
and it also affects their
expectations from apps

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.970
that they're running
on these devices.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.970
Now, typically research
and planning tasks

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.530
are done on tablets and
laptops, but execution tasks

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.030
are done on
smartphones, where users

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.190
have bursty and intense
interactions with their device.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.770
Now, while they're busy doing
other things, and as a result

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.544
they could be really distracted.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.960
So when you put
this all together,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.210
there's a good chance that
location-based apps running

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.410
on smartphones will be used
by people to perform execution

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.944
tasks while they're on the go.

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:28.360
In other words,
to understand this

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.200
just picture yourself
standing at a busy airport.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.789
You have a bag in one hand.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.080
You're on your way to the gate.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.810
And you're trying to
use your smartphone

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.110
to find a place to get coffee.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.930
So let's pick apart
this use case.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.680
Now, before we get into
the specifics of designing

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.780
and building an application
that helps you get your coffee,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020
there is one problem
at hand which

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.450
is, how do you allow the
user to find a coffee

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080
shop on the map
using a single hand?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.110
So, when you consider
the human hand

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.280
and how people hold
their phones and which

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.720
parts of the touchscreen
are easy to touch,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.670
we bump into some real
physical constraints.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.919
Human hands can only
move in certain ways,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.280
regardless of how a designer
envisioned the perfect visual

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.110
and interaction design.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.540
This is why UX is industrial
design and not fine art.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.790
The goal of industrial design
is to create and execute

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.490
design solutions for problems of
form, usability and ergonomics,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.110
while taking the user and all
these constraints into account.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.790
And these constraints
apply to any type

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.373
of location-based
application that you

00:02:30.373 --> 00:02:32.430
might be building and designing.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.980
So now it's really important
to respect these constraints,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.540
or in other words, respect
the hardware form factor.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.050
And by hardware, I
mean the user's hand.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.016
This picture shows
you that interactions

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:43.640
that require a user
to move their thumb

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.620
to the red or orange
touch areas on the screen

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.950
are going to be
difficult to accomplish.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.370
And the red areas are much
worse for single-handed touch

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.990
than the orange areas.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.340
So the green areas on the screen
are the most comfortable areas

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.630
for someone to
touch with one hand.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.120
So this means that
you should try

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.290
to design the UI in such a
way that the widgets that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.210
require the most
touch interaction

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.970
should be placed
in the green area

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.920
and less ideally in
the orange, and try

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.765
to avoid the red
areas altogether.

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:11.140
This will result
in an app that's

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.140
easy to use with just
a single hand or thumb.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.630
Now, keep in mind
that this picture

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.490
is for right handed
users who make up

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.440
over 70% of people in the world.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.710
Here's another fun fact.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.970
About 50% of users tend
to hold their phones

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.470
in one hand which
means that they're

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.195
using the phone
with a single thumb.

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:29.570
This is what the
thumb zone looks

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.460
like when you overlap both the
left and right-handed users

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.069
onto the same surface.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.610
If you wanted to
create an app that's

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.470
usable by both left
and right-handed users,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.950
then this is a good
reference to keep in mind.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.210
So looking at this picture,
avoid the stretch zones

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.370
if possible, and definitely
avoid the ow zones.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.290
And try to keep the touch
interaction centered

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.450
in the thumb zone.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.280
For more details
on the ow zone, you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.424
should read this great
article by Scott Hurff.

00:03:57.424 --> 00:03:58.840
And there's also
a great book that

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.595
covers this in detail called
"Designing Mobile Interfaces."

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:04.720
So, what should we do with
this new found knowledge

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.110
of the human hand
and how people use

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.950
their smartphones
with a single hand?

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.770
How do we make a more usable
coffee locator application?

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.450
We could leverage
these constraints

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.930
to create better designs
for any location-based apps,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.490
not just coffee
finding apps that

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.050
are going to be used
by humans with hands.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.850
Let's dive into some specifics.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.030
So here's the first
best practice.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.080
Try to avoid the use
of small mapviews.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.960
No one likes small mapviews.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.820
If mapviews are tiny, then
users can't navigate around

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.520
in the view which
is frustrating.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.330
And they're going to
be difficult to touch

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.450
with thumbs and even fingers.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.750
So if you are going to use
a small map, for example,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.450
in a hybrid view where you
show a list of results,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.200
then make sure that
they're not navigable,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.100
meaning that the
user can't actually

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.620
touch it and move it around.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.490
So clearly, big maps
are the way to go.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.680
Try and make the mapview
as large as you can.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.405
It's the content that the
user should be immersed in.

00:04:57.405 --> 00:04:58.780
And they should
not be distracted

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.461
by needless interactions.

00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:02.210
This also makes the
map easier to interact

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.282
with thumbs and fingers.

00:05:04.282 --> 00:05:05.490
Here's another best practice.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.940
Don't position buttons
in the ow zone.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.760
This will inconvenience
the user when

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.070
they have to interact with a
mapview with a single hand.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.050
And also avoid cluttering the
screen with too many control

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.517
buttons and widgets, as you
can see in this example,

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:20.100
because it reduces
the amount of space

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.100
you have to display the map.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.220
So to reduce clutter, put
your app's navigation controls

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.080
in the drawer.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.450
Put frequently used
actions, for example,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.420
to switch between list and
mapviews, and to do a search,

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.580
these should all go
into the action bar.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.110
Put the map controls,
for example,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.080
for filtering and overlay
control, on the map

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.590
surface itself.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.340
And finally, try and avoid the
ow zone for button placement.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.610
Use the thumb zone instead.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.050
Here's another best practice.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.930
Do not make touch
targets too small.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.980
It's hard enough for
users to search and filter

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.220
to get to the results on
a map in the first place.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.190
So don't make it
even harder for them

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.632
to select an actual
result on the map.

00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:58.340
Think about clumsy
thumbs trying to press

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.939
a pin in a crowded map.

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:02.730
Another benefit of
taking this into account

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.290
is that it restricts
how many results

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.390
you can actually
display on the map.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.020
So make sure that
the markers on a map

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.840
are large enough so that
they're easy to touch.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.760
Try going higher than the
minimum 48 dip touch target,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.480
and try and provide
enough padding

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.040
around each touch
target as well.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.110
Also, make sure to have
multiple sizes of markers.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.910
The larger the
marker size, the more

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.180
important that result should be.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.210
That's all the time we
have for this episode.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.210
In the next episode, part two,
I will share some best practices

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.790
around how to display
results on a map

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.280
and how to make this
information glanceable and easy

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.300
to consume for users on-the-go.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.810
And if you haven't already,
please be sure to join our UX

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.685
community on Google+.

00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:43.270
It's a place where we can
continue this discussion,

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.720
and you can meet
other people who

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.110
are just as passionate
about UX as you are.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.958
Thanks for watching,
and goodbye.
