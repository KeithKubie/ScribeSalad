00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.180
I'm Kelly.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.820
I'm originally from New Jersey, and

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.188
I moved out to San Francisco
about a year and a half ago.

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:06.276
I think it took me so

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:10.030
long to get into computer science
because no one told me about it.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.750
And I wish that I had been introduced
to it earlier, but then again,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.370
it's not too late.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.030
So that's why I'm excited about these
programs, such Udacity's program.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.061
And I think that if I had been
introduced to computer science during my

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.793
undergraduate degree,
I definitely would have pursued it.

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:25.972
One of the things I'm really excited
about for this nanodegree program,

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:29.252
is I feel like it gave me a really good
foundational base in web development,

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:32.060
and I'm excited to put that
to use in the work place.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.790
So what I love about programming is just
the whole problem solving process, and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.720
I actually love how at times it
can be extremely frustrating, and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.360
you can sit in front of your computer
for hours confused and just frustrated.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.160
But then that moment when it actually
works is just the best feeling.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.389
