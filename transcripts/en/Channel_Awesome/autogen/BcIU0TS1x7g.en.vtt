again they're there's definitely that
there's<00:01:31.979><c> definitely</c><00:01:32.159><c> a</c><00:01:32.400><c> little</c><00:01:32.549><c> bit</c><00:01:32.670><c> of</c>

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a little bit of
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.469 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a little bit of
rebelling<00:01:33.390><c> that's</c><00:01:33.570><c> going</c><00:01:33.900><c> on</c><00:01:34.079><c> and</c><00:01:34.549><c> a</c><00:01:35.549><c> big</c>

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
rebelling that's going on and a big
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.530 align:start position:0%
rebelling that's going on and a big

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
thing is that this ball lands uh in
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.980 align:start position:0%
thing is that this ball lands uh in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
these uh these like four or five arms
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
these uh these like four or five arms
it's<00:01:45.689><c> a</c><00:01:45.750><c> great</c><00:01:45.960><c> design</c><00:01:46.320><c> and</c><00:01:47.000><c> there's</c><00:01:48.000><c> a</c><00:01:48.090><c> bunch</c>

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 align:start position:0%

it's a great design and there's a bunch

going with them it turns out there's a

we<00:02:43.470><c> can't</c><00:02:43.680><c> do</c><00:02:43.800><c> this</c><00:02:43.950><c> again</c><00:02:44.100><c> and</c><00:02:44.550><c> it</c><00:02:45.150><c> just</c><00:02:45.360><c> stops</c>

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
we can't do this again and it just stops
 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
we can't do this again and it just stops
there<00:02:45.840><c> um</c><00:02:46.550><c> so</c><00:02:47.550><c> again</c><00:02:47.760><c> interesting</c><00:02:48.630><c> hmm</c><00:02:48.900><c> like</c>
