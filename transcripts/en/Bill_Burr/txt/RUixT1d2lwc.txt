Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Ahhh

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       Just checking. Just checking in on you. You fucking whoa. What's going on? How are you? Um, oh, it's the sound. Sound fucked up here. In order as you guys probably want a white pill, why don't you, when you get the fucking sound right, why don't you just set it, set it and forget it. Remember that Shit you turn on an oven. Just forget about it. Just fucking walk away from it. I bought one of those things. That thing was this shit. I don't know. I can't remember whatever happened to it. Stick a whole fucking chicken in there, you know? And I would shut it, but I would not forget it. I would always remember that I had a chicken cooking cause I was living in New York and uh, you know, I was paying nine grand a month for like fucking 30 square feet. So, you know, I had my pillow propped up on the other side of it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       And you know, it's impossible not to hear that bell go off considering my head was against it. You know, half of my head would be sweaty and red and I'd sit down and eat a whole chicken greasy shit. I don't understand why fucking chickens is so God damn greasy. You know, when you look at them, they don't look greasy and that grease is shit. And then, you know, what's the worst is you fucking show up and the amount of people that don't know how to cook chicken and it's just fucking dry ass chicken. Do you know, way back in the day, back in the day when I was young and I had more hair, um, I used to do a what was called the uptown shows, you know, do the uptown show at town. You know, in my business is means, uh, the black shows, these shows where the crowd is African American and uh, every once in is like one white guy on the show at one token white guy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       So I used to be the token white guy on those things. And I remember all the fucking time I used to do these things and I hope he hears this. I used to work for a talent. He used to do all those fucking rooms and they used to always give me shit, say white people don't know how to have a cookout or barbecue, whatever the fucking thing is. And I'll never forget, he invited me, I can't remember, was him a Gerald Kelly. They invited me up way the fuck up in the Bronx. I Dunno where the hell I was. It was just fucking like basketball slash do stand up during the day in this basketball park. So I got fuck it. I'll go up there and do it. So I went up there, you know, and then fucking cooking out and all that shit. And I gotta tell you, I will never forget how fucking disappointed I was when I ate the chicken. It was so fucking dry. Tell you everybody talks shit. Uh, fuck it. Do this. I'll fucking go fucking do it.

Speaker 3:          00:02:50       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       I got it. Oh, you know what? I should have Nia here for this cause that's another one too. They always telling me how good soul food is. I've been to one good soul food place. It's the same thing with like barbecue too. Everybody Raven above fucking barbecue. 90% of those things are absolute shit holes. You walk in there, you see like 50 health code violations is fucking flies and stuff and then they just, they try to disguise all their fuck ups with like fucking, you know, 10 pounds of barbecue sauce. I mean, you put barbecue sauce on a tree branch. It's gonna fucking taste good to some level. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:03:25       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       I found that all, you know, trying to, you know, you want the reality is is I don't know shit about barbecue. So it's just like, you know, if you don't know shit about standup, you're going to watch a bunch of hacks before you get to a good one. So maybe that's what it is. I have no idea. I have no idea. The one place soul food place that I want that actually, I went to Amy roofs a long time ago and I liked that. I thought that that was quality. All right. So I know it has to be out there. I mean, God knows if you want to get a good fucking corn beef sandwich, I know the go down to Tom Burgins here in fucking La, right? I know where to go for that shit. So somebody helped me out in la. Where's was it?

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       Was it good spot for all of that type of stuff? Cause I've, I can't say it because it'd be sacrilegious, but I've gotten the most famous fucking, um, I guess so food place out here. There's two locations. And I went to both of them and the food. Absolutely. Without a doubt. No questions. Landslide fucking sucked. And I was like, why is there a God? Why is there a fucking line around the block for this shit? It's terrible. There has to be, this has to be the spot that only guys like me know about. Right? And then everybody else is going to the real place.

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       that was a fucking left turn. I think the only good barbecue I think I ever really enjoyed was when I was in Alabama and there was a place called a size smart ass Wilson. It's still stood for and that shit was fucking delicious. You go in and the place was clean, you know, they always have to have it be a little bit funky. It kind of looks like, do you guys build hot rods here or are you, are you making a fucking, you know, brisket, you know, fucking pisses me off those wherever you watch the food network and you watched those professionals doing it, I'm always screaming at the TV, where do you, where the fuck is your restaurant? I don't want to sit here and watch you cook and all this shit that I can't fucking eat. I mean it's works of art, you know? Yeah. People will make barbecue or some fat motherfuckers though. You gotta admit that, right? Just big fuck. They look like they drive trucks.

Speaker 3:          00:05:34       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       anyways, this is just making me hungry. Speaking of which, I've been eating like shit, you know, I know it's going to fucking tell you something. I mean, what the Hell is talking about? Start talking about fucking dry chicken. Okay. So fuck right. Does it really matter? I'm just checking in on you. This is really isn't even a podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:05:54       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       anyways, what did I want to talk about? Oh yeah, so give you the update on my, uh, yeah. Fuck that. I'll do that later. I, um, I fucking drank so much the other night, right? I had some friends of mine, they were at this bar and they texted me going, hey man, we're out here drinking. Right? And I didn't want to drink, which is really surprised. I mean, I always want to drink, but I knew I shouldn't, something in my head and my big stupid Charlie Brown head said, don't go to the bar. Right? So I just, you know, they like, yeah, we've been day drinking, we're already here, Yada, Yada, Yada. And I'm just like, okay, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever. Right. I'm not going to, you know, you know, I got a set tonight. They're like, yeah, we're right up the street. Hit us up after. And I was just like, okay. And I was just hoping they were going to be totally hammered and forget. And I went down to the comedy store. I've been doing sets all week cause I got those huge shows this weekend. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       I went up ahead a fucking great set, got all this new shit, really excited about it, you know, because I did just do a Gig in downtown La and one of my gigs is out in Riverside. The other one's in Orange County. My agents telling me this is a completely different market. There's a completely different flat [inaudible] and I'm just worried that somebody from the show, New Year's is going to show up. So I gotta make sure I got a new 15, 20 so they don't be like [inaudible] same shit. Right? Like I'm supposed to write a brand new whack in 90 fucking days. It's not even 90 days, you know. So anyways, um,

Speaker 3:          00:07:28       wow.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       I'm working on that shit. And the second I get off stage, I have a text, hey man, you off you off off stage yet for right down the street. So like a fucking ass hole. Don't listen to my gut. I go down there, right. And I show up and it's everybody that I like to drink with and I'm like, fuck. And I'm driving, right? So I go, I'm going to have one whiskey, I'm going to nurse it and that's going to be it. Okay. And I sipped it and it tasted fucking delicious. And I literally looked at the, another comic goes, yeah, I go, why does it taste so good? And he just laughed. He goes, it tastes better every year. And that's kind of the last coherent, like part of the night that I remember I sucked at one down and then the waitress came by and she goes, hey, gay gay, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       How's, yeah, your house? And I was, she didn't say, you know, she was actually, you know, completely, uh, probably probably did better in school than I did. And I'm making fun of her because I'm set with the answer that I gave her. I said yes, as my brains gone. Don't do this bill. Don't do this. The second you get the second one, now you have to fucking take a taxi home and you've got to leave your car here. Don't do that. Just fucking relax. You know, you're really just here for the social thing. Just have a water and talk to the fellas. Right. So that's what I'm thinking. And my brain just goes, yes, a mouth goes, I would like another drink. And then that it, and then I just looked at it, buddy, go, well, I'm not driving now. And they'd go, yeah, yeah, you're not driving.

Speaker 1:          00:09:00       You're not driving. And then that was it. And um, I don't know what the fuck happened. Then somebody told the fucking story about this drink called the John Riley and I kept thinking it was like the, the actor John C. Reilly. So I kept picturing his, his face as the guy was telling the story and I'm going like, John c Riley's got his, I already has a drink named bathroom. That's, that's like the, like the bar version of women, like the Mark Twain Award. Right. And I'm like, good for John. And it wasn't until he got like halfway through the story, I realized he was just talking about a guy, John Riley, Eddie date fucking did something. He fought one of those, one of those wars that they never make a movie about the Spanish American war. They never make a fucking movie about that. And the Spanish American war. Wasn't that the one we fought in the fucking Philippines. I always thought that that one was like with Sam Houston and Dave Bowie. David Bowie, now Daniel Boone, whatever the fuck his name is, right. They surrounded the Alamo. Let's see this here. Spanish American war. What do you put the home game away game. How do I look this up? Serve or not found the fuck you talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       What again? You motherfucker. Don't don't do this to me. All right. This is, this is how I fixed it. I shut it off. Shut off Wifi. Turn Wifi back on. That's like the fribulation. You're fucking, I say that word right? Come on. I feel like Pachino in and he car guys. Alright, here we go. Spanish American war. I think this was in the Spanish American war. Wikipedia. God knows they're always right. Spanish American war was a conflict between Spain and the United States. The result of the u s intervention in Cuba. We've always been doing that, huh? Well, we're trying to make them free also. All right. Location, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines in Guam. Why don't they ever make a movie about that one? I'm sure they did, but why don't they make a one that's fucking known enough that I've seen it? Hang on a second. I know I've ever even read about this was a conflict in 1898 between Spain and the United States.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       The results of US intervention in the Cuban war of independence. In other words, you know, we, we always have a dog. We always have a dog in the fight. You know what I mean? If we go to the fucking casino and there's that gouge his fucking bet, every game, that's the United States, we always, we always got some action going, you know, walk around with our fucking Hawaiian shirt and a big cigar. Flip flops were a mess. US attacks on Spain's Pacific coast. Oh, Pacific positions led to the involvement in the Philippine revolution and ultimately to ultimately, ultimately to the Philippine American war. All right, let's click on that Philippine American war. It fucking lasted for almost two over two years. 1899 three years. One month. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, that's three years. Jesus. Bill, lay off the fucking sauce, Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:12:24       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       alright. Filipino civilians dead. 200 to 250,000 dead mostly from disease. We lost four to 6,000. They lost 12 to 20,000.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       We crushed another one, Huh? Jesus Christ. We were on a tear back. That was it. That's what, that's when we were really on a fucking tear. Conflicts arose when first Filipino republic objected to the terms of the treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines from Spain ending the Spanish American war. Yeah. They're like, dude, we want to be our own people, if you don't mind. And then we came over their land to the home for a land of the brave free of the home, whatever the fuck our, our little tagline is. I, and they probably scared up some guy named fucking Ulysses, you know, scared the shit out of. They're going to come over here to go to kitchen. They're going to get you fucking four wheeler. Um, anyways, once again, I don't even know how the fuck I got to that goddamn thing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       Oh yeah. So the drink, it's called the John Riley. All it is, it's, it's a fucking Margarita. And you take a shot at Jamison and you'd dump it in there. And it had something to do with the fact that there was a bunch of Irish people fighting on this side and they decided, you know what, you guys are fucking using us. We're going to go fight on the side where the Latinos are. So that's the Jamieson going over to the other fucking side. Right? So now I got whiskey, the bird, the real tailor. The tape here is now I got what the fuck's in a, in a, in a Margarita. Okay. I never drink. Is that, is that vodka or is it Tequila? I think it's Tequila.

Speaker 4:          00:14:03       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       And uh, I fucking dumped that in there. So now, now I'm on my third fucking whiskey. I had already ordered another Johnny Black because it was a really long fucking story. And now I'm three of those in, I had a Jamison and then I had a fucking, uh, a Margarita and a, I believe I had one more after that grant, I did all of this, I swear to God it felt like 90 minutes, but I think it was about two and a half hours. And um, then I did the Irish goodbye, which is, I just hit me. He's like, I got to get the fuck outta here. And I didn't say goodbye to anybody and I just walked.

Speaker 4:          00:14:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:41       They called my old friends La taxi. That's who I always call. I do not Uber, I don't do Uber because I just, you know, you do Uber. It's be some young kid, he's in the fucking business and he's going to hand you a fucking script or some shit, you know? And eventually just say something really creepy like, Oh, you live here. You know? But yeah, you get in the cab, it just like yellow. Yes. Hello my friend. They don't give a fuck. They don't, they have no fucking, you know, they don't give a shit. They're not trying to fucking do anything. Right. So I call La taxi like, okay, you know how many taxi you have Ababa? And I'm just like, yeah, I just like, yeah, I'm [inaudible]. And then that was just dead silence it in my fucking head. It made, they made me seem, made me think that they knew where the fuck I was at.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       I wasn't at the Ramada, I'm not going to say what the fuck I was at. Right. So, um, then I was just standing there swaying in the breeze and then one of my buddies came down and his Uber pulled up and he just saw me and he saw the state I was in any, just let me get in it. So I got in the fucking thing. And like most streets in La, they're the longest fucking streets ever. You know what I mean? Like last Sianna goes, starts at the Hollywood hills and we'll just go all the way down to like the palace Verdi's peninsula. Maybe that one doesn't, but some of them don't. They, they're like, they're like fucking 20 mile long streets, so you have the north side and the south side. This guy started going in the wrong fucking direction. Fortunately, I wasn't so drunk, he would've dropped me off to the opposite end of the fucking, uh, you know, fucking city or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       And um, so I go to bed, I don't even remember going to bed. And then I wake up the next day I woke up at like eight in the morning, my dog fucking lick in my face and I swear to God at eight in the morning, I was still legally drunk, legally drunk. And I was just like, oh my God. So I got up, I walked the dog around the block. I sat down and I just fucking, it took me till about 10 30 to get my shit together and then I just walked all the way back to the bar, to the hotel area to get my fucking car.

Speaker 4:          00:16:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       just a complete waste of a fucking day. By the time I got home, it was like one in the afternoon. And I'm just muttering to myself the entire time going, look at this bill, would you look at this? Look how many fucking times you got to learn this lesson. And I would love to tell you that this is the last time I'm going to do something like that. It's the last time for a while. Oh, is a bad one. That was a bad bump. But you know what was good was a, I sold off some of the shit from my garage and I got to tell you, felt good. Made me want to get rid of a bunch of more of my shit. Um, I just got a ton of shit. I don't know what I fuck. And you know what it is and I'm telling you, when I say shit, it's fucking shit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:32       Bunch of baseball hats and fucking all these books and shit and just, just stuff. Got All this fucking shit and I'm sick of it. It's all over the fucking place. I don't use most of it, so I'm, I'm, you know what, I'm just gonna I'm going to get rid of a bunch of shit. I, I'm where I'm going to start to do is every couple of days I'm going to give something away or sell something on Ebay and I literally want to get down to basically bare bones. What the fuck do I use? You know, I was thinking about that one on my long fucking walk of shame. Back to my fucking car. I saw this giant, we know all those may flower moving trucks just as jai, the biggest one you could possibly get. Or they even have like in between the front and the back wheels, they drop the back end the trailer down so they can even have shit down in there. And I was just thinking like, I never want to need one of those

Speaker 4:          00:18:26       ever. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       You gotta be that guy that can fuck the next size up from the u haul van. That's what the fuck you need, right? I want to be late. So,

Speaker 4:          00:18:39       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       oh, she's like a ton of shit to tell you guys. So I also, I also want, I looked at cars before my fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:18:47       my big, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       fucking booze fest and, uh, I thought I finally found my car and uh, I swear to God, I love the picture of it. I went and I looked at the 2016,

Speaker 4:          00:19:03       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       Cadillac Cts v await now though, the, the top of the line one, whatever the wanted, the one, it basically, it goes fucking, it goes 200 miles an hour and it's a four door sedan. Right. And all, all I'm thinking is that I'm, I'm just like, all right, this is the fucking, this is the one, it's exactly what the fuck I want. I can't explain it. I love the way it looks like in the picture. And then I went to go see it and it just looked like something that you'd buy if you were in, like if you were in your twenties, if you could somehow afford it just with all the fins in the tail. And of course I'm just like, I can't get in my driveway because the front end is too fucking low. There's a little hump to get in my driveway and then they go in like, well, you could back it in.

Speaker 1:          00:19:48       And um, I don't know man. I just couldn't get past. And then they were like, yeah, Justin Bieber bought one of these. And I'm like, yeah, exactly. He should buy one of these. If you could walk around shirtless, putting one my eyebrow up and doing the kissing your two fingers in the piece thing, that's the fucking car for you. I can as an almost 50 year old fucking man walk in that thing. I got to tell you, I love the inside of it. And it went like nine zillion miles an hour. But I gotta admit I fucking, uh, I realized while I was test driving the car that I am an old man and I don't like going fast. I just like cruising. So I looked at the other Cadillacs like the $54,000 fucking old man one, it was 54 fucking thousand dollars and I cannot stress enough what an absolute piece of fucking shit it was.

Speaker 1:          00:20:38       I could have put my foot through the fucking door. I literally left just like depressed. I was just like, you know what? Fuck this. Fuck all these fucking things. I'm just going to keep driving my fucking piece of Shit Prius. Right. And it really is a piece of shit at this point. Now the engine is fucking great, but like I've had all the dents, take it out and everything, but it's sat in the sun for fucking eight years. It's been hit too many. It's punched drunk. My car is fucking punch drunk. So last night I'm at the comedy store. Oh by the way, the Lincoln New Lincoln Continental's coming out in August, 2017 and it looks pretty fucking bad ass. And it's just like, you know, I was talking to a comic last night and I was joking about how old I am that I, I like comfort over speed at this point.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       And he goes, oh yeah. He goes, you know, you're out here in la cause where the fuck are you going to? Where are you gonna go? The fuck are you going to go? You can't go anywhere. You want comfort, you're going to be stuck in traffic. Just drive around in a living room and it just totally made sense. It's like, yeah, that's what the fuck I want to do. Then of course, I drive down to the club that night, right? And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I don't know if every, these are a bunch of tourists and they all rent, rented the cars. There was a fucking guy in a white corvette like 2016 corvette, a guy in a fucking 2016 brand new fucking Ferrari, spider, whatever the fuck that thing is. And then somebody else with this, you know, one of those BMW, the m ones, m three m five or something, and they're all zigzag and out of stop and go traffic revving the engines and all that shit. The exact thing that my buddy was saying and I was going, look, look how I was thinking that I'd be thinking, look how dumb that is. And all I was thinking was, look how fucking great those cars look.

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       But of course everybody in them was 20 something, you know the Yolo guys, Yolo shoes, right? I mean, I just have to fucking old, right? So, um, anyways, so I went down to the store last night comedy store and I fucking know I did a set once again and I wasn't really even funny last night. I mean, I did a decent enough job. I've been doing it long enough where I can fake my way through my job, but I just kept having brain farts and all that cause I was still fucking hung over. Right. So, and when I'm hung over and I'm kind of in a grouchy mood, my shit goes from fucking silly to like, dude, is this like a meeting? This guy sounds like an insane person. And, um, I got out of the club and I was walking in my car and uh, this guy comes up, he goes, excuse me, Mr Burr, Mr. Brewer. And another reason why I shouldn't buy a fucking cool sports car when somebody's pushing 30 calls. You, Mr.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       It's time to get yourself a Buick Riviera, right though. You know what I mean? Yeah. You can't fight it. You can't fucking fight it. I am in my sport coat luxury car, you know, fucking years. I'm going to go fucking, I'm going to go online and buy an old cutlets or something like that. Um, old cutlets is actually a cool cone. Am I talking about whatever, the fucking a, a delta 88 or some shit. Um, so he comes up and he's with his girlfriend and uh, he goes, yeah, I just want to say, you know, I really enjoyed the show. A big fan [inaudible] I got, yeah, thanks. Or whatever. And there's his just standing there. She goes, yeah. She goes, I'm not a big, she goes, yeah, I don't like you. Right. Cause I was trashing the lays. Right. She goes, I don't like you. And I go, yeah, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       I just went, all right. And then she goes, no, I like you. And she goes, I like you, but, and I'm like, here we go. Here we go. It's just like we just get on with fucking trash and me, you know, that fucking female manipulation thing. She said, I don't like you, cause she was expecting that I gave a fuck. They'll be like, Ooh, you like me? And then she could tell me what part of my act she didn't like and guess what part it was only this shit about me, trash women, all the other stuff was perfectly fucking fine. I'm talking about drunk driving and going to McDonald's. Right. She didn't have a fucking problem with that. All the hypothetically like innocent people during that joke that I could have fucking got in trouble, you know, could have run over. Right. She didn't give a fuck about that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       So she literally, she goes, I don't like you. And I said, I'll coach. She goes, no, I like you. And then like a fucking rookie. I stopped. She goes, but you shouldn't be trashing him. And it's just like, ah. I said, I don't give a shit. I don't give a fuck either. Dead after the show, heckling is my number one pet peeve. I stood on stage for 20 fucking minutes, right in your crosshairs, you know, yell out something. Then you don't say shit. You just fucking sit there. And then after the show you come up to me in the parking lot and you ignore the 30 topics. I went, I talked about those, those were all fine. And he'd just talk about the one that pertains to you. So I just said, you know, I don't give a shit, right. So I get in my fucking car and she, but at this point she was yelling at me,

Speaker 3:          00:25:28       um,

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       and this is hilarious. She goes, oh my God, did I forget? She was like, man, I don't have that. I wasn't listening. And she goes, and you drive a fucking Prius steady yelling at me about my car. Oh, it's fucking hilarious. Fucking hilarious. She, when she yelled fucking Prius, she had turned around and cause she realized that wasn't going to listen to her bitch moaning and complaining about my jokes. She had already turned away and she goes, oh fuck. And she threw her head back. She goes out, fucking praise. And, uh, what she, what she did there, she made me laugh harder than I probably made the whole crowd laugh my entire set in that moment. So thank you to that woman. And uh, you know, other than that, you know, I don't know what to tell you next time. Heckled me onstage and, and I'll listen to what you have to say. There was a fucking woman had called me in the crowd, although I'll tell you how to rough one, you know. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:26:24       yeah, I don't know what the fuck to tell you. Um, all right. Before I, before I end voice, start doing some of these reads here. Uh, what the fuck is it? Yeah. Five dogs from tribe called quest passed away. Man. I was one of the, a casual of that, you know, I'm just too fucking white. I missed it. I totally missed the boat. You know, I saw Michael Rappaport's documentary on him and I'll just maybe feels like, how the fuck did I miss this shit? Oh, that's right. Cause I was listening to warrant. I got it man, that fuck it. But I, even though I didn't listen to the band as much as I should have, it really forced fucking depressing. Um, just cause I obviously had friends die at that fucking age from that shit. Complications of diabetes and all that. So, uh, I dunno, that's just getting old.

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       Sucks. Just fucking blows. 45 years old. How the fuck do you come to terms with that? You know, why did I bring it up? I knew it was going to be depressing. All right, let's read some advertising. All right. Score big. Uh, you're paying too much for tickets between all the markups in last minute convenience charges. Oh, by the way, you know I asked this before, how the fuck is there a way that I can sell tickets to my show just off my website and only fans will get them. Like what stops these people who go in and somehow cause they got the money, we'll go out and buy like 500 fucking tickets and then jack the price up and then everybody gives me shit on the Internet. Go Look, do you phone you not this funny. And then they show how much the tickets are for and the amount of times I call my age and going to what the fuck are we doing here?

Speaker 1:          00:28:06       And he's like, that's not us. That's those constant buy a thousand tickets and then rape everybody. If anybody knows a way. You know what's hilarious? I think this advertising might be the way. I have no idea between all the markups that you know with these guys at doing. These guys are going to undercut stub hub. This is actually probably a good thing here. All right. I'm not saying these guys aren't dirt bags too, but you know you can't just have one dirt bag. You know if you get to dirt bags, they start fucking going at each other and then you slide under the radar. Right? Anyway, she paid too much for tickets between all the markups and last minute convenience charges. Even print at home fees. Question Mark. Exclamation point. You can end up paying court side prices for nosebleed seats score big.com is here to change that. Well, well, well let's see. Let's see you guys. You guys check this thing out. Let me know if this is legit. Did you know that 40% of all live event tickets go on sold and did you know that there's a place to get these seats at huge savings? It's called score big.com. In other words, you bought up 40% of the tickets. What do you mean they go on sold? No, they don't.

Speaker 4:          00:29:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       Well they don't, this is all bullshit. 40% go on. Sold. Yeah. And then you know what they do? They probably would fucking cancel the show. The acts not making the venue any money. All right. You know what? I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll suspend disbelief here. You know, considering Batman versus Superman is going to be coming out this week and you gotta suspend all that disbelief that a guy from another fucking planet that can fly and bullets bon off his bounce off his chest. He's gonna have a fucking fight against a regular human being who has a fucking utility belt,

Speaker 3:          00:29:45       right?

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       Bullets bounce off his chest. What is Batman going to? What does he have in his little fucking tool belt there that can fuck with that guy? If they really made this movie as real as possible, Batman versus Superman, it, it's going to go down like one of those old school Mike Tyson paper views. Remember that the fight would be over before the pizza showed up.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       But you know, somehow they'll, they'll fucking, I dunno what they'll do. They'll keep it going. I love how they are out of victims. They're out at like villains and now they have to fight each other. You know what I mean? Like what does that say about superheroes? You know what I mean? I think that just they just into fighting. They don't give a fuck whether somebody's good or bad. They just, they just need, they need to fight somebody and then when they stop all the crime and you think they're going to relax and get themselves the new 2017 Lincoln continental, you know, maybe chill on the whole flying and all that stuff. Get themselves some adult clothes, right? What do they do? They start fighting each other. Fucking animals. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       Yeah. You know, it's shit happens.

Speaker 3:          00:34:23       Um, the fuck do I just have a socket here for

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       anyways? Um, yeah, so I'm going to start selling some shit on Ebay and uh, I was actually thinking that this is not much, I want to start selling shit. I was thinking of fucking taking my truck out to my shows this weekend and just bringing a bunch of shit in the back and it just shit, you know, shit to me, somebody else might like it, the end of the show, just fucking given it to people, you know, just getting it Outta here and then somebody else takes it and they like it because if I throw it out, it ends up in the fucking ocean. But if I fucking just give it to somebody, they can keep it in, in their, in their bedroom or in their fucking living room, away from the poor purses.

Speaker 3:          00:35:05       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       I know it's just an idea. Just an idea. I've decided I'm going to start with the fucking closet in my, in my bedroom. I'm just going to go in there. I want to, I'm going to have two fucking piles. Shit. I need shit I don't need and I'm going to write on a post it, stop being a sentimental bitch. Get rid of this shit. Whatever I need to do to just fucking plow through and get rid of all of this stuff because I'm

Speaker 3:          00:35:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:30       I'm not, I don't, I don't, I just don't want all this shit anymore. All right. That's it. That's the podcast this week. You guys have a wonderful weekend, Yukon and I'll, uh, I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 5:          00:35:47       [inaudible] everybody [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       and that is, it built a bit of a dilemma here for you. Uh, I'm an 18 year old male who's about to graduate from high school. Congratulations. Um, over the past few years, I've been told I'm a really good dancer. Uh, not ballet or artsy stuff, but just good dance floor dancing. Oh my God, I'm going to take over the dance floor. Hey Angie, watch me. You're John Travolta. This is great. Do you go out to the Staten Island Bridge and do headstands with your, with your buddy Bobby? You know, if he didn't have an Afro, he never would've fell off that bridge if he had it high and tight. Like all these Armenians out here, all, every Armenian looks like they know, uh, they, they know, um, um, MMA moose. Last time you saw in our Armenian dude in his twenties or thirties, and he did not look like he could put you in an arm bar within two seconds if you wanted to.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       If I was, if I was a Dana white and I was running the UFC at one point, that this point, whether they're up to like what, like UFC 2006, they're like running, they'd run out of adjectives this time. It's really, really personal, right? Not Saying I'm not a fan of a huge fucking fan. I'm just saying, you know, the way they had those things like every other week and there's only so many like you know, redemption. I mean you're running out of words. Um, I'm such a fucking idiot. This is what I would do if I was dating a white at some point I would have, you know, you know what I would, this is what I would branch off. And when they had those tough man competitions and they would have just people coming in, throwing haymakers which is some of the best boxing ever is when you watch people who just aren't trained whatsoever and they just start, you know, cause somebody's going to connect, right.

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       I think that they should have one week they should have the Armenians verse the Russians tough man competition because I really think that that meets, it needs to be decided who is the tougher of the two. Uh, cause when I, when it comes to white people, that's, that's who I got my money on. All right. That those, those are the crips and the bloods of white people is the army and the Russians, all of them, they just have that vibe that somebody just like, yeah, I'm a fucking with that guy. Just really, I'm really not doing it anyways. Uh, not a ballet or artsy stuff. Uh, but just ballroom dates in a fucking, you know, uh, I kind of think of think dancing is gay from an outside point of view. Um, I, it isn't, it really isn't, that's just how white people look at it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:14       It's considered gay cause it involves like letting yourself go and actually admitting that you have emotions as a man, as a white male. Yeah. It's, yeah, it is. It's considered gay. Um, as his crying as his showing any sort of emotion as is not dying for no good goddamn reason before you're 56, um, or not dying, I should say. If you live to be 60, I believe amongst white men, that's also considered gay. Cause that means at some point you cried something out of your chest and you didn't have a heart attack. Um, anyways, he says, I think dancing is gay from an outside point of view, but I'll be the first one to admit that I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I didn't think so. I wouldn't be out there doing it. Yeah, but dude, you gotta be getting some, I'll, I'll fucking women love a guy who can dance, but if you can dance and you're wearing like a silk scarf, it's fucking over. It's going to be rain and pussy. As far as my outside view, my freckled view from over in the bar trying to stand out from underneath those hot lights so I don't get burned. Uh, you know, red heads with the closest thing to vampires, you know, we have, we have none of the powers of vampires, but the sun affects us the same.

Speaker 4:          00:40:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:31       A friend of mine who was a female dancer keeps telling me I could make money doing it on commercials or music videos, parentheses clothes on. Or You could go to fucking Broadway and be like one of the five straight men who dances on Broadway and just tag every fucking lonely chick out there who's all stretched out. Just make sure you keep their shoes on. Dancer's feet are always fucked up. Uh, here's where it gets complicated. I plan on becoming a policeman. Oh Dude, this is, this is a no brainer. You need to dance it. Bachelorette parties dressed as a cop. All you need, dude, is that a fake uniform on a boombox and you're on your way to making money? Dude, you should fucking do that in a second. And then you write a book about it. I was a gyrate and cop for Bachelorette parties.

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       You write a tell all book about how many fucking broads you bought. Ready? Got Married, go get married, suck your Dick. You really need help on this one. I mean, I'm going to read the rest of it, but I think I've already come with the solution anyways. How is anyone to take me seriously on the force? If there's a video going with me, pop and locking next to little Wayne. At the same time, I'll, dude, you should fucking pull people over. You should pull people over and fucking moonwalk up to their car and just freak them out. Even if they were reaching for a gun, they'd be laughing too hard and they, they, they wouldn't shoot you then you could rest them and then you move up. Next thing you know, you're a commissioner, right? Nothing. Anyways, at the same time, I'm getting laid a lot because of it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       Of course you are. I'm a seven on a scale of 10. I like this guy's honest and um, uh, and like having a jumpshot. It's put me up to an eight, five. I'm bang intense. I've always wanted to be a cop at the parks here. Seen better if I was able to make money doing it other in the dancing thing, I wouldn't just be getting hammers for letting gross moms off on speeding tickets. I could be banging J-lo. She's into dancers, right? Thanks. Yeah. Dude. APP's a fucking lutely dude. You're basically saying, what should I do here? Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the club and make all this fucking money or should I take a job where I'm going to get shot at and not be appreciated.

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:50       You know, I'll tell you every cop out there with dance if they could, as opposed to being a cop, I don't care if they're like seven generations in, dude, this is what I think of as far as like dancing. I think if I, if I,

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:05       Like compare it to being a comedian. Oh, the open mikes would be getting a piece of cardboard and being on a subway platform, making money that way. And then when you move up to hosting a show, that would be your dresses, a cop and you fucking dance at Bachelorette parties. That's what you do on the side. That's like your fucking day job. That bullshit. And then during the day, I, yeah, I would try out for those. Fuck, I don't, do they make music videos anymore or fucking, uh, I dunno. I believe it or not, I don't know how to climb the ladder as a dancer, but dude, APP's a fucking lutely. If you can make money doing that shit.

Speaker 6:          00:43:46       And then what the great thing is, is once you get to a certain level to, to, uh, make more money, you know, once you got some credibility, you can, you always have the fallback where you can teach a class. They, you can be like, I danced for nine years and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and fucking banged every fucking broad on there. And then if you'd like to know how to fuck the women in your cast while still not losing your job, come on down the Frankie's in Dade Studio, whatever. Just you'll figure it out as you go in there. And, um, yeah, absolutely. Absolute fucking Lulea. I would definitely do it. You want to do what you want and taking the time,

Speaker 3:          00:44:25       um,

Speaker 6:          00:44:26       to write in. So your big fears, should we be whatever, everybody's big fears. Like what if I go after this dream and I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a fucking futon and it hasn't happened yet. Well, I gotta tell you something, sir. I'd been there. I was there at fucking 34. I was still sleeping on a futon and a fucking studio apartment that they call the one bedroom because they slammed a fucking wall in there

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       and put a door on it. And then one day I was trying to bang the girl upstairs who had the fucking apartment right above me, and it was the exact same unit. And hers was a studio, but she had been there longer so they never slammed a wall in there. And I realized, Hey, wait a minute, I'm getting fucked. You know, I should go down there and try and get some money taken off of this. I should go down to the a. They're fucking me over rental board. But I didn't. I said, fuck it. Just keep writing jokes, right. So whatever all you've got to do, you've just got to commit to this shit and uh, and then realize that, you know, sleep on Futon when you're 30 is not the worst thing. It isn't. You don't see what you don't. It's worse to sleeping on Futon at 30, sleeping in a king bed next to a fucking woman you're not really love with. But for some reason married and a, you got a couple of kids and you got a job that you fucking hate. Okay. You'll be laying there fantasizing about fucking sleeping on a, on a, on a, uh, on a futon there, there is no risk. When you go after a dream, it's all fucking reward. It's all going to lead to something good. It always does. There's a tremendous amount of risk to playing it safe and uh, that leads to unbelievable levels of regret, which is something else I've also experienced. Cause I'm an old [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:46:01       mother, motherfucker.

Speaker 5:          00:46:03       Well in the city, believe you. Every day is pretty much [inaudible] I be happy.

Speaker 6:          00:46:27       Surprise. We're getting a divorce. All right, here's a new story. All right. Hey Bill, I know you have, you aren't a therapist, but I think I just want to talk to anyone at this point. So here goes, I've been married for just under four years to my wife who I dated for four years prior to marriage. I love being married and have said that to anyone. Uh, that asked since day one, we own a nice house together. We have three dogs, pit bulls, two good man and both make a decent living. I share everything in my life with my wife. Uh, when something makes me happy, she knows when I'm upset about something. I tell her, uh, throughout the course of our relationship about once a year she would suddenly without warning say she, she was unhappy and has been for months.

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       Okay. Here we go. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:47:13       She says she has discussions with their mom who loves me and is the sweetest woman alive and close friends about the things that make her unhappy by, I never hear a word about it until it boils over and she floors me with how unhappy she is. Well, that's not fair. All right. We tried to work it out though. Make changes. She would act like it was okay while it bottling it up again once, once the lid goes on the bottle, there's no opening it again. Each and every time she calls the unhappiness state of the Union meeting into session. I've always been completely honest as saying that I'm very happy with her. I love our jokes and honesty and joy. Honestly enjoy spending time at Bahbahbah Jesus Christ to get to the fucking point. All right, last Wednesday, here we go. We had a good night together. We went out for dinner and ice cream and laughed at about Alibaba by bar. So I thought I'd come home the following night in general, great mood. And she told me she had talked to her mom and a friend and that they recommend that she talks to me. I was confused, Eh Damn. Oh Shit. About not being unhappy.

Speaker 6:          00:48:21       Uh, anyways, I wanted anything to make her happy, but she told me she didn't think there was anything. It was very emotional as she finally mustered up the courage to say that we might need to get separated. I was floored and not in an almond asshole husband that sits around drinks, beer and watches football with his buddy way. I love my wife. We have free. Okay Dude. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, so the following day after much reluctance, I get her to agree to try marriage counseling so we can work out our happiness do, and I'm not giving you shit that this is, you're pouring your heart out because this shit just happened. I understand. But for the sake of the listeners, I got to put fly through this. Um, I get to agree with her. I get to, I get it. Okay. So the following day, it's like Lord of the rings here, after much reluctance, I get her to agree to try marriage counseling so we can work out her unhappiness.

Speaker 6:          00:49:11       I was willing to do anything at this point. I immediately scheduled an appointment with the counselor and was looking forward to having someone neutral for us to talk to. Later that night we were laying in bed and I asked her if there was someone else in her life. She said, no. Yeah Dude. Oh Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Uh, Jesus, here we go. We just went over the waterfall folks or where we, you know what it is now? No. In this story, we were hearing the waterfall and we just looked at the other person in the RAF with the panic. Look on our face for that split second before we tried to desperately. But futilely try and paddle the fucking thing over to the Goddamn coast. Okay, here we go. We're going over. I got a feeling we're going over. Um, she said, no, there's no one else in my life. I asked her if she's ever been unfaithful in our relationship relationship and she adamantly said no again. Then she turned out the light and laid down to sleep. Five minutes later she sat up and turn the light on a fuck. She told me she just lied to me and said that she had messed around with someone a year into our marriage. And he writes in capital letters, what period? The period fuck period. I probed her to tell me what messing around was as got at least be at blowjob.

Speaker 3:          00:50:29       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:50:31       Oh, ah, fucking whore. Um, and after a minute of me guessing her silence told me that she went in

Speaker 1:          00:50:40       down on a guy, she works with, swear to God. I had read this.

Speaker 3:          00:50:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       Oh, if I was very busy right now. Yeah. What I say, you heard me, you heard me

Speaker 6:          00:50:52       fast. Fucking creek. I was furious and hurt. Then furious again. She cried and cried and said she was sorry. We cried together. Dude, you're a bigger man than me. While I tried to wrap my head around how she could possibly have done that to me, I've had casual flirting with people over the years, but to act on something physically with someone other than your spouses, completely disgusting. To me, the worst part is I love this woman more than anyone. She's been my og. Here we go again. She's not my best friend for the last eight years. She knows everything about me. I want to hate her and make her sleep at her parents house until we divorced. But all I want to do is, yeah, be near her again. Yeah, Dude. Let's, because yeah, dude, she, she was in the hurry up offense. That's what happened here.

Speaker 6:          00:51:38       So now you're scamper and trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. And she, you know, she has an x three place that she just called in the huddle. That's why this, this is why it sucks to be you right now. Um, one of my close friends tells me what I know is the right thing. He goes, let it go. Don't bother with clown. Silene what else has she done that you don't know about how he never trusted her again? Bill, is it possible for me to forgive my wife? Am I wasting my time?

Speaker 6:          00:52:05       Um, also I find out who this guy is and I really wish I hadn't. Yeah, dude, of course. All I wanted to do was show up at the job, beat the shit out of him. Like Ed Norton, Pete's the blonde, pretty boy up in fight club. He writes, I wanted to destroy something beautiful. My other thought is since this guy also cheated on his girlfriend, who we still with, um, he did it with my wife. I threatened to tell his girlfriend what he'd done but not actually do it. Yeah. You don't want to do that that way. He live in fear of coming home and her knowing everything because I told her or he would try to beat me to it and admit to it, hopefully ending his relationship and getting terminal cancer and aids, terminal cancer and aids. And you know what? You're still being a gentleman.

Speaker 6:          00:52:52       I still think that you're, you're handling this with class wishing terminal cancer and AIDS on this guy. Um, I know you don't give a shit. Of course I give a shit, but not occupy a, but I've got to occupy my mind. So I, I thought I do it here. Yeah. Dude, why would you think I don't give a shit? You know, I mean, I'm not a friend of yours, but you know what I mean? Give me a fucking break. This is horrific. Um, all right. Your first question builds it possible for me to forgive my wife. A, eventually you're going to have to, uh, and or you're going to go on a fucking tear and you're going to meet some really damaged fucking women and they're gonna reinforce everything that you've now found out about your wife. See, can't do that. You're going to go on a fucking

Speaker 1:          00:53:37       a hate fuck pussy spree. That is, yeah. You don't want to do that. Um, you said, am I wasting my time? Yeah, dude, it's over. She's not happy. She's not good at communicating. Um, she puts a lid on it, you know, until it boils over. This is the deal, dude. You know what I, this is going to kill you. All right, let's go with the positive. You don't have any kids with her. Okay? You can just walk away. Okay. We had a prop and there was a, there's nothing we could do. It's over. He didn't make it. Did you just fucking walk away? Just walk away. It's over. All right. Um, that's a good thing. All right. One thing. You've had a bunch of kids with his fucking, this person who for whatever reason, couldn't say that they will. I don't think that she wanted even wanting to fucking marry you. I think she ignores her feelings. She's actually having a fucking breakthrough right now while stomping all over your fucking heart. All right, well I dunno. I don't know. I don't fuck her.

Speaker 6:          00:54:48       Give me a break, dude. You fucking, you loved her with all your heart. You say a mother's a sweetheart. You got dogs. You like communicating dude. You know something your like the fucking guy. You're the guy. My girl wants me to be. Every fucking woman wants a guy like that. You know guy who actually wants to be married guy who actually comes home and communicates, you know a guy who gets along with the mom and all that type of shit. You're a family man. All right. Unfortunately,

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       you know you met the wrong person, so forget that dude. All right. Forget it. Forget it. Fuck that. Fuck dead. It's over. Walk away.

Speaker 6:          00:55:28       Well, walk away dude. Give me a fuck about you. You know what you're talking about there. You're talking about like the, the amount of fucking shit she has to go through before she even learns how to just communicate her fucking emotions and the frustration of that's going to meet every once in a while she's going to blow somebody at work. Are you wasting your time? APP's a fucking Luli. Okay. Apps of Fucking Luli. And as far as like going there and trying to fuck over that other guy, that other guy is, he's already, you don't need to fuck him over. He's fucking himself over. He's living, he's living a life of misery. That life is miserable to fuck around with the person that you with, with somebody else. That is a miserable life.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       You know, I don't know.

Speaker 6:          00:56:16       They get something that a lot of guys do. Myself included back in the day in my twenties going into the thirties trying to fucking, uh, you know, figure myself out. I lived that life, that whole fucking double. It's horrible. It's a fucking horrible thing. Then in the end, I ended up alone and I heard a lot of people and I was a complete piece of shit. So, and believe me, dude, it was miserable and ended up with me on a fucking futon. Um, yeah, dude, you're, you're, you know, don't become a piece of shit. Now. Don't judge other women like that. Just fuck it. You know? Yeah. Get out of it. Get out of it and just know that it's gonna be a fucking a, I dunno, it's gonna be a hundred yards of pain that you never fucking dealt with in your life and you just gotta go through it.

Speaker 6:          00:57:07       And, um, I would say the next time you get with somebody, uh, make, you know you're going to get serious with somebody who would make God damn sure that they know how to fucking communicate, because that's a, that's a scary thing to get with a woman who does not communicate because that's something that they're supposed to teach us how to do. You know, in a way they make you better because you, oh, all I can just say, uh, no, I don't feel like doing that without fucking punched in the wall. You know, they do that set of sell you down if you get with some psycho. And she can't settle you down. I mean, she's a, she's damaged Chris

Speaker 5:          00:58:11       [inaudible]. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:58:12       all right. 27 year old Virgin Jesus Christ. Hey Billy, I'd love to hear your humorous take on my pathetic situation. First of all, dude, let's work on yourself estate. All right. You're already shitting all over yourself. I'm all right. Watch this guy. Watch him shit all over himself. I'm a 27 year old virgin. Oh geesh. Uh, that's what he wrote. Now your first question is going to be how the fuck did that happen? Well, to protect myself, I'd actually preserved prefer to keep my background as quiet as possible. Hey, I'm not trying to get you to rat yourself out. Here's what I can say. I come from a rich town inhabited by obnoxious cause I was always the weird kid and very socially awkward people hated me no matter how nice I was. Jesus Christ. Dude, are you like a superhero that's like the exact same background of like every fucking superhero movie, isn't it? Probably Cause Nerds, right? Those movies cause they don't have to fight and all of a sudden you're like, what am I knew how to play? What am I could fly? I was a guy who could save me. Um, and then they draw it and then nerds line up around the block to go see it. New Spiderman. Yes. It's exactly the other ones. Um, I was always the weird kid and very socially awkward people hated me no matter how nice I was. And eventually I came to hate myself and still do.

Speaker 6:          00:59:32       I called it dude, I fucking called it a, he's shitting all over himself. Eventually it was discovered that I most likely have a mild case of Asperger's syndrome, which is a mild form of autism, which is way out of my league. Are you guys trying to make me look dumb? I thought I did that. I achieved that by how awful. I read out loud.

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:59:54       here we go. That causes social ineptitude and Quirky personality traits. Well, I would go find a hooker with asbergers. That's the first thing I would do. You get the Fucking v off my back. Definitely wear a condom. See that's where my advice is going to be coming from. You guys have some weird conversation in some ironic vehicle. I'm at least discovering this made me more of self-aware and I've been able to clean up my act over the last few years, but I still have a lot of social anxiety and shyness and very few friends. On the flip side, I'm actually pretty decent looking, have a decent job in a laboratory. He's a fucking, he's going to get bit by something radioactive and he's going to become a superhero. Uh, and I'm a certified commercial pilot and do volunteer work dude. Like you know something. If, if I was in the FBI, like so many fucking red flags just went up there. Uh, okay. That's the set up now. Now for the question first, what the fuck would you do if you were in my situation? I told you I'd get a hooker with Asperger's syndrome and you guys could just bond over that. Uh, I don't know. Let, let me, let me read all your questions. I'm obviously kidding off trying to find a hook with Asperger system syndrome. All right. You couldn't find one that would be like a needle in a haystack, which you'd have to do is go to an escort service and request that personally.

Speaker 3:          01:01:17       Um, I would think

Speaker 6:          01:01:22       I'm looking for 36, 24 36 with Asperger.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:01:27       Hair color does not matter. Yes, I can hold 'em next if ever. If eventually everything I ever do make it anywhere with the chick. Should I tell her up front about my status? I had this conversation a few weeks ago with a friend who has a lot of romantic experience and she said it would be extremely obvious that I'm new to the game and that withholding that information could itself be detrimental. But I also know that if I do tell a chicken 27 year old virgin, she will demand an explanation before going any further and it will send up red flags for the most. What do you do? Built thanks to doing your awesome podcast and go fuck yourself. All right, this is what I would do. I would just start hitting on every check that fucking interests me and I would be just totally honest. Tell him, tell her what your, your, uh, your situation is. And uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       if she doesn't accept it, then fucker let her walk and then you don't have to deal with any of the bullshit. You didn't or you just, you just fast forward through a three year fucking horrific relationship. Um, I would just be upfront with people. I wouldn't open it with a at you have beautiful eyes and I have Asperger. I wouldn't do that, you know? Um, I would work on my self esteem. I wouldn't talk shit. You just, you shit on yourself right out of the gate. I mean, obviously I knew you're going to do that when you said you were 27 year old virgin and you probably going to go that route, but uh, think good thoughts about yourself, man. I know that's kind of like simple, but I, you know, you gotta like you got to amp yourself up a little bit, go out there and you know, you don't have to go find the check.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       He had drains but just go out. You don't get to tell some girl he got fucking Asperger syndrome. You don't, why don't you just do that with somebody that you're really interested in but it just want to go out and get laid. Just go out there, start hitting on checks, turn it into a game so you don't have to deal with the pain of the rejection. Just be like, alright, I don't have the balls to take the next step. Whatever that step is. Peeling yourself off the fucking wall. Striking up a conversation, just saying hello to a pretty girl. She walks down the street. Just try to get over that fucking hurdle and give you permit yourself permission to suck and you just, you gradually build it up. It's like learning how to play guitar. You're not going to pick it up and immediately be able to play all your songs. You learned a couple of fucking chords, you know? Then your fingers hurt, right? And you get frustrated, but you keep coming back and eventually you can fucking play. Pussy is no different. That's what I would do. Put the Asperger on the back burner. Who knows too. Maybe not as fucked up as you think you are socially. You know what? I mean, maybe you got a sense of humor under that. I think you do your shit on yourself in a funny way. You know, spin it around that way. Do you have any interests? Go, go to, oh, go to a fucking, I dunno, whatever. You know, you fly kites, go to some flying again in the code

Speaker 6:          01:04:18       convention. There's gotta be some woman there also likes Kate. I know that was an overly simplified thing, but that's what I would do. All right. And then when you go to like a hookup with somebody, a nice, you know, NGS, tell them if he start and you're not, don't know what you're doing to watch a couple of fucking pornos, you know, you'll get the idea. Actually, no, don't do that. Don't do that. Cause then you'll suck. Just start slapping them around. You don't do that. I know what to tell you, dude. I get buy some books. I say go buy some, buy some books and that, that, uh, that, that part of the bookstore that, you know, if, if bookstores exist anymore, go on, go online. There's gotta be plenty of information. I bet. If you literally looked up finger banging technique, if you looked how to kiss, I bet this is going to be reams of fucking information.

Speaker 6:          01:05:09       I've never done that because I never had to. Oh, just kidding. Of course I had. Do you think that I've been wished that fucking information was around way back in the day when he had no id, just practice kissing your fucking pillow and tried to overhear conversations in the fucking high school cafeteria and try to figure out what people were talking about. That's all I could do. You, you have the whole world that you fingertips, you know? So when you're done in the laboratory working with radioactive shit before you, you get bit by something you don't want you to go on and get late.

Speaker 5:          01:05:40       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:05:40       Before you learned how to fly. Alright. All right.

Speaker 5:          01:06:09       [inaudible].
