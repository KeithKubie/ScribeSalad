00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's the right model for this idea?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Should the rate of change of the left temperature be 0.1/h

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
times the difference between the right and left temperature?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Should the rate of change of the right temperature be 0.1/h

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
times the same difference should the rate of change of the right temperature

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
be 0.1/h times the left temperature?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Should the rate of change of the left temperature be -0.1/h * left temperature

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or should the rate of change of the right temperature be 0.1/h

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
times the difference of the left and the right temperature?

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
