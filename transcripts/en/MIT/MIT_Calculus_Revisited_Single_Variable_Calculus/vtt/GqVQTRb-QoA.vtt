00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.470
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.680
Our lecture today is called
'Rolle's Theorem and Its

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.930
Consequences'.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.960
And I suppose we could've made
a take off on what goes up

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.030
must come down, and say that
what Rolle's theorem says

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.970
intuitively is that what goes
up smoothly and comes down

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.480
smoothly must level
off somewhere.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.880
OK?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.280
Now because that may sound too
easy to understand, let's

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.350
cloak that in the language of
more formal mathematics.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.110
Rolle's theorem says this.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.760
Let 'f' be defined and
continuous on the closed

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.050
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.620
In other words, what?

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.930
The domain of 'f' is the closed

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.140
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.340
The graph of 'f' is unbroken
on this interval.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.770
And differentiable in the open
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.840
In other words, you want the
function to be continuous on

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.270
the entire interval, but for
differentiability, you only

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.000
require that it be smooth,
differentiable, in the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.010
interior of the interval,
in the open interval.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.000
Suppose also that 'f of
a' and 'f of b' are 0.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.990
Then, what Rolle's theorem says
is that 'f prime of c',

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.180
the derivative of 'f of x', must
be 0 for some number 'c',

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.680
at least one number
'c', in the open

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.160
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.420
Now what this thing says
intuitively is simply this,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.440
suppose you have a curve that is
unbroken for all values of

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.130
'x' between 'a' and
'b' inclusively.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.580
Suppose the curve is smooth.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.780
Suppose the curve starts here
and ends here, then what we're

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.330
saying is there must be some
point in here where the curve

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.030
levels off.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.800
In other words, someplace where
you have a horizontal

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.800
tangent, which is what 'f prime
of c' equals 0 means.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.000
In this particular diagram, this
would be the value of 'c'

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.510
that we're talking about.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.080
By the way, I think the proof
is intuitively clear.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.510
Namely, if the curve never
leaves the x-axis, then it's

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.660
leveled off for the
entire domain.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.937
And if the curve does leave the
x-axis, for example, if

00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:50.400
the curve starts to rise, OK,
since it must eventually get

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.320
back to the x-axis when 'b' is
0, it must ultimately begin to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.240
fall again.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.860
Well, if the curve goes from
rising to falling,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.040
it must have what?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.010
Since it's coming up and then
going down, it must attain a

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.520
maximum value.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.030
Because the curve is unbroken
and smooth, as we saw in our

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.690
previous lecture, the maximum
value is characterized by the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.220
derivative at that
point being 0.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.920
In fact, the analytic proof is
precisely what we've just

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.650
said, only translated into more
mathematical language.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.280
By the way, I would like to
make a slight aside here,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.980
because I think it sometimes
gets confusing to students to

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.600
see, why do you say that the
function has to be continuous

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.000
on the closed interval, but
differentiable only in the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.220
open interval?

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.580
I thought you might like to see
a contrived example as to

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.360
what goes wrong if you allow the
curve to be broken at the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.220
end points.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.520
See, all I'm thinking of
is something like this.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.880
Suppose I say, look, let's
define a curve as follows.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.510
At 'x' equals 'a' and
'x' equals 'b', the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.040
curve will be 0.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.550
So in other words, it'll
cross the x-axis.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.980
Then immediately, for 'x'
greater than 'a', the curve

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.090
jumps up to here, comes down
along this line, and then, you

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.480
see, when 'x' equals 'b', it
jumps down here again.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.560
In other words, why
not let the curve

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.950
be defined as follows?

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.170
It will be 0 at these
two endpoints.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.650
It'll be this curve on
the open interval.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.010
Notice in this contrived example
that 'f of a' and 'f

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.780
of b' are both equal to 0, but
there is no place in the open

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.880
interval where the curve has
a horizontal tangent line.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.790
In other words, the significance
is you've got to

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.830
be sure that the curve doesn't
get broken at the ends,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.940
because with these gaps,
all sorts of

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.780
crazy things can happen.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.180
Now, just as in our previous
lecture, there are some rather

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.960
important cautions that have to
be taken in understanding

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.210
Rolle's theorem.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.020
As simple as it is, we have to
be sure that we understand

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.070
exactly what's really
happening here.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.260
The first caution is that
Rolle's theorem is what we

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.920
mathematicians call an
'existence theorem'.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.800
It says, under certain
conditions, there exists at

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.080
least one number 'c' that
has a certain property.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.790
It doesn't tell us how
many "c's" there are.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.870
It doesn't tell us where
to find them.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.040
It just says, what?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.720
There exists at least
one such 'c'.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.770
And the point is, you must
be careful to remember--

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.930
so let's take an example.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.970
Here's 'a', here's 'b'.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.826
If the function is continuous
and smooth, in other words, if

00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:37.950
the graph is continuous and
smooth, all we're saying is

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.710
that at least one number between
'a' and 'b', the

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.520
curve, must possess a
horizontal tangent.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.640
There may be more than one.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.480
You see, the curve, for
example, could do

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.250
something like this.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.640
See, in other words, here is one
value of 'c', which we'll

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.060
call 'c1', horizontal
tangent here.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.730
Here's another value, which
we'll call 'c2', horizontal

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.280
tangent here.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.100
See, again, the meaning
of at least one.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:11.370
Secondly, we must make sure
that we remember that the

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.290
curve is smooth.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.780
Meaning what?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.570
That the function is
differentiable.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.980
Now I'm taking the liberty
of drawing

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.880
these things in freehand.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.760
There's some mixed emotions
here, if I draw the diagrams

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.260
too smoothly all the time, you
lose the significance of

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.200
what's going on because
of the picture.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.020
And if I draw them freehand
all the time, you won't

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.230
understand what I'm
doing, because I

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.380
don't draw very well.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.270
But I think here we can
get away with this.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.650
What I'm driving at is this.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.710
Let's suppose you have
'a' and 'b' here.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.810
Let's suppose that the function,
the curve that we're

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.230
drawing, passes through
these two points.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.260
But suppose there happens to
be a sharp corner in here.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.530
Maybe the curve goes like this,
it goes up like this,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.010
then very abruptly comes
down like this.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.550
Notice, what?

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.270
That the curve is continuous.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.380
It does reach a local maximum.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.890
But the point is, for this
particular value of 'c', 'f

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.320
prime of c' is not
0 by default.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.320
Namely, 'f prime of c'
doesn't even exist.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.230
So in other words, Rolle's
theorem doesn't apply if you

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.700
don't have differentiabilities.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.890
I want to make sure you see
where each of the parts of the

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.600
hypotheses for the
theorem are used.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.470
By the way, here's another
interesting result, which has

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.200
nothing to do with the statement
of the theorem, but

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.140
again, another piece of evidence
as to why we like to

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.700
shy away from functions which
are not single value.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.700
See, for example, suppose you
allowed the function to be

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.520
multivalued, and you say, OK,
I want the curve to pass

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.960
through here and here.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.890
And I want it to be smooth.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.180
But the curve does not have
to be single value.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.660
Notice what you can do.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.070
You could have a curve that
does something like this.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.210
I don't know.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.190
Now you see, there will be
a point 'c' where the

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.390
derivative will be 0.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.790
Even as badly as I've drawn
this, I think roughly

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.430
speaking, we can see that 'c'
would be something like this.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.130
Notice, however, that in
Rolle's theorem, the

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.150
statement is what?

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.490
That 'c' must be on the open
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.010
If the function is not single
value, as long as the curve is

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.330
smooth, there will be places
where the curve levels off.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.130
But the x-coordinate of the
point at which the curve

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.530
levels off may not be
in the interval--

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.179
may not be, it could be, but
it might not be, I should

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.220
say-- in the open interval
from 'a' to 'b'.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.070
This is a very, very
important result.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.070
In fact, I'll have reason to
make reference to this in a

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.700
little while later
in the lecture.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.660
I couldn't make reference to
it later earlier in the

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.570
lecture, I guess.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.200
The fourth assumption here is
also an aside, and it's one

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.360
that's rather crucial.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.470
In most textbooks in which
Rolle's theorem is stated, the

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.350
condition is what?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.180
That 'f of a' equals
'f of b' equals 0.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.340
It turns out that this is too
restrictive, that essentially,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.630
all you need is 'f of
a' equals 'f of b'.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.200
What I mean by that is, let's
suppose 'f of a' is not 0.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.810
Let's suppose this height
represents 'f of a'.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.300
What I'm saying is suppose
that 'f of a' and

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.210
'f of b' are equal.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.760
What that means is, if I want to
think of a new axis, which

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.330
I call the 'x sub 1' axis--

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.980
see, with respect to the 'x sub
1' axis, the curve crosses

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.550
the axis at these two points.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.235
In other words, notice that as
long as these two points are

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:43.160
at the same level, the same
argument that we used to prove

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.970
Rolle's theorem goes through
unimpeded over here.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.170
Namely, we say what?

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.490
What goes up smoothly and
comes down smoothly--

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.670
because it has to come down,
because it comes back to the

00:09:54.670 --> 00:10:00.540
same level here-- must reach a
point someplace in here where

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.280
it levels off.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.100
So these are the four cautions
that I'd like you to look at

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.200
when we view Rolle's theorem.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.110
Now, if somebody were to say
to us, what's so important

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.290
about Rolle's theorem?

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.250
And this happens so often in
mathematics that frequently,

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.510
the most important thing about
one particular theorem, is

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.420
that it may be the building
block by which a more

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.670
important, or more
useful, or more

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.910
practical theorem is derived.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.680
And in this respect, I would say
for my own opinion, that

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.830
the most important application
of Rolle's theorem is that it

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.560
facilitates a very famous result
known as the 'Mean

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.590
Value theorem'.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.790
As our course proceeds, from
time to time we will have

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.330
ample reason to back track and
make references to the mean

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.390
value theorem.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.640
I intend not to make too deep
references to the mean value

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.190
theorem now, because what
I would like to do is to

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.220
establish the result, give you
enough of an intuitive feeling

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.960
so that you can tuck it under
your belt without feeling too

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.880
overwhelmed by it, and just
enough applications of it so

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.450
that we can get into the next
phase of our calculus course.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.080
But the mean value theorem is
another one of these things

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.680
where if you state the thing
analytically, and have no

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.490
feeling for what's going on
pictorially, the thing can

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.180
become overwhelming.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.940
Let's, in fact, do it in an
overwhelming way, and then

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.040
show what the thing
means pictorially.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.520
Notice again how this thing now
starts off the same way as

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.560
Rolle's theorem.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.560
Let 'f' be continuous on the
closed interval from 'a' to

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.150
'b', and differentiable in the
open interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.110
By the way, this is just an
idiosyncrasy of mine, I don't

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.050
know if it's standard.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.070
When I talk about the closed
interval, I have the habit of

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.050
saying 'on' the interval.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.280
When I talk about the open
interval, I like to say 'in'

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.840
the interval, to sort of
emphasize the interior.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.250
It's just a vocabulary
trait, and don't read

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.080
too much into this.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.160
Don't be upset by it.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.060
But it's continuous on
the closed interval,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.050
differentiable in the
open interval.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.360
Now it's again an existence
theorem.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.750
It says then there exists
a number 'c'.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.580
When I say there exists,
it means what?

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.190
There is at least one number 'c'
in the open interval from

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.080
'a' to 'b'--

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.240
and this is the part that
looks kind of tough--

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:19.030
such that ''f of b' minus 'f of
a'' divided by 'b - a' is

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.600
'f prime of c'.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.040
And this somehow or other may
seem at first glance to be

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.290
more ominous than the intuitive
feeling about

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.520
Rolle's theorem.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.590
By the way, as the name implies,
where by 'mean' we

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.900
don't mean nasty, we mean
average, if you'd like to see

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.240
what this thing means, and I'll
draw you a picture in a

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.020
second, all it says is that if
a particle is moving from

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.790
point 'a' to point 'b', say, at
at least one point during

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.750
its trip, the instantaneous
speed must

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.980
equal the average speed.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.210
You see?

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.380
Because after all, if you're
always going less than your

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.490
average speed, how could you
have had an average speed as

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.010
high as your average speed?

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.250
And if you're always going less
than your average speed,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.270
how could you have had, you see,
an average speed equaling

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.660
this, what it did?

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.610
So that somehow or other, all
you're saying is that somehow

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.050
or other, the instantaneous
speed at a particular instance

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.160
must equal your average speed
someplace along the path.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.550
Now what that means pictorially
is this--

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.750
again, I'll chance a
freehand diagram--

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.320
suppose our curve is 'y'
equals 'f of x'.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.230
See, I've drawn it
to be smooth.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.380
Suppose it's continuous and
smooth on this open interval

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.680
from 'a' to 'b'.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.530
Now what is, if I think of a
particle moving from point 'p'

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.270
to point 'q', how do I identify
the average speed?

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.200
The average speed is the slope
of the straight line that

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.530
joins 'p' to 'q'.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.880
On the other hand, what is
the instantaneous speed?

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.280
If we think of it in terms of
the picture, it's the slope of

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.620
the line tangent to the curve
at a particular point.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.420
So in other words, what
we're saying is this.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.270
You see, if we were to take the
line 'PQ', and we shift it

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.070
parallel to itself, I think you
can sense that the points

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:19.070
'P' and 'Q', if we labeled 'P'
and 'Q' the points at which

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.170
this chord intersects the curve,
the points 'P' and 'Q'

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.440
will roll in closer and
closer together.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.760
Ultimately, the line will fail
to intersect the curve, and at

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.340
the transition point, if the
curve is smooth, all we're

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.780
saying is that the last point at
which that line touches the

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.460
curve as we move it out, OK,
that the line would be tangent

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.060
to the curve at that
particular point.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.430
You see, all we're
saying is what?

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.650
That someplace between here and
here there must be a point

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.760
where the tangent line to
the curve is parallel

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.310
to the chord 'PQ'.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.320
And now, we have all the
ingredients that we need to

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.500
see what the mean value theorem
says geometrically.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.550
Let's call the tangent
line 'l'.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.820
First of all, what is the
slope of the line 'PQ'?

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.120
Well, it's a straight line.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.610
The slope of a straight
line is 'delta y'

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.090
divided by 'delta x'.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.840
Well, notice that this
height here is by

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.680
definition 'f of b'.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.880
This height here is 'f of a'.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.820
So this height here is just
'f of b' minus 'f of a'.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.770
This length here is
just 'b - a'.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.710
So the slope, 'delta y' divided
by 'delta x', is just

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:37.180
''f of b' minus 'f of
a'', over 'b - a'.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.010
On the other hand, what is the
slope of the line 'l'?

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.340
By definition, it's 'f prime of
x' evaluated at 'x' equals

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.100
'c', that's 'f prime of c'.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.240
Now what does it mean in
terms of slopes for

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.700
two lines to be parallel?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.630
It means that their
slopes are equal.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.170
And where is 'c'?

00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:02.240
'c' is someplace in the open
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.730
Now the reason I call this
intuitively an extension of

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.490
Rolle's theorem--

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.270
and by the way, you'll notice
that what I have to say is a

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.490
much simpler demonstration than
what's given in the book.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.460
But before you think I'm being
egotistic about this, let me

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.610
point out, as is so often the
case that wherever my

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.930
demonstrations are easier than
the one in the book, I'm

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.520
losing something in
my presentation.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.410
Either I haven't shown the most
analytic representation,

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.760
or I'm overlooking a particular
complicated side

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.760
effect that might occur.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.330
But disregarding that for the
moment, you see what I'm

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.790
saying is this, let's suppose,
for the sake of argument, we

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:47.720
visualize the line 'PQ' as
being our new x-axis.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.710
I'll call that the x1-axis.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.110
And now let's take a line
perpendicular to 'PQ' and call

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.740
that our new y-axis,
the y1-axis.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.870
Now look at the curve
that we've drawn.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:05.079
With respect to the y1- x1-axis,
notice that the curve

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.819
is smooth, right?

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.329
It's unbroken.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:13.050
And it cuts the x1-axis
at two points.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.270
Now if we apply Rolle's theorem
with respect to the

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.970
x1- y1-axis, we say, look,
here's a curve

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.770
which cuts the x-axis--

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:22.660
the x1-axis--

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.790
at two points.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.560
It's smooth.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.740
Therefore, it must level
off someplace.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.370
In other words, there must be
some point on this curve where

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.480
the tangent line to the curve
is parallel to the x1-axis.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.670
That's exactly, you see, what
this thing here says.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.660
That's another geometric
interpretation that indicates

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.620
how Rolle's theorem
might be used.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.000
However, there is a very, very
subtle flaw in what I've said.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.240
One that is so subtle that you
may not even notice it until I

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.830
point it out to you, and even
after I point it out, there's

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.760
a chance you may not realize
what I've said.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.910
Because it's a point that I know
took me a long, long time

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.390
to discover for myself.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.470
And it all hinges on
the concept of

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.200
single valuedness again.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.840
The trouble with this
interpretation is the

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.380
following--

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.770
and by the way, let me point
out, I'm not knocking my

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.390
interpretation, I think it's
still a tremendous way of

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.110
visualizing the result, but from
an analytical point of

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.600
view, why we have
to be careful.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.830
Let's suppose that my curve 'y'
equals 'f of x' happens to

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.110
look something like this, OK?

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.200
Happens to look something
like this.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.160
Notice, barring any bad drawing
that I've done here,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.130
that this curve is single value,
that no line parallel

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.670
to the y-axis cuts this curve
in more than one place.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.150
Now here's my 'a' and
here's my 'b'.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.820
And so I say, OK, by Rolle's
theorem, if I look at this as

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.740
being the x-axis and this
as being the y-axis--

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.500
in other words, the x1-
y1-axis again--

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.930
I say to myself, look, here's
a smooth curve, it cuts the

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:04.620
x-axis in two points, therefore,
someplace between

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.210
these two points, there must
be a place where the curve

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.120
levels off, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.370
And the interesting point is to
notice that a given curve,

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.850
as to whether it's single valued
or not, is dependent

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.830
upon the orientation
of the axes.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.040
In other words, notice that
I've drawn this particular

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.100
curve so it is single valued
with respect to the xy-plane.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.580
On the other hand, with
respect to the x1-

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.020
y1-coordinate system, this curve
is not single valued.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.920
Namely, observe how a line
parallel to the y1-axis can

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.630
intersect this curve at
more than one point.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.590
In other words, whether a curve
is single valued or not

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.570
is not an absolute property
independent of

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.970
the coordinate system.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.160
So again, if I could be sure
that when I rotated my

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.460
coordinate axes the original
single valued curve was still

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.010
single valued, then
my above proof

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.250
would have been rigorous.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.410
But of course, I can't
be sure of that.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.700
By the way, the technique used
in the book is quite standard,

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.270
and what it does is the
following, it still utilizes

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.630
Rolle's theorem, but the
technique behind the proof in

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.780
the book is this.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.160
The function that we set up is
the vertical distance between

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.930
the chord and the curve, as
we move along this way.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.090
And notice that that distance
is 0 at these two endpoints.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.450
OK?

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.510
And therefore, Rolle's theorem
applies to that function.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.710
And the whole idea is
something like this.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:40.950
All we say is--

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.780
and the analytic part
proves this--

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.190
all we say is look, the point at
which this chord would have

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.960
been tangent to the curve is the
place where the vertical

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.360
distance between the chord
and the curve is what?

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.730
Maximum.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.420
And we won't go into that
right now, that

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.250
is done in the text.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.520
All I wanted to do, as I always
will do when possible,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.580
is that whenever the rigorous
proof seems far more

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.520
complicated than proofs which
are more intuitive, I will not

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.830
take the time in general, in our
lectures, to give the more

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.700
rigorous proof.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.590
What I will take the time to
do is to show why the less

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.610
rigorous proof has pitfalls.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.640
Well, enough said about
the statement of

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.950
the mean value theorem.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.080
Time is getting very short, and
we don't need much more

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.260
time to make the home run
ball pitch that we

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.520
want to make now.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.040
And the idea is this, that the
most important analytical

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.740
reason for having the mean value
theorem is, for those of

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.560
us who like to use our geometric
intuition, it turns

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.080
out that almost every
geometrically obvious fact

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.200
that has a proper analytic
counterpart has the property

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.640
that the analytic counterpart
is proven by

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.130
the mean value theorem.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.320
See, let me give you a
simple for instance.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.700
In fact, in the text book this
is called the first corollary

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.530
to the mean value theorem.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.810
Suppose we have a function
capital 'F of x', and we know

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.330
that the derivative is
always equal to 0.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.730
The claim is that 'F of x'
itself must be a constant.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.160
By the way, two cautions here.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.140
Don't say that we've had
this result before.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.030
The result that we had
before was actually

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.660
the converse of this.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.790
The result that we had before
was the one that said what?

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:32.570
If 'F of x' is a constant,
then its derivative is 0.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.800
Now we're saying the
opposite--not the opposite,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.400
but the converse.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.000
Now we're saying, look, if the
derivative is always 0--

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.980
notice the use of my identity
symbol here--

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.680
if the derivative is 0 for all
values of 'x', then the

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.480
function must've been
a constant.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.660
Now, you know, geometrically
this is a very

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.090
simple thing to visualize.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.160
You say, look, the derivative
is the slope.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.150
And if you're saying that the
slope of the curve is always

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:00.300
horizontal, the curve itself
must be a straight line.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.960
And if the curve is a straight
line, that's exactly what you

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.590
mean by saying that the function
is a constant.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.500
How do we prove this using
the mean value theorem?

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.250
See, and I just wanted to go
through a proof here once,

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.970
just so to get the idea
of what a proof means.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.350
You see, to show that
something is a

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.930
constant should mean what?

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:23.430
That if 'a' is unequal to 'b'
for any two values 'a' and

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.850
'b', 'F of a'--

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.570
well, I'm using capital 'F'
here--capital 'F of a' has to

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.210
equal capital 'F of b'.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.500
That's what you mean for a
function to be a constant.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.530
No matter what the input is, the
outputs are always equal.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.310
By the way, if 'a' equals 'b',
it's trivial that 'F of a'

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.350
equals 'F of b'.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.500
But essentially, to prove that
capital F is a constant, this

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.810
is what I have to prove.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.740
That if 'a' is different from
'b', no matter what 'a' and

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.960
'b' I use, that 'F of
a' equals 'F of b'.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.570
And the idea is by the mean
value theorem, we say, look,

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.090
what does the mean value
theorem say?

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.440
We're assuming now that 'F'
is a continuous and

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:05.420
differentiable function on an
interval, OK, from 'a' to 'b'.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.210
The mean value theorem says
under these conditions, there

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.600
exists a number 'c'
between 'a' and

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.730
'b' with what property?

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:20.260
That ''F of b' minus 'F of a''
over 'b - a' is equal to 'F

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.810
prime of c'.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.260
That's just a statement of
the mean value theorem.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.060
This is always true if the
conditions of the mean value

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.150
theorem apply.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.480
Now all we're saying is, in this
particular problem, what

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.130
property that capital
'F' have?

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.670
It had the property that
its derivative for all

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.250
values of 'x' was 0.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.970
In particular then, when 'c'
is the value that we're

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.890
talking about, if 'F prime of x'
is 0 for all values of 'x',

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.400
in particular, then, it's 0
when 'x' is equal to 'c'.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.920
In other words, by our given
hypothesis, this is 0.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.380
But if a fraction is 0, its
numerator must be 0.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.300
That says what?

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.920
'F of b' minus 'F of a' is 0.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.450
See, the only way a quotient
can be 0 is for the

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.370
numerator--

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.860
or the dividend, the divisor,
I don't know these formal

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.210
names, they slipped my mind, but
the top one has to be 0.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.110
And if 'F of b' minus 'F of a'
is 0, that says 'F of b'

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.730
equals 'F of a', and that's
precisely what we had to show

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.830
to show that 'F'
was a constant.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.490
OK?

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.800
So again, notice, it's not that
we're saying that the

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.190
mean value theorem is a harder
way of proving what we already

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.610
know to be intuitively true,
what we're saying is what?

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.890
That we know that many
intuitively obvious results

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.380
frequently turn out
to be false.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.760
We would like some analytical
way of knowing which of the

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.240
intuitive results are
actually correct.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.125
All I'm saying is the mean value
theorem gives us a big

00:25:55.125 --> 00:25:56.080
hint that way.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.750
By the way, let me close by
giving you one more important

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.400
illustration of what
we can prove by

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.030
the mean value theorem.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.810
And this is called a corollary
of a corollary, as I'll show

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.240
you what I mean in a minute.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.900
The next example that I want to
use is what it means to say

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.560
suppose I'm given two functions
'f' and 'g', and all

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.790
I know about these two
functions is that the

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.970
derivatives are identical.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.280
In other ways, that 'f' and 'g'
have the property that for

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.950
every value of 'x', 'f
prime of x' is equal

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.320
to 'g prime of x'.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.200
By the way, when I say every
value of 'x', again, it's

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.890
local versus global.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.850
It's not necessary that this
happens for all 'x', what is

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.240
important is what?

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.385
That 'x' be defined
on some interval.

00:26:41.385 --> 00:26:44.340
In other words, even if I know
that this property is true for

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.470
some interval, I don't really
care what happens outside of

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.760
that interval.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.660
In terms of local properties,
all I'm saying is, all I know

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.300
is that for some interval, maybe
the whole axis, doesn't

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.390
make any difference, 'f prime'
is identical to 'g prime'.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.690
Now, you would like to be able
to say, maybe, that if 'f

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.300
prime' is equal to 'g prime',
'f' equals 'g'.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.920
But that's not the case.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.510
What is the case is that the
difference between the two

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.740
functions must be a constant.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.180
Again, geometrically, what
you're saying is what?

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:20.400
That if you have two curves,
which point by point always

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.810
have the same slope--

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.410
in other words, for each
'x' value, the

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.540
slopes are the same--

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.590
is just essentially
saying that the

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.530
two curves are parallel.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.130
And if they're parallel curves,
what's a way of

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.900
stating that two curves
are parallel?

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.910
That one is a constant
displacement of the other.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:41.300
In other words, the geometric
impact of two curves having

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.110
the same derivative is not that
the curves are the same,

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.780
but that they're parallel.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.200
And by the way, the proof of
this result is again a

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.290
corollary to the mean
value theorem.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.600
Namely, let's look at
the function 'f of

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.970
x' minus 'g of x'.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.000
Call that capital 'F of x'.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.100
Let capital 'F of x' be ''f
of x' minus 'g of x''.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.460
Since the derivative of a
difference is the difference

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.430
of the derivatives, that would
say the derivative of capital

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.970
'F' is the derivative
little 'f' minus the

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.360
derivative of 'g'.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.090
OK?

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.470
Now what do we know about 'f
prime' and 'g prime of x'?

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.250
We know that 'f prime of
x' equals 'g prime

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.970
of x' for all 'x'.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:28.180
Consequently, the difference
between these two must be 0.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.550
Remember, if two functions
are identical, their

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.000
difference is 0.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.510
That says, therefore, that
capital 'F prime of x' is

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.920
identically 0.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.870
And by our previous theorem--

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.430
notice the beautiful
logic of this--

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:44.540
from the mean value theorem,
we proved that if the

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.400
derivative of a function is
identically 0, the function

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.660
must be a constant.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.260
So we apply that here.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.020
But what was capital 'F'?

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.410
It was 'little 'f - g'.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.130
And that proves our
desired result.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:04.510
Again, what I want you to see
here is that we have not done

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.530
anything different with the
mean value theorem.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.140
We're not trying to say we're
going to prove results we

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.410
couldn't prove before.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.230
Rather, what?

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.970
The mean value theorem is our
way of showing that certain

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.540
intuitive results hold true
analytically, that we can talk

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.920
about parallel curves,
and things like this.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.250
Most important, in terms of
summarizing this lecture from

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.650
a point of view of what's coming
next, it's crucial to

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.050
observe that this last example
is what is going to allow us

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.080
to enter the study of
something called the

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.640
'indefinite integral'.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.820
Or in another manner of
speaking, something called the

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.600
inverse of taking
a derivative.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.290
You see, the idea is, notice
that in these two examples we

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.490
start with information about
the derivative and deduce

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:51.820
what's true about the
original function.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.820
That's inverting the emphasis
of what we've been doing up

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.740
until now, where we've started
with the function and

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.800
investigated its derivative.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.910
To see this in more detail,
join me again next time.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.520
And until next time, goodbye.
