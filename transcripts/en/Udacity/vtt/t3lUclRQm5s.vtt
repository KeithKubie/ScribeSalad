00:00:00.181 --> 00:00:03.586
And realize both answers count, but clearly the correct

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:07.168
answer is no. You should go to the hospital.

00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:10.417
Hospitals don’t cause sick people to die.

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:12.209
I know that there has been lots of studies

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.669
that show if a perfectly healthy person goes

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.029
to a hospital, they might actually catch a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.694
disease there but hospitals have a reason,

00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:21.465
they want to cure people. Why is this

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:24.838
interesting? Because based on the correlation

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:28.064
data, it seems that being in a hospital makes

00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:30.396
you 40 times as likely to die than being at

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:33.964
home but that doesn’t mean by staying at

00:00:33.964 --> 00:00:37.058
home, you reduce your chances of dying

00:00:37.058 --> 00:00:41.000
So this is a statement of correlation.
