00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.690
When evaluating square roots or other even roots we can't take the root of a

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.676
negative number. That's because there's no number that can multiply two times,

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:13.840
or any even number of times, to have a negative sign. We know a negative times

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.545
a negative equals a positive number, so any number of two negative signs would

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:23.750
always be a positive. So we can't exactly simplify the square root of negative

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.824
1. We know it's not equal to negative 1, since negative 1 times negative 1

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:31.690
really equals positive 1. And, we also know that the square root of negative 1

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.894
does not equal positive 1 since 1 times 1 equals 1. There's no value in the

00:00:36.894 --> 00:00:41.382
real number system that gives us the square root of negative 1. We'll need

00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:45.120
something else for this. It turns out that we define it as i, an imaginary

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.625
number. I allows us to take the square root of negative numbers. For example,

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:55.350
if I wanted to take the square root of -4, I would split this radical up, into

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.200
the square root of -1, and the square root of 4. We know that the square root

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.622
of 4 is simply 2. And the square of negative 1 really equals i our imaginary

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:10.110
number. So, we get the products of 2i. for the second one we have the square

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.180
root of 3 times the square root of negative 1. This number really represents i.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.850
So, we replace the square root of negative 1 with i. We leave the product of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.662
the factor in front of the radical. So we'll have I times of the square root of

00:01:23.662 --> 00:01:27.376
three, our final result. And for our last one, we'll have the square root of

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:31.340
negative one times the square root of 12. We can simplify the square root of 12

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.790
by breaking it up into the square root of four times the square root of three.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.161
We know the square root of negative one is really equal to I. So we write that

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:43.826
here. And then we take the square root of 4 which is 2. We multiply these two

00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:48.840
together to get 2i times the square root of 3. In a lot of ways we treat i just

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.117
like a variable. We list it after the product of any numerical factors but

00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:56.450
before the radical sign. Now that we've seen a couple of cases of simplifying

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.153
negative radicals with i let's see if you have the hang of it.
