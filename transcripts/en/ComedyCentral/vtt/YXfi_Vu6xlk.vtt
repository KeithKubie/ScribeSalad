00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.185

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.286
REALLY FAR IN THE BACK, THERE'S

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:55.455
A GUY WATCHING THAT GUY.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:56.356
IT'S LAYERED.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.925
&gt;&gt; CHRIS, IF YOU LOOK CLOSER,

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:01.728

&gt;&gt; CAN'T TELL IF THAT'S DAVID

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.386
SPADER GARY BUSEY.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.889
&gt;&gt; THAT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:29.356

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.527
HER BODY.

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.562
&gt;&gt; YES, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:36.396

NEXT ONE, NEXT ONE.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.237
THIS GIRL IS TAKING A SELFIE.

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:44.805
WHAT DO YOU THINK, CREEPY OR

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:45.906

ANDI OSHO?

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.141
&gt;&gt; I THINK SOMETHING CUTE IS IN

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:48.642
THE BACKGROUND.

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:50.577
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU MIGHT BE WRONG.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:51.578
IT'S PRETTY CREEPY.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:55.549
WHY IS SHE HOLDING A GUN.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.419
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.054
&gt;&gt; HAVE THEY TRAPPED HER IN THE

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:01.388
SHOWER?

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:03.090
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.291

&gt;&gt; SHE'S, LIKE COME INTO THE

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:08.562
SAFE HOUSE.

&gt;&gt; THIS IS LIKE A FEMINIST

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.598
REMAKE OF "PSYCHO."

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.066
SHE'S READY FOR HIM.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.368
WHO'S IN THE SHOWER.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.669
SHE'S GOT GUNS.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.804
&gt;&gt; "PSYCHO" REALLY NEED A

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.840
SHOTGUN AND A RED NECK.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.875

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.511

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.712
I'M NOT GOING TO SMILE.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.747
I WANT TO LOOK COOL.

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:28.248
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:28.649
BACKGROUND.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:29.082
