00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.700
I have a function
f of x here, and I

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.940
want to think about
which of these curves

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.980
could represent f prime
of x, could represent

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.924
the derivative of f of x.

00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:12.340
Well, to think
about that, we just

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.150
have to think
about, well, what is

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.800
a slope of the tangent line
doing at each point of f of x

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.480
and see if this
corresponds to that slope,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.060
if the value of these functions
correspond to that slope.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.130
So we can see when x
is equal to negative 4,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.350
the slope of the tangent
line is essentially vertical.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.490
So you could say it's
not really defined there.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.110
But as we go slightly to the
right of x equals negative 4,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.552
we just have a very,
very, very positive slope.

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:37.260
So you could kind of
view it as our slope

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.650
is going from infinity to very,
very positive to a little bit

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.550
less positive to
a little bit less

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.420
positive, to a little
bit less positive,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.380
to a little bit less positive.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.690
So which of these graphs
here have that property?

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.140
Remember, this is trying
to graph the slope.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.790
So which of these functions down
here, which of these graphs,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.540
have a value that is essentially
kind of approaching infinity

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.170
when x is equal to
negative 4, and then it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.117
gets less and less and less
positive as x goes to 0?

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:09.700
So this one, it looks like it's
coming from negative infinity,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.741
and it's getting less and
less and less negative.

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:14.600
So that doesn't seem to
meet our constraints.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.999
This one looks like it is
coming from positive infinity,

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.040
and it's getting less and
less and less positive,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.900
so that seems to be OK.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.340
This has the same property.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.820
It's getting less and
less and less positive.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.230
This one right over here
starts very negative

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.000
and gets less and less
and less negative.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So we can rule that out.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.420
Now let's think about what
happens when x gets to 0.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.550
When x gets to 0, the
tangent line is horizontal.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.960
We're at a maximum point of
this curve right over here.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.480
The slope of a
horizontal line is 0.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.980
Remember, we're trying to look
for which one of these curves

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.220
represent the value
of that slope.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.170
So which one of these curves
hit 0 when x is equal to 0?

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.560
Well, this one doesn't.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.726
So the only candidate that
we have left is this one,

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:05.380
and this one does hit
0 when x equals 0.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.310
And let's see if
it keeps satisfying

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.780
what we need for f prime of x.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.130
So after that point,
it should start

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.950
getting more and more negative.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.550
The slope should get more
and more and more negative,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.980
essentially approaching negative
infinity as x approaches 4.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.080
And we see that here.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.621
The value of this function is
getting more and more negative,

00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:31.530
and it's approaching negative
infinity as x approaches 4.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.190
So we'll go with this one.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.200
This looks like a pretty good
candidate for f prime of x.
