Language: en

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.634
Clinton: and I paste it in
wherever I want.

00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:08.167
Refresh, and we're already live.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:09.968
Now, even a small--thank you.

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:12.100
[applause]

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.167
Now, even a small site like this
one can benefit from search.

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:20.567
I can do that with the Google
Custom Search element.

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:24.434
I'll go
to google.com/webelements,

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:27.033
click the
"Custom Search" element,

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.300
and right now I don't need
to do anything more.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.667
The Custom Search element will
automatically configure itself

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:36.501
to search just
the content of my site.

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.067
So all I have to do is copy--

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:42.334
and I think you're
seeing the pattern here--

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:46.000
paste,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.334
and the search box appears.

00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:51.667
I'm going to do a test search.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.434
Looks good.

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:57.167
However, since
the Custom Search element

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.901
is built on top
of the Ajax search APIs,

00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:04.968
I can apply the styling rules
and custom JavaScript

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:07.234
however I like
to make it fit my site.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:12.467
I move the search box over here,
and there we go.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:15.567
So I've added maps,
news, and search

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:18.133
all in about three minutes.

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.000
And my site's
certainly more dynamic,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.067
but I'd like to make it
more interactive.

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:25.033
I'd like to make it social.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:29.334
I can do that with
the Google Conversation element.

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:32.667
The Google Conversation element
allows visitors to my site

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.200
to post comments and videos

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.734
and hold a conversation
about whatever topic I choose.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:41.734
So, in fact, I will choose
Google I/O as a topic.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:45.934
And I will copy the code,

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:48.734
I will paste it into the site,

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.267
and I will refresh.

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:54.234
And our conversation is live.

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:56.334
Hello, Google--

00:01:56.334 --> 00:02:00.868
Oops.

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:06.367
Google I/O.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.234
So we've seen,
just using copy and paste,

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:14.367
adding search, news, maps,
and conversations to the website

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.133
thanks to Google Web Elements.

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.534
Google Web Elements
are available today

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:21.834
at google.com/webelements.

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.801
Thank you.
Thank you, Vic.

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:27.734
[applause]

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:30.467
Gundrota:
Copy/paste development.

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:35.300
We think that's really
going to make it easier.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.601
Next I'd like to talk
about Android.

00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:40.367
Eric mentioned it
in his opening remarks.

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:43.901
We couldn't be happier with
the progress that we've made

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:46.067
in a little over
just half a year

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.000
since Android's been introduced.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.300
In those brief, few months,
we've had three versions out,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.634
including the latest
version last week

00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:55.834
of the Android 1.5 SDK.

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:58.033
We've had ten carriers and--

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.367
available in over 12 countries.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:03.501
Over 4,900 apps--
almost 5,000 apps,

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:06.701
including apps like the one we
demonstrated on Android earlier,

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.501
using the powerful capability
of its browser.

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:12.067
And on average we're
seeing users of Android

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.601
download over 40 apps
to their device.

00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:17.200
And so the ecosystem
is really working,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.067
browser share is just
fantastic and fun to watch,

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:21.901
and we thank you
for your support.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.667
What we'd like
to do next, though,

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:28.167
is show you a sneak peek into
what's coming next on Android,

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:30.667
and for that I'd like
to invite up Romain Guy.

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:32.934
Romain, please, why don't you
show us what's coming next.

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:34.267
Guy: Thank you, Vic.

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:37.934
[applause]

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:41.133
With Android 1.5 now live,
the Android team is already

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.467
hard at work on the next
version of Android,

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:44.968
and we code named it "Donut."

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:47.267
You may have heard of it
on the Web already.

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:50.200
And today I want to show you
two exciting, new features

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.367
that will ship
as part of Donut.

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:56.734
First, we want to make search
more useful and more powerful

00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:59.734
both for users
and developers alike.

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:03.000
For users, we want--
we want them to be able,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.300
from a single query,
to be able to search the Web,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.300
their contacts, their bookmarks,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.133
their application,
and their music.

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:11.968
But let me show you
what it looks like.

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:15.033
So here I have
an Android device.

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:18.300
And on my home screen,
when I click the search widget,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.067
I can initiate a new search.

00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:21.901
And if I start typing,

00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:23.701
the device
automatically looks

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:26.267
for my applications
or my contacts.

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:30.467
We can also
look for Web results.

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:35.701
So if we're hungry for pizza,
and the 3G is working,

00:04:35.701 --> 00:04:39.167
we can
search the Web for that.

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:40.667
But we decided
that the search UI

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:42.100
could be a lot more than that.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.667
The search UI can also act

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:46.734
as a brand-new launcher
for you as a user.

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:48.701
Every time I click
a search result,

00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:52.200
the system remembers what I did
with that search result,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.701
and the more I use my device,
the more the--the--

00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.634
the device will know about me,
about what I do every day,

00:04:57.634 --> 00:04:59.467
about my common tasks.

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:03.701
And what happens is every time
I start a new search,

00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.133
I get pre-populated results.

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:07.467
So here, for instance,
last time I did a search

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:08.934
I clicked the calendar
application.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:10.734
And I see here the result

00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:13.734
that matters to me
on a day-to-day basis.

00:05:13.734 --> 00:05:15.501
So this is going to be
an awesome feature

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:17.534
'cause I know that
in this part of the UI

00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:19.133
I will always have
access to the thing

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:21.367
that matters to me as a user.

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:22.634
But there's more.

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:25.634
We want the search UI
to become a powerful tool

00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:27.267
for your applications.

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:29.033
And with just
a few lines of code,

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:34.033
your application can populate
more results in the search UI.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.534
And I have a simple
example here.

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:37.100
I wrote an application
for myself,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.934
just a list of books I've read,

00:05:38.934 --> 00:05:40.701
and I wanted to be able
to quickly search

00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:43.334
my library from the home screen.

00:05:43.334 --> 00:05:46.567
So with just
a couple lines of XML,

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:50.801
I am now able to add
my search results to this UI.

00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.100
And if I type the name
of one of my favorite authors,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.334
I can see his books
appearing in my search UI.

00:05:57.334 --> 00:05:59.767
And you can see
search results from the Web--

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:03.000
more books
and more Web results.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.934
So we're really excited
about this feature

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:07.567
because you guys
are creating the content.

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:09.467
You have the application,
you have content

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:11.067
that the Android platform
doesn't have,

00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:13.300
and we can't wait to see
what you're going to do with it

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.100
and what you're going
to put in this UI.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.000
Next, we wanted
to add a new API--

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.234
something that you developers
have widely requested.

00:06:22.234 --> 00:06:26.601
In Android 1.5, we introduced
a new speech recognition API

00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:28.367
that lets you
control the device

00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:30.601
without any
physical interaction.

00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:34.033
Now, the problem is the device
cannot interact with you.

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:36.767
So we're introducing
a new Text-to-Speech API

00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:39.534
that lets the device,
you know, read text to you,

00:06:39.534 --> 00:06:41.033
or give you a result,
or, you know,

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.334
turn-by-turn navigation

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.400
if you're writing
a GPS application.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.968
And I have a simple demo here.

00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:48.767
We modified
the Translate application

00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:50.868
that you can find
on the Android market,

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:54.000
and we added
the Text-to-Speech API.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.334
So, for instance, here, if I
want to translate a sentence

00:06:57.334 --> 00:07:02.567
from English to French, and I
click the "Translate" button...

00:07:02.567 --> 00:07:04.801
computer voice: &lt;i&gt;Bienvenue&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; San Francisco.

00:07:04.801 --> 00:07:07.133
Guy: The device reads
the sentence to me.

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:09.400
And we're shipping--
we're going to ship Donut

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.968
with several voice packs
for different languages,

00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:15.167
so in any language the user
will get the right accent

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:16.734
so they will be able
to understand

00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:18.267
what the device
is saying perfectly.

00:07:18.267 --> 00:07:20.567
So, for instance, in German...

00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:24.701
computer voice: &lt;i&gt;Willkommen&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; San Francisco.

00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:25.701
Guy: Or even in English.

00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:26.868
As I--as you can see,

00:07:26.868 --> 00:07:28.067
we have two different
versions in English.

00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:30.367
computer voice: Welcome
to San Francisco.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:35.167
Guy: So we're really excited...

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:38.100
[applause]

00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:41.167
We're really excited
about these APIs

00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:42.234
'cause we know that you guys

00:07:42.234 --> 00:07:43.934
are going to do
great things with it.

00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:46.300
But it gets even better.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.100
We're shipping a new
text-to-speech API in Donut,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.033
but we're also going to ship
the text-to-speech engine,

00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:55.734
and thanks to SVOX,
that engine will be open source.

00:07:55.734 --> 00:07:57.334
So as part of
the Android platform,

00:07:57.334 --> 00:07:59.634
any Android device
will have an open-source

00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:01.534
text-to-speech engine
of high quality

00:08:01.534 --> 00:08:03.934
like you just heard right now.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:07.400
Finally, I want to show you
a small experiment

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.701
that we've been working on
in the Android team.

00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:13.267
We--you know,
we recognize that sometimes

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:16.000
finding a specific item
in a long list of data--

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.200
for instance, I have
several hundred contacts--

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.868
and finding one item
in that list

00:08:19.868 --> 00:08:21.634
can be, you know,
pretty painful.

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.801
So we have different solutions
to address that issue.

00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:24.901
We have search,

00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:26.200
we have search
on the home screen,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.534
you can filter your list

00:08:27.534 --> 00:08:28.767
when you're
in a contact application,

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:30.100
we have a fast scroll widget--

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.567
many different ways to do it.

00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:34.968
But we wanted something new,
something more interesting

00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:37.501
and that was
a little more fun to use.

00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:39.200
So I have a small demo
for you here.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.467
Wouldn't it be cool if I could

00:08:40.467 --> 00:08:42.567
just launch
my contact application

00:08:42.567 --> 00:08:46.734
and start drawing on the screen
to filter my list?

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:49.534
And I keep--
and I can keep going,

00:08:49.534 --> 00:08:51.534
and the device just
recognizes the handwriting

00:08:51.534 --> 00:08:53.234
and filters the list.

00:08:53.234 --> 00:08:55.167
Instead of filtering,
if you prefer,

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:56.634
you can simply jump to an item.

00:08:56.634 --> 00:09:00.400
So, for instance,
in the music application,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.534
I can jump directly to a certain
position in the list.

00:09:04.534 --> 00:09:06.100
We care about
the user experience,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.901
but we also care
about the developer experience.

00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:10.634
And we hope that
with those new APIs

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:12.267
that we're
introducing in Donut

00:09:12.267 --> 00:09:13.634
there will be more--

00:09:13.634 --> 00:09:16.000
you are going to come up
with awesome applications

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.200
that will make Android
a more exciting platform.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.467
Thank you, Vic.

00:09:20.467 --> 00:09:21.467
Gundrota: Thank you very much,
Romain, thank you.

00:09:21.467 --> 00:09:24.400
[applause]

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:31.400
Well, folks, we covered
quite a bit of ground.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.767
First of all, you heard about
our call to action for HTML--

00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:37.534
Google's commitment
to make applications

00:09:37.534 --> 00:09:41.667
that are HTML 5 exploitative,
and we hope you join us.

00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:43.234
We talked about App Engine

00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:45.100
being opened up
for Java sign-ups.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.968
We gave you a sneak peek at GWT

00:09:46.968 --> 00:09:49.868
and what's coming next--
in the next version there.

00:09:49.868 --> 00:09:51.501
We introduced
Google Web Elements--

00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:53.501
copy/paste development.

00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:56.000
And finally, we gave you
a sneak peek

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.067
at what's coming next
in Android.

00:09:58.067 --> 00:09:59.300
We have three more things
and one final spot.
