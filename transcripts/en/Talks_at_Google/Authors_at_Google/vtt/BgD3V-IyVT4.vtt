JONATHAN: Good morning,
welcome to Talks at Google

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:12.948
in Cambridge, Massachussetts.

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:16.932
Today it is my great pleasure
to welcome Donald Sull.

00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:20.916
Donald joins us to talk about
his newest book co-authored

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.655
with Kathleen M.
Eisenhardt-- "Simple Rules:

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:26.892
How to Thrive in
a Complex World."

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.132
The book authors
challenge how we

00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:33.864
think about complexity and for
new insights into how to cope.

00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:36.354
They take us on
a surprising tour

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:39.342
of what the simple rules
are, where they come from,

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:44.073
and why they work, illustrating
six kinds of rules that really

00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:47.061
matter, drawing on
rigorous research

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:49.907
and using entertaining
stories, they

00:00:49.907 --> 00:00:53.137
find insights in
unexpected places

00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:56.368
and offer fresh information
and practical tips

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:59.350
on fixing old rules
and learning new ones.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.829
Now we can settle in
and get comfortable

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.314
because the next
portion of our hour

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:08.296
will be devoted to
summarizing Don's CV.

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:12.023
He is a global expert on
strategy and execution

00:01:12.023 --> 00:01:13.266
in turbulent markets.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:17.242
He is a senior lecturer at
the Sloan School at MIT,

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:20.721
having previously taught at
Harvard and London Business

00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:24.697
School, winning teaching
awards at both institutions.

00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:28.921
He has published five books, 10
best-selling "Harvard Business

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.655
Review" articles and
over 100 case studies

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:36.128
articles and chapters on
strategy and execution

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:38.116
in turbulent markets.

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:41.595
"The Economist" identified
his theory of active inertia

00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:45.074
as an idea that shaped
business management

00:01:45.074 --> 00:01:46.565
over the past century.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:50.044
And "Fortune" has listed him
as one of the 10 new management

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:51.038
gurus.

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:53.523
Please join me in
welcoming Donald Sull.

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:55.511
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.410
DONALD SULL: Thank you, Jonathan
for that kind introduction.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.390
I cringe every time I hear
that word guru, by the way.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.100
As Peter Drucker, the only
management thinker who actually

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.369
deserved the title guru, once
said that journalists only

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.940
use the guru only
because they were

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.090
too lazy to go to the
dictionary remind themselves

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.640
how to spell charlatan.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.015
So I appreciate
the introduction.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.230
So what we're going
to talk about today

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.900
is the book that my
co-author, Kathy and I just

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.650
published about six weeks ago.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.920
It's called "Simple Rules."

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.390
This is Kathy on
your right here.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.040
Kathy is a professor at the
engineering school at Stanford.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.790
And we started this
project about 15 years ago

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.670
with a very narrowly
defined research agenda,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.210
which was we're really
interested in how

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.960
technology intensive companies
mainly based in Silicon Valley

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.320
managed the complexity
of their ecosystems,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.080
their technological systems,
their competitive domains.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.730
And so we started
a little study just

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.897
to dig into that
specific question.

00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:00.730
And what we found-- had
a big finding out of

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.680
that preliminary research--
was that the companies that

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.930
were more successful
be they start ups,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.930
you know, or startup-ish,
at that time, eBay and Yahoo

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.857
at the time or bigger
companies even then like Cisco,

00:03:12.857 --> 00:03:14.940
the companies that were
more successful in dealing

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.030
with complexity had a systematic
bias towards simplicity.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.710
And specifically
what they did was

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.490
they'd identify a critical
activity in the firm.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.610
It might be a new product
development, partnership,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.350
merger and acquisition
activity, and apply

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.260
a handful of simple rules
that provided some guidance

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.710
to that process but left scope
for flexibility, innovation,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.509
creativity, human judgment.

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.550
So this was the big finding
out of that research.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.230
And over the past 15
years, Kathy and I

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.480
together with our doctoral
students, with our research

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.610
teams, have looked at simple
rules in a variety of domains

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.010
and then expanded our study to
look more broadly into domains

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.870
outside of business
and innovation

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.280
where we focused to see
how simple rules are used.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.440
And so we think this is
the first study that's

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.390
looked at-- a lot of people
have looked at simple rules

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.410
in specific domains.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.950
So in monetary
policy, for instance,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.960
there's a rich body of research
about the role of simple rules.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.729
And social biology--
rich body of research

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.020
about the role of simple rules.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.210
So we think we're the-- this
is the first project that's

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.280
looked at these
different domains

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.494
and tried to draw
cross-cutting lessons about why

00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:19.660
simple rules work, what the
boundary conditions are,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.430
when they work and don't work
so well, and in particular

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.980
how to develop them so
that they're effective.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.400
So that's what we'll
talk about today.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.640
I actually discovered
the power of simple rules

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.260
long before we started
this research project.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.820
So when I was an undergraduate,
I went to Harvard.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.120
And I worked through college.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.960
And one of the jobs I had
was as a doorman at a bar

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.942
called Jack's, which all of
you are too young to remember.

00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:43.775
You remember Jack's?

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:46.100
Oh, excellent, excellent!

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.680
Excellent, all right, my man.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.840
That is great news.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.570
OK, so for the rest of you--

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.960
AUDIENCE: I think
I saw the fire.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.004
DONALD SULL: Oh, no, you're
kidding me, oh, jeez.

00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:58.060
So yeah, that's kind of
the sad end to the story.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.680
So Jack's was this bar on Mass.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.672
Ave almost exactly halfway
between Harvard and MIT.

00:05:02.672 --> 00:05:04.380
So when I tell most
people, maybe not you

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.054
guys-- certainly
not you-- when I

00:05:06.054 --> 00:05:07.470
tell most people
I worked at a bar

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.210
halfway between Harvard and
MIT, this is what they picture.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.710
Right?

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.316
It's like the "Big Bang Theory."

00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:14.690
You've got some
doctoral students

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.210
in there talking through
their dissertations

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.190
or undergrads going
through their problem sets.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.040
But Jack's was not this bar.

00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:27.960
When you think
Jack's, I don't want

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.420
you to think "Big Bang Theory."

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.060
I want you to think
"Sons of Anarchy."

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.340
So Jack's had two
design criterion

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.940
that attracted the local biker
gang, which was called the Rum

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.090
Pot Rustlers.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.990
And the Rum Pot Rustlers, what
they loved about Jacks, one,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.340
we had a live band every night.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.525
And they were pretty good
bands-- Mighty Bosstones

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:46.310
and Til Tuesday.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.320
They were big, local bands.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.251
So they could drink.

00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:50.500
They could listen to the band.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.080
The other thing was instead
of a wall overlooking Mass.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.310
Ave, it was all
plate glass windows.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.060
So why does that matter
if you're a biker.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.902
No, don't tell them.

00:05:58.902 --> 00:06:00.710
AUDIENCE: You can
see your motorcycle.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.110
DONALD SULL: Exactly.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.904
So it turns out
Jack's allowed you

00:06:03.904 --> 00:06:06.320
to do the three things you
loved to do most in life, which

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.840
was drink, listen,
to rock music,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.020
and make sure your bike was OK.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.270
So this is pretty
much biker Valhalla.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.950
And just to give you a sense--
this was kind of a tough crowd.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.500
These guys had
nicknames like Shotgun,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.280
Man Mountain, Mother
Killer, like don't ask.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.470
You really don't want
to know the back story

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.274
to these nicknames.

00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:32.690
So, anyway, that's
where I worked.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.740
And by the way, the question
you should be asking

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.500
is why were you working as
a bouncer in a biker bar?

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.820
I'm sure I'm built for a sport.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.520
I'm sure that
sport is badminton.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.020
But the thing was the
owner, this guy Ben,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.990
he had graduated from Harvard
and he hired all the bouncers

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.420
from the Harvard hockey team
and the Harvard Boxing Club.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.610
And I boxed all through, as a
young man, boxing was my sport.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.090
So anyway, I quickly
discovered after my second trip

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.660
to the emergency room in
the first month on the job,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.200
that a pure brawn strategy as
a middleweight bouncer in a bar

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.970
full heavyweights was a
non-winning proposition.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.210
This was just-- this was not
working out according to plan.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.210
But the money was great.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.750
And it was a terrific
job and a lot of fun.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.760
Anyway, so what I did
was-- as I was recovering

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.240
from my concussion and
only slightly disoriented

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.710
by that time, I came up
with a set of simple rules

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.790
for being an undersized
bouncer in a biker bar.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.040
And I'll just tell
you what those rules

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.120
are because they illustrate
the characteristics

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.950
of effective rules.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.180
So the first one was don't
let trouble in the door.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.580
So it turns out it is
an order of magnitude

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.752
harder to throw a knucklehead
out of the door than to keep

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.210
said knucklehead from entering
the door in the first place.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.470
So I'd just say no.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.860
And they'd yell, they'd
shout, they'd get angry,

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.776
and then they'd leave.

00:07:46.776 --> 00:07:48.160
So that was quite helpful.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.090
The second rule was
sober beats drunk.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.475
So people think when you're
drunk, you're better fighter.

00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:53.600
You're more prone to fight.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.349
But you're sloppy.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:55.900
Your reflexes are slow.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.400
So I had a hard and
fast rule that I

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.630
didn't start drinking
until after the bar closed,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.899
which frankly, might have
been club policy anyway.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.440
I think at minimum,
it was encouraged

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.840
by management-- that behavior.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.130
So it turns out
empirically I noticed

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.170
that certain types
of bands always

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.910
had these complete rock heads,
usually from South Boston, who

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.292
came in and caused big trouble.

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:18.250
So I'd just get the
manager to always double up

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.060
on doormen when those
bands were playing

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.309
so we had a little support.

00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:22.850
And then by far the
most helpful rule

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.820
was number four, which is
keep bikers on your side.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.830
Listen, if you're dealing
with a group of people

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.600
with nicknames like
Shotgun and Mother Killer,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.179
common sense dictates
you do not annoy them.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.100
That is just like anybody
configure that out.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.270
But I went beyond that.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.020
So I tried to cultivate,
maybe not a friendship,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.811
but a cordial relationship
with these guys.

00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:42.870
So they went out to
conduct their business,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.789
I'd watch their bikes.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.150
I went to get pizza,
I'd buy them pizza.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.076
Their friends came
to the door, I'd

00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:48.096
let them in the door,
which came in very handy

00:08:48.096 --> 00:08:49.220
in the following situation.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.311
So it was Friday night,
and the bar is rocking,

00:08:51.311 --> 00:08:52.560
and we're having a great time.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.830
And I look over and here
are four knuckleheads

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.500
and, of course, they
are from Southie.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.766
And the testosterone is flying,
and the chests are pounding.

00:09:00.766 --> 00:09:02.390
And I'm like, oh,
god, not another trip

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.580
the emergency room.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.230
So I'd walk over to the bar.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.770
I'd always walk over to
the same guy, Man Mountain.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.150
So Man Mountain is 6'
7"-- huge, bushy beard.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.680
This was not an
ironic nickname is

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.810
the point I'm trying to make--
huge, bushy beard, big guy,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.220
prison tats up
and down the arms.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.750
And he only ever wore a vest,
never a shirt underneath,

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.321
never jacket over through the
depths of a Boston winter.

00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:26.320
You guys have all lived
through a Boston winter.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.530
So imagine riding
a Harley down Mass.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.972
Ave in a winter like
this with only a vest on.

00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:33.430
So the point I'm trying to make
is he was big, he was mean,

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.131
and he had a high
tolerance for pain.

00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:37.630
So I said, Man Mountain would
you come with me for a minute.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.150
He was like, yeah, sure.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.594
So we walk over and walk
over to these knuckleheads.

00:09:40.594 --> 00:09:43.010
And they're like, whoa, pounding
their chest and so forth.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.910
And I was like, guys,
we've got two options.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.310
Option one, you leave right now.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.990
We're not going anywhere.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.630
So, OK, fine, just listen to
what's behind door number two.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.340
Option two is I introduce you
to my friend, Man Mountain.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.700
And it never failed.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.334
They just look at him
like, whoa, meekly put

00:09:57.334 --> 00:09:58.500
down their glass, apologize.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.190
So sorry to disturb
you, really, we're

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.270
just leaving now,
anyway, time to get back.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:08.090
So it turns out these
four rules illustrate

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.900
what Kathy and I have
discovered are the defining

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.880
characteristics of
effective simple rules

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.580
across a wide
variety of domains.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.700
So the first is
that the rules are

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.164
limited to a handful,
typically three to five.

00:10:21.164 --> 00:10:22.080
Why would that matter?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.913
What do folks think?

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:24.649
Why would the number
of rules matter?

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:25.940
AUDIENCE: You need to remember.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.900
DONALD SULL: OK, first of all.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.020
And it turns out some of you
may have learned at some point

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.220
that people can remember
seven, plus or minus

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.560
two, items in a category
ungarbled without prompting.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.250
That's not true.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.041
It turns out psychologists
have established

00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:38.820
that we can remember
4 plus or minus

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.820
1 items in a single category
consistently ungarbled

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.104
without prompting.

00:10:43.104 --> 00:10:44.270
So right, you remember them.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.390
And, particularly, in the
heat of battle, it's helpful.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.348
What else would matter?

00:10:47.348 --> 00:10:47.956
Yeah?

00:10:47.956 --> 00:10:49.669
AUDIENCE: Combinatorial
explosion.

00:10:49.669 --> 00:10:51.460
Rules that are interacting
with each other.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.209
DONALD SULL: Exactly,
so part of the thing

00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:55.480
is you get these long
laundry lists of rules.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.650
There's all sorts of
interaction, some of which,

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.066
by the way, can be conflicting
interactions, which make it

00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:01.500
very difficult to make choices.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.142
So this at least surfaces
any conflicts in the rules

00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:07.350
because you have a small
number you can kind of stare

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.489
at the same point.

00:11:08.489 --> 00:11:10.530
What else would matter
about the number of rules?

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.070
It forces a prioritization.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:15.580
OK?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.746
So in many situations, at
least the situations where

00:11:17.746 --> 00:11:19.320
simple rules work
well, there will

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.550
be a small number
of guidelines that

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.360
are most effective for the
most highest number of cases.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.680
There'll be a lot of
idiosyncratic cases

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.850
that you don't want to
write a specific rule for.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.170
So it forces prioritization.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.650
The second defining
characteristic

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.690
is that they're tailored
to a specific activity.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.800
So what we are not talking
about is broad principles

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.080
like be innovative and
respect human dignity--

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.070
terrific things, you
know, great values.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.590
But any time you
have a set of rules

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.290
that are meant to apply
across multiple activities

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.420
or decisions in
order to encompass

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.070
these multiple
activities or decisions,

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.480
you need to achieve such
a level of abstractness

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.330
that they often
border on platitudes.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.580
So we're always talking about a
specific activity or decision.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:06.190
And in this case, it was
working the door at Jack's.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.182
I have sometimes wondered,
I must say, like,

00:12:08.182 --> 00:12:09.640
what would have
happened had I used

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.870
those rules in a different
activity like my school work,

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.411
for instance.

00:12:12.411 --> 00:12:14.734
So I go into office hours
and say to my professor,

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:15.900
oh, how am I doing in class?

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.620
Very poorly, C plus.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.130
Oh, really?

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.629
C plus?

00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:20.230
Have I introduced
you to Man Mountain?

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.840
It's what we call a
conversation starter in academia

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.650
but focused on a single
activity, typically.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.845
And then the third thing
is that simple rules are

00:12:30.845 --> 00:12:32.230
a framework, not an algorithm.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.196
And what we mean by
that is, and I know you

00:12:36.196 --> 00:12:37.570
guys know a lot
about algorithms.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.044
So this is a loose use
of the term algorithm.

00:12:41.044 --> 00:12:42.710
The point we're trying
to make with this

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.630
is that it's a framework
for discussion.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.140
It provides some guidance
for discussion and decisions,

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.980
but isn't something where you
put the input, turn the handle,

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.240
and the answer pops out.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.890
It's not a replacement
for guidance or discretion

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:56.840
or judgment.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.390
It is a guide and
framework for that.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.223
And as we go and talk
through some examples,

00:13:00.223 --> 00:13:02.290
I think that point will
become a little clearer.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.789
So in the Jack's case,
I didn't define trouble.

00:13:04.789 --> 00:13:06.330
There weren't a set
of-- there wasn't

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.663
a checklist of these are the
characteristics of trouble.

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:11.480
But it framed what I was looking
for when I went to the door.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.430
So that's the defining
characteristics

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.219
of simple rules.

00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:17.510
And one of the things that
we discovered, and again, we

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.540
had no clue of this when we
began this research project

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.390
was how widespread
simple rules are

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.370
across very diverse domains.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.396
So The White
Stripes-- I don't know

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:32.220
if we have White Stripes
fans in the room?

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.040
OK.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.560
So The White
Stripes-- Jack White

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.420
is a huge proponent
of using simple rules

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.760
every time he cuts an album
to constrain his creativity

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.070
and channel it in a
specific direction.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.900
The medieval, or actually
the Renaissance Jesuits,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.630
St. Ignatius of Loyola
used a set of simple rules

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.650
that guided the
selection of ministries

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.030
that the Jesuits pursued, which
allowed for explosive growth.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.120
They were the Google
of the 16th century

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.130
explosive global
growth, pursuing

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.490
a lot of innovative
opportunities in their domain.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.550
Japanese scientists have
studied the simple rules

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.310
used by slime mold as they
search for food to inform

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:20.390
their design of the Japanese
rail system, widely used

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.259
in sociobiology.

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:22.550
We'll talk about some examples.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.574
So one of the things we
didn't know at the time

00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:25.990
we started this,
but what maintain

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.710
our interest in this project
was how widespread simple rules

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.270
are.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.228
And in the book, we give
some of these examples

00:14:31.228 --> 00:14:34.150
to illustrate points.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.000
So why simple rules?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.470
We waited 15 years.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.664
Why not wait another 15
years to write this book?

00:14:40.664 --> 00:14:42.580
And I guess there are
another couple of things

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.270
that we like about it.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.550
We think they're
pretty interesting.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.930
We think they're
pretty practical.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.130
We have a lot of-- we've done
a set of field experiments

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:48.755
with companies.

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:51.260
And the results have
been pretty rewarding.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.980
But the main thing is we
live in a complex world.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.800
And, again, you all be very
familiar with the notion

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.141
of complexity.

00:15:01.141 --> 00:15:03.140
Neil and I-- this is my
colleague Neil Thompson,

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.830
by the way.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.096
Neil and I, our offices
is right over there.

00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:07.720
And we have a lot of
colleagues who are

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.380
interested in systems dynamics.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.120
And the definition of
complexity that they

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.870
bring to bear to technical
systems or social systems

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.180
is multiple units
interacting with one another

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.980
rather than being
Brownian motion

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.670
of gas molecules
interacting with one another

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.190
where there's dynamism
to those interactions.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.880
So they, actually,
we have colleagues

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.970
who measure with some precision
the level of complexity

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.760
in a system.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.590
So that's the defining
characteristic.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.000
And most of the world we
live in is just complex.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.680
That's most of the
things we're trying

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.695
to achieve whether it's dealing
with terrorism or eradicating

00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:43.195
disease.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.784
The desired result
comes out of a lot

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.450
of interactions of a
lot of moving parts

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:54.616
that are changing over time.

00:15:54.616 --> 00:15:57.140
So complexity is a fundamental
issue that we grapple with.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.450
And the tendency is
often to say, oh look,

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.730
we've got a complex problem.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.634
We've got a complex system.

00:16:03.634 --> 00:16:05.300
We need a complex
solution to manage it.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.310
We need a complex interface
to manage complexity.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.190
We call it the myth of
requisite complexity--

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.830
the assumption that
complex problems

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.610
require complex solutions.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.260
And the argument that
we make in this book

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.700
is that's not
necessarily true that it

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.190
is possible and
empirically, theoretically,

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.310
practically
demonstrably possible

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.600
in certain circumstances
to manage complex systems

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.200
and address complex problems
with a simple interface.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.550
So the kind of analog is
to these simple interfaces

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.670
for consumer products.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.530
And what we're not
arguing, by the way,

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.630
is simple is always
better than more complex.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.980
We are not arguing that.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.520
OK?

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.880
We're very careful in the
book to talk about boundary

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.170
conditions--
circumstances under which

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.610
simple rules or some other
simple approach would be good.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.260
And then there are clearly cases
where more complex approaches

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.360
are more appropriate.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.280
So for instance,
no one wants to be

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.950
the person who lives next
to a nuclear reactor run

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:01.820
on simple rules.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.680
You just don't.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.400
You don't want a doctor who
uses simple rules rather

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.483
than a surgical checklist.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.680
There are domains where
alternatives are clearly

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.390
superior to simple rules.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.670
So we're not saying simple
rules are always better.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.010
But what we are
saying is complexity

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.900
is not always better.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.960
It's not always necessary.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.085
And it's not always better.

00:17:19.085 --> 00:17:21.485
Now, I'll give you an example.

00:17:21.485 --> 00:17:23.109
So I'll ask this
question first of all.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:27.060
Does anybody recognize
that equation?

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.606
I just gave this speech in
Stockholm to a bunch of CEOs

00:17:29.606 --> 00:17:31.730
and, surprisingly, one of
the women raised her hand

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.610
and she said, oh,
yeah, of course,

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.300
that's the Markowitz
efficiency frontier.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.150
I was like, hold on a second.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.080
How did you know that?

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.700
And it turns out she had written
her PhD on this guy Harry

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.060
Markowitz.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.050
So now I always ask.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.220
It makes it kind of fun.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.990
So this is an equation
written by a guy named

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.880
Harry Markowitz to address
on of the fundamental issues

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.030
in finance, which is how
you allocate your asset

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.970
across various asset classes.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.480
And Harry Markowitz won
the Nobel Prize for this.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.119
It's basically a
model that helps

00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:03.660
you to think about a frontier
where you're constantly trading

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.993
off risk and reward and where
the optimal point would be

00:18:05.993 --> 00:18:07.810
or where the trade
offs would be.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.656
And it's fairly
computationally intensive.

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.280
You need a lot of
data the calculate it

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.640
as the number of
asset class increases.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.470
And then an alternative
way to allocate assets

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.470
is this-- 1 over N, which is
about the dumbest, simple rule.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.070
If you could count, your dog
could probably more or less

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.890
do that one.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.720
It's a pretty simple rule.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.930
And I think most
people would assume

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.960
that when it came to
allocating their assets,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.087
this would be superior.

00:18:36.087 --> 00:18:37.420
It's a more sophisticated model.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.900
The guy won a Nobel Prize.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.870
This is a really stupid,
simple rule-- really dumb,

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.580
simple rule.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.590
And yet, there were
some colleagues

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.810
who are financial
economists did a horse

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.630
race between the 1 over
N rule and the Markowitz

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.920
rule on some derivatives
of the Markowitz rule

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.760
across 28 real-world data sets.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.290
The results?

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.150
1 over N won 80% of the time.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.730
1 over N essentially never
lost investors' money.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.370
The Markowitz and its
derivative equations

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.220
lost investors' money
about 40% of the time.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.240
I hasten to add this is before
accounting for the fees that

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.730
are normally associated for
these more sophisticated

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.350
investment equations.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.740
So, again, we're not
saying complexes--

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.120
we're not saying simple is
always better than the complex.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.260
You don't want to
be-- in the old days,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.830
people used to guess
the weather by red sky

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.180
at night, sailor's delight.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.730
That's a case where you
don't want a simple rule.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.974
You want the Weather Channel.

00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:36.140
There are certainly domains
where more sophisticated

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.760
algorithms and equations
are more appropriate.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.641
But it is not necessarily
inherently the case

00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:43.890
that complex models are
always better than simple ones

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.431
because there are
a bunch of reasons.

00:19:45.431 --> 00:19:48.220
The deepest one is the
bias/variance trade off.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.070
You can over-fit data and if
you don't understand causality,

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.390
you get into trouble.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.900
So what do simple rules do well?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.676
And, again, in the book,
we're super-careful not

00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:59.550
to argue that no matter
what your problem is,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.400
simple rules is a solution
because anybody who does this,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.500
anybody who does this
says here is my book,

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.270
and no matter your problem,
this is the answer is

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.700
one of three things.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.090
They are lying, they are
delusional, or they are both.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.130
There's just no
one-size-fits-all, right?

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.132
So in the book, we talk
through in some detail

00:20:19.132 --> 00:20:20.590
the boundary
conditions under which

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.620
simple rules are a
sensible approach

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.660
and when they're inappropriate.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.540
So what I'd like to do is talk
through five applications where

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.720
simple rules-- where we
have evidence that they work

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.640
consistently well that
are also potentially

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.830
interesting and
relevant to you guys.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.570
The first one is
coordinate on the fly.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.060
So allow a complex
adaptive system

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.090
to self-organize and
coordinate activities

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:50.940
without some kind of
superseding direction.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.670
For centuries it was a
mystery how birds flocked.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.845
And I'll just give
you just a fixed why--

00:20:58.845 --> 00:20:59.720
what the mystery was.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.886
I'll show you a short video.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.040
So phenomenal behavior.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.680
And literally, for
centuries, no one

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.840
had been able to explain how
birds were able to coordinate

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.410
their activity in
flight until along comes

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.140
a guy named Edmund Selous.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.130
Has anybody ever heard
of Edmund Selous?

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.390
A bit of an obscure figure.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.270
But he is a very
credible pioneer

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.685
in the field of ethology.

00:22:07.685 --> 00:22:11.360
Ethology is the field that
studies social animals, insects

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.760
in the wild-- and one of two
or three pioneers of this.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.990
And in 1901, one he decides to
begin a research project to,

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.510
once and for all, explain the
flocking behavior of birds.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.510
He spends not 10
years, not 20 years,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.740
but 30 years in the field
carefully observing,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.180
carefully plotting the behavior,
testing rival alternative

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.720
hypotheses to understand
how birds flock.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.430
In 1931, he makes presentation
to the Royal Academy of Science

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.510
in the UK, of which
he is a member,

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.680
to present this findings.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.380
And people are quite curious.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.546
This is a big deal question.

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.420
Nobody had really
understood the answer.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.810
So Selous gets up and he says,
I've been out in the field

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.526
30 years.

00:22:49.526 --> 00:22:50.775
I've carefully plotted things.

00:22:50.775 --> 00:22:53.024
I've eliminated all the
things we thought it might be.

00:22:53.024 --> 00:22:54.530
There's clearly no
director or kind

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.580
of orchestrating everything.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.413
Nope, it's not that.

00:22:56.413 --> 00:22:59.120
They are not
coordinating by sound.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.704
They're not coordinating
by-- it's not

00:23:00.704 --> 00:23:01.994
a function of prevailing winds.

00:23:01.994 --> 00:23:03.160
He goes through one by one.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.340
Folks are like,
OK, they're sitting

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:04.950
on the edge of their seat.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.570
What is the answer?

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.653
He says, I think by almost
process of elimination,

00:23:07.653 --> 00:23:10.580
I figured out how these birds
coordinate their activities.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.530
He says, what it is-- it's
avian telepathy-- thought

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.160
transference.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.880
So your reaction was
the approximate reaction

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.980
of his colleagues at the
Royal Academy of Science.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.030
It's like chuckle, chuckle,
slight bemusement .

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.420
Maybe Edmund spent a bit
too much time in the field.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.440
There's eccentric, and
then there's eccentric.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.536
And yet the challenge--
and by the way,

00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:32.910
it was a beautifully
titled book.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.830
It may be the favorite title
of a book I've ever seen.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.746
It was called "Thought
Transference (Or What?)

00:23:36.746 --> 00:23:41.830
in Birds."

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.354
And so it was
basically like, I know

00:23:43.354 --> 00:23:45.270
it seems a little flaky,
thought transference,

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.550
I don't know what
else it could be.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:52.470
And essentially for 50 years
or what was the state of play?

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:56.100
Nobody could explain it
until the answer emerged out

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.990
of an unlikely place, unlikely
from the position of biologists

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.460
at least-- a computer
lab here at MIT

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.100
where a guy named Craig Reynolds
who was studying computer

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.810
animation was playing around
and trying to figure out how

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.280
to simulate birds in flight.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.030
And he used an approach,
agent-based modeling,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.820
which I'm sure a lot of you are
very familiar with where he had

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.250
these separate agents,
and he programmed them

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:18.850
with simple rules.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.370
And through some
trial and error,

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.320
he came up with
three simple rules

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.257
that he programmed into
what he called boids.

00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:27.590
And these are basically just
head in the same direction,

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.770
stick close together, and don't
bump into stuff-- very simple.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:36.360
And this is what those rules
produce just to give you

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.900
a sense of how it works.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.250
So what's interesting is
now in social biology,

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.180
simple rules are all
the rage in terms

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:10.460
of modeling complex
behavior in social systems.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.950
Craig went on to win the Academy
Award for his contribution

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.250
to computer animation.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.070
So it was quite--

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.719
AUDIENCE: I think a
SIGGRAPH award too.

00:25:16.719 --> 00:25:17.760
DONALD SULL: What's that?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.020
AUDIENCE: I think
a SIGGRAPH award.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.290
DONALD SULL: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.800
He's been super-influential
with this approach.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.750
And by the way, this
isn't just animal systems.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.070
I assume many of you have
used, at some point, Zipcar.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.770
If you think about Zipcar,
it's a similar thing.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.436
It's not Hertz or Avis where you
pull the car and somebody makes

00:25:34.436 --> 00:25:37.127
sure it's clean-- somebody
makes sure it's full of fuel.

00:25:37.127 --> 00:25:38.710
There's someone
coordinating all this.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.501
You rely on members
who have never met each

00:25:40.501 --> 00:25:43.390
and never will meet each other.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.594
And when Robin Chase and her
co-founders founded Zipcar,

00:25:47.594 --> 00:25:49.010
one of things they
could have done

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.980
to try to allow these
members to self-organize

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.650
is create some
big, thick contract

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.560
that nobody would read
or pay attention to.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.736
What they did instead
was they came up

00:25:57.736 --> 00:25:58.860
with a set of simple rules.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.360
They covered the
most common sources

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.944
of conflict between
users, but were also

00:26:02.944 --> 00:26:04.610
small enough in number
and simple enough

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.151
to remember that people actually
remembered them and followed

00:26:07.151 --> 00:26:09.980
them-- pets in containers,
and fill her up

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.560
that eliminated the vast
majority of conflicts

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.750
between members.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.640
So we see this is a
very interesting domain.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.760
We see in a lot of
virtual communities,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.420
simple rules emerging
to help members

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.220
coordinate their activities.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.220
Another thing, translate
big data into action.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.860
So I sit on the
committee at MIT that's

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.560
proposing a new masters
in data analytics.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.210
And, touch wood, that's
going to come out next year.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:41.440
And it's really our
colleagues there

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.430
know a lot about how to collect
data, how to structure it,

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.414
how to frame a problem,
model a problem,

00:26:46.414 --> 00:26:47.580
how to write the algorithms.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.204
I think one area that we've all
recognized we know a little bit

00:26:50.204 --> 00:26:57.620
less about is how get-- how
you manage the algorithm/human

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.850
hand off-- how you get people to
use the insights from big data.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.300
Obviously, if you
Google, you just

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.675
program it into the computer,
and that's a trivial issue.

00:27:05.675 --> 00:27:07.460
But if you need
human beings to use

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.430
the algorithms and the
insights from data analytics,

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:16.190
that's something we know
a little bit less about.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.392
And so we've seen
this problem before.

00:27:20.392 --> 00:27:22.350
How many of you have seen
"Moneyball," just out

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.570
of idle curiosity?

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.600
So we all think we know the
story of "Moneyball," which

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.380
is the following for both of
you who didn't see the film

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.290
or didn't raise your hand.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.450
Oakland A's lose
three all stars.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.590
They have a budget
of roughly a third

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.180
of the richest
teams in the league.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.229
And the opportunity set of
potential replacements numbers

00:27:43.229 --> 00:27:44.270
in the tens of thousands.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.470
So this is a very
daunting choice problem.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.390
And, historically, this
is they're player budget.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.920
Historically, these
decisions have

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.260
been made by scouts, people who
have to played baseball often,

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.060
have not finished high school
or college, devoted their lives

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.770
to baseball.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:03.280
Question?

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.670
How many of these fellows do you
think have a PhD in statistics?

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.205
It's just not their background.

00:28:09.205 --> 00:28:10.330
They have other advantages.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.450
They know the game.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.241
They've spent a lot of
time seeing players.

00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:14.950
But they know the game.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:19.050
So Billy Beane, as we all know,
brings in the statistician,

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:23.420
who is going to do sophisticated
analysis to identify arbitrage

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.287
opportunities in the
baseball labor market.

00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:26.120
So that's the story.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.370
And I think a lot of
people left the cinema

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.280
thinking this is the future?

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.700
Sabermetrics?

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.839
And these guys are dinosaurs--
destined for extinction.

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.630
I think that was the
impression a lot of us

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.890
left the cinema with.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.280
That's not true.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.850
It turns out the Oakland A's
have actually not decreased

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:44.700
spending on scouts.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.570
They've increased
spending on scouts.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.830
And the way Billy Beane
and the team have framed

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:53.210
the question is not algorithm
versus scouts, which is better?

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.410
It's how can we combine the
benefits of both approaches

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.200
to make better decisions?

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.110
And the way they did it
is described in the book,

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.220
not in the film, is
through simple rules.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.270
So, basically, based on
an analytical approach

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:14.260
of past data, the team
distilled a set of simple rules

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.402
like don't go after
players we can't afford.

00:29:17.402 --> 00:29:19.860
Don't go after players who have
a substance abuse problem--

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.300
no high school players--
that created some boundaries

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.350
based on empirical analysis
within which the scouts could

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.500
exercise their judgment and
utilize the specific knowledge

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.724
they gained through
being on the road.

00:29:35.724 --> 00:29:37.640
The fourth rule is
performance trumps promise.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.430
And, again, I stress this.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.346
It's not an algorithm.

00:29:39.346 --> 00:29:41.510
You didn't punch the data
in, crank the handle,

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.870
and the answer comes out.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.840
Rather, it was a way to
frame the discussion when

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.400
they were looking at players.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:56.740
This is, I think, a really
interesting application

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.210
of simple rules
is getting people

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.530
to use the insights
from data analytics.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.060
There was a study done by a
colleague of ours, Antoinette

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:08.580
Shore, at MIT, which took
1,200 micro entrepreneurs

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.490
in the Dominican Republic and
broke them into three groups.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.720
One group learned accounting
the way it's traditionally

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.746
taught as a complex system
of a large set of rules.

00:30:18.746 --> 00:30:21.120
The second group learned it
as a set of very simple rules

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.090
like have two different
drawers for cash,

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.631
one for your personal account,
one for business account-- one

00:30:25.631 --> 00:30:27.630
you transfer, write an
IOU-- very simple rules.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.250
And the third was a control.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.170
What they found
was-- and then they

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.615
trained the two treatment
groups in the two

00:30:34.615 --> 00:30:35.490
different approaches.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.040
What they found
was the following.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.670
The entrepreneurs who
learned accounting

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.810
as a set of simple rules
had a 30% percent increase

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.920
in revenues, saved more money,
and did better bookkeeping.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.500
What do you think happened to
the entrepreneurs that learned

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.820
accounting the traditional way?

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.530
Indistinguishable from
the control group.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.159
Let's put it that way,
essentially no impact,

00:30:57.159 --> 00:30:58.700
so a very interesting
approach to get

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.970
people to use the benefits
of insights from analytics.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.850
Number three, discipline
innovation-- one

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.380
of the most common pieces
of advice in the innovation

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.750
literature is think
outside the box.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.270
And the underlying
assumption here

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.500
is that constraint is the enemy
of creativity or innovation.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.180
Right?

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.980
And so you want to
break all constraint.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.438
But, really, if
you think about it,

00:31:20.438 --> 00:31:23.930
unconstrained creativity or
innovation is really difficult,

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.125
maybe impossible because
your face, if you

00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:27.500
have no constraints,
you're faced

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.260
with an almost infinite
number of opportunities

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.890
which overwhelms people, one.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.020
Two, you ignore
lessons about what

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.930
works in creative processes
like agile programming, or XP,

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.720
and other things that we
know are more effective.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.620
And three, to the extent
you need different people

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.690
to cooperate, to
innovate, if everybody's

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.606
going in their own
direction because there are

00:31:46.606 --> 00:31:48.410
no constraints, you have chaos.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.260
So unconstrained
innovation-- the assumption

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.000
that constraint is bad for
innovation is not good.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.650
And the advice that results
is pretty poor advice.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.450
So an alternative is
rather than saying

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.160
how do we think outside the box,
to frame the question is how do

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.390
we draw the right
box within which

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.120
we pursue some creative
or innovative activity.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.860
And, again, simple
rules are one approach

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.159
for self-imposing constraints.

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:16.450
And, again, this is something
we had no idea about when

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.116
we started this.

00:32:17.116 --> 00:32:19.060
But this is very common
in the creative arts

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.750
so that authors or
painters or artists

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.500
will draw some set of rules
which will simulate and channel

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.610
their creativity.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:32.860
So Tina Fey, for instance, which
was on "Saturday Night Live"

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.179
observed how Lorne
Michaels produced the show.

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:37.720
From that, she
derived a set of rules

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.624
she when she was
producing "30 Rock."

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.040
And these include
rules like never

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.632
tell a crazy person he's crazy,
which actually, the point

00:32:44.632 --> 00:32:47.090
being that oftentimes the most
creative people are somewhat

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.810
idiosyncratic, and you
need to manage that rather

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:54.370
than-- another one was to
take Harvard lampoon nerds

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.620
and stand up comedians,
combine, and mix.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.630
And, again, the idea being
this more cerebral humor

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.572
will take you into
doctoral dissertations.

00:33:03.572 --> 00:33:05.030
If you just had
stand up comedians,

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.020
they'd make a lot of jokes
about bodily functions.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.730
But if you can combine them
and kind of keep that together,

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.300
you get much better comedy.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.550
So this is in the
creative domains.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.570
It's quite a common approach.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.260
It's also, I think,
we see it being used

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.080
in the corporate world as well.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.300
So Under Armour, I'm
sure, most of you

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.330
are familiar with a pretty
new company-- $3 billion

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.840
in revenues.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.410
The brand is quite strong.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.417
And one of the things
they do is every year

00:33:33.417 --> 00:33:35.750
they have something called a
future show where they have

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.830
an open call to
entrepreneurs and inventors

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.740
to present ideas for
innovations to Under Armour.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.621
And they get thousands
of possible innovations.

00:33:47.621 --> 00:33:48.870
How do they sift through them?

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:49.790
How do they prioritize?

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:50.748
And how do they choose?

00:33:50.748 --> 00:33:52.880
It turns out they
use simple rules.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.540
And just to give
you a sense, again,

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.790
of some of the concreteness.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:00.780
So in 2014, the rules they
used were incorporate apps

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.140
in wearable technology.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.730
That was a big push for them.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.510
Integrate with Map My Fitness,
which they had acquired in 2013

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.020
so that mattered.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.690
When producing data, emphasize
inspiration and insight, not

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.780
just information.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.530
That's not of much
help to people.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.750
And make it social
rather than individual

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:21.730
when you're producing
your product.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.134
So, again, these provided a
framework for the discussion

00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:27.300
for the evaluation that
allowed them to sort through

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.980
very quickly.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.699
A fourth category is
around triaging, allocating

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:35.670
scarce resources.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.760
So the triage is one of the
earliest modern approaches

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.239
that we see of widespread,
simple rule use.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.250
So triage comes from
the domain of medicine.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.389
Actually, the
person who invented

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:49.150
this use of simple
rules, or pioneered

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.750
the use of simple
rules, was a guy

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.400
named Larrey, who was the
surgeon general for Napoleon's

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.780
Grand Army.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.920
And it was to allocate--
the situation problem is

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.600
after a battle, you have a
large stack of injured soldiers.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.929
And you have limited doctors,
medicines, beds, and so forth.

00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:07.720
How do you allocate
those scarce resources?

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.050
And you have to do
it very quickly.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.140
And so the approach
that Larrey pioneered

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.710
was you use a small set of
simple rules, check the pulse,

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.420
check responsiveness,
breath rate,

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.032
to quickly categorized
patients into one

00:35:20.032 --> 00:35:20.990
of a couple categories.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.240
So one category is you're going
to fine no matter what we do.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.365
We give you some aspirin
and put you in the corner.

00:35:25.365 --> 00:35:28.341
The second categories
is, alas, there's

00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:29.590
nothing we can do to save you.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.300
We give you some
stronger painkiller,

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.983
and put you in the corner, which
parenthetically if you're ever

00:35:32.983 --> 00:35:34.580
in the emergency room,
they give you some pills,

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.740
and put you in the corner,
it could be good news.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.780
It could be very bad news.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.310
And then the third
category is those people

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.250
who can be saved, but
only with intervention.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.860
And based on this quick
assessment with simple rules,

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.225
they are the ones who
receive the resources.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:58.170
This is a very useful approach
to allocating scarce resources.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.864
I work now with the
Gates Foundation.

00:35:59.864 --> 00:36:01.530
And people think of
the Gates Foundation

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.370
as they have a lot of money.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.730
The Gates Foundation
gives more in a year

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:10.040
than the next hop-- than
the next 10 largest US

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.510
philanthropies combined.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.093
So they have a large endowment,
and they do give lot of money.

00:36:14.093 --> 00:36:16.410
But when you compare it to
the scope of their ambition,

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.790
it's actually pretty a
small amount of money.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.640
So in the global
health bit, which

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.080
is just one of three major
divisions in the Gates

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.100
Foundation, their
ambition is to eradicate

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.320
childhood mortality in poor
countries around the world.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.130
That's an audacious goal.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:36.220
And against that goal, the
resources they bring to bear

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.070
are pretty scarce.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.500
So they use a set
of simple rules

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.860
to guide-- to provide a
framework for these decisions.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.770
So one is that they look
at the disability adjusted

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.070
life years, which basically
says for every disease

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.800
when do patients
typically contract it,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.800
and how many years of
life do they lose to death

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.557
or disability, and
aggregate those up,

00:36:54.557 --> 00:36:56.890
which gives-- it's a crude
proxy, but a useful mechanism

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.130
for comparing across diseases.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:02.290
They only focus on poor-- the
poorest countries in the world.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.900
Rich country diseases
like childhood obesity,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.310
for instance, is not
their focus-- very focused

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.001
on technology rather than
structural or institutional

00:37:10.001 --> 00:37:10.500
changes.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.712
So vaccines are
a great approach.

00:37:12.712 --> 00:37:14.670
And if somebody else is
working on the problem,

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.211
they typically will
let them do that.

00:37:16.211 --> 00:37:17.300
They'll focus in the gap.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.270
So they use these
simple rules to allocate

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.146
their scarce resource.

00:37:21.146 --> 00:37:22.270
And these are hard choices.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.811
Bear in mind, for
what they're doing,

00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:26.010
literally any disease
category that they

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.920
choose to deprioritize,
children die by the nation.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.070
These are very hard decisions
that they're faced with,

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:35.220
and these rules can help
to make those decisions.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.580
And then the final
category of applications

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.710
is embed strategy
where it matters most.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.690
So Neil and I both
teach strategy at MIT.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.360
A lot of companies
have a strategy,

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.260
and it's sitting on a
shelf gathering dust.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.405
That's not a strategy.

00:37:49.405 --> 00:37:50.280
That's a book report.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.000
The question in a
lot of organizations

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.620
is how do you embed the
insights of a strategy, which

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.153
is essentially a
hypothesis about a

00:37:56.153 --> 00:37:57.569
how a firm will
create and capture

00:37:57.569 --> 00:38:00.050
economic value in the decisions
that matter most on a day

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.670
to day basis in
the organization.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.760
And, again, one mechanism,
not the only mechanism,

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.685
but one mechanism
is simple rules.

00:38:05.685 --> 00:38:08.790
And I'll give you
a quick example.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.800
Are you folks familiar with 3G?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.280
The private equity firm?

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:17.160
They've bought Heinz,
Kraft, InBev, Burger

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.110
King, Tim Hortons.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.200
They are very active, very
successful private equity firm.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.560
And the head of--
the chairman of 3G

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.991
is a guy named Alex Behring.

00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:26.990
Shortly after he graduated
from business school,

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.430
one of his first
jobs was to take over

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.400
a newly privatized leg of
the Brazilian freight railway

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.360
system.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.110
And to say it was a mess does
a disservice to the term mess.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.820
It was a disaster.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.600
Basically, crops were
rotting in the field

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.016
because they had
lack of capacity.

00:38:42.016 --> 00:38:44.559
Soybeans were
rotting in the field.

00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:46.600
20% of the bridges were
on the verge of collapse.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.670
They were literally
using steam engines.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.190
They had engines that you
put wood in, light the wood.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.050
This is in the mid 1990s.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.510
They had a huge medical
expense because there

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.210
were poisonous snakes in the
grass around the yards that

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:01.710
kept biting the employees.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.330
So it was really
a tough situation.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.810
And you can imagine somebody--
a young guy coming in--

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.070
and he's got to deal
with all these problems.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.650
It could be a
little overwhelming.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.742
So what Alex did was
he used simple rules.

00:39:14.742 --> 00:39:16.200
And I'll just walk
you through this

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.940
very quickly, the
steps, because these

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.430
are the steps we
argue are or more

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.400
generally helpful when you're
developing simple rules

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.300
to embed strategy.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.410
So the first thing is
you get some clarity

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:25.940
on what will move the needle.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.474
In strategy, our
focus is on how you

00:39:28.474 --> 00:39:30.640
increase customers' willingness
to pay or cut costs.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.160
And there are a
million-- and you

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.310
want to maximize the
gap between those two.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:35.810
There are literally
countless things

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:37.840
you can do that make
the needles twitch,

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.564
but in most
organizations, relatively

00:39:39.564 --> 00:39:41.230
few actions that will
lead to a material

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.040
increase and willingness to
pay-- material decrease in cost

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.761
and be sustained over time.

00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.260
So the first step
is getting clarity

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.360
on what those things will be.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.570
And, in their case, it
doesn't have to be tricky.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.240
It was, for instance, rather
than pursuing new business,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.700
increasing revenues
with existing customers

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.720
or cutting costs.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.030
These were not-- this
wasn't tricky stuff.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.614
The second step then,
having clarified

00:40:02.614 --> 00:40:04.613
what will move the needles
for your organization

00:40:04.613 --> 00:40:06.110
is to identify a
bottleneck, which

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:10.220
we define as a specific
activity or decision that

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.999
will significantly impact your
ability to move the needles.

00:40:12.999 --> 00:40:14.540
And in most
organizations, there will

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.373
be many candidates for
this, but it actually

00:40:16.373 --> 00:40:19.620
is a pretty straightforward
process or pretty quick process

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.840
to focus in on one.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.270
In that case, it
was pretty easy.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.920
They had about $200
million worth of requests

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.220
for a proposal because of
the systemic underinvestment

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.110
in the railway.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.100
And they only had about
$15 million in cash.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.800
So that was a clear bottleneck.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.845
And then you develop
the simple rules.

00:40:34.845 --> 00:40:36.470
And, again, these
weren't tricky rules.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.570
It was around minimizing
upfront expenditure,

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.492
removing obstacles
to growing revenues

00:40:40.492 --> 00:40:41.450
with current customers.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.364
So if you came in
with the proposal,

00:40:43.364 --> 00:40:44.780
one of the first
questions you get

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.980
is how will this help us to
keep the soybeans from rotting

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.890
on the fields?

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:50.200
And if you didn't have
an answer to that,

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.050
the odds were not high
that you'd get funding.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.633
If you had an answer
to that, the odds

00:40:53.633 --> 00:40:55.370
were pretty high
you'd get funding.

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:58.200
And so they'd develop and
test the simple rules.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.590
And what's interesting--
one of the things that's

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:02.840
interesting about this is
as organizations get larger,

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.140
and I guess Google these days
is a pretty large organization,

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.470
it's hard for people
throughout the organization

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:10.220
to understand really
what the strategy is.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.011
It's easier when it's
a small organization.

00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:13.960
People are geographically
co-located.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.930
This mechanism not only helps
you to make better decisions

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:21.025
quickly, but also helps for
people on the front line

00:41:21.025 --> 00:41:22.650
to understand what
you're trying to do.

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:25.449
So an interesting little
anecdote out of this.

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:26.990
So they're going
around communicating

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.989
the strategy, the bottleneck
they're focusing in

00:41:28.989 --> 00:41:30.720
on the rules to employees.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:34.197
And one of the employees-- he
works basically in the gasoline

00:41:34.197 --> 00:41:36.280
station, in the petrol
station, filling the trains

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.080
when they pull in.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:37.640
He raised his hand.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.098
He says, listen,
what you're saying

00:41:39.098 --> 00:41:41.240
is you don't want the
crops rotting on the field?

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.050
They're like, yep, that's right.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.549
He said, you want
us to do it cheap?

00:41:43.549 --> 00:41:45.500
He said, yeah, that's
what we're trying to do.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.260
And he says, if that's
what we're doing,

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.840
I never really knew that's
what we're trying to do.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.540
But I've got an idea.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.570
He said, look, it takes a
lot of time for these trains

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:52.460
to pull in and get fuel.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.740
They have to come
off the tracks.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:54.780
They often have to wait.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:55.730
They have to wait their turn.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.490
Then they go out.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:58.740
We lose a lot of
time that we could be

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.347
moving freight because of this.

00:42:00.347 --> 00:42:01.930
He said, what about
if we just doubled

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.470
the size of the fuel tank?

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:06.160
That one idea, one
suggestion, that

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.040
only emerged because
for the first time,

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.460
this employee understood
what they were trying to do,

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.210
saved them something
like 1% of EBITDA

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.170
in the first year,
which is a lot of money

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.630
for a business like that.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.100
So it can have
some real benefits.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.450
And we see consistently
that organizations

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:27.231
that do this-- they can get
pretty good results pretty

00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:27.730
quickly.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.030
In the ALL case they
basically tripled their EBITDA

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.470
in the span of
about three years.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.670
There were obviously other
things they were doing.

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.380
But these simple
rules played a role.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.930
And I'll just conclude by
noting the six types of rules,

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.900
and then I'll shut up
and open it up to Q&amp;A.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.640
So one of the things that was
interesting to us, we've again,

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.470
studied simple rules across
many different domains,

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.130
many different sets
of simple rules.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.713
One of the things
that was interesting

00:42:50.713 --> 00:42:53.080
is out of that emerged
a set of six categories

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.760
that the rules fall
into, and I'll just

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.640
introduce those to you.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.130
So the first three are--
we kind of lumped together

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.670
as decision rules.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.579
So one is boundary rules--
what's inside and outside.

00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:05.370
So think of the Billy
Beane, no high school

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:08.050
players, no players with
salaries we can't pay.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.810
Stay outside the boundaries,
and then you exercise judgment

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:12.370
within those boundaries.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.370
The second set of rules
are around prioritizing

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.270
alternatives, allocating
scarce resources

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:21.285
to competing uses like the
Gates Foundation rules.

00:43:21.285 --> 00:43:22.910
A third set of rules
is stopping rules.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.150
So it turns out it is
very well documented

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.370
that individuals,
teams, organizations,

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.740
have a tendency to persist
in lines of activity

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.810
beyond the optimal point.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.770
They want to save face.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.000
There is some cost fallacy.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.840
There are a variety of social
and psychological factors

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.700
that lead to that tendency.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.980
And we see simple rules
often used, for instance,

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.500
in investment as
to rules to when

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.220
you kill an investment there.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.112
It's a common application.

00:43:45.112 --> 00:43:47.070
And then the bottom three
are a little bit less

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.930
about what to do and
about how to do it.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.480
So the how-to rules--
those provide some guidance

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.770
on a process like
Tina Fey's producing

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:58.580
"30 Rock" or the simple
rules of bouncing.

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.750
Timing rules link the
timing of an activity

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:05.560
to typically external events.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:09.300
So there's a large
Brazilian conglomerate.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.790
And it has been
extremely successful

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.060
over the past 100 years.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.340
And they have a set of
rules that they use.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.260
They are very asset-
intensive businesses

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.619
that they use to buy and
sell their businesses.

00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:21.160
And most of the rules are around
boundary and prioritization.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.510
But I asked them when
I was down there,

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:23.635
do you have any time rules?

00:44:23.635 --> 00:44:25.730
And they said sheepishly
they look at each other

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.590
and should we tell him?

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:27.464
Yeah, we'll tell him.

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:30.390
Yeah, we have a timing rule that
has worked pretty well for us.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.830
And I said, what's that?

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:32.996
They said, well, we buy
when the gringos are selling

00:44:32.996 --> 00:44:34.700
and sell when the
gringos are buying.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.200
And it turns out
it's actually, when

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.330
you think about it,
a pretty good role

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.210
because when the Europeans
and the North Americans

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.730
are coming down in hoards,
they are throwing money

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.480
at bad assets, and
when they're panicking,

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.710
they're often leaving
good assets in their wake.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:46.680
And then the final
category is coordination

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.170
like the Zipcar rules
or the bird rules

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.000
that we talked about.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.587
OK, so I'll pause
it there and see

00:44:52.587 --> 00:44:54.670
if there are any questions
or comments or anything

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:55.586
you'd like to discuss.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:44:59.440
Yeah?

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.190
Please.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.128
AUDIENCE: You had a picture
of the Google founders.

00:45:03.128 --> 00:45:04.460
You kind of quickly skipped it.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:07.000
DONALD SULL: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.390
I skipped over it only
because I realized you

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.720
guys, of all people,
would note this.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.636
This is actually--
the reason is these

00:45:17.636 --> 00:45:19.260
are the rules used
by an incubator that

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.410
did not incubate Google.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.990
So I just thought it was an
inappropriate combination

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:28.360
of picture and rules.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.090
This is a firm
called Onset Venture.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.675
So yeah, that was
the rationale for it.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.525
Yeah, please?

00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:39.175
AUDIENCE: Do you have simple
rules for a software project?

00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:40.050
DONALD SULL: I don't.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.760
But it would certainly be a
domain that would lend itself

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.320
to the approach.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.449
If it would be
helpful, I can talk

00:45:47.449 --> 00:45:49.490
through just a little bit
other kinds of projects

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.780
that we've seen that
might be analogous.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.970
So the basic notion
is to, first of all,

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:57.720
get clarity on what
will move the needles.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.761
And a lot of times that's
what we see, especially

00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:02.490
in large, complex organizations
where it requires where there

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.340
are interdependencies
between different divisions,

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.090
the engineering and
finance and marketing,

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.780
whatever it is,
that a lot of times

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.860
there is not a shared
set of objectives.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.737
So getting clarity on who's
involved, again, that clear.

00:46:15.737 --> 00:46:17.820
Then the second thing is
identifying a bottleneck.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.340
There's a lot of software
programming, new product

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.760
development, talent management.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:28.010
These are broad processes
composed of many steps.

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:30.210
And if you try to come
up with simple rules that

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:33.640
encompass all those steps,
they become too broad.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:38.010
So it's really helpful to
identify specific activity

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.676
within that chain of events
to focus in on the rules.

00:46:41.676 --> 00:46:43.800
And then the other thing,
which I think for Google,

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.970
would be so obvious.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:48.970
But one is data trumps opinion.

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:50.940
So a lot of times people--
I have an opinion,

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.800
I have an opinion.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.300
No.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.070
We're ruthless about testing.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.610
How do you know if rules
work unless you have clarity

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.490
and what your dependent variable
is, you have some comparison

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.660
state beforehand or
ideally a control,

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.070
and then you do
the intervention,

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:05.990
and you measure it?

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.740
So data trumps opinion.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.970
And you can look at historical
data, comparative case study,

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:13.840
large sample data, also
that the users make

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.240
the rules, and especially
in complex processes

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.840
in organizations where multiple
units need to coordinate

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.890
for the activity to work well.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.760
That would entail, not
just the engineers,

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.220
but if it's marketing or quality
control, whoever it would be,

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.720
to get them involved
in the process as well.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.380
So is that helpful?

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.590
DONALD SULL: Yeah?

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:35.695
Please.

00:47:35.695 --> 00:47:38.361
AUDIENCE: There's the comparison
of simple rules versus no rules

00:47:38.361 --> 00:47:39.840
or complex rules.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.798
Did you run across cases
where an organization

00:47:42.798 --> 00:47:45.509
tested one set of simple
rules against another set

00:47:45.509 --> 00:47:46.742
of simple rules?

00:47:46.742 --> 00:47:48.332
Or how did they
determine whether they

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:49.207
have the right rules?

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.430
DONALD SULL: Yes, it's
a very small sample.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.970
And, actually, one of things
Neil and I are very keen to do

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:59.200
is we're going to start
a course on A/B testing

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.410
of organizational interventions
at MIT because that's exactly

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.410
the right question.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:07.320
So we have had-- so what I
did basically for four years

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.736
was work with an organization
called the Young Presidents'

00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:12.280
Organization, which has
founders or CEOs who

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.260
have run a materially
sized organization

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.620
before the age of 40.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:19.156
And we'd have cohorts
of 10 to 12 come in,

00:48:19.156 --> 00:48:20.780
and we'd do a simple
rules intervention

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.905
and then measure the impact
of those interventions.

00:48:22.905 --> 00:48:25.740
And there were a couple of
cases where people actually

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.950
tried a different set of rules.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.800
So I'll just give you
one concrete example.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.720
There's a company
called Frontier Dental.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.240
They make dental implants.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.656
And the problem
they have, there's

00:48:34.656 --> 00:48:36.510
about 200,000 dentists
in North America.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:37.950
They had a sales force of 12.

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:39.574
And it typically
would take 200 calls

00:48:39.574 --> 00:48:41.740
before you'd make a sale
because dentists make money

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.490
with patients in chairs,
not talking to sales people.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.680
So the bottleneck
they focused in on

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:53.720
was the prioritization of
the dentist to focus in on.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.380
And what they did was they
took a subset of their database

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:01.617
and divided it into three
with some dentists who

00:49:01.617 --> 00:49:03.200
were good customers,
some not so good,

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.074
and a bunch in the
middle, and assigned those

00:49:05.074 --> 00:49:07.760
to three separate teams
of users, each of whom

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.739
based independently,
inferred a set of rules,

00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:12.530
then they tested those
rules, and then they

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.550
converged on what worked best.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.430
But yeah, what it requires--
what's interesting

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.990
is it requires a commitment
to the scientific method

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.220
on the part of companies.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.680
I find it shocking
personally that people

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.570
try all sorts of
stuff in organizations

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:30.785
and never once do a trial, never
once say is it going to work?

00:49:30.785 --> 00:49:31.910
No, let's just roll it out.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.410
It seems insane when
you think about it.

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:36.820
And, yet, we found in
talking to companies

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.720
not every company
is keen on the idea

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.410
of-- what the response is, oh,
we're sure it's going to work.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:42.140
Let's give it to everybody.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.700
Why would we have
a control group?

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.320
No, you're missing the point.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.110
So it's exactly the right
idea, but sometimes hard to get

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.320
organizations to buy into it.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.105
Yeah, please?

00:49:52.105 --> 00:49:54.744
AUDIENCE: How about
exceptions to the rules?

00:49:54.744 --> 00:49:56.358
I was intrigued by
the A's example.

00:49:56.358 --> 00:49:57.149
I'm a baseball fan.

00:49:57.149 --> 00:50:00.030
But the draft was last week,
and they took a few high school

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.530
guys.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:04.910
DONALD SULL: Yeah, sure,
so I would code that,

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:07.970
in that specific case, less
about exceptions to rules,

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.360
and more about rules evolving.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.320
So we talk about exactly
this in the book.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.720
So if you're in a
non-competitive situation,

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.220
your rules might stay stable
for a long period of time.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.070
The Gates Foundation
doesn't have

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:23.200
competitors trying to thwart
them in curing these diseases.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.220
The A's do.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.070
You have people
poaching their players

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.910
and trying to figure out
what their rules are.

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:34.410
And so in those domains where
people will come in and emulate

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:35.970
your rules and
therefore decrease,

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:39.010
in that case, the
arbitrage opportunities,

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.740
they were forced to evolve
their rules over time.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.720
So that was more of a case
of evolution than exception.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.910
By and large if
you've done a good job

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:51.410
of basing the rules on
data and testing them

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:55.050
before you roll them
out and striking

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:59.410
the right balance of
guidance and discretion,

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.910
you would want the exceptions
to be pretty minimal, which

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:03.570
by the way, it's so important
to have the users make

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.640
the rules because they
are the ones best situated

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.740
to assess whether you've struck
the right balance of guidance

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.570
and discretion.

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:11.070
Yeah?

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:11.922
Please.

00:51:11.922 --> 00:51:13.422
AUDIENCE: Presumably
in your studies

00:51:13.422 --> 00:51:16.300
you've come across cases where
simple rules would be useful.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.896
But they're not
there [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:19.896 --> 00:51:23.003
Do you find that it's
more often a lack of rules

00:51:23.003 --> 00:51:24.680
or overly complicated rules?

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.300
DONALD SULL: It totally depends
on the size the organization.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.510
So, for start ups,
what we typically find

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:32.550
is that it will be a lack
of rules, by and large.

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:34.490
For large, complex
organizations over time,

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:39.220
they accrue huge rule sets
through a cumulative process.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:43.220
So the way we think
about this is imagine

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.764
a spectrum of absolutely no
constraint, just pure chaos,

00:51:47.764 --> 00:51:49.930
everybody does what they
want, to perfect constraint

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:53.540
where every possible contingency
is identified ex ante,

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.930
and you specify
precisely what to do.

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:57.820
And so what we
find, big companies

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.090
are moving from this way
to that direction and start

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:01.339
ups are moving that direction.

00:52:01.339 --> 00:52:04.320
And our argument is that there
is a privilege spot, or a very

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.390
interesting spot, on this
spectrum where you introduce

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:13.990
a threshold level of structure
that avoids the cost of chaos

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:16.200
without imposing a lot
of the cost of rigidity

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.440
that accrue as you go
farther on the spectrum.

00:52:21.182 --> 00:52:21.682
Yeah?

00:52:21.682 --> 00:52:22.182
Please.

00:52:22.182 --> 00:52:24.912
AUDIENCE: So it seems like
often simple rules come

00:52:24.912 --> 00:52:27.646
in the domain of organizations.

00:52:27.646 --> 00:52:31.622
But then there is the personal.

00:52:31.622 --> 00:52:35.434
Like, for example, parenting.

00:52:35.434 --> 00:52:39.112
And it seems that folks
out there, they [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:39.112 --> 00:52:41.090
simple rules for parents.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:43.433
But over time you would
think that wouldn't

00:52:43.433 --> 00:52:45.740
be simple rules be established?

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.811
Like there is one
way for parenting.

00:52:48.811 --> 00:52:50.719
And these are the simple
rules for parenting.

00:52:50.719 --> 00:52:54.011
Why is that not the case?

00:52:54.011 --> 00:52:55.760
DONALD SULL: So it's
a fantastic question.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.470
We have a point of view on this.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.990
Our big argument
is that there is--

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:06.410
rules are context-specific.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.010
They are specific
to, in that case,

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:09.890
the family, the
individual parents,

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:11.530
the culture in which
you are embedded,

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:13.090
the time, all those things.

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:17.610
So we are really not big
fans of universal rules

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:18.660
you take off the shelf.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.201
Here are the three
rules of parenting

00:53:20.201 --> 00:53:21.760
or five rules of
parenting it's not

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.230
to say they are good
sources of inspiration.

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:24.597
And they're not well-intended.

00:53:24.597 --> 00:53:26.180
I'm sure they're
both of those things.

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.471
But the argument, we feel
very passionately about this,

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:31.240
is you need to develop the
rules that work for you.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.990
And we actually have
a chapter in the book

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:35.610
called "Getting Personal,"
which talks about this process.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.901
And if it's helpful, I'll
just give you a quick example

00:53:37.901 --> 00:53:38.720
to illustrate.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.010
So in the middle of
writing this thing,

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.180
it was the depth of
the Boston winter,

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.700
and I just, the Michelin Man
came and delivered a tire

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.990
to my stomach.

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:51.640
And simultaneously, I just
ordered a bunch of shirts,

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.925
and the shirts didn't fit, and
I was super-frustrated by this.

00:53:54.925 --> 00:53:57.300
And I called the guy, I said,
can I send the shirts back?

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.620
He said, no, you can't
send the shirts back.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:00.010
All right, I'm going
to lose 15 pounds.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:02.301
This was my goal so I could
fit in these bloody shirts.

00:54:02.301 --> 00:54:05.180
And so there are no end of
books out there, diet books.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:07.040
These are your five rules.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.761
But our approach is to
say, no, first of all,

00:54:09.761 --> 00:54:11.260
develop the rules
are right for you.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.180
So first of all, what will
move the needle for you.

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.460
It was pretty
straightforward in my case.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.751
I wanted to lose the 15 pounds.

00:54:15.751 --> 00:54:17.887
The second point is
identify a bottleneck.

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:19.470
And the more the
specific, the better.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:21.070
So what I did for
a week was I got

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:22.360
one of these fitness trackers.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.327
I just tracked what
I ate, and exercised.

00:54:25.327 --> 00:54:27.160
And what I discovered
very interestingly was

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.201
during the day it was OK.

00:54:28.201 --> 00:54:29.120
I ate OK.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.305
After dinner, all
hell broke loose.

00:54:31.305 --> 00:54:33.180
It was like, oh, the
Merlot, and then there's

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.590
the Ben and Jerry's, and then
how about a Snickers bar?

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:36.450
That sounds great.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:39.070
And so the bottleneck,
in that case,

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:40.890
was after-dinner
snacking, which is good

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:42.390
because I didn't
have to then deploy

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.055
limited willpower across
all food decisions

00:54:45.055 --> 00:54:46.180
over the course of the day.

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.970
It was more narrow.

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.070
And the third thing
is develop rules that

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.532
worked in my specific context.

00:54:51.532 --> 00:54:53.490
And these aren't-- you
don't just make them up.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:54.660
I looked at the research.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.880
And for instance, there's a guy
named Brian Wansink at Cornell,

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.380
who has done a lot of really
neat work about portion control

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.200
as the key driver
of caloric intake.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.110
So I had a rule like eat
chips out of a bowl, not a bag

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:07.930
because you frame how
much you should eat based

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:09.570
on the size of the container.

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.735
Another was around
no stockpiling.

00:55:11.735 --> 00:55:13.110
So if you have a
box of Snickers,

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.550
you eat a box a Snickers.

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.120
If you have only one Snicker,
you can only eat one Snicker.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.784
And then, again,
of course, testing.

00:55:18.784 --> 00:55:20.700
And in this case, it's
pretty straightforward.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:25.260
You test can you-- what
happens with change in weight?

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.364
So we would argue,
and we actually

00:55:27.364 --> 00:55:28.780
talk about some
cases in the book,

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.490
of in a family domain, how
you would develop rules

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:33.360
that are right for your family.

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.110
And, by the way,
it worked for me.

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.193
This is one of the shirts.

00:55:35.193 --> 00:55:36.970
So I'm really happy.

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:39.640
It was like a good use of
simple rules for me at least.

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:43.720
Great.

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.740
OK, so I apologize.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.200
I think we've run out of time.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.156
But I hope it was of
some interest to you all.

00:55:49.156 --> 00:55:51.530
And thanks for the opportunity
to come and chat with you.

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:52.363
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:52.363 --> 00:55:54.580
