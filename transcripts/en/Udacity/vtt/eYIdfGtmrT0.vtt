00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.460
Now it's time to dive in and

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.250
start exploring how to
create our own watch faces.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.950
The best way to start is to look at
some of the existing samples and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.240
see how they work.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.120
So go to File, Import Sample,
and type in Watchface.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.310
You can create this with
all the default values.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.870
If you expand the Wearable Project,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.970
you'll see there are many
services defined here.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.880
The sample actually includes
more than one watch face.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.550
And we'll see how their defined
shortly and what they do.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.395
So now, you should build and install
the application side to the phone.

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:30.300
Include the green play button.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.220
And then also, build and
install the wearable side as well.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.950
Note that you won't be able
to select a default activity

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.860
because neither of these contain one.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.760
So let's run this and
see what it looks like now on the watch.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.560
On the watch we can select
a watch face by pressing and

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.220
holding on the current watch face.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.600
You'll then see a selector appear.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.980
If you scroll to the right,
you'll see sample analog.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.060
Select that.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.315
You'll see it shows the time with
hands and to ticking seconds.

00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:57.285
Now let's select sample sweep.

00:00:57.285 --> 00:00:59.825
This one is very similar
to the sample analog

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:03.395
except you'll notice the second
hand has a smooth sweeping motion.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:07.695
This refreshes much faster than once per
second to achieve this smooth motion.

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:09.905
Now let's select sample card balance.

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:13.045
This one's not meant to be used as a
watch face, but it's meant to be used to

00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:16.290
help you visualize
the dimensions of the beat card.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990
Now let's select sample tilt.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.950
This is implemented using Open GL and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.600
shows how you can apply arbitrary
3D rotations to a watch face.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.380
Now let's select sample calendar.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.500
This is interesting because it actually
looks at the calendar on your phone and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.610
determines how many meetings
you have coming up and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.130
presents this in a watch face.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.081
So this is an example of how you
can implement awareness about your

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:36.860
users schedule as part of a watch face.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.060
Let's go to sample digital.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.870
You'll notice this one has
a little gear icon underneath.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.550
This allows you to actually configure
the watch face locally from an activity.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.850
So let's select a red background.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.880
Now, interestingly,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.500
we can also go to the phone and
start up the Android Wear companion app.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.610
You'll see that Sample Digital
is selected here, too,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.760
and there's also a little gear icon.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.840
You can click on that and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.820
there are more configuration
options available for the watch.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.240
You'll see how the red background that
we selected earlier is shown here.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.700
This sample actually uses the data API
to synchronize the selections between

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.130
the phone and the wearable.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.920
So you can make changes on either side
like adjusting the text color here or

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.650
the background here.
