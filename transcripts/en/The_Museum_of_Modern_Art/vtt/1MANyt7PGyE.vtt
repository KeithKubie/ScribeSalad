00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.670
I think the reason why the story of Frankenstein
is so ubiquitous across cinema is because

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.820
it's so basically frightening.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.910
The Hammer Films, their horror films really
indulge in the gothic.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.580
It’s a castle.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.300
It's darkness.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.140
It's a stormy night.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.890
This mournful music.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.320
There's a heightened romanticism.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.180
Asking yourselves who is the real monster
is a huge part of what these films are about.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.080
Who is responsible for creating life?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.760
Not only the mechanics of the creation of
life, but the idea of this higher power.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.980
My name is Anne Morra.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.600
I'm a film curator at the
Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.929
And today, we're going to look at Frankenstein
in the movies and pay special attention to

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.200
"The Hammer Horror Series."

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.220
So Hammer Films began in 1935.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.920
And like many British film companies, they
were really interested in this idea of realism

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.200
and reflection of daily life in the
films that they were making.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.360
And it really wasn't until the 1950s when
they moved their operation to a place called

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.040
Bray Studios, and in this gothic house and
that's when they really began to think

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.800
"How are we going to make money?

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.640
Aha, teenagers go to the movies.”

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.479
The Hammer studios begins their 1950s
assault on the cinema with sci-fi films.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.600
It's not till 1957 when they create their
first Frankenstein movie, "The Curse of Frankenstein."

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.460
Mary Shelly was the author of
“Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus.”

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.480
Her concept of what the monster looked like
was a combination of Greek statuary, this

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.940
idea of the outrageous primitive man.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.240
And if you look at the 1910 version
of Frankenstein, you get that.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.350
But Mary Shelley did not necessarily
conjure the mechanical man.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.800
He was definitely more human.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.780
You know, there were no electrodes
and things like that coming out of his neck.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.890
The Hammer monster really
has a different visage in each film.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.500
Sometimes you have a monster
that looks like a Sasquatch.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.900
Sometimes you have a monster that is cobbled
together of other bodies and then really glued

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.540
together with cement.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.720
They're very strange-looking creatures.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.290
But there's something weirdly
human about them.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.600
They're not so much a machine.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.220
They're not so hard-edged.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.910
They're much more anatomical.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.800
They're much more flesh-like.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.560
And I think that, in a way, that's what makes
the monster much more sympathetic.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.990
In the Hammer films, it doesn’t
matter what the monster looks like.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.460
Often the monster doesn’t even play a
significant role until the last portion of the film.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.900
They’re asking you to think more deeply
about the doctor than they are asking you

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.920
to be scared of the monster – which isn’t
to say the monster isn’t scary.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.340
What the Hammer films do in terms of contributing
to our broad view of Frankenstein is create

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.510
this conflicted Frankenstein who is so hell-bent
on his experiments because he knows what's

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.140
right, although he knows around him that his
colleagues believe what he's doing is wrong.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.720
The church certainly doesn't
want him to do what he's doing.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.600
But he's going to go ahead and
do these experiments anyhow.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.500
Unlike the doctor in the 1931 Universal film,
who was a bit hysterical, Peter Cushing’s

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.940
doctor is calm, collected,
methodical, and very arrogant.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.620
We see this doctor, he's a human being, but
he may be more monstrous than the monster.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.000
And I think that's something that the Hammer
films really discuss in this psychological way.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.000
The doctor is a murderer.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.820
Essentially, he is an anti-hero.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.840
If he needs a pair of legs, he's going to
get those pair of legs, and he's not really

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.880
too picky about where they come from.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.379
The evil is that he just has no self-awareness.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.640
I don't think that the Hammer films today
would be considered particularly gory.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:14.580
But at the time at mid-century, following
a debilitating war and the horrors that people

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:22.729
experienced, seeing a glass jar filled with
eyeballs in formaldehyde would be incredibly

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.220
gory and gruesome.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.990
They did receive an X rating, and
that sort of propelled them forward.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.800
People wanted to see those films.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.499
There are so many contemporary movies that
deal with that idea of the reanimation of

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.229
the dead, the reuse of the body.

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.969
All of these kinds of machine made men I think
are all pulled out from the Frankenstein story.

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:48.629
Do people actually die?

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.300
Is there a finite sense of existence?

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.940
Frankenstein is a classic, and it
will continue to be part of cinema.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.460
So those are my thoughts
on Frankenstein in film history.

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:04.800
What do you think?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.800
Is the doctor more monstrous than the creature?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.180
And amongst the Frankenstein
films, which are your favorites?

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.229
