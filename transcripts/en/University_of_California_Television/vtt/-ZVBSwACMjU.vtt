We are the paradoxical ape; bipedal,
naked, large brain. Long the master of

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:40.290
fire, tools and language, but still trying
to understand ourselves. Aware that death

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:50.772
is inevitable yet filled with optimism. We
grow up slowly. We hand down knowledge. We

00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:58.960
empathize and deceive. We shape the future
from our shared understanding of the past.

CARTA brings together experts from diverse
disciplines to exchange insights on who we

- [Jeff] So I study ice cores and I'm just
an armchair admirer of the people who

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.170
study evolution of humans. So I'm very
pleased to be invited here and I hope I

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.780
can contribute something. My outline is
that first I'll take a little sort of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.160
digression away from the topic of human
evolution just to give you some background

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.730
on what's happening right now and how, for
example, do we know that humans are

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.260
causing the current climate change.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.070
Then I'll talk about the observations made
by many other people, not myself, that

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.980
agriculture seems to have originated
precisely when we had the most recent of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.970
these abrupt climate change events 11.7
thousand years ago. Some people call it

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.570
the end of the Younger Dryas period and
it's really quite a stunning coincidence

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.930
and it probably isn't a coincidence. Many
people now believe that the warming and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.640
the wetting allowed humans to switch from
a hunting and gathering mode of existence

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.510
to an agricultural mode of existence.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.220
Then I'll go on to talk about abrupt
climate change itself and what causes it.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.810
To tell you the punch-line which is that
we think it's the switching on and off of

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.190
ocean circulation. I'll wrap up with the
question will it happen again in the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.250
future?

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.110
So my little digression, the smoking gun
of human causation. I love this diagram

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.170
and you don't see it in the media very
often. I think it's a shame that we don't

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.840
because it really is a very powerful form
of evidence. If someone asks you if you

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.530
believe in global warming you should say
no because it's not a matter of belief

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.610
it's a matter of evidence.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.800
This is from the ice cores. I'm proud to
say this is my field of ice core science.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.430
We know from the bubbles trapped in ice
core that CO2 in the atmosphere was at

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.550
about 280 parts per million for most of
the last 1,000 years. Then right around

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:49.800
the time of major coal burning around 1850
it started to creep up. Here we are today

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.320
at 400 parts per million and at the same
time, this rare isotope of carbon that

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:04.400
Peter deMenocal introduced to you, Carbon
13 in the atmospheric CO2 changed from a

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.070
very stable value.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.300
Don't worry about these units
and it started

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.450
taking a nose dive. That's the signature
of fossil fuel burning. If the CO2 was

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.140
coming from the ocean, which is the major
natural source of CO2, it would not have

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.020
done this. It would have been flat. So
this really is the smoking gun. You can

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.120
say that with great great confidence and
of course there are a lot of other lines

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.840
of evidence but I like this one in
particular.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.110
The other thing that you can do if you're
confronted by someone who doesn't buy this

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.640
argument that CO2-- How do we know that
CO2 actually causes climate you can look

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:53.120
to our neighbor Venus, which has about
3,000 times more CO2 in its atmosphere

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.500
than our planet and it has a surface
temperature of 450 degrees centigrade,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.060
which is hot enough to melt lead.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.240
It's basically a combination of Venus,
basic physics that tell us that CO2 traps

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.990
heat and these undisputed measurements of
CO2 concentration in its isotopes. Those

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.030
three things taken together pretty much
sums it all up. Everything else is kind of

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.760
details.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.970
We know that humans are embarking on a
dramatic future change of climate. It

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.510
doesn't really matter that much what's
happened up until now. I mean asking

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.080
whether the earth is warming or not is
kind of like driving towards a cliff and

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:45.180
asking are we dropping yet? It's really
not that interesting a question, actually.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.910
While I'm on the topic of smoking guns,
this is a very famous picture that many

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.000
people have seen, the CO2 concentration
from ice cores and here we are today at

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.100
400. So you see it is quite unusual in the
context of the last 800,000 years which is

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:09.450
the whole ice core record. I'm working on
trying to extend this back to 1.5 million

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.240
years. You can ask me about that later if
you want.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.010
The important thing about this that this
is not the smoking gun of human causation.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.880
There's been an awful lot of confusion
about this. Al Gore, bless his heart, I

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.830
think kind of led us down the wrong path
by implying this was some kind of evidence

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.960
that CO2 causes climate change. In fact
it's mostly the other way around that

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.160
Antarctic temperature is related to the
things that control natural variations in

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.480
the CO2.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.370
The current CO2 spike has nothing to do
with these variations. It's not coming

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.860
from the ocean as you saw from the Carbon
13 evidence; it's coming from fossil

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.090
fuels. It's a completely different
chemical in fact. If somebody gives you a

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:59.340
hard time about the fact that the CO2
changes slightly after the temperature,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.590
you can tell them that's expected because
it's natural CO2 and it's responding to

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.300
climate, it's not causing climate.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.370
And the related myth is that the ice core
record that you've just seen shows that

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.910
carbon dioxide rose after temperature
began warming at the ends of ice ages.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:22.130
Which is true that's why it's in black.
Ergo, carbon dioxide does not cause

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:28.100
warming which is false. The fact is that
ice ages are ended by the changes in the

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.670
earth's orbit as you heard earlier today.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.020
So it's not surprising that the
temperature changes first and you can

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:41.130
think of CO2 as a feedback that amplifies
the initial warming by about 30% probably.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:49.670
It's not actually a huge increase. It's
maybe two degrees bigger of a change than

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:55.560
you would have gotten otherwise. So humans
are adding CO2 directly to the atmosphere

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.830
and so ice ages are not a good analog,
it's a red herring.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:05.040
I couldn't resist showing this because
it's such a nice analogy. If you overspend

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.370
your credit card, you go into debt, and
then you have to pay interest, right. Then

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:14.860
it makes more debt. So interest lags debt.
How do we know that interest adds to debt?

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.150
We can't explain the total size of the
debt without taking into account interest

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.050
and also economics.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:27.030
Tells us in the climate of the past now.
We have the earth's orbit causing warming,

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:32.830
making CO2 rise as the ocean warms and out
gases, CO2, and then causes further

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:39.100
warming as an amplifier. So that's the
whole end of story about human caused

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:45.350
climate change. Now I'm going to move on
into this idea that the first evidence for

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.900
agriculture was seen during this abrupt
warming.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.740
This is a fascinating topic and it's
mostly, I think, the work of Brian Baird

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.070
who used to be here at UCSD. Who
discovered that the very first

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:07.260
domesticated plants, I think they were
barley seeds, actually, occur within plus

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:12.020
or minus 200 years of this abrupt warming
event right here. Seen, this is actually

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.210
the Greenland temperature, but it's a lot
of the northern hemisphere European

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.610
temperature as well.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:23.250
Then this is a methane record from the ice
core and it seems to be a proxy for

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.380
wetness. There's a great deal of increase
in northern hemisphere low latitude

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.130
rainfall at this time. This all happened
in about 30 years. These are very fast

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:38.030
events. There's about half of the
temperature change seems to have occurred

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.620
in one year.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:46.050
These are the kinds of things that could
impose very large stresses on humans

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:52.750
potentially because there's not enough
time to adapt. What's amazing about this

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:59.670
is that people seem to have completely
changed in a very short time their mode of

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.750
existence from hunting and gathering to
farming right here.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.190
It's probably because everything got so
much warmer and wetter that it was just

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.220
really lush. Think about the Garden of
Eden. That's probably sometime in here. We

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:22.620
don't know whether it was 8,000 years or
12,000 years, whatever. That was an

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.020
example of abrupt climate change that
probably greatly benefited our ancestors.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.460
Of course when it's cooling, it's drying
as well and that would be a period of

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.360
intense stress. There were probably
population bottle-necks at the time and

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.500
those may be very important for evolution.
Because if you kill off 97% of the humans

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:49.980
then you just leave 3%, those will have
characters that will then be able to

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.850
spread widely without having to exchange
with a large gene pool.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:01.490
So you can get very powerful evolutionary
change through this bottlenecks and what's

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:07.170
remarkable about this abrupt events is
they happen again and again. It's not just

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:12.280
one of them it's 25 of them in the last
100,000 years and probably something like

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.820
20 in the 100,000 years before that.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.210
All told, our ancestors probably went
through at least 100 of these bottlenecks.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:25.980
So it's a repeated form of boom and bust
and William Calvin had a very nice book

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.800
about this kind of boom and bust
evolutionary pumping hypothesis.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.590
I'm going to switch now to talk about the
physical science understanding that we

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.960
have about abrupt climate change. What
causes it in the first place and as I

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.400
hinted at the beginning it's something to
do with ocean circulation. Warm water at

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.430
the surface in the north Atlantic is
carried by currents to this place around

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.380
Greenland where it becomes cold and dense
enough to sink.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:59.490
Then it travels southwards along the
bottom of the ocean and what these seems

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.790
to do is that it actually displaces the
earth's thermal equator north of the

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.530
geographic equator. The northern
hemisphere today is quite a bit warmer

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.830
than the southern hemisphere.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:16.310
We believe that from theory and evidence
that this circulation is capable of

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.340
shutting off. So that's what a cooling is
and when it turns back on that's what an

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:27.230
abrupt warming is. This is kind of what
the Paleo records look like of this

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:32.620
phenomena of turning on and shutting off
the north Atlantic circulation.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.790
In the northern records you see abrupt
warmings at the times when the circulation

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:44.360
goes on. In the southern hemisphere, this
is Antarctica, you actually see a gradual

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:51.190
warming during times when the north is
cold and then an inflection point towards

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:58.760
gradual cooling in the south. This is very
strong evidence that this really is the

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.430
ocean circulation.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.590
This is from a very recent ice core we
drilled that just finished and we got

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:12.970
published in Nature a few weeks ago. This
is one of the main findings from this ice

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:19.890
core is that because we can now date the
two hemispheres relative to each other to

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:26.390
a precision of about 50 years. We can show
that the northern abrupt warming leads the

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:31.350
southern transition to cooling which is
shown here by about 200 years.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.160
That's very interesting because that
really confirms that this is the ocean

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:42.400
circulation that is doing this. I think
it's the latest in a long line of pieces

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.970
of evidence that support the notion that
it is this ocean circulation sort of

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.540
oscillating and flipping on and off that
does this.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.890
Will it happen again in the near future?
Is an abrupt climate change something we

00:14:54.890 --> 00:15:01.090
have to worry about? Well you may have
seen the movie The Day After Tomorrow.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.850
It's something that is permeated into the
public consciousness but I think the

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.280
answer is probably not.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.960
The reason I say that is that the Atlantic
Ocean is getting saltier today. In the

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.120
last 50 years it's increased its salinity
dramatically. You can sort of see that in

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:24.330
this cartoon here. The Atlantic is all
yellow which is an increase in salinity.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.440
The Pacific has a lot of blue and that
means a sort of decrease in salinity.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.630
So what's going on right now is that the
Atlantic is getting saltier. The Pacific

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:37.440
is getting fresher and that's exactly what
we expect to happen in a warming world

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:43.980
because warm air holds more water vapor.
So it's impossible to transport more vapor

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.210
out of the Atlantic into the Pacific
across Panama as you see here.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.450
Basically whenever the world gets warmer
the Atlantic gets saltier. The salt

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.970
actually densifies the water, makes it
easy to sink and it actually protects that

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:04.290
circulation. While there was some worry
maybe 15 years ago that the Atlantic

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.970
circulation would shut down due to global
warming. I think we can say now we've

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:15.680
learned something, science moves on. It is
now very unlikely this will happen again.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:22.410
The other thing of course is that we don't
have the amplifying factor of sea ice. Sea

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:29.310
ice makes the ocean turn from dark to
white. So it greatly exacerbates the

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.980
effects of the overturning circulation
shutting off.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:40.790
My take home messages. I hope I have
convinced you that abrupt climate change

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:47.950
did stimulate farming and there's a very
very interesting story that's only just

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:53.080
beginning to be understood. It's very
probable that many many abrupt climate

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.840
changes prior to this one that stimulated
farming, played a role by creating

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:08.000
bottlenecks that made the survivors of
this event able to radiate out into an

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.190
empty niche after the event.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:17.710
Very probably I think, also, encouraged
people who could do things differently

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:23.440
than their parents were doing them. As I
have some kids who are becoming teenagers

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.450
I know a lot about this sort of
oppositional, don't do what your parents

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:33.500
were doing kind of stuff and I just wonder
if maybe the teenager kind of thing has

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.980
its origins in abrupt climate change.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:44.300
Because if your parents are telling you to
eat fruit and the climate just crashed and

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.630
you say I do things differently than my
parents. I'm going to eat roots instead of

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:53.030
fruits. Well you might be the one who
actually survives because you're a root

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:58.030
eater. I'm just wondering maybe this
population bottlenecks somehow encouraged

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:03.370
sort of contrarian thinking.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:08.360
Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation is
the culprit, I think. We can now say that

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.810
causes abrupt climate change. Will it
happen? Again in the future probably not.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.650
That's one thing we can breathe easier
about. Check that one off the list. More

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:22.040
salt less sea ice in our future. Thank
you.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.080
♪ [music] ♪

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.480
- [William] This is kind of this
transition talk between the relatively

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:45.950
deep past and the very recent past and
present and future. There is a debate

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:52.070
going on about this. I'm talking about the
last 10,000 years when agriculture

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:57.630
developed. There is a debate going on or a
discussion going on in the community.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:05.010
If you asked the average geo-scientist are
humans now in control of the world, the

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.240
atmosphere, the water, the soil,
everything else. I think you would get

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:17.360
pretty much a 100% response yes. The
debate or discussion is about whether to

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:26.310
define a particular time when that began.
On that, there is less unanimity. I am

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.900
somewhat towards one extreme of that
argument.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:36.100
I was asked to write a perspective piece
in Science. This is not the most exciting

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:42.910
slide in the world, but you can at least
read the title. It's about this discussion

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:50.680
about defining this epoch we leave in.
Whether to do it in a very recent time and

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:57.990
there's a proposal out from a group in
London, geologists, [inaudible 00:19:57]

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:03.910
to make it the 1945
and 1950 era because all kinds of things

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:09.470
started to happen that humans hadn't been
doing before then and because bomb testing

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:15.700
began then and these isotopes that people
have been talking about were spread widely

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.340
in the ocean, ocean sediments and in ice
cores.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:28.960
There's a move to say that anthropocene,
the start of the human domination of the

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:37.240
planet, is in the 1950s. This slide shows
a dark colored bar down the right center

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:44.980
part which defines that. It actually chose
the industrial era which is the last 200

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:53.510
years and there's substantial support for
this suggestion to do this. However, those

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:59.960
of us who work back on somewhat longer
time scales favor a longer interval of

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.840
human influence on the earth.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:12.430
Extending back about 10,000 years to the
earliest major domestication and dispersal

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:19.150
of crops and livestock and a series of
things that happened and accelerated since

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:24.240
that time. So that's what I'm going to
talk about. I'm going to take you back

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.840
10,000 years and tell you what we were up
to as we became agricultural people.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.330
There's been a community since.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:37.680
This is kind of a cartoon version that I
drew about five or six years ago of the

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:44.530
little figure that's on the right insert
on your program and its pretty close, it's

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:50.650
a schematic. You notice that nice wrinkle
in the deglaciation points here. Coming

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:58.440
from glacial cold temperatures up into the
modern interglacial warmth, it peaks out

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:06.500
then it starts to decline very slightly
towards the present. Now we're taking off

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:12.460
into worlds unknown with the industrial
revolution.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.900
This is the picture of climate for the
last 20,000 years that prevailed through

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:24.140
the 1900s right to the turn of the
century. Here's a picture, that I think is

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:29.400
correct, you notice it's the same from the
glacial cold era coming up into the

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.580
warmth.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:36.840
But around 8,000 years ago in this slide
something else starts to happen. You see

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:43.250
agriculture originating at the bottom of
the slide and agriculture produces

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:47.290
greenhouse gas effects. There's no
disagreement about that but there's a big

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:53.010
disagreement about how much the amplitude
of these greenhouse gas effects.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:23:01.330
The proposal is that these anthropogenic
greenhouse gases kept the climate from

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:07.650
getting as cold as it would have without
the gases. That in fact early farming

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:14.060
stopped nature from taking us back into
the beginnings of a new glaciation

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:19.210
sometime in the last maybe 2,000 or 3,000
years. So early farming stopped the

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.100
glaciation.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:26.500
It sounds radical, but I'll take you
through the steps. There are two ways to

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.510
think about this. These are greenhouse
gases that are recorded in ice cores as

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:37.900
you have already learned. Air in the ice
cores preserves the amount of greenhouse

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.310
gases and here are two examples of these.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:48.590
The red dots show for methane at the top
carbon dioxide at the bottom. Those are

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:54.940
the values during the last 11,000 years,
that time scale along the bottom, and you

00:23:54.940 --> 00:24:01.300
see them both peaking, methane and carbon
dioxide, peaking about 10,000 years ago

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.270
starting to decrease and then climbing.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:10.340
Carbon dioxide comes back up after about
6,000 years ago. Methane comes back up

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:19.080
after about 5,000 years ago. Also plotted
on this slide in dark blue circles is an

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:24.930
average of the seven previous
interglaciations and you've seen that they

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:29.950
were about every 100,000 years. There was
interglacial climate due to those

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.020
variations in earth's orbit.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:38.740
You see that starting with methane.
There's a peak in methane about the same

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:44.110
time as the red circles for this
interglaciation. Then there is a decrease

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:51.540
not dissimilar to this interglaciation but
then instead of turning on and going up

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.510
this average of all seven previous
interglaciations keep going down. The same

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:02.850
thing happens for CO2 with an even more
striking match of the current

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:08.730
interglaciation and the average of the
previous interglaciations and they part

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.920
ways about 6,000 ago.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:18.970
I call this top-down evidence for human
influence and the way to think about it is

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:26.230
really simple. If the blue circles show
previous interglaciations when no one

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:32.920
thinks humans are having massive effects
on this environment or its atmosphere. If

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:40.940
blue is natural and if blue is going down
then red is not natural. So something new

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.590
is working in this interglaciation.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:51.370
I say what humans are doing 6,000 years
ago starts to push the CO2 curve upward

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:58.240
and starts to push the methane upward
about 5,000 year ago. Anomalous and I say

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.670
anthropogenic factor is at work. I call
that a top down view because it's from the

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:09.370
point of view of the atmosphere and that's
half of a hypothesis. If you want a full

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:14.540
hypothesis you need bottom-up evidence.
What's happening on the ground? What are

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.270
people actually up to?

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:24.890
This slide is a very simplified version of
the spread of agriculture. You can see

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:30.140
here I'm mapping mainly the spread not the
initial domestication of crops and

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.770
livestock. You can see in southwest Asia,
the eastern Mediterranean after about

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:41.490
9,000 years ago crops which originated in
the fertile crescent started to spread

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:48.650
across Europe came down to the Nile River
valley went east into Pakistan and India.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:56.810
About the same time in northern China,
people domesticated crops and animals and

00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:04.030
that spread beginning of the Han dynasty.
The Han people, I should say, spread up

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:09.610
into Korea and then in the rest of China.
Then around 5,000 years ago in southern

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:15.450
China the development of irrigated rice
spreads across down into India, down into

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:20.840
Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Those
are major centers of domestication.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:28.180
Around 5,000 years ago, the Bantu people
in the tropical North Africa and

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:33.980
Sub-Saharan Africa developed sufficiently
impressive agriculture that they spread

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:39.630
all across southern Africa except for
South Africa itself. One of the major

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.580
migrations of human history.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:49.490
Over in the Americas in Mexico even though
agriculture began earlier by 4,000 years

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:55.230
ago the combination of corn, beans,
avocados and tomatoes people were

00:27:55.230 --> 00:28:00.360
spreading agriculture up into North
America and down through Central America.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:08.120
Finally in the eastern Andes part of the
Amazon more agriculture beginning there

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:13.180
4,000 years ago. All of these are
happening during the time when those

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.330
greenhouse gas trends were going the wrong
way.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:22.060
To go back at the methane curve shown at
the top. Remember their departure is 5,000

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:27.430
years ago. Here's a map of the spread of
rice agriculture through Asia. It

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:34.600
originates in the Yangtze river valley and
by 5,000 years ago rice is fully

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:43.130
domesticated. It spreads down across the
rest of Asia by 1,000 years ago. This

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.773
based on Archeo-botanical work.

00:28:45.773 --> 00:28:52.173
Rice paddies are manmade wetlands and
wetlands are basically swamps which have

00:28:52.173 --> 00:28:57.394
swamp gas which has methane which bubbles
out of the rice paddies. The spread of

00:28:57.394 --> 00:29:06.313
rice agriculture coincides nicely with the
reversal of the methane trend. The man who

00:29:06.313 --> 00:29:10.580
did this was Dorian Fuller at University
College London,

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:17.406
converted that the spread of rice and then
assumed in filling of the density of rice

00:29:17.406 --> 00:29:24.599
into estimates of total rice area.
Irrigated that's in green and he converted

00:29:24.599 --> 00:29:31.181
that using modern relationship estimates
of the effect on atmospheric methane.

00:29:31.181 --> 00:29:36.870
He got a 70 parts per billion estimate
between 5,000 and 1,000 years ago.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:42.488
The ice core data which I showed you
earlier shows 100 parts per billion. So if

00:29:42.488 --> 00:29:47.476
his estimate's right and they're going to
be more versions of this I'm sure, rice

00:29:47.476 --> 00:29:54.180
irrigation would explain 70% of the rise
of the methane trend. Remember also the

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.487
full anomaly also would include the fact
that the methane trend should have gone

00:29:58.487 --> 00:30:02.110
down but it didn't so there's more to
explain.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.770
Dorian Dorian
Fuller also mapped the spread of livestock

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:13.490
across Africa and Asia. You see that
between 7,000 and 5,000 years ago the

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:20.160
livestock are in relatively arid areas.
The Sahara which is greener, it has

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.620
grasslands because it's getting some
moisture. The Iranian plateau and western

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:34.927
China. But between 5,000 and 1,000 years
ago livestock spreads all the way across

00:30:34.927 --> 00:30:41.144
India and eastern Asia and down into South
Africa with that Bantu migration.

00:30:41.144 --> 00:30:46.447
There will be estimates of the methane
contributions from livestock, too, and

00:30:46.447 --> 00:30:51.587
they will explain more of the anomaly.
Carbon dioxide at the bottom until

00:30:51.587 --> 00:30:55.467
recently has been very tricky for a number
of reasons which I can't go into in this

00:30:55.467 --> 00:31:00.770
talk, but there's been an explosion of
data in the last three or four years that

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:01.827
bears on this.

00:31:01.827 --> 00:31:08.003
Now to get carbon dioxide from farming you
need to clear trees and burn them or just

00:31:08.003 --> 00:31:12.716
let them rot which puts the CO2 in the
atmosphere. There's a map of the spread of

00:31:12.716 --> 00:31:19.015
agriculture across Europe beginning in the
lower right in the fertile crescent and

00:31:19.015 --> 00:31:25.679
spreading all the way to the far reaches
of Europe by 5,500 years ago. Interesting

00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:31.530
point 5,500 years ago is still the late
Neolithic, the late Stone-age. We don't

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:36.914
even have Bronze Age tools, but people are
coming in and clearing forests. They're

00:31:36.914 --> 00:31:40.551
using very sophisticated flint axes.

00:31:40.551 --> 00:31:48.657
There is agriculture all across Europe by
5,500 years ago which is that CO2 curve

00:31:48.657 --> 00:31:58.694
starts to rise by 6,500. That doesn't
begin to prove that deforestation explains

00:31:58.694 --> 00:32:05.683
the carbon dioxide rise, but a paper
published earlier this year certainly

00:32:05.683 --> 00:32:13.261
points in that direction. The top left
panel shows the synthesis of hundreds of

00:32:13.261 --> 00:32:20.230
lake cores that have pollen remains which
include remains of grass pollen, tree

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:28.174
pollen and then intermediate pollen that's
shrubs and things that are in between.

00:32:28.174 --> 00:32:35.915
If you look at the trend in part B, the
dark green forest pollen starts to

00:32:35.915 --> 00:32:42.477
decrease somewhere between 6,000 and 5,000
years ago which is just after that carbon

00:32:42.477 --> 00:32:49.507
dioxide curve starts to turn up and go the
wrong way. Before you get to the

00:32:49.507 --> 00:32:56.983
industrial era, you've basically gotten
rid of the forest. This is favorable to an

00:32:56.983 --> 00:33:03.058
early anthropogenic effect, a large early
anthropogenic effect and as the top right

00:33:03.058 --> 00:33:06.735
slide shows it's based on hundreds of
cores.

00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:15.411
Part C and D show some data from China.
Not pollen data, but numbers of

00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:20.002
archeological sites. It turns out that
the Chinese government for decades has

00:33:20.002 --> 00:33:27.906
been funding people to gather information
on the impressive early history of China.

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:35.443
There's just thousands and thousands of
archeological data points. Either radio

00:33:35.443 --> 00:33:42.250
carbon dated or correlated by cultural
remains to other sequences that are dated.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:49.767
The bottom left slide shows the number of
archeological sites 8,000 to 7,000 years

00:33:49.767 --> 00:33:55.638
ago. They are mostly down in the Yellow
river valley and they're fairly sparse. By

00:33:55.638 --> 00:34:01.043
5,000 to 4,000 years ago they Yellow river
valley's just completely filled in. There

00:34:01.043 --> 00:34:05.634
were people burning coal in some of these
areas because the forest is gone and it's

00:34:05.634 --> 00:34:12.745
coming down into the Yangtze river valley.
This is before that rice spread begins in

00:34:12.745 --> 00:34:15.488
southern China and the rest of Asia.

00:34:15.488 --> 00:34:20.405
I guess I can summarize by saying in the
last three or four years there's been an

00:34:20.405 --> 00:34:27.150
explosion of ground truth evidence that
people are doing things that are putting a

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:32.514
lot of methane and carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere.

00:34:32.514 --> 00:34:39.442
This is beginning to gather some attention
from those who report the scientific news.

00:34:39.442 --> 00:34:47.691
This is from Science autumn 2013. This is
a piece that the commentary focused on

00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:53.684
methane and you can read the title and get
the punch-line yourself.

00:34:53.684 --> 00:34:59.759
Here's a paper that was published, a
features piece, that was published in the

00:34:59.759 --> 00:35:02.710
other
most distinguished journal, that's Nature.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:10.610
The central panel shows the time of major
cultural effects on land clearance and

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:15.630
vegetation. You see that there are blocks
there that are dating back to 5,000 years

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:20.630
or more. You also see that methane
reversal plotted in the curve at the

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.480
bottom right.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.920
As we go off in the next few talks after
the break into talking about the major

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.800
things that have happened during the
industrial revolution and during the last

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:41.600
50 years. Keep in mind that we have a long
history of affecting climate and the scope

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:47.190
of it is still coming into focus but it's
coming into focus pretty fast. I think

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:52.920
humans have been a major factor in the
landscape for thousands of years not just

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.010
200 years.

♪ [music] ♪

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.220
- [Charles] I am in fact literally the
bridge between the past and the future in

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:20.420
many different ways. This is the title
that I originally chose when I submitted

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.210
my first abstract. But as I got to
preparing it, I thought I would try

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:30.100
something new with the same material that
I've been working on for some time. I have

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:35.480
rechanged the name now: Anatomy of a
Climate Regime Change.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:43.060
It's the same material, basically, but the
hypothesis is that we may be with our

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:50.200
modern instrumentation over the last 20 or
so years. We may be seeing a change in

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:56.630
climate that is something like those that
might have caused Jeff Severinghaus'

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:01.760
abrupt transitions. I'm going to go
through it with you. It is of course a

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:07.420
very small version of very big events that
happened in the past.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:13.170
I first got interested in this problem
because of an issue of public awareness

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:23.710
and policy. The public issue is called the
paradox that triples the hiatus paradox.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:29.040
If you cherry pick your data as this
article did, you can find a time in 1997

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:36.350
and another time in 2012 when the earth's
temperature was the same that it had been.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:43.060
This led to the idea that the globe is not
warming even though the carbon dioxide is

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.780
increasing.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.470
I began to ask myself two other questions.
What else was going on while the global

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:54.680
temperature was constant? Was climate
change also disappearing? I found of

00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:00.680
course two other paradoxes. Why are the
extreme events in climate increasing?

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.510
Here's the key I chose why is the Arctic
warming even more rapidly?

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:15.750
Let's first of all verify that this is the
hiatus. It started in the year 2000 and

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:23.520
during that time the carbon dioxide has
increased and humans have added about 27%

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:29.500
more CO2 than they have since the
beginning of the industrial revolution.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:37.040
This should have led to an increase in the
warming rate in climatologist language of

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.360
four tenths of a watt per meter. We were
putting more energy into climate but it

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.850
wasn't turning up in the global
temperature. The question was where was

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.980
that energy going?

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:54.080
So here's a longer perspective on the
hiatus. This is a record since 1880 and it

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:59.400
shows a much shorter record than you've
seen this far but it shows the global

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:06.820
temperature evolution. The first thing you
notice is that there was another hiatus

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:13.700
between '45 and '75. They do happen; they
are features of climate models. They are

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.790
areas where the climate goes through a
reconfiguration.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:24.990
Our present hiatus started with a bang.
With a huge El Niño in 1997 and '8. My

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:30.820
first year as director of Scripps where my
office was inundated. Then you can see the

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:36.860
profile of the slowly warming that we've
seen throughout this century.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.710
Now the global mean temperature that the
scientists calculate is taken from data

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:45.680
and most of it is from satellite
observations of the sea surface

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:52.180
temperature. The sea covers 70% of the
earth's surface. So you would expect that

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:58.130
this computation will be dominated by
what's happening in the ocean.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.690
After After
many gyrations, the community came to

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:08.230
realize that it was the behavior of the
ocean that was responsible for this hiatus

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:14.230
in warming. Because we knew from earlier
studies going back to the 1980s that

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:19.800
Pacific Ocean for example oscillate
between two very extreme states in which

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.790
the temperature changes dramatically.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:29.580
You'll notice that El Niño is a warm state
and La Niña is a cool state. So perhaps

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:36.310
what was happening was that we were
switching from El Nino to La Niña a

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:43.090
prevailing state thereof. I have to tell
you just a little bit about how the El

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.410
Niño cycle works.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:50.020
So what you're looking at here is a
picture taken from the sketch taken from

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:56.460
the Pacific equator. Stretching from the
east in Lima to the west in Darwin and

00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:01.750
you'll see at the top in the La Niña
phrase the trade winds pushed the wavy

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:09.840
ocean towards the west. That water heats
up from the sun as it goes and as it heats

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:16.320
up it expands a little bit so the winds
have to push the water upstream, uphill.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:25.300
It goes until it can't go any further. So
you get deep water in the western Pacific

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:30.990
that's warm and then the circulation
pattern pushes up cold water in the east.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.050
That's the cooling phase of La Niña.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:39.170
The El Niño is a little bit different. The
trade winds can suddenly stop for some

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:43.920
reason and then all this water rushes
downhill and the warm water gets heated a

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:51.580
second time as it crosses the Pacific and
you slosh up against the North American

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.510
and South American continents.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:42:00.470
What happened? Did the trade winds
increase and were of the right sense to

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:07.780
create an El Niño, a La Niña? The answer
is from this remarkably difficult data set

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:14.870
to compile 100 years of the trade wind
stress on the ocean water in the central

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:21.770
Pacific. You can see it oscillated around
until about the year 2000 when it switched

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:27.900
from El Niño sense smaller trade wind to
La Niña sense larger trade wind.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:32.080
It's continuing to get larger in the
negative direction. That's the negative

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.790
part of this curve and it's
unprecedentedly large and it is not

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:41.040
included at present in contemporary
climate models. But the trade wind has

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:46.340
been exceptionally large. Which means,
then, you would think if that were the

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:51.840
case that in fact you were driving a lot
of heat energy into the ocean in the

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.950
western Pacific.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:43:01.170
Here is a picture of ocean heat content
that was published just about six or seven

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:07.620
months ago in Science but it looks like it
solves the problem. What Chen and Tang did

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:13.060
was divide their time that they looked at
the data from before the hiatus on the

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.470
right and after the hiatus began on the
left.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:23.050
You see two plots. The bottom one is the
one pertinent to my argument about the El

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:29.320
Niño and I'll come to the top one in a
moment. What you see is a spread against

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.920
longitude across the Pacific. The red blob
is the distribution of ocean heat down to

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:41.800
about 300 meters. You see this abrupt
switch in color, s if you will, the same

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.140
switch that you saw in that earlier
picture from Woodshall.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:53.170
What we do know is that at around the time
of the hiatus, the Pacific Ocean's state

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:59.080
changed to a heat sequestering state. But
the other thing that happened which

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:06.040
actually took over after a while during
this same period is displayed in this plot

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:11.730
on the left. Which is somewhat different
because it's a transect up the Atlantic

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:19.140
from south to north and it shows you where
new heat is being buried in the north

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.820
Atlantic.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:26.870
You can see basically that the heat is
being buried at pretty high latitudes.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:32.490
This started at approximately the same
time. This little event here we are

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.960
observing is a small version of the events
that Jeff Severinghaus was talking about

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:43.050
somewhat earlier. Where it was possible to
slow down the Atlantic meridian

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:49.190
circulation. You can see the strong
difference between the two states. This

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:57.190
change took place across the large El Niño
that started the process off.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.250
So So
what else was going on during this time?

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:04.580
The oceans will tell you this spread all
around the earth's ocean and that tells

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.260
you right away that we're dealing with a
comprehensive change in ocean state. You

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.750
would expect then that there would be
other changes in the climate that occurred

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:17.510
at the same time, other parts of this
restructuring.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:24.610
As you probably have understood from the
pictures of polar bears, there actually is

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:30.130
an Arctic regime shift in progress. This
was first revealed by two formal

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:36.470
assessments. One in 2005 that used
primarily data from before the hiatus

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:42.640
began and another one only seven years
later and they discovered a major change

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.630
in the distribution of Arctic heating.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:50.750
During the hiatus it's been fastest in
spring and autumn and before it was

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:54.670
fastest in winter which was consistent
with the earlier greenhouse warming

00:45:54.670 --> 00:46:01.970
models. It's now faster over the oceans
than the land. These change in patterns

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:08.180
suggested to you that the Arctic developed
a new warming source that was not as

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:13.410
strong in the previous period.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:20.170
Satellite data first began to be collected
with great accurate data on Sea Ice area

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:29.470
in '79. Here is the curve that you can see
of the minimum Sea Ice extent which occurs

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:34.790
at the end of the warm season in
September. As a function of time September

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:38.730
after September since 1979.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:45.250
What you can infer from this plot is a
break in behavior in which the sea ice was

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:50.030
slowly declining but oscillating about a
slowly declining mean. Suddenly there it

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:55.800
looks like a change in state and over this
period of time the sea ice area has

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:04.396
declined by about 40% and the sea ice
volume is down to 25% what it had been in

00:47:04.396 --> 00:47:06.468
1979.

00:47:06.468 --> 00:47:12.726
Here's the same data. That was there in
case the movie didn't work. That shows you

00:47:12.726 --> 00:47:21.401
where the timing of the sea ice decline.
There's one other thing that has happened

00:47:21.401 --> 00:47:28.409
during the period of the hiatus which I
think will be interesting to Jeff and

00:47:28.409 --> 00:47:34.888
others. It's a small analog of the
events that slow the meridional

00:47:34.888 --> 00:47:36.818
overturning circulation.

00:47:36.818 --> 00:47:43.115
During this hiatus only since about the
year 2000 a new pattern of winds developed

00:47:43.115 --> 00:47:50.467
over the Arctic Ocean. It's called the
Arctic Dipole Anomaly. This pair of winds

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:57.902
going in opposite direction drives ice and
sea and fresh water from the Arctic into

00:47:57.902 --> 00:48:04.361
the north Atlantic where it will shut off
or it can impede. Where it collides,

00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:09.418
basically, with the Gulf Stream and at
that collision point the water sinks to

00:48:09.418 --> 00:48:11.368
depth and we did see that.

00:48:11.368 --> 00:48:18.498
This is a small event of something that
actually happened in the historical record

00:48:18.498 --> 00:48:26.480
8,000 years ago as the ice sheet was
retreating across North America. As it

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.411
retreated, it left behind in the area of
Hudson Bay a huge glacial lake that was

00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:37.611
contained between the melting ice on one
hand and the moraine that pushed up on the

00:48:37.611 --> 00:48:43.135
front. These glacial moraines are unstable
and there was a huge outflow of water that

00:48:43.135 --> 00:48:48.862
occurred all at once and there was a 200
year period of cool climate that then

00:48:48.862 --> 00:48:50.203
recovered.

00:48:50.203 --> 00:48:55.728
The Columbia River was also formed this
way. What the satellites have observed is

00:48:55.728 --> 00:49:02.166
a great injection of fresh water into this
Gyre here the Beaufort Gyre that began at

00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:08.625
approximately the same time and that water
is lighter. When it gets to the saltier

00:49:08.625 --> 00:49:11.775
Atlantic the saltier Atlantic will sink.

00:49:11.775 --> 00:49:17.462
So here is the next and most important
point. This sea ice retreat that I just

00:49:17.462 --> 00:49:24.144
documented is warming the Arctic by a very
simple mechanism. When you replace white

00:49:24.144 --> 00:49:31.924
ice with blue ocean you absorb much more
solar energy. Sea ice itself may reflect

00:49:31.924 --> 00:49:39.866
half back to space and the ocean absorbs
93% of the energy that's falling on it. As

00:49:39.866 --> 00:49:44.336
the sea ice retreats, it warms the Arctic.

00:49:44.336 --> 00:49:51.465
A recent paper that came out from Scripps
measured the degree of warming since the

00:49:51.465 --> 00:49:58.615
satellite era started in '79 and they
found that the net sea ice retreat adds

00:49:58.615 --> 00:50:03.600
about six watts per meter
squared, but two thirds of the heating

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:10.450
that took place in that period occurred in
those 10 years between '01 and '11. The

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:15.830
Arctic is small but if you average this
over the globe you get 0.21 watts per

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:21.570
meter squared which is about a quarter of
the increase that you would have expected

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.800
from the increase in greenhouse gas at
that time.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:30.650
So you have added a new warning mechanism
that the climate, at least in recent

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:38.830
times, was not used to. This is a picture
of the geography of heat transport in the

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:44.810
climate and I put it on even though it's
complicated just to remind you that the

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:50.460
basic circulation of the atmosphere as
understood from the time of Edmond Halley

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:57.050
was there was heavy and strong warming of
the ocean and land over the tropics. This

00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:03.810
heat was then transported to the north. So
it's a north south circulation-- north

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:08.760
equator to pole circulation that is the
fundamental feature of our climate

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.860
transport.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:17.450
If you suddenly add a new heating source
at the poles particularly the Arctic won't

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:23.740
you change the circulation of heat in the
atmosphere? And will this not, in fact,

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:32.540
lead to states like the El Nino? What we
do know and this a question still under

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:41.120
active investigation, but what we do know
is that we have created a 17 or 18 year

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:47.040
persistent La Niña-like state in the
Pacific Ocean and also a similar outflow

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:54.280
in the north Atlantic that is lasting
longer than most typical La Niña's lasted

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.140
the whole period of time.

00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:01.110
What this has had an effect on the climate
down below because when you're in a La

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:09.220
Niña state, you bend the jet stream as you
see and you've seen many many pictures

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:13.890
recently anytime you look at the weather
you'll see the jet stream dipping deep

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:24.100
into central United States. We've remained
in a state of La Niña-like jet stream. The

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.790
weather patterns, then, correlate with
this.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:33.780
Now the question is the global
temperatures have been constant so you

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:40.540
would expect that there would be many
fewer heat waves or at least the same

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:47.740
number as before. This has not proven the
case. Here's a remarkable data analysis

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:55.360
generated in Spain. Where they were able
to compile the mean summer temperature in

00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:02.430
Europe for the last 500 years since 1500.
What you see is five of the ten years in

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:08.891
the 2010 decade were the hottest years on
record.

00:53:08.891 --> 00:53:16.264
You also hear about this unstable. You
hear this bending La Niña-like jet stream.

00:53:16.264 --> 00:53:23.231
You hear about it in another context
because in the winter it brings Arctic air

00:53:23.231 --> 00:53:28.309
to the south and it's then responsible for
the large snow storms that we've seen in

00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:35.857
the past. We also know that the La Niña
state implies a very dry climate in

00:53:35.857 --> 00:53:39.920
California, something that we are
presently observing.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:46.704
Here are the questions. I phrased the
hypothesis at a set of questions. Did the

00:53:46.704 --> 00:53:51.538
Arctic warming associated with super El
Niño, which pushed the ice over the edge,

00:53:51.538 --> 00:53:57.346
did it trigger a continuing ice retreat
when winter regrowth could not make up for

00:53:57.346 --> 00:54:03.948
the previous year's loss? Did Arctic
warming, by altering the north south heat

00:54:03.948 --> 00:54:09.594
flow, did it strengthen the trade winds
create the La Niña bias, and enable the

00:54:09.594 --> 00:54:13.363
persistent ocean heat sequestration that
we've been seeing?

00:54:13.363 --> 00:54:19.720
Did it, warming, by altering the heat flow
cause the observed pattern enhancement of

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:26.057
extreme event occurrence? Then finally how
long can this kind of thing go on? Will

00:54:26.057 --> 00:54:31.988
the present dynamical quasi-equilibrium be
maintained until the energy added to the

00:54:31.988 --> 00:54:38.652
climate system from ice and snow retreat
stops? Thank you.
