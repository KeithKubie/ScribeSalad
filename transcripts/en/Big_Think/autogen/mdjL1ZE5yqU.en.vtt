00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850
it's harder I think for people to get

worked up when you know they're in the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000
worked up when you know they're in the
 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.110
worked up when you know they're in the
majority that especially in midterm

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120
majority that especially in midterm
 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.820
majority that especially in midterm
elections we tend to see that it's the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830
elections we tend to see that it's the
 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.740
elections we tend to see that it's the
disgruntled people who are the most

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
disgruntled people who are the most
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.760
disgruntled people who are the most
active we saw that in 2006 where it was

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770
active we saw that in 2006 where it was
 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.850
active we saw that in 2006 where it was
really the Democrats by and large who

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860
really the Democrats by and large who
 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.040
really the Democrats by and large who
were the most enthusiastic at the most

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050
were the most enthusiastic at the most
 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.000
were the most enthusiastic at the most
engaged and now it's the Republicans you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010
engaged and now it's the Republicans you
 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.050
engaged and now it's the Republicans you
know with the Democrat in the White

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060
know with the Democrat in the White
 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.990
know with the Democrat in the White
House so it's sort of part of the normal

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
House so it's sort of part of the normal
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.300
House so it's sort of part of the normal
cycle of American politics that's what

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310
cycle of American politics that's what
 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.070
cycle of American politics that's what
tends to happen in these in these

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080
tends to happen in these in these
 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.840
tends to happen in these in these
midterm elections is just that with

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
midterm elections is just that with
 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.090
midterm elections is just that with
increasing polarization you know I think

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100
increasing polarization you know I think
 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.890
increasing polarization you know I think
what happens now is that these swings

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900
what happens now is that these swings
 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.390
what happens now is that these swings
become greater and the reaction becomes

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400
become greater and the reaction becomes
 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.060
become greater and the reaction becomes
even stronger
