You're going to get that fucking check. That fucking Douche is going to come by with his gold towed socks, right? Poke his head and your cubicle. Wait that fucking envelope down, right? And he's going to be talking to you and you're not going to hear him. You, that's going to be sitting there smile. Or maybe it's a lady, maybe it's a woman. Maybe she's coming along with their sensible shoes. You know, she doesn't have a heel on it, right? She's taking it back. You know, tell me what to do with my body. How come guys don't have to walk around in high heels? Why do women have to ruin their feet and their fucking lower backs? You know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       that's like one of those fucking stories that like with this stupid ass fucking election would actually become like a national story, some dumb shit like that, you know, complete fucking clickbait horse shit. Who gives a fuck? You know, I dunno. I don't know how people sit down and watch these conventions my entire life. I've never been able to get through one. They are so fucking cringeworthy. It's so phony. It's so fake. The fucking smiles, those maniacal. Hey like just totally in your head. You know the candidates at this point, they have to be completely fucking exhausted. They don't want to answer any more fucking questions and they still have like another 90 days or this shit that they have to go through. You know, you know like when a team goes to the Super Bowl, right? I mean you've got the two weeks right before and they just fucking sit there. All fucking they report is run out of questions. Are they just sitting there? That's two weeks of that shit. And those players, they go nuts. Just doing that is fucker Kobo of a guy. Fuck up my Yana Four. It's only eight 30 at night. This is fucking calm over dude in the clam. They're, they, they just keep answering the same fucking questions. It's gotta be easier for Trump. You know what I mean? He just has to just make up some shit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       Listen into Trump, give his speech is no different than fucking listen to me do this podcast. He might as well just be laying there with his fucking underwear, his fucking boxes, and just talking to the American people, just whatever the fuck he's thinking. A just says it and then like fucking, you know, whatever, 20 minutes later somebody corrects him on Twitter. That app is be all the time. Every time I put out a podcast, somebody goes, hey man, not trying to be a dick, but just let you know. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       Oh, the George Bush thing, I thought they would just make fun of George Bush dance and I didn't know he was doing it at the fucking, it's some, you know, the police officers funerals, the memorial service, you know, I thought Lewis Hamilton was the upstart driver. They're like, no, it's actually Nico Rosberg and every fucking week I do that, but I'm just some shit head. I'm not actually running for office. Um, oh, you're not bill. Thank you for bringing that up. We didn't fucking realize it. Um, so anyways, uh, uh, you, you truly are a fucking patriot. If you could sit through those things, especially this election. Cause uh, I can't, I can't fucking do it. I can't. Uh, oh my God. Rudy Giuliani, Yada. I remember when he fucking was going off Jesus Christ. What the fuck was he? What was going on with him? I love always voice kept going up.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       Like he thought the crowd was going to go with them and they didn't really, they kept clapping, but he kept increasing his energy and his passion and nothing happened. At least when Howard Dean got going crazy when hey, when he did that thing that he was reacting to the energy, at least he was fucking connected to those people. Rudy, I don't know what he was doing. Yeah. I'll tell you the worst fucking image you could ever picture is Rudy Giuliani, Bang and Hillary Clinton. I mean, just imagine that with his fucking that look at his face when he was screaming about the cops. And then Hillary when she, you know, fucking does that smile where eyes get all wide. All right. I'm gonna ruin your fucking day. Picture her bent over. Put the fucking eyes all white and that crazy smile and head behind like I got, got just fucking banging away.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       There you go. That's on your fucking hard drive now. You can never erase that. Um, oh shit. Look at me. That's another one for the MMP fucking Photoshop right there. I look for that one too. Tomorrow on fucking, I guess today you listen to it tomorrow for me on the old fucking Twitter, Twitter sphere. Um, I had such a great time this week. You know, not having to go in the fucking writer's room has been awesome. Uh, getting caught up in all the shit you know, around the house and all that type of stuff. It's just, it's just a fucking, it's only being a comedian is the greatest fucking job. It's the greatest fucking job you could ever fucking have. Just go on stage and act like a fucking idiot. And then afterwards hang out with a bunch of co comics and then you go home. Then you wait 24 hours. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       we're good. Apologize for the yarn. And all of a sudden, um, you know, I don't know if there's just something about listening to you, to my voice that just puts me to sleep. That's how I got to sleep every night. You know, that I just start talking out loud. You know, I'm saying it in the rain, just saying 20 minutes later I'm, I'm, I'm asleep. Um, anyway, so Monday night, as I mentioned last week I did a, I was going to be doing the goddamn comedy jam and a, I busted out the old fucking John Barnum get up and a, for the first time ever I played my Ludwig 71 green sparkle fucking kit, add my, my drum teacher swung by the house. He tuned the fucking things up so they sounded great and I'm like, I don't know how they're gonna sound in the room. The fucking two year anniversary of Josh Anna Myers show the Goddamn comedy jam, which is now become a fucking pilot on comedy central. The show is just blown up. So happy for all those guys. Um, they had it at the Roxy down on sunset strip. Now you got to understand, I am a Phi came of age in the fucking eighties a meaning I didn't get laid til the 90s.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       Um, anyway. Yeah, it will, I'll tell you it was a rough one for me. Right. But basically I'm the fucking, just the bands that were going on that were, you know, the sunset strip was total the fucking hair metal, you know, the beginning of the metal with fucking, uh, ready roads, you know, when he joined Ozzie and all, all those fucking guys. And then it went into the hair metal and then guns and roses pulled it out in the end and then fucking, uh, who Kate warrant and all those guys, all of that shit happened on the sunset strip out here in fucking la. And I used to always read about the whiskey, the Roxy, the Rainbow Rum. You know, back when I used to read hit fucking per ray, anybody used to read hit parade, a magazine. I fucking loved that magazine. You know, they used to put all the curse words in there and everything.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       I would, you know what? I would actually buy one of those off of fucking Ebay just to read it, just to see. I'll read, read about all of those fucking bands. I knew everybody's name. I knew the names of every fucking drummer. I used to watch all the videos that used to watch the headbangers ball. Randy Rockman. I used to watch the top 10 countdown. That was hilarious. It was either like Janet Jackson or some hair metal. I used to think Janet Jackson was, was was like fucking pussy music. But these guys will wear lipstick and had their hair all tee stuff up like some desperate soccer mom trying to fall in the last dicker of a life. I thought that that was fucking Guy Music, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       Brittany Fox, I've always brought that up. The girls school, all that Shit, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       Poison. Every rose has its store and all of that shit. Right. I got into all, I was into all of that. Then I started working in a warehouse and uh, I worked with these fucking burnouts that were, they weren't burnouts, they, they smoked weed, but my world, that meant you were fucking burnout back then, you know, cause back then that was considered was bad. If you smoke weed, it was illegal. We didn't realize that you owe, you actually helped with the fucking memory back then. We thought that not your memory, it helps with Alzheimer's, whatever the fuck they claim and who knows.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       You know, the whole fucking weed thing is, it's, it's like the global warming battle. I just, it's going to go back and forth and back and forth and then eventually Bose bags like myself will finally give and be like, all right, all right, you guys were right about the weed kind of way. People, all the corporations finally went like, Oh, you know what, Eh, global warming is happening and it is because of us, but you know, it's too late to fix it now. Um, so I started working with these guys and they, uh, played in a band and like I came from more of a jock town. Right. Everybody just fucking played sports or you just, you know, I don't know, stood in the corner on a fucking wall during a party, you know, it was basically it, those are your only two options. The town I was in and uh, these kids were from a couple towns over and everybody over there and played, played instruments and these guys came.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       I worked with them. They were playing guitar and they are playing the shit that was on the radio. And I, I didn't, I, I didn't do all my agents. He can fucking get that. Good. That's amazing. And that's right. Then when I bought my first drum kit, I brought a, I was 20 years old when I started playing fucking drums. I had done everything late in life. I was always fucking, I had day late in a fucking dollar short. Right. And um, I had this, I bought a five piece Slingerland kit at the time it was, I bought it in 1988 I think. And it was like 10 years old. It was all bottom sizes, but it was more like the five ply ones. It wasn't the three ply shelves. So it was, they were already starting to fucking make them too heavy. But uh, it was uh, black and it had a, Oh God, I can't remember the fucking sizes. It was Whoa, it had an 18 inch floor, Tom, a 24 inch kick. And then what the fuck was the rack? I think it was like a 13. It was really weird sizes.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       And then later I ended up, I went down to l Drew's shop in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. I believe that's where it was. And I found a 16 inch floor Tom, which was fucking unbelievable. That matched my kit. Even the badges said Niles, Chicago, Niles, Illinois. Sorry. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       and

Speaker 1:          00:11:01       you know, there was no fucking Ebay back then. I didn't know. There was no way to track down all of this shit that people had lying around the house. I just went into that place. They had all these old drums and they happen to have that and I fucking bought that thing. I was nine by 13, 10 by 14, 13, 14 in 18 and a 24 kick. So then I got the six 16 inch. So now I had um, I had a six piece kit, which I thought was the shit. And then I got some Rodo toms put them on the other side of the high hat cause I was watching Alex van Halen cause it was all about having the biggest fucking kits you could possibly have.

Speaker 3:          00:11:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       And then along came guns and roses and a guy named Steven Adler and he showed up with a little four piece kit, right rack, Tom floor, Tom and his fucking ride sitting in between the two, which was just, it was the shit. And he got more music out of that than half these fucking guys with double bass drum kicks. Fucking two toms above each base drama to floor toms. Right. And um, that just completely changed my life. So long story short, I used to always read up on all that. I try to do all, try to figure out how to spin the sticks, all of that shit. And back in the day I could do was watch MTV and try to figure this shit out or you just listen to the records. And we added even better than the kids in the 70s, cause there was no fucking MTV. Maybe he caught him on a, I don't know Dick Clark fucking show with some shit.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       So, but I'll use to have it here about was, you know, if you wanted to fucking make it in rock music back then you had to be down there. So here we are fucking almost Jesus Christ. 30 years later I finally get to fucking go down there on a Monday night and I got to play drums at the Roxy. It was fucking incredible. And I sucked when we practice, like on Thursday, I sucked on Sunday and then during soundcheck I was only okay. And I was like, God damn it. I had all these friends coming down ago. Wouldn't you fucking know? Cause you know I hadn't played and played since March and I'm a comedian, so I already sucked even when I was playing. And, uh, so went out and did my set dressed as fucking bottom and I sat down behind the kit. I don't know what happened.

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       I just took it, I don't know, just kind of fuck it right. And I ended up playing for me. I played great. I had the most fun. I was the loosest that I've ever been at a, it was fucking hilarious of playing the song. And uh, Dave Cushner who, uh, does the music for a f is for family and also was in velvet revolver. He was playing the song too when he always, you know, fucks around and shit makes me laugh. So I had this stupid fake mustache glued to my upper lip and he was making me laugh and I knew I couldn't smile. It was going to come off. So then half of it was fucking flap and he started laughing and then the thing literally floated off my face and we only halfway through the first song and then I had this stupid bandanna around the fucking John Bonam wig.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       That thing came off. Then the hair was in my face. I looked like the chick from the ring and my sunglasses started fogging up. So it's funny, I was playing, I was on a green sparkled kid dressed as John Bonam and we were playing ac DC. None of it made sense. So of course it was, you know, working because you know, you just fucking around. So then we did highway to hell. And in the end that was the encore. We did highway to hell. And then everybody, we bringing everybody out per crusher, um, who fucking destroyed. He opened, he did a red hot chili peppers, give it away now. And not only did he come out just wearing the sock, he talked to everybody in the band into doing that. Um, I was not out there for that. And, uh, then Margaret show went up, she fucking killed it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       Uh, Harlan Williams saying eyes without a face. He fucking killed it. And, uh, then Ron white went up and sang Leonard skittered give me three steps. I hope somebody took video with this shit. So I had to follow all of that. And uh, fortunately was a great crowd. And, uh, so anyway, so in the end they brought everybody out to sing highway to hell. And they kept me on drums. By then my hair is, that wig is in the face. I can't see through the fucking sunglasses. And in the end they just wanted me to keep doing like the symbol wash thing as the introduced everybody, you know, another round of applause for everybody. And I forgot and I couldn't see. So I kind of stopped playing and I kept hearing the guitars. It was a cluster fuck, but it was hilarious. And, uh, I want to thank everybody that came out and, um, I have to tell you that's the best sounding fucking drum kit I've ever played in my life. 26 inch bass drum. And the way my teacher, uh, tuned it up and the way they miked it up, it sounded fucking unbelievable. And what I loved was everyone in the band was saying how great the fucking kits sounded. And, uh, I dunno, I have to figure out, I swear to God, I have to figure out a place where I can just set that fucking thing up.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       That's the goal. That's what sucks about having a fucking, there's no place to play. When you play drums, you have a fucking guitar, you can turn down your ramp. There's no way to do it. And you know, as fun as those electronic kits are, I don't have just talking drums on this, but who gives a shit? I barely ever talk this much about drums. They got these drums. Like if you live in an apartment, right? The way it go if you still want to play is you buy a set of v drums. All right? Those are the best electronic drums as far as I'm concerned, that are out there. You buy that mid level one, so it's not that much money. There's always ones used on Ebay. And then what I used to do was I would put foam down on the floor, then just build the little two by fours and simply apply would just build a little drum riser.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       Okay. Put carpet on that foam and then another layer of carpet. Okay. And then you put the drums on top of that. And then what you do is you go downstairs and you meet your neighbor. You tell him, hey, I play drums. I'll only play during, this is what I used to do. I say, I'm, I'm stand up. I work nights. All right, I'll play during the day. Only Monday through Friday if I'm going to play, I play during the day. If for whatever reason, if you're ever home during those times, here's my phone number, just call this number and I will immediately stop. I mean, that's, that's the best you could fucking do. I told this story before and then the guy ended up being a cunt,

Speaker 4:          00:17:19       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       one time out of the 5,000 times I played, he ended up being home sick or some shit or he had a vacation and he called up, alright, I pick up the phone. I'm like, hello. And he just goes, can you knock it off like right out of the fucking gate?

Speaker 4:          00:17:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       And I was like, all right, Jesus, quite, I was younger then. Now it would've been like, dude, hey. Yeah, you don't fucking say that. Like you said it to me 50 fucking times. You can't, I gave you my number. I couldn't be any nicer. All right, I'm gonna stop, but go fuck yourself and please call me again if I bug you and I would have laughed at him and I would have left it at that. But anyways, um,

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       Three Ali is, you're not playing drums if you're on an electronic kit. I can't explain it. It's weird because if you're playing an electric guitar, you're really playing guitar, but there's just something about those electronic drums. I Dunno, I think, I think most dramas would agree with me. This is something that you play. You sit down on electronic drums and you're like, I, how have I not fucking toward the world is one of the greatest drummers of all time. This sounds fun. I sound incredible on this fucking thing. And then what happens is then you sit down, bind a real kit, and you actually have to make the sound happen. Rather than just fucking hitting somewhere on the pad and getting a nice snare sound or fucking bass drum. Then all of a sudden you get on a real kit, you're like, oh, that's right. That's right. I'm not one of the greatest dramas of all time. It's the exact opposite. I'm one of the worst fucking drummers that ever fucking lived. This is an embarrassment. I should be on an electronic kit cause at least those you can turn down. Um, so anyways, um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       I can't stop thinking of how fucking unbelievable those fucking drum sounded. I'll do. They sounded so fucking good in, in between. We played if you want blood and then when they will bring in everybody out. Like I was just, I still had to keep playing them. They sounded so fucking good. Play that beginning beats it in my time. A dying back bet to do [inaudible] they just founded. Oh, they sounded fucking amazing. That's killing me. I swear to God. I swear to God. Why the fuck did I build a gym out of my well, cause I didn't want to be a fat fuck. That'd be hilarious. If I built a drum room instead and I put those things out there, nobody could hear it. And then I didn't work out and I got fat and I started looking. You ever see those awful pictures of John Bonam when he had the fucking wife Beater on Jesus Christ and he's like 27 years old back then?

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       Like people just looked so fucking old. I don't know what, I don't know what was going on back in the day. You know, like they just showed that fucking lunatic, that fucking lunatic. John Hinckley who shot Ronald Reagan Shut Brady in the head, totally altered that guy's life. Quality of life. Forget me fucking people. He shut. They just let that guy out. And Oh, by the way, he was obsessed with Jodie foster cause he kept watching her in taxi and I, yeah, I think she was like 13 years old in that fuck it thing. Yeah, let's let that guy out that that's a good thing to do. Jesus fucking Christ, the guy's been in there for 35 fucking years. What's he gonna do? So you're going to go work or one of those yogurt shops. I mean, what, what exactly is the guy has no fucking resume, you know, Dick, imagine

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       that guy's fucking resume. What it must be like. Just be like, alright, he plug Mr Ankle. He, let's see here. And uh, see he was 25 when he got arrested. 1980, 81. Let's see. So let's just say, let's say he was a go getter. He got his first job at 16, so he would've had nine years on his resume. That takes us back to about, uh, about 1972. Let's see, in 1972, a, you had a job stocking shelves in a grocery store. He did that for a couple of years. Uh, you got a job at a bowling alley. It's gonna be all 70 shit, right?

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       It, uh, then you shot the president, right? And then there's a a, was it a 35 year gap? Okay. Shout the president. 1981. And now you, uh, you want to work here at staples. Tell you what, we're going to put this in the bin. I'm going to have a manager look at it. I want to thank you for coming in and, no, no, no, no. There's no reason to contact us. We'll, uh, we'll get back to you as soon as we can. I don't understand that. This is what I think they should do. They should fucking transfer Hinkley to wherever the fuck John Charlie Manson is. All right. Then you stick them in side by side cells and then they just host the reality show. You don't, neither one of them has seen the outside world for roughly the same time. Whatever. Charlie Manson's got like 10, 12 years on it. But at that point, once you're up to 35 fucking years, you know, Oh, I've been in for 47 years. It, that doesn't fucking make a difference. Right. Even you just have just fucking talk locally, locally. No, just have them talk about just, you know, random shit. You just show him a video. Give him a little glimpse of the outside world. Hey, uh, Charlie Manson, what'd you think about lady Gaga has meat dress, you know, but whatever the fuck's going on in the world, I don't know. All right. That's a bad idea.

Speaker 5:          00:22:52       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       Oh, is it? Is that a good reality show? We've taken some of the most infamous criminals of the past 50 years, stuck them all in a circle of cells and your eyes won't believe what happens next. Um, you know what's funny is I could probably get to at least the second level of pitching that show strong interest before the whole thing fell apart and they realized like, well, wait a minute. How the fuck are we going to get transferred this guy to the other prison? I the overhead's too high, you know? All right. There's always a moment with every podcast where it goes off the fucking rails. And I'm going to go out on a limb and say, it's this moment right here. This is the moment right now where I wonder, what the fuck am I going to talk about next? Um, do that guy 60 fucking years old now. He spent from 25 to years old in a fucking nuthouse and they're gonna, they're gonna let 'em out now. Well, fucking job. Cree is a 60 year old. Yeah, you got any yard computer skills? You sit in there. What are those? I mean those giant things from the $6 million man now. Now they're like [inaudible] they weigh like fucking three pounds now. You know, he probably thinks it's a plastic book. Um, I don't know what they said. They're gonna fucking try to monitor this guy. What the fuck is wrong with it? I just, I don't understand it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       I don't understand that. Like it isn't a thing too. If you're going to fucking give a guy 35 fucking years, just put him out of his fucking misery. Right. Wow. What would you rather do? Would you rather spend 30 years in a 35 years? 25 to 60 no one had 60 you get out or they can give you the old right there. Fred, you know, your choice. I think I'd choose a fire in squad if I had to go out fucking get electrocuted, you know, or have you put me down like some old collie with a little fucking injection. I don't want that shit. Who would want that? I don't just fucking have me in front of a firing squad. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       Hey did we not the face just fucking center mass. Boom. Done over. All right. Here we go. Did I mention, I can't remember cause I started this podcast a couple of times here that I mentioned. I got some new dates coming up. Okay. I've mentioned the European dates. I've got some new dates coming up that are going on sale this Friday and I'm very excited about this because these are the shows. These are the shows that I'm doing as I'm getting ready to do my fifth hour long standup special. Very proud of that. My five year five special anniversary. Okay, here we go. I've got to make update coming up. Coming up. Hey, it's coming up. Um, this is in Huntington, New York at the paramount theater. Wednesday, September 7th is a 7:00 PM and a 10:00 PM show. This is the makeup show for that show that I canceled, uh, due to weather out on long island, um, earlier this year, back in January, I believe. I'm finally making that one up. And then on September 8th, I'm in, uh, at the Charleston Galley Yard Center in Charleston, South Carolina. September 10th. I'm in North Fork, Virginia at Chrysler Hall. Uh, September 11th, Sunday I'm in Richmond, I'm in Richmond, Virginia at the Altria theater. And then, um, let's see, the next weekend I'm swimming with great white sharks. I'll tell you about that later. Uh, oh Jesus. Getting over a fear.

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       Stupid Thursday, September 29th I'm in Madison, Wisconsin at the Orpheum theater. October 1st. Holy fucking shit. Okay. Does that say all my Honda Brasco it's just gonna be my triumphant return to, to know I have not been in Nebraska since. Okay. Since I was always doing college kicks. I don't, I can't remember the last time I was there. The Orpheum theater. Okay. That's going down on October 1st all right. This is when we're getting down to crunch time. We're getting closer to the special Thursday, October 6th. I'm in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox theater. Friday I talk October 7th. I'm in Gainesville, Florida. All right. What the fuck would a goddamn Yankee like me be doing down in Gainesville, Florida and Friday, October 7th. Well, I'll tell you what, boy, I tell you what. Okay. That's because on October 8th the LSU Tigers are playing the Florida gators down there on the swamp. I cannot fucking wait to go to that game.

Speaker 1:          00:27:48       Uh, I love both those programs. And A, I've always been a dream of mine as a sports fan to always to go into that stadium before they tear it down and gave him some new flashy new one that fucking looks like everybody else's. I just want to see the layout, like that whole section of that weird wall where it just says the swamp. Like what the, there was that one that was multipurpose stadiums that they, they used to be able to spin it around and to make it a baseball diamond. And then after a while it just broke and they said, fuck it. It's a football field. I have no idea. But I want to go see that. A very unique looking stadium and their fans are fucking awesome. And a as it's SCC football. And then from a Saturday, October 15th to Thursday, October 20th I'm going to be in Washington DC at the national theater.

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       Now what's great about that is, uh, I'll be doing probably a couple shows at night. Oh, it's, yeah. Theater. Oh No, actually no. Maybe I'll just be doing one tonight. I don't know when I'm gonna be doing, but, um, that's the crunch time. I'm working every single Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, doing a little residency I believe is what they call before I get ready to do my special. And um, I never write my shit down. And this time is a few things that I think I'm actually going to try writing out and then improving on it and just seeing how it goes on this special just to try something different. You know, I'm always trying to do something a little different. Can't be giving you the same old bill every fucking special. Right. So, uh, I'm very excited about that. Uh, I'm ridiculously excited about the, uh, European tour coming up, not excited about the long flight and um, you know, the lovely Nia will not be going with me to those fucking shows.

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       I'm just doing it cause it's a thrash. I mean it's all right for me cause I get that they at the higher doing the show, but she's just going to be getting fucking, hey, you like this city. All right, here's another one. You know, every fucking day. I think that would get a little old. But uh, so any who, um, I think that's it, right? Is that my little half hour? Did I do my little fucking pennants for the week here? Huh? Oh, I'm seven seconds underneath. Um, thank you to everybody. Once again, they came out to the goddamn comedy jam and thank you to Josh, Anna Myers and all those guys for letting me get to play at the Roxy dude dressed as John Bond and plaintiff's 71 Ludwig wicked me fucking, you know what I mean? That's, that's some shit some day when I'm fucking old and I'm staring at the wall still drinking.

Speaker 1:          00:30:16       Of course I'm going out like Peter O'Toole, right? Still fucking drinking. I'm just going to have the greatest smile on my face just thinking about shit like that. Like I fucking did that. That was so much fucking fun. And, uh, it was just great. I will do that show as long as they fucking do it. And, uh, so that's it. And, um, yeah, that's it. Now I'm off to Ireland. Next time I talked to you. I don't know where I'm going to be. I don't know where I'm going to leave, Ilana. I think I'm going to be over in, uh, I think I'll have already done the three dates in Ireland. Maybe, or maybe not. I don't know. All I know is I think I drive from Bristol to Manchester, England. And if I have time, I have to pay my respects at John Bottom's grave and I have to do it in a row.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       I going to do it. No fucking selfie. None of that bullshit. Uh, you know, tried to do in a classy fucking way. You know what I mean? I always remember, cause I went to Elvis's house one time and I just felt bad. I went there to actually laugh, like, oh, get a bit out of this. And I went to his house, Graceland, and I just felt bad. I just felt like I was intruding on the guy's personal life and uh, uh, if they had like a gift shop across the street with like Elvis cuckoo clocks, like decades, one of the most exploited fucking entertainers of all fucking time. I mean the guy's been dead for almost 40 years to still make money off his fucking image. Um, then the end, you walk by his grave and the back, it's just like a bunch of people just walking by and Yammer and, and saying dumb shit and they're just to sound a fucking flip flops and poverty just walking by.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       It was just bad. It's like, well, what are we doing here? What are we doing? Are there like an Elvis head? The three TVs, cause at least the lock to watch all the fucking games and the TVs are all fucking out of date. But you know something, when I went in there into his house, I really saw how fucking like, yeah, this must've been the only place that this guy could go to escape how famous he was. And it must've been really nice for him to be here and just be able to chill and relax. And it's just really fucking ironic that this place that was so peaceful for him is that we're all traipsing through it all trying to stretch our heads and look up to the fucking the upstairs. So maybe you can see the toilet that he fucking collapsed from, you know, it's really bad. All right. I guess I'm going to end on that. All right. And I commend anybody who really honestly sits there and watches these Republican and Democratic national conventions at this point. If you can actually sit through there. I didn't watch it, but did, uh, did the fucking guy there,

Speaker 6:          00:32:54       um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:55       Bernie Sanders, did he, did he just completely flip flop and Endorse Hillary? Is that what he did? I mean, just how can I just not think. I just don't understand is how you can sit there watching somebody in a debate trashing somebody and trashing them and trash from trash them saying why they think they're going to be awful. And then when the person they say is going to be awful beats them, they then just do a fucking one 80. It'd be like, I think there's person that I said sucked is going to make a great president and as my full endorsement.

Speaker 6:          00:33:27       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       so anyways. All right. That's it. I'm done. Yap. And uh, that's it. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm still fucking buzzing off that fucking show Monday night.

Speaker 8:          00:37:49       do rather well. When my, my eyes were watching news, they closed and I was still listening for when my hand was holding hers, she whispered words bouncing around the room. [inaudible] spoke and I was bouncing around the room. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:38:28       Hey, what's going on? This is bill bar, the Monday morning podcast and this is the third attempt at trying to be remotely amusing on this thing. Cause A, I've been on vacation last week and I'm too unhappy and I'm too relaxed. I had a great time down Nantucket, one of the, uh, one of the widest places on the planet. It's not that what's funny, I just literally had to pause when I said one of the, what is things? Because someone of color was coming by and for some reason I thought that it was going to be viewed as racist. Like I was actually going like, yeah, it was really white. It was awesome. It was actually, it was so white. I believe my level of whiteness was actually offensive, if you can believe it. And uh, yeah, very, uh, I can't explain the welfare. It's, I don't know, I was staying out in Sconsin, which is even more snooty than on Nantucket.

Speaker 9:          00:39:28       But, uh, if you ever get out there is a little a tip I'll give you, take a trip of the, a fucking brewery out there. The hell's the name of it. Uh, Cisco, Cisco Brewers, they make their own beer, wine and vodka out there and uh, go on their website. If you're a big vodka drinker, cisco.com I believe, but just look up Cisco Brewer's CIS, c o I'm telling you, this shit is smoother than greatness. It's, it's unbelievable. I guess the island sits on an aquifer. The amount of times people told me that in the last week, it's just some point it would come up. Uh, you know, this island sits on an aqua for and like you, I was like, what the fuck is an aquifer? I was on vacation so the fuck wasn't there. It was more like, oh, and what might an aquifer be? Evidently, uh, you know, I don't know what it is.

Speaker 9:          00:40:26       I was going to go on the Internet and I was going to look it up, but as far as I could tell from the drunk people in their boat shoes and their tiger woods shorts, they was saying that a Nantucket was formed from a glacier and somehow, uh, I don't know what sits on fresh water and the water trickles under all kinds of bedrock and shipped from Massachusetts and ship that just really killed the cleanest of the water. It fucking comes from Massachusetts and shit. It's like really fucking clear. But yeah, it goes right underneath the ocean and I guess it comes right up and a, that's how they make their pod could taste so good. I learned that the trick that all my life when I had no idea that the cleaner the water, the smoother and more pure euro your heart stuff is.

Speaker 9:          00:41:15       So maybe that's why all those hillbillies and they can moonshine up in the Appalachian trail. You know, you, they talked to somebody, not 10 people I know who, who've walked the Appalachian trail and somehow got Lyme disease and a, you know, I'm all up for an adventure. But when you get like a disease that they did an episode about on little house on the prairie, you know what I mean? Basically some 1800 shit, you know what I mean? You get a, it's all looked the other way. I mean we've all uh, put the gun to my head, you know what I'm saying? That's a modern disease. But you get like typhoid fever or the plague. I'll say what's fucked up man. I was reading this book on the population and uh, I think I talked about this. I can't, I can't remember last week I was doing podcast from a bathroom in this cabin I was staying at, cause it's the only place I could get some sort of cell phone service, but uh, to reading this book about population and basically I think medicine is what really fucked us over. A lot of people think it's dumb people fucking and creating more people. That's really caused the population problem, but it isn't. It's smart people giving dumb people penicillin that has caused the population explosion. And A, I can't stress to you enough, having traveled as much as I had truly. How many people need to die in an avalanche for us to ever save the polar bears?

Speaker 9:          00:42:50       I know the fuck I'm talking about going to Goddamn Sunburn on my brain here. All right. Now if you're new to my page, man, I got a big thing coming up here. Uh, I was saying last week my special was coming out on August 23rd, they just moved the day by my own one hour stand up special coming out on comedy central on August 31st all right. And it's called, why do I do this? And it's actually coming on after one of Dane pokes specials, which is great because he has like 9 million fans. So if a third of them hang around it's going to be a great thing for me. Um, yeah, August 31st and this week my CD comes out, we'll be in stores, uh, of the same name. It's basically a CD of the specialists coming out on 31st. Then in September the DVD will be coming out. So look for all that and stores.

Speaker 9:          00:43:38       I'll have more information this week and I'll be putting something up on my website as far as, uh, they give you all that information. But let's get down to the podcast questions cause my flight's going to be leaving here soon. My flight to Charlotte and then on to La. I don't know why I got the connecting flights. Seemed like a good idea. Fucking stupid. All right. Uh, Bill with all, uh, the latest postings. What the fuck did my laptop just do? What are you doing? Hello? Hang on. You know that when you try to click on something and then it selects it and then just start to going 90 miles an hour down the page. All right, bill, with all this posting of late have a spontaneous crowd members heckles and interruptions. It's getting me wonder about, wondering about a couple of things I butchered reading that question.

Speaker 9:          00:44:24       They're basically saying in the last month I put a couple of postings on youtube and on my mind space page of people yelling out random shit during my shows. Uh, her question is, uh, you've seen or his question, I don't know who sent this. You seem to be pretty nice generally to these people, even if they're being a dick, but I'm sure that's always, that's not always the case. Have you ever offended someone to the point of them trying to fight you or made someone cry or something else really awkward? Um, actually, you know what, the two people heckling me, the lady going, thank you. And the guy who was in the crowd who was blind, neither. Neither one of them will be in malicious, which is why I wasn't being malicious back to them. You know what I mean? That's kind of how I work at.

Speaker 9:          00:45:08       If someone's being a dick to me, I become a nuclear Dec to them cause you have to out get them. You know what I'm saying? It's weird. You gotta be, you gotta go 10 times meter than they're ever going to go. You know what I mean? It's like that untouchables. They bring a knife, you bring a gun, you know they make funny you fucking pen. You talk about their mother's vagina cancer or something. I know it's disgusting, right. But you know, I don't make the rules. That's how it works. All right? You want to change the stand up world. You go do the late show. You go do the third show, Saturday night in the middle of fucking nowhere. And you tell me that vaginal cancer does not seem like a viable means of self defense. I'm not wishing that on anybody, but, uh, I'm not above bringing it up and wishing it on a crowd number.

Speaker 9:          00:45:58       I Dunno. And it's hypothetical mother. All right. That was brutal. Um, anyways, have you ever offended someone to the point of them trying to fight you? Uh, yeah. I had one girl chased me around the state one time and uh, I didn't know what to do, you know, cause she was abroad and if I hit her I'm going to go to jail, which is a funny thing about that. You know what I mean? It's like they get up there and they've got a glass and they want to smash it over your head. You know, I'm not trying to be a dick, but at the end of the day that is, you know, the average woman is, weighs over a hundred pounds, you know, upwards of 150 you know, the average broad out there, you know, they got some a d titties, they might be pushing one 60, who knows, right? You start swinging a glass.

Speaker 9:          00:46:38       You know, I never took a physics class, but you can really fuck somebody up. But for some reason because they have a vagina cancer free of course. Um, all of a sudden now I have to stand there. There's really, there's really no way to get out of it without looking like a tool. Either stand there and you let some girls smash you over the head and be, you run away and you look like the biggest fag ever. Or see you blast them in the face and uh, you know, then you look like, you know, you look like a wife beater rather than no. There was another adult who they, rational brain who was, you had a glass which is considered a a is that attempted murder if you smash it, I know if you smash a bottle over, somebody said that's assault with a deadly weapon.

Speaker 9:          00:47:28       I do know that as is if you bumped into somebody with your car, I learned that how the one, I'll tell you that story here in a minute. Basically what happens is lady came up on stage so I didn't know what the fuck to do. So I just picked up the mic. Stan and I put it between her and myself, sort of alligator armed. It didn't have an extended way out cause I would seem too hostile. So I kind of had it, you know, I didn't want to have it up against me because that would defeat the purpose. So I kind of had to halfway, you know, so it was like I was extending an olive branch in a way and I basically backed up in a circle and she was so drunk. She kept following me until a place. She, I think she got tired.

Speaker 9:          00:48:06       It was danger fields where it happened. And uh, of course there's no security there so they probably just sitting there laughing in their oceans 11 waste cloak from waist length, red coats, math, fucking, why am I even trying to be funny here on to fun to relax. I'll be funny next week. I already forgot the story that I told you I was going to tell you. Jesus Christ. Let me go back here a second. What the fuck was, I was talking about being on stage, somebody chasing you. Oh, the car thing. But that's right. What time? I was in a car. Right. And that was driving. Isn't that unbelievable? Yeah. I know. I'm living an amazing life driving down the street and uh, I put on my left directional, it's getting to the left lane. So there's this lady in the left lane, but there's enough room for me to get in.

Speaker 9:          00:48:54       But she does the conti thing. She stomps on the gas. Right. So, you know, trying not to let me in, you know what I mean? Then drives, you know, she basically cut me off. She doesn't let me until I get behind her, I'd be better. So she beats at me. So I'm like, what the fuck? I'm right. You cut me off. I be back at her. And then she just snapped. She just slammed on the horn and held it all the way up to this red light, which was like a football field away. She just went like, eh. So like a half a mile staring at me. I could see her VDI staring at me in the rear view mirror, came all the way up to the red light, my hand. And the second she stopped, I just beat real quick. I went to sleep just to piss her off just so I'd get it last, you know, the next thing you know, I just see her reverse lights come on and she fucking, uh, she backed into the front of my car really lightly and I'm like, what the fuck is this girl doing?

Speaker 9:          00:49:53       And then I see a reaching into the glove box and I was like, oh my God, she's got a gun. And there was somebody behind me so I couldn't get out. And Uncle Eddie, I panicked. I didn't know what to do. So she jumps out of the car and you know, I rolled down my window like a crack because I'm so scared. Right. You know this, this psycho lady. I'm like, what's your problem? She, she ended up having a pad and a piece of paper and she wrote down my license plate number. Then she jumped in the car and she drove away. Unfortunately somebody saw it and they said, hey, was that a friend of yours? Cause that's how lightly she hit me. I said, no, that was some psycho. And the person gave me their business card, which I kept. So because I'm a fucking Moron, oh, I just completely forgotten about it.

Speaker 9:          00:50:37       And next thing you know, I'm on the road and all of a sudden I get a phone call. Yes. Hello. This is a offices Shepard calling from the Elsa Gunda police department investigating a, a hit and run possible assault with a deadly weapon. Basically what she did was she backed her car into my car and then said I rear-ended her. Um, but I had the business card so I was able to get out of it. And uh, you know, who knows, I don't know what would have happened. You know, I could've gone to jail and uh, someone that tried to rape me and then I'd have to kill him and then I'd be like Tom Selleck and that really bad movie, you know, that's why I like Shawshank redemption. That's the only one with the dude actually. They show what would happen if an accountant goes to jail.

Speaker 9:          00:51:23       You know, he doesn't start with doing weights and somehow take over the jail. Now, you know what happens? He gets fucking raped and he gets raped for years. And that's why you always want to have a fucking alibi, okay? Especially if you have a bad marriage. If you're going through a tough time, whenever you go out, always make sure you've got a friend with you, okay? Because if you don't, someday when someone does you the favor of lacking that fucking chick that you stick of ad they're going to blame it on you. And then you know what? You're going to get raped repeatedly unless you're good at math, you know, and the warden's a piece of shit and your shiny shoes or whatever the fuck that plays out. I don't know. I don't know. Look, all I know is this. I got a special coming out August 31st called, why do I do this?

Speaker 9:          00:52:13       Please do me a favor. Tell as many people as you know, and even people you don't know, just bug people. Just tell them to watch. It's August 31st my cds coming out this week, August 31st comedy central, and then, uh, my DVD comes out in September. I don't know why it's happening like this, but that's the way it's happening. So, um, please watch that and then come out and see me cause I've already written a whole new hour cause cause I'm the shit. They don't, that's what I, not the shit. You know who's getting killed. I'm fucking, I'm on my way to be in the shit. Trying to be the shit. All right. That's why we're not, that's the real reason why wrote another hour. Actually that's not the real reason. The real reason why I wrote this, cause I'm so fucking paranoid once my materially has been out there that, you know, that's a big nightmare.

Speaker 9:          00:52:57       My being on stage telling a joke and having the whole proud going, you already do do on TV. What the fuck? And then I just started bombing and then somehow it spreads across the Internet. No one ever goes to my shows again. I got to move back in with my parents. Then again, I'm working in a warehouse again on loading trucks. You know what I mean? Catastrophizing, I believe is the thought process. Um, okay, I'm going to wrap this thing up. I'm going to be at the comedy works. These are the gigs in August, and we'll get the comedy works in, uh, Denver, Colorado, uh, starting this Thursday. I think that's July 31st through, uh, Saturday night, August 2nd. And uh, go to my website, [inaudible] dot com to get all the information. I'll be at the Miami improv somewhere around August 12th. I don't have the fucking dates in front of me there.

Speaker 9:          00:53:52       They're sitting right there in the mind space page. You can say it. And then after that, I believe I'm doing, I'm doing the stress factory in New Jersey, New Jersey. Sorry, I got the hiccups now. Um, I'm trying to think if I can remember anymore. Podcast questions. Somebody asked me a great question. I didn't drop it, but it was a copy and paste it where I can read it right now. What the fuck was that? It had something to do. What is the most overrated thing you ever saw in your life and what do you think is the most underrated? And uh, that's, that's too big a topic to just come up with one answer. I'm going to answer even more of it next week. But the shit off the top of my head that I could say was the most overrated shit of all time. Uh, let's see, Josh Hartnett the strokes.

Speaker 9:          00:54:41       Tony Manda rich, any old sports fans out there? Remember that guy? The incredible bulk scat was an offensive line. They put them on the cover of sports illustrated. I Dunno what they thought he was going to fucking do, but a, he didn't do it. Uh, what else was overrated? Fame. Not, not being famous. Just that TV show fame. Everybody seems to love that show. Bruce Springsteen. I don't get it. I don't fucking get it. You know the guy sells that giant stadium 19 times in a row. So a, it's gotta be me, but I'll tell ya, I don't, I don't get it. I don't, I don't fucking get it. So I guess that's not underrated. That would be one. How about this? A good, here's a good one for you guys. Why don't you guys answer me this one. What's the most popular thing that everybody was into that you didn't get?

Speaker 9:          00:55:37       Okay. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not trashing Bruce Springsteen like he's fucking, you know, in sync or a boy band. You know what I mean? I'm talking about like, like you know those fucking plastic. See through clogs that everybody seems to be wearing now. Crops, you know, I don't get it. The only person who wears shoes like that is stuck in Mario Battalion. Okay. And I'll let you can make pasta through the well method. You shouldn't be wearing those pocket things. Okay? I didn't care if you were on hell's kitchen. Just the worst fucking show on TV. Just can't believe it. What else? People sit there and they let that guy yell at him. It's bad enough you've got to go. Yes, chef. You know what I'm saying? Like he won a war or something. Fucking guy makes tuna tar tar. Get over yourself. I W I haven't had a child who just allowed themselves to be yelled at by a fucking chef to that level.

Speaker 9:          00:56:34       That guy looks like an Inchcape. Bobby Kelly. I know Bobby Kelly's losing weight. You guys should go encourage him by the way. Look Great. Last time I saw him. This, I'm looking at the after picture of Bobby Kelly walking by that he will get to because I have faith in them. Um, what else the fuck was I talking about? Oh yeah. The shit that everybody's into that, that I just, I just don't let them get, you know, I'll tell you something that's really fucking underrated. Water water's really underrated. Water's one of the most underrated things of all time. There is no reason for coke, soda, these fucking sports strengths. See electoral lights and all that shit. They did. Districts the water. I'll tell you what else is underrated. If you eat a banana and apple and an orange and then later on the day you just have a house salad, you will be as regular as a fucking race horse.

Speaker 9:          00:57:36       How these stupid shows on commercials. What does it take? Giving people pills, at least fucking old people, you know, bottles down working anymore. It's like if they would just eat some fruit, you know what I mean? Eat some fruit and then have a fucking salad and I'm telling you moon river, any fletch fans out there? Um, what else? What else was fucking a, I'll tell you know what? I'll tell you the one thing that ever lived, lived up to the hype was the iPod. The iPod is one of the few things, you know what I'm saying? They never lived up to the heights. And speaking of hype, I'm going to see Batman this week. And uh, as far as I know, he's Leger lives up to the hype plan. Uh, playing the joker. I tell it was fucked up. Somebody had the amount of people who came up to me with theories as to why he, oh, cause people thought he killed himself rather than he sort of took the wrong stuff the wrong time. You know what I mean? Rung them out. You know, somebody told me, he goes, you know, like, you know what? I know why. I know why. I don't know why. I know why he killed himself. He was, he was losing his hair.

Speaker 9:          00:58:53       Can you fucking believe that is one of the dumbest still, like, like he couldn't affair of, like, he couldn't, he couldn't afford a fucking hair plugs. I'll get one of those. John Travolta wigs. You don't want to saying, we'll just shave you fucking head. Take a nod from me. You know what I mean? Why would you kill yourself? Just get it. You know, I just, I don't, I don't buy that the guy didn't kill himself. He just, unfortunately, I don't know what happened. I haven't like, I'm going to try to act like I'm trapper John and d here, you know, which I'm not obviously haven't even played a doctor on TV, have I? No, I haven't. I like it. I like how it only took me eight seconds to, to run mentally through my whole fucking acting career. Um, so anyways, what time is it here?

Speaker 9:          00:59:43       Oh, Shit. All right, my plane's going to be born here in a few minutes. Um, once again, uh, thanks to everybody who came out to my shows in Pittsburgh, please everybody watch my special on August 31st called, why do I do this on comedy central? Uh, my CD comes out this week, I believe on August 4th or fifth. Uh, try to find that in stores. And, um, you guys really seem to be liking these random videos that I've been making. Uh, I just been kinda taping every set that I do and if, uh, if I'm basically is what I'm going to do is if I buy, just go off on a risk that's kind of specific to that city or if I have a good back and forth with somebody. It's a great way to give you guys some new laughs without me having to burn any material. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 9:          01:00:30       Yo. You know what I'm saying? Um, all right. That's it. You guys all have a good week. Thanks for listening to my podcast and, uh, I'm working on a new website and I will be putting all of my blogs up there. Okay. That's why I haven't blogged in a while. I haven't been blogging, but I have not posted any of them because, uh, evidently the Facebooks, the myspace and the friend stirs they own anything you post up there, they own, like, I can still make a book of my blogs, which is what I'd like to do. But so can they, and a, you know, I don't like working for free. I don't know about you guys, but I don't like doing that. So you know, I'm just going to start the whale blog on my space from here on out is I will just put something, you know, hey, I wrote a blog and then I'll just put a link to my website.
