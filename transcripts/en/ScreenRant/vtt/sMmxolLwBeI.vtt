00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.840
The term “spoiler alert” is all it takes
to send the Internet into a frenzy.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.160
Moviegoers love reading up on their most anticipated
films, but the world wide web can be a minefield

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.300
full of secrets viewers don’t want to know.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.470
Whether it’s a plot twist, a surprise character
appearance, or even the ending of the movie,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.840
audiences have to be careful about what they
read and watch, or the whole experience could

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.840
be ruined.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.440
Sometimes, even when they’re extremely careful,
they still find out about spoilers from some

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.440
unlikely sources.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.430
Here are 10 movie secrets that were spoiled
before release.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.909
Captain America: Civil War

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.940
Marvel fans were ecstatic when it was announced
Spider-Man would finally be part of the Marvel

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.729
Cinematic Universe, making his debut in Captain
America: Civil War.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.670
For most of the marketing campaign, the studio
kept his role in the film under wraps, and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.390
there was a debate as to whether the web head
would be part of Team Iron Man or Team Cap.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.250
Marvel spilled the beans when the second Civil
War trailer premiered and ended with a shot

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.659
of Spidey stealing Cap’s shield and announcing
himself to the world.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.750
It made sense from an advertising perspective,
but some would have preferred Spider-Man didn’t

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.840
show up until the actual film.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.030
Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.369
Just about everything from Zack Snyder’s
superhero crossover proved to be divisive,

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.960
and that includes the trailers.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.330
Warner Bros. released a preview in December
2015 that received a healthy dose of criticism

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.320
for playing as a condensed version of the
feature film.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.510
It outright revealed that Doomsday would be
the big bad that Batman, Superman, and Wonder

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.969
Woman team up to fight, taking the attention
away from the titular Batman vs. Superman

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:39.969
conflict.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.939
By the time the film arrived, audiences were
just waiting for that sequence instead of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.710
getting lost in the story, which certainly
didn’t help its mixed reception.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.119
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.569
Having a talented actor like Liam Neeson appear
in a Star Wars movie is a treat for fans,

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.939
but he unfortunately wouldn’t be around
for long.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.679
Viewers learned that his Qui-Gon Jinn wouldn’t
make it out alive when the movie’s soundtrack

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.729
track list was released, including the tune
“Qui-Gon’s Noble End.”

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.900
That stripped the film of some much-needed
dramatic tension and was just overall disappointing.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.930
For their part, Lucasfilm seems to have learned
from the mistake, withholding both the score

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.000
and novelization for The Force Awakens until
the day Episode 7 had already premiered.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.760
They deserve credit for that, if nothing else.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.760
Cast Away

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.470
As one of the best actors of his generation,
Tom Hanks can sell audiences on just about

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.610
any concept, and Cast Away was the ultimate
test.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.650
Hanks spent most of his screen time isolated
from society, with only a volleyball named

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.070
Wilson to talk to.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.220
What should have been a suspenseful tale of
survival became just another film when Cast

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.940
Away’s trailer actually revealed that Hanks
made it off the desert island alive – having

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.940
been gone for a period of four years.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.120
The movie is still good, but imagine how much
more compelling it could have been if the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.390
studio left that one big question untouched.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.390
Speed

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.790
One of the most tense thrillers of the 1990s,
the drama of Speed comes from a bus constantly

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.680
driving at 55 mph or more – or it will explode.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.040
The people who cut the film’s trailer must
have missed that memo, because they spoiled

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400
a key plot development in the preview.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.120
It was bad enough they included a shot of
the bus exploding, but it was quickly followed

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.620
by the cast reacting to what had just happened.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.340
Knowing that everyone got off the vehicle
alive before it blew up basically ruins the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.210
enjoyment of watching Speed – even though
there was still a train at the end.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.210
Creed

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.690
One of the many recent soft reboots passing
the torch to a new generation of characters,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.760
Rocky installment Creed placed the spotlight
on Adonis Johnson – son of Apollo Creed.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.910
The trailers promised a return to the stripped
down gritty drama of the original film, and

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.320
something a little extra.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.420
The second preview revealed that the Italian
Stallion himself would fall ill at one point

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.420
in the movie.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.520
This was a gut punch, but it wasn’t necessary
to sell Creed to general audiences.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.580
Seeing Stallone as Rocky again was enough.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.770
If the studio had kept his bout with cancer
completely under wraps, then maybe that plot

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.860
point would have hit harder than it did.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.920
Wreck-it Ralph

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.410
These days, not even coloring books are safe
from movie spoilers.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.570
Audiences don’t learn that King Candy is
the main villain of Disney’s Wreck-it Ralph

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.030
until the end of the film – and that he’s
a completely different character from what

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.030
he says he is.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.610
But children eager to color their favorite
video game characters ahead of time learned

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.040
the surprise well in advance.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.040
That’s right.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.829
A Wreck-it Ralph coloring book was released
two weeks before the movie, and it spoiled

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.019
the film’s climax.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.689
This may not be the most highly publicized
entry on our list, but there’s no denying

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.650
it’s an odd and frustrating way of having
the experience ruined.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.419
Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.720
Arguably the most famous plot twist of all-time
is Darth Vader’s startling revelation to

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.960
Luke Skywalker.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.820
Even people who haven’t seen the Star Wars
films know about it.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.330
Before George Lucas unleashed that secret
on the world, he kept it so hidden, a fake

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.710
line was used during principal photography.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.180
But David Prowse – the man in the Vader
suit – knew about it well before 1980.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.230
During a fan event in 1978, Prowse was quoted
in a newspaper as saying Vader is Luke’s

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.230
father.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.889
Studios these days have media trained their
actors to perfection, so one can only imagine

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.569
what would have happened if Prowse pulled
this off today.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.169
X-Men: Apocalypse

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.029
No matter the era in which it takes place,
an X-Men film is always going to find time

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:09.029
for Wolverine.

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.850
The poster boy of the franchise, it’s impossible
to separate Hugh Jackman’s mutant from the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.850
series.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.379
But for a while, it looked like this summer’s
X-Men: Apocalypse was going to break the streak.

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.240
That is, until a trailer was released weeks
before the film premiered and ended with Wolverine

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.370
bearing his bloodied claws for the camera.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.310
Throw that in with the revelation Quicksilver
is Magneto’s son, the Apocalypse marketing

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.680
team left everything out on the table to get
fans interested.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.830
Those are our picks for movie secrets that
were spoiled before release.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.860
Are there any we missed?

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.629
