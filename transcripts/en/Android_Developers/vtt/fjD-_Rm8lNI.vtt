00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.450
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.920
Hello, my name is Roman Nurik
from the Android Developer

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.890
Relations team.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.440
In today's Design Bite, I want
to show you how to take an

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.700
existing icon and flatten it
to better match Android's

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.130
flatter style for things like
action bar icons or

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.060
notification icons.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.950
Now, this is a technique that
works with Raster Icons,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.420
things like PNGs.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.710
Ideally, you'd be starting with
vector shapes, things

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.060
like Illustrator files or vector
shapes in Photoshop and

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.190
working on those.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.060
But in some cases, you
simply don't have

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.030
those source materials.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.620
And in some cases, it's actually
really hard to

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.530
replicate the icon using
vector shapes.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.170
So let's take a look at how to
do this in Photoshop-- how to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.040
take and existent icon and
flatten it to better match

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.450
that style.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.510
So the first thing we're going
to do is open up an existing

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.715
graphic here.

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:05.620
We're going to just tweak the
setup a little bit to make it

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.400
a little easier to work with.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.270
And we're going to create
a new fill layer.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.235
It's going to be black.

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.210
And we're going to put
it at the bottom,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.671
below the primary layer.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.760
Now, the next step is to
merge these two layers.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.560
And then go into the
Curves tool.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.800
And this Curves tool is going
to let you tweak the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.550
brightness values of the
pixels in your icon.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.720
These brightness values will
in the end becomes the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.070
transparency or alpha values
for the final icon.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.880
So we'll take our black
background and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.820
leave that as black.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.250
And we'll take those grey and
we'll make that the brightest

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.070
part or the most opaque
part of the icon.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.970
We'll then select the entire
icon, select the entire layer.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.080
We'll copy it onto the clipboard
and we'll create a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.820
new channel.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.090
Now, this channel is going
to be basically the final

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.390
alpha-channel for our
resulting graphic.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.150
And we'll paste that graphic
that have in the clipboard

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.810
into this alpha-channel.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.970
And this is the big step, the
key step here is to then load

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.700
this alpha-channel
as a selection.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.170
And that's going to be using
this button at the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.180
bottom right now.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.340
Now, once we have that
alpha-channel loaded into a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.200
selection, we can go back into
the layers palette and create

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.690
a new layer.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.720
And then simply fill
our selection with

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.250
a foreground color.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.960
Now, this foreground
color should depend

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.950
entirely on your needs.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.880
If you're creating an action bar
icon or you're using the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.480
normal hollow dark and hollow
light styling, then you can

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.500
get the right color and opacity
values from the action

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.670
bar iconography section
in the design guide.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.730
Or if you're trying to use a
different color that better

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.400
matches your brand, this is
the point at which you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.800
can put that in.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.950
So we'll simply fill the
selection and then deselect

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.510
our selection.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.150
And then get rid of
the original icon.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.070
And that's it.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.130
What we're left with is
basically a layer.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.060
You can turn this into a Smart
Object to re-size it down to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.510
smaller sizes.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.980
But we're left with a layer that
has a single foreground

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.450
color with no special effects
or anything like that.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.660
And we can use this as
potentially a source material

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.280
for smaller icons.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.860
And that's it for today's very
quick Design Bite on how to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.800
use Photoshop to take an
existing icon and flatten it.
