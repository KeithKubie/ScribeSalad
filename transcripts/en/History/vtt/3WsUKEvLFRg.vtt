<i>- Welcome to Connecticut.</i>

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.297
And welcome to my forge.

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.591
<i>I'm Brian Evelich,
and I've been bladesmithing</i>

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:10.009
<i>for about
a year and a quarter.</i>

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.846
Everything in my forge has a
story.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.764
My coal forge was a gift
from a friend

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.225
who was getting rid of an old
barbecue.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.977
And I welded it in a basin,

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:22.355
and I did an air injection
system using steel piping.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.691
Later on, about six months
later,

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.985
I decided I needed
a propane forge.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.738
And I welded together a frame
with fire brick,

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.698
and I made my own propane
forge.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.700
When I first started
making knives,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.369
I was using the bumper
on the back of my truck

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.122
as an anvil because I didn't
have anything else.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.082
And I put a Facebook post out,

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:44.294
and a high school friend
responded that he had an anvil

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.879
sitting in his garage.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.089
As it turns out,
I find out later,

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.092
it was used to make horseshoes
for Washington's army

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:53.386
as they crossed
through central New Jersey

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.971
back during
the Revolutionary War.

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.308
Up here are just some
of the blades I've made

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.226
that I felt were noteworthy,
and I've kept around.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:04.022
I love the kukri episodes. The
shapes just really thrill me.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:06.065
So I tried to make a couple
of kukri

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.651
just to kind of have
around the shop.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:13.573
- I'm Deke Parker,
and I'm from Elkhart, Kansas.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.991
This is my shop.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.035
I usually run this two-burner
propane forge.

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:20.413
Bought this forge when I was
ten years old.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.916
I was actually forging with a
torch before that,

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.084
so I was about nine when I
started--nine and ten.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:29.130
Over here this is my--it's
about 125 pounds,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.133
plus the chain--Acme anvil.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.510
Funny story on that.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.178
That actually came out of my
boss's backyard.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.471
He just give it to me.

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.223
This is my main workbench
right here.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.183
This is where most of my handle
gluing and all that stuff

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.559
goes on.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.895
Oh, and that over there, that's
my sledge block.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.605
These are pretty hard to find
nowadays.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.023
They're rare.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:50.068
And this big guy, this is my
big drill press.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:53.404
This actually came off a World
War II submarine.

00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:54.864
This thing's heavy.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.116
It--it took a lot of work to
get it in here.

- This is a gifted motor off
of an old Whirlpool tub.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.251
And so I've been using that for
about ten months now

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.752
on this angle grinder.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.798
Carrying on the trend of
recycled and gifted items,

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.300
this was in a dump
being discarded.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.887
Turns out, the top was just
full of bird's nests

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.307
from being outside, so it
didn't require much

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.978
to get it back running,
but it's very low torque.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.021
This is my shop.
This is my forge.
