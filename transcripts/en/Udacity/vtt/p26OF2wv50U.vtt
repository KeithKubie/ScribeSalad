00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.790
Now the question is, is this property something that happens for every pair of

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.340
functions and their inverses? Do we always end up with the independent variable

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.028
when we take their compositions? I think we should test a few to see if we can

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:16.175
disprove our theory. How about we just use those functions and their inverses

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:21.540
that you found before? We're going back to f of x equals x plus 1. G of x

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.064
equals 1 4th times x minus 9, and h of x equals x cubed, and of course, the

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:32.671
inverses that go along with them. I'd like you to find a bunch of different

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.822
composite functions. I've listed them all down here for you. Please tell me

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:38.330
what you get for each one.
