Thanks, Susan. Now here's an interesting finding. Using neural imaging,

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:07.160
researchers found that when Genie was listening or speaking, the activity in

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.482
her brain was located mostly in the right hemisphere. Now remember, we just

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:15.667
mentioned that language comprehension and production is located in the left

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:20.255
hemisphere. This led researchers to suggest that the left hemisphere speech

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:25.600
development requires stimulation from the environment. During what's called

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.273
sensitivity period if it's to develop properly. The sensitivity period are ages

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:34.827
before critical stimulation and learning must occur, otherwise the window of

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:41.286
learning will close and it will become very difficult to learn languages. If

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:44.784
you are interested learning more about this case study, the movie Mockingbird

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:49.602
Don't Sing, is based on her life story. Although tragic, it demonstrates again

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:53.198
how much we can learn from human thought and behavior by using case studies

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.210
such as these.
