00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.960
Hey what's up guys, did you know you can make your own butter? A couple of years ago

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.080
I put out a tutorial showing how you can take heavy whipping cream from the store put it in a glass

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.049
Mason jar and shake it vigorously for about 10 minutes and the whole thing would start solidifying and turning into a clump of butter.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.010
It's an awesome experiment that really does work a lot of you tried it. the problem

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.859
is that it takes 10 minutes of vigorous shaking now everyone

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.539
I know who's tried turning cream into butter, takes it straight out of the fridge, puts it in a container and start shaking it

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.739
until it eventually turns into butter this takes a monumental effort.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.570
So for this video I want to give you an update on a little technique

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.950
I discovered that can shrink that 10 minutes of effort down to around 20 seconds.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.149
You might be surprised to know, that all it takes to do this in 20 seconds is

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.200
First, set your container of cream on the counter and let it warm up to room temperature first.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.989
Now the kind of cream you want to get is called heavy whipping cream

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.319
and you'll find this stuff over by the milk section in your local grocery store

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.759
So I've just let this cream warm up to about 78 79 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.129
That's room temperature, and that's gonna work really well.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.169
So now all you need to make this work is some kind of container like a water bottle with a screw-off lid

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.360
because once our butter is made. we're gonna need a way to get this back out, so widemouth is gonna work the best

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.889
I'm just showing you guys this is cream. That was just freshly poured out of the container you can see it's liquidy

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.589
I have not shaken this at all. So we're gonna put this lid on and in that condition once it's screwed on tight

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.560
I'm going to hold my finger down and we're going to shake this as hard as we can

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.979
For about 20 seconds and see if we can't turn the butter let's begin!

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.949
There we go, few seconds in it. It's already turned to whipping cream now

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.799
We need to do is push a little harder and get that cream to break as soon as it breaks. We're back into bottle.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.169
Got a whip what the good there goes alright guys it just broke come here check this out

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.429
Alright, so it went from a liquid state, then it went into a cream state and now it's gone back to it's liquid state

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.458
I'm just shaking a little bit more so all the globules of butter can collect together, a little bit of a workout

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.590
But I didn't break a sweat now

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.929
let's open this up and lets see what  we got inside!

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.789
Little bit of heavy breathing, but that didn't hurt anybody check it out guys nice glob of butter

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.309
See see right now our butter kind of looks like we gotta cheese, and that's because there's a lot of buttermilk in there

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.149
We can go ahead and pour off that buttermilk using and cooking drink it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.610
good stuff alright

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.220
I'm just going to put the cap back on shake this a few more times

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.030
This will help blob the butter back together into a nice ball for us

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.759
If I transfer this to a container for you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.510
There we go look at that beautiful chunk of butter made from whipping cream. How amazing is that?

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.539
Looks like butter smells like butter

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.299
Definitely tastes like a butter. We know this could use a little salt just

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.120
need a pinch

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.380
You might even be a little it too much. They're just going to work that in

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.540
By adding a little bit of salt to your butter

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.410
It's going to make it taste delicious

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.029
And it's going to act as a natural preservative so this stuff should be able to last for a week or two

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.039
Especially be stored in the fridge my theory on why this works is because the molecules of cream

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.040
I think are similar to water balloons

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.519
Imagine for a second you have a bucket of water balloons each of those balloons has a thick rubbery coating

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.590
but if you slosh that bucket hard enough

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.030
You could eventually get those balloons to collide and those rubber skins to break that's a sense that we're doing with the cream here

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.059
We're shaking it so hard that we're getting the membranes to break and release the butter molecules in the solution so cream that comes

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.229
Right out of the fridge is like cold water balloon that's going to be a lot harder to get those to pop

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.630
That's why I letting your cream sit out for a couple of hours can make the difference between working for 10 minutes and working for

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.949
A matter of seconds now the way, we store butter at our house is by using something called the butter crock

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.560
This is a two-piece unit that has water in one side and a cupped bowl shape in the other you fill the bowl up with

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.240
Butter and then you turn upside down and push it down into the water this creates an airtight seal that will prevent any

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.480
Bacteria from getting in there and causing your butter to go bad now

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.160
I'm not going to lie and say that making this was easy

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.850
But it definitely is a lot easier

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.669
Than making it with cream that comes straight out of the fridge so go try for yourself head down to the grocery store pick up

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.570
Some whipping cream let it warm up to room temperature and put it in the bottle and shake it

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.649
So you got yourself some butter add a pinch of salt spread on a cracker. You got yourself a snack

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.130
hey, thanks for joining me for this experiment today has been awesome hanging out with you

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.130
And I'll be there for you in the next video. Talk to you there!

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Its Stuck to the edges
