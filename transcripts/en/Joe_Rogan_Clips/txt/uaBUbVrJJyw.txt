Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, let me think. It's the wrong way to think about it. What do you disagree if anything with what he said so far? Well, so far what he said, it hasn't been particularly reveling the Tori, um, the, uh, I think we have to step back for a second because you know, while the low carb community might have a more better understanding of where we disagree, um, I think the greater community that Joe Reaches might not so fundamentally with Stefan saying and what the research community is saying and the conventional thinking in this field is that the brain, and correct me any point I get this wrong, but the brain regulates, does the fundamental job of controlling how fast we are and the way it does it is by controlling or miss controlling our intake and our expenditure and the different tents up in fat tissue. Is that fair to say for the most primarily intake, but yeah. Yeah. So Stefan has a brain centric view of the universe and the community community at large does as well. So if we go outside and we walked down in Ventura Boulevard and we see someone who weighs 400 pounds, um, they've clearly taken in more calories than they should have opened the course of their life and it's been stored in their fat tissue. And Stefan says, I think would say that the problem is in their brains ability to regulate intake to expenditure. Is that correct? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38          And let me, I have to fix my headphones. So how are we going to do this? I'm getting feedback when I talk. You're getting feedback? Yeah. It's just weird. Couldn't be the, hold on one sec. For those who don't know, I'm hearing impaired. As I say, kindly, my kids would say deaf as a post, so better. So I took off my hearing aids. It's a little better. Okay. So what I've been arguing, so I come along my background, I'm a journalist, I'm an investigative journalist with a science background. Okay. That's what I do. And I'm curious, and I've gotten a lot of, you know, and I, my first two books were studying what's called pathological science, which is about people who got the wrong results in science because a lot of times scientists do so by, I'm very sensitive to this. And as I was doing the research for my first book, which took five years, what I noticed in when you take a historical perspective is that the research community studying obesity was very focused on the brain.

Speaker 1:          02:42          They just assume that that people are gluttons. And I'm gonna use some socially unacceptable, uh, language, because in part, that's how they thought about. And in fact, when you read the, uh, obesity literature from the forties and 50s, it's shocking the way these people talked about people with obesity. And the assumption was they're gluttons are, they're neurotic or they're anxious or they're just, you know, but, but it was all brain center. And when they got to the 1960s, the field was being run by psychologists and psychiatrists who are trying to get people with obesity to eat less. And it, my favorite example is one team that was trying to get the, they got the wives to stop having sex with the husbands if they didn't lose weight every week and that would motivate them. I think even you pointed out that sex is a greater motivator in your book.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Then tasty foods. It didn't say it was greater, but I said it was on par. Par So, and I'm going to just read you a, I won't read you that the, so there was this, while the obesity research community is focusing on the brain, there are people studying fat metabolism endocronologists they study hormones and hormone related disorders saying that the, Oh yeah, fat storage and fat mobilization, the burning of fat and the human body is controlled by this very diverse set of hormones and enzymes and the nervous system is involved in well and our body does a very careful job of the site of basically orchestrating how we use fields after we eat. And the implication was, and I think Stefan kind of stepped into this with the very first thing you said till the assumption was obesity is a disorder of excess fat accumulation.

Speaker 1:          04:27          So today when you read the literature, the article's officer obesity's a sort of energy imbalance. You take in more calories than they expend. There were still the best scientists in the field. The best physician scientists, which they look obesity is the disorder of excess fat accumulation. Let's look at what regulates fat accumulation. The human body, some people are programmed or dysregulated to store more fat and if their store more fat, they're going to, their behavior is going to respond, they'll be hungry or they'll eat more, there'll be gluttons all of these things. So it was switching the causality instead of the brain determining energy balance and that determining fat accumulation. The idea was the sort of, let's see, what regulates fat accumulation that's dysregulated. If I have a, if I give birth to a daughter who weighs a hundred pounds at age four I'm not gonna worry about how much he eats and exercises.

Speaker 1:          05:22          I'm going to worry about what's going on with fat accumulation and this young girl that her body is just as if you give a, you know, if you have a child who's six foot eight when he's six years old, you're not going to worry about how much he eats an exercises. You're going to worry that he's over secreting growth hormone. So the idea, basically what I've done, my role in this is to say look in this vitally important period in the 1960s the 1970s when obesity we searchers came to understand I'm fat metabolism researchers came to understand the of that sells the obesity. People were convinced that the problem is in the brain and those obesity people eventually grew into the world that Stefan got his PhD in as the neuro biological world where you study what's happening in the brain and you ignore what's happening in the fat cells and fat mobilization and fatty acid oxidation and Ted Stuart.

Speaker 1:          06:22          And when you look at that, you find a whole world of places in which people can pre be predetermined, you know, be driven to be fat. So, for example, when I was in high school, senior year in high school, I weighed 195 pounds and I played football and my brother, two years older, wait 195 pounds his senior year and played football. My brother never got more than 195 pounds and I went up to two 40. We both ate as much as humanly possible. You know, as you could imagine, that's what high school athletes do. My brother was always lean. I was always trouble. My brothers stayed late and it became an endurance athlete. I became a football player and I lifted weights. I put on muscle easily and I fat knee. Slowly he didn't. Um, the conventional wisdom would be the reason I went to two 40 and he never got the one 95 was that my brain was different than his. My argument is our bodies were fundamentally different. So if I see somebody walking down the street and weighs 300 pounds, I don't worry about, I don't think about what the problem is with her brain regulating intake and expenditure. I think about what's, why is her body driving her to be 300 pounds? So that's, I think, kind of the fundamental difference. Um, and is it, is it the brain that can't do the job or is it the body that can't do the job and the brain is responding to what's happening in the body?

Speaker 2:          07:53          Yeah. Is this a reductionist perspective? Cause I mean, isn't it a holistic, I mean holistically you're looking at the entire machine of the human body. The idea that the brain is somehow or another separate from the body is saying it's separate. The question is the brain driving what's happening in the body or is it responding to a 10? So, um, and you know, the brain of course does respond a lot to what's happening in the body and we can talk about that and how that works. Um, but you know, I think it's, we can tell stories, but the things, the thing that differentiates a story that's true from a story that is not true is evidence. And so, you know, you talk about the difference between your brother and you. This is where that genetics evidence comes back in that I was talking about your brother and you only share half of your genes.

Speaker 2:          08:40          We know that genetics has a strong impact on who has a greater susceptibility to body fatness and nut than others. And we also know what the genes do that underlie those differences. And they are primary. I'm not done Gary, let me finish jeans. Those jeans. Nope. Nope, not right now. I'm, I'm in the middle of saying something. Those genes are um, primarily related to differences in brain function. That is what the genetic say. And so that suggests that the reason why you had a greater propensity than your brother to become fat probably has to do with differences in genetics that relate to brain function. That is what the research says. Okay, very actually look. So when you talk to him about two 17 year olds that way, exactly the same amount. Like how do we know how much they consumed in calories? I mean, we don't have any studies.

Speaker 2:          09:30          We don't have of course, but I mean I could guarantee you we both paid as much as humanly possible, but eventually my mother who never got over one 95 and I apologize for bringing you up on the air. I know you don't like that used to say that he never gets stuffed. He just gets bored of eating after a couple of hours. Okay. Okay. But I may be even though like maybe if you looked at it scientifically, you ate more than him or maybe you ate more sugar, more carbs. So that's a difference. So the, that, those are the two hypothesis. Why don't I pause? [inaudible] is my body, and this is what Stefan is. Cypress. I want to just, the thing I wanted to read, how much, I'll ask you the question, how much of the variation in human obesity to those genes explained? So if you look at the genetics of, no, I didn't ask how much.

Speaker 2:          10:20          Yeah, your question. He needs to let us talking. Yeah, you got to love Tamales, Gary. Um, so if you look at the genetics of obesity, what you find is that from twin studies and family studies that measure the overall contribution of genetics, about 75% of the differences in body fatness between individuals is due to genetic differences between those individuals. So, you know, 1995 America, if you just take a cross section of people and you measure how much is genes, how much is environment, about 75% is genetic. Now we've only identified a small proportion of the specific genes that underlie the propensity to obesity. And so if you look at the percentage that we have specifically identified, it's a very small, and that's what I refer to in my book. How much it's like a, right now I think it's up to about 10% it was 3% when their book was pumped.

Speaker 2:          11:16          Yeah, that's correct. They did 7% absolutely. Yeah. The latest. Yeah. Actually, let me cite the, uh, so the study, they're not just a second, I'm going to cite this study just a second. I'm going to cite this study. Uh, this study is under reference number two. So you can, you can go check that out. It's about 10% and these genetic studies are advancing very quickly. And that's why in the three years since I wrote that, we have explained a lot more than we did at the time that I wrote that. And so we have a portion of these genes identified and what we're seeing is that most of that portion that we have identified relate to brain activity.

Speaker 1:          11:53          And so that tells us that primarily the differences between individuals that determine differences in body fatness is about differences in brain activity. And no one should be shocked about this. The brain generates all of our eating behavior. It generates all of our physical activity behavior and it actually regulates body fatness. No one should be surprised by this. I am. And I was. And how were you surprised when you get, if you disagree with, well, virtually everything, but, um, let's begin with track back now. The, um, okay, so drugs that explain obesity 10% with the argument that I was making and the argument I continue to make. Imagine if you don't, we'll take Stefan's, uh, car medicine's Stefan. He says, Stefan, can you say that right? It's okay. I'm not saying that, but I mean just people don't get confused. Thank you. The, uh, if it takes car now and, and somewhere in the 1970s I, I've used the car, now I'm for this too, but I don't think it's as appropriate.

Speaker 1:          12:58          But when we to think that somewhere in the 1970s the aliens didn't notice that there were humans driving the car. So now they're trying to solve the problem without the humans involved. Why did you do some cars drive faster than others? And they come up with all kinds of hypotheses and some of them can explain it even when they interpret the hypotheses. One of the common problems at science, it's called intellectual face lock. So what I've been arguing is in effect, the obesity research community left out of its research, 1960s era endocrinology, the hormonal metabolic regulation of fatty acid metabolism, oxidation burning. And it sucked when they did it. Pretty much everything they've done since has been interpreted incorrectly. Just like the aliens would interpret the car problem if they never noticed the humans. So, um, and Leptin is a good example. So Leptin is discovered in 1993 and when Leptin is discovered, obesity becomes sort of a legitimate field of science.

Speaker 1:          14:04          Until then it's a bunch of actually mostly psychologists studying and, and now it becomes a subdiscipline and molecular biology and all the molecular biologists jump into the field and they assume that would let them, does, is controlled the brain signals how much fat is available to some kind of satiety or fueled deficiency, um, hormone. And as such, they studied the brain and they studied the action of Lipton in the brain. Now in 2002, Jeff Friedman who gets credit for discovering up perhaps incorrectly, um, publishes a paper in the journal Science. It's saying perhaps as much as two thirds or more of what Leptin does is done in the periphery in the body. And what Leptin does, it's a hormone that sort of is, is secreted in response to how much fat you've accumulated. And then does it stimulate the brain to tell you to eat more or less depending on how much fat or it also works in liver cells, which are the cells that were studying.

Speaker 1:          15:08          And the assumption is it probably doesn't all cells to tell yourselves to burn fat. So it makes perfect sense if there's fat available in the fat cells, now you've got a signal telling sort of influencing the other cells of the body to burn fat. So now you've got a hormone that could work in the periphery, in the, in the, you know, below then neck or it could work above the neck. But you've got a community that's almost exclusively studying in the head. They don't know they're human drivers down here. So that's what they do. So even in this world, the, I don't, I think I know the genome paper, I'm Stefan is probably referenced on his [inaudible] a number of fescue. That's the heart's research. Is that, uh, I, I don't remember the, so they had two papers cause it's what you cited in the article you coauthored with Rudy Leibel.

Speaker 1:          15:59          So I have two papers. One is genes associated with obesity and one is genes associated with body type. So with body type, they're all below the neck. They're all you know, fat metabolism basically. And the Musk, you know, the genes had aspects of your body that you would expect to be controlled. Like when you build up muscle and you have to take an excess energy to do it, it makes you hungry. I don't think your brain is regulating how much muscle you're building other than your drive to go to the gym. Basically your body is responding to the stress on the muscle. All the things you do in the weight lifting, it's all below the neck. So the argument here is again, simple. When these people looked at body type, it was insulin regulated genes for the most part, growth hormone, all of these things.

Speaker 1:          16:50          When they looked at excess body fat, they decided they were in the head. But the question is when they looked, they're programmed to think that excess body fat, it's caused by overeating. So they look in the brain, did they do the same kind? And I was going to call the researcher involved. I never got around to doing it saying if body type body shape is determined by these genes and doesn't it make sense that x has variations of body shape, we're going to be determined by the same genes. And did you do the same kind of searches? I don't actually know how they determine where the genes work. It's the same kind of searches. They just came up with different sets of genes. So they didn't start with any assumptions. They were just finding them the questionnaire where the genes work. So there's a common phenomenon, all of this like with Leptin gene that everybody thinks about working in the hypothalamus seems to work in every, can I respond to that? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:44          talking cause you say this in your head, you say this in your book, I'm prepared to respond whenever you're done. Okay. In your book you say that gene's work. Yeah, the body is very, basically, it puts a different mechanisms to work as many places that can in there these homeostatic feedback loops, you know, something happens. Your whole body has to respond. So a gene that my work primarily on one cell is scattered all over the body because every cell, and it'll do different jobs on different cells. But if you think that the problems in the brain, that's where you look. So you get this kind of intellectual phase lock where that's what we do. That's what we study. And neurobiologists studies the brain, uh, the Daniel Kahneman, Stefan like suicide, Daniel Conaman as well had this concept. What you see is all, he's a Nobel laureate, uh, cognitive psychologists.

Speaker 1:          18:38          What you see is all there is. Okay. And basically if you're studying the brain, that's what you look at if you're studying the gut, until we all get trapped into that on some extent. And what I'm saying is, even in these studies, so Stefan and Stefan wrote a book about the hungry brain that is supposed to be about obesity. But in fact, you never mentioned anything about the metabolic regulation of [inaudible]. It's just not there. And I would argue it has to be there even if it's wrong, if it's not there, the absence of it. Like you can't talk about Leptin without talking about what it might be doing in the body. You can talk, you know, so there's a, the edits put me in a very odd position. So Stephanie is kind of the defender of the Orthodox and I'm the one who comes along and says, look, you guys just, you missed it.

Speaker 1:          19:34          You screwed up. You had psychologists and psychiatrists running the field when the endocrinologists sob that and then you'd discovered Leptin and it became a molecular biology problem. And you're now divorced from the very simplest observations about obesity. You know, so we can do huge genome wide association studies. They sound remarkable. But if I were to ask a simple question like why is it I get fat here? Yeah, the love handle thing, it's in the back with man. It's not in the front, but it's here and not here. I don't see what the brain has to say about that. Um, okay. So as you mentioned, there have been different genetic studies that have looked at body fat distribution versus total body fatness. So total body fatness is what we're talking about when we're talking about obesity. Uh, body fat distribution is what we're talking about when we're talking about the fat being on your hips versus on your wrist. Now what we see is different sets of genes that come up. So body fat distribution, we actually see insulin, a related genes, so people that have a central body fat distribution, so body fat around their waist tend to have these insulin related genes

Speaker 2:          20:48          that are driving that. But when you look at total body fatness, the thing that causes obesity, what you see is that those genes are dominated by the brain. And the really cool thing, the point I want to make about the genetics research 10% that means might be tolerated by the brain and say, look, come on Gary. It is unbiased. That's the really cool thing about it is that they're just, this is whatever genes are popping up. These studies do not care about what you believe about what causes obesity. This is just whatever genes are popping up. So it's unbiased and that's what they're saying. And I'm not done here, Gary. Now I want to talk about, um, you mentioned Gary, that may be Leptin is having important actions, not just in the brain but in the body. First of all, I'm glad, I'm flattered that you read my book and I'm glad that you acknowledge the existence of Leptin.

Speaker 2:          21:38          Now this is good. Um, but now you say that researchers focus on Leptin actions in the brain because we're phase locked and we can't get out of our, you know, blinders of thinking about it in terms of the brain and that that's why we focus on left and action in the brain. The real reason we focus on left and action in the brain is because it has been demonstrated that it's effect on body. Fatness are via the brain. There are actual experiments demonstrating this, and I'll explain how these experiments work. This is all in the scientific literature. So if you knock out the Leptin receptor only in the brain or only in the Hypothalamus, you get obesity. So that is what tells us that actually the brain is the key site of action. And particularly this part of the brain. It tells me, Hey, Carrie, Carrie, Carrie, please let him talk.

Speaker 2:          22:36          He let you talk. Yeah. And that's it. So I mean you get the same obesity if you knock leaped and how to the brain and particularly out of the hypothalamus that you get if you knock it out of the whole body. So that shows that the brain is this site of action that is causing this to happen. And this is no surprise. We have these mechanisms worked out. We know specific groups of neurons that are receiving the left in that are controlling or appetite that are controlling our metabolic rate. We have many of these neuro populations worked out in mice. We understand these systems so well we can control specific popular tiny populations of neurons very precisely caused them to eat a ton, to stop eating, to gain fat, to lose fat like the animals are marionettes. I mean that's the level of understanding we have right now of how these systems work. So, I mean, all of this evidence is converging on the same thing that the brain is central and that fat cell metabolism. I'm just not seeing the evidence for that. I mean, Gary, if you want to cite specific evidence demonstrating that that is an actual cause of differences in body fatness between individuals in the general population. I'm awaiting that evidence and I'm happy to sit here and listen to you cite the evidence that demonstrates that. Correct.
