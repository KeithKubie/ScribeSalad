00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:01.501
My name is Glenn.

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.705
My name is Bill,
and who here likes vacations?

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:06.006
I do.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.276
But it's tough to take vacation

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:12.846
when you only have five days
allotted the entire year.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.215
You know what? We're going to do
a little magic here.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.217
What would you say
if we took those five days,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.319
we took those five days
and we ...

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.021
abracadabra,
made them 10 days?

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.790
10 days of vacation time!

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.525
Wow.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.361
Is that happening?
Is that happening?

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.662
It can happen.
Is that?

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:32.933
It can happen if you believe in
the program we're talking about.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.334
We're talking about
a program ...

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.702
who wants to book a vacation?
No one, right?

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.904
No.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.372
Who wants to think
about where they're going?

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.508
Who wants to call up
a hotel or go online?

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.377
That sounds like a lot
of hassle to me.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:46.914
Exactly. It is a lot of hassle,
but not anymore.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:50.550
If you want 10 days,
all you have to do is vacation

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.054
at one of three resorts that
we have predetermined for you.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.355
A resort like a resort, resort?

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:59.326
It's a resort in the greater
Tampa metropolitan area.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.161
Wow.
Fuck, yeah!

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:04.331
And they are so nice. How about
a place called Casa Laguna?

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.666
Casa Laguna!

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.334
It all takes place
right here ...

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:08.568
I like the water.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.971
... here and here in Tampa.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.875
Guys, it is so beautiful.
You've got to see this place.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:18.111
You are just a short tram ride
away from the beach!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.479
Yeah!

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.915
How can we possibly afford
this on a cop's salary?

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.216
Well, that's the thing.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.918
What we do is,
we go like this ...

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:27.721
Oh ...

00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.589
Oh! Boom!

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.291
What are we talking about
right here, guys?

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.592
We're talking about Tupperwares.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.860
Yeah.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.131
All you've got to do is sell
over $50 of Tupperware

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.967
to three to five friends ...

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:41.768
Every week for
the next six months.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.036
Easy. Easy.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.404
And then you will qualify
for the package.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.639
Easy.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.207
What was your favorite time
in your life?

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.942
When you had sleepovers
with your friends, guys?

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.143
Yeah.
I love sleepovers!

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.179
Everybody all together, right?

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.382
Well, we are going to give you
a bonafide dorm room experience

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.517
because you're going to be
sharing this condo

00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:00.387
with up to seven
different people!

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:02.589
Some of them, the beauty of it,
you don't even know them,

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:03.957
so you make new friends.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.325
That's good people

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.394
We're going to talk
about security too.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:10.497
Every window has bars on them.
You are protected.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:11.932
You're not going
to have to worry

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.433
about your stuff getting stolen.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.036
If you're afraid of other things
that might happen at the beach,

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.237
such as shark attacks,

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.740
did you know that the occurrence
of a shark attack,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.042
the odds of that happen
are so minuscule

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.944
to almost be negligible?

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:25.912
It's so negligible it
makes me wonder

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.381
why you even brought it up.

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.616
Well, we have to bring it up
by law.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:32.319
So we get 10 nights
in an all-inclusive resort,

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.288
two rides on a tram,
a job, mandatory lectures

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.591
and all we have to do is sell
$12,000 worth of Tupperware.

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:38.825
Exactly!
Exactly!

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.527
I'm going to the Tampa area!

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:41.795
Yeah!

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.563
We need an investment from you
for the Tupperware.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.831
No problem.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.066
You're going to put
some money out ...

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:46.366
Right.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.668
... and then you're going to
get that money back.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:48.902
Takes money to make money.
Am I right?

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.737
Yeah. Come outside to our van,

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.506
and we are going to give you
that Tupperware.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.207
Tupperware!
Tupperware! Tupperware!

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:57.344
Tupperware! Tupperware!
Tupperware! Tupperware!
