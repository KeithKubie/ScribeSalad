00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.030
We’re always told to avoid eating yellow
snow… ugh.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:13.389
But new research shows maybe you shouldn’t
eat any snow!

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.320
This month the entire East Coast of the US
got pummeled by a blizzard.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.100
Businesses and schools closed leaving everyone
to cozy up by fire or go outside to do what

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.680
we love doing most.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.680
Eating snow.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.789
Don’t act like you’ve never done it before.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.630
Just, some scientists recommend against it.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.670
You’re basically eating dust and soot trapped
in water.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.720
Yes, every snowflake already contains some
kind of dust particle because that’s how

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.720
they form.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.090
These particles are the “seeds” on which
frozen water crystallizes to make snowflakes.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.410
But, now research shows snowflakes can also
attract even more particles, many of which

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.410
are harmful.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.730
And to be fair, this is the same stuff you
breath in the air too.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.250
There’s lots of dust and pollen floating
around the air right now, and it’s mostly

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.250
fine to breathe.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.780
But snow might just concentrate it more.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.800
According to a study published in the journal
Environmental Science: Processes &amp; Impacts,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.840
snow can act kind of like a sponge.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.140
Snowflakes, while small have a lot of surface
area, so there’s a lot of places for little

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.640
particles to stick to.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.860
So the fumes and particles from car exhaust
get stuck in all the nooks and crannies of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.150
a snowflake.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.010
Unfortunately, these particles are nasty stuff,
it’s toxic and carcinogenic, which means

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.280
it can cause cancer.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.890
These researchers put both snow and exhaust
fumes into a chamber to see what would happen.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.560
After just an hour, the concentration of particles
in the snow dramatically increased.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.570
The snow just soaked up the exhaust from the
air around it.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.730
So how much of this pollution is in snow?

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.590
Well according to one study published in Science,
in some cities in the Great Plains, concentrations

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.670
could be as high as 7 micrograms of soot per
cubic meter of snow.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.790
Which is still less than the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards maximum of 35 mg per

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.790
cubic meter.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.340
So it’s well below toxic levels.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.100
Now if you want to be on the safe side, maybe
avoid the first snowfall of the day.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.760
The snow acts like a filter as it falls, it
captures all that dust and pollution in the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.760
air.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.020
But after the first few hours, there’s less
pollution in the air.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.510
So less pollution to get caught in the snow.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.649
But some still recommend caution, one lead
researcher suggests avoiding eating snow in

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.649
big cities.

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.810
Dr. Parisa Ariya, told the Huffington Post
that, “As a mother who is an atmospheric

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.020
physical chemist, she definitely does not
suggest her young kids to eat snow in urban

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.340
areas in general."

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.730
Yet other scientists, like Staci Simonich
from Oregon State University told NPR that

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.030
she “would not hesitate for her children
to have the joy of eating a handful of fresh

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.200
fallen snow from my backyard”.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.480
If you’re worried about snow you should
avoid, stick to the white stuff.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.190
Other colors signal contaminants.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.400
Brown snow means it’s well… obviously
dirty.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.270
It’s when more dust and dirt sticks to the
snow.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.610
Pink snow, sometimes called watermelon snow,
while pretty actually means it’s filled

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.530
with algae, a photosynthetic microbe you definitely
don’t want to eat.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.459
There’s so much to know about snow!

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:20.470
Trace explains 13 things you probably didn’t
know about snow in this episode right here.
