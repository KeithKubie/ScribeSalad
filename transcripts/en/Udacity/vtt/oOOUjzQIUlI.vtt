00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.870
As our first step into
studying intersections,

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.540
we'll consider the most basic situation,
two lines in two dimensions.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.060
While basic,
we will start to see structures and

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.980
procedures that will remain
present in more complex examples.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.230
A line in two dimensions can be
defined by two essential properties.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.830
A point it passes through which
I'll call the base point and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.340
a vector that gives
the direction of the line.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.440
Given the base point x naught and
the direction vector v, we can represent

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.070
all points on the line in the form x
of t equals x naught plus times v.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.980
Notice that I'm abusing notation by
treating points as vectors here.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.830
This means given any number t, we can
find a point on the line by plugging in

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.510
t to the expression x naught
plus t times v and computing it.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.440
If we were to theoretically plug
in all possible values of t and

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.320
plot them, we'd end up with a plot
of all the points on the line.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.150
This expression is called
a parameterization of the line.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.100
Since we are expressing
the line via the perimeter t.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.060
For example, for the line x of t
equals the vector one negative two

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.950
plus t times the vector three, one.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
Taking t equal to zero gives
us the output one negative two

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.140
which is the base point for
this parameterization of the line.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.470
If we take t equals one

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.630
then we get the output four negative
one another point on the line.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.413
If we take t equals negative one-half
then we get negative one-half negative

00:01:34.413 --> 00:01:37.790
five-halves, yet
another point on the line.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.170
Note that a given line has
infinitely many base points,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.520
since we can pick any point on
the line to be the base point.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.790
And it has infinitely
many direction vectors,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.720
since we can multiply any direction
vector by a positive scalar and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.140
it will still point in
the same direction.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.810
We could also multiply the direction
vector by a negative number and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.700
the same set of points
will be in parameterized

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.870
just starting from
the opposite direction.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.980
We can multiply the direction
vector by zero though, or

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.288
else we'll collapse the line to a point.

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:14.390
You may have seen lines written
in the form y = mx +b where b and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.700
m are numbers.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.610
This equation and
codes both a base point and a direction.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.970
b is the y intercept,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.550
the y coordinate of the point at
which the line intersects the y axis.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.860
This gives the base point 0,b.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.720
m is the slope of the line which can be
translated into a direction vector of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.510
the form 1 m.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.890
For every unit of movement
in the x direction

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.100
there are m units of
movement in the y direction.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.620
This equation for representing
a line isn't perfect however,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.160
since we do not have the ability
to define vertical lines.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.190
A more general form of equation for
representing a line is Ax+By = k.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.110
Where A, B and k are numbers and
at least one of A or B is non-zero.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.480
To reconstruct a base point from
this equation, there are two cases.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.280
Assuming B is not zero,
you can set x to be any number.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.710
I'll take it to be 0 for

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.660
this example, which becomes the x
coordinate of the base point.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.400
Then you can solve for y to find
the y coordinate of the base point.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.670
Having taken x equals zero,
this becomes y equals k over B.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.470
So a base point for
the line is 0, k over B.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.510
On the other hand if B does equal 0,
then A will not be 0.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.960
Let y = 0 in this case solving for
x gives us x = k/A.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.388
So a base point will be k/A, 0.

00:03:45.388 --> 00:03:52.548
So for this example here two possible
base points would be 0, 2 and 3, 0.

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:55.368
Now let's think about
the direction vector.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.608
If we write down any
two points on the line,

00:03:57.608 --> 00:04:02.170
then the vector connecting the point
will be a direction vector for the line.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.570
In this example, we've already written
down two points on the line but for

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.940
a general case,
how would we find the direction vector?

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.670
Let's start with a very particular case,
when the constant term k = 0.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.029
Here the equation reduces to just
Ax+By = 0 and notice that this

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.770
line passes through the origin since
the base point for this formula is 00.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.270
If we draw the vector from the origin
to another point x, y on the line

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.540
then the corresponding vector xy will
be a direction vector for the line.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.510
Now here's a neat algebraic trick,
rewrite

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.075
the left hand side of this equation
as a dot product of two vectors.

00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:50.790
Ax+By becomes the vector AB
dotted with the vector XY.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.740
Now what does this equation mean?

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.700
It means that the point
x,y is on this line.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.750
If and only if the vector xy,
a direction vector for

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.670
the line is orthogonal to the vector AB.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.060
This means we can find
a direction vector for

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.330
this line by picking some
vector orthogonal to AB.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.960
One good way to do that,
in two dimensions at least,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.180
is to just swap the coordinates
in the vectors in the gate one.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.890
So picking B,-A, would give us
a direction vector for this line.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.320
So for the case of this pink line,
a direction vector would be 3,-2.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.460
Now what if k doesn't equal zero?

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.030
What changing k does is it shifts
the line off of the origin.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.780
It doesn't actually change
the direction of the line at all.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.300
So a direction vector for
Ax+By = k regardless of

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.070
what k is will still be B,-A.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.570
So, both the pink and

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.900
green lines will have three
negative two as direction vectors.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.440
One reason this way of looking at
the equation Ax+By = k is important, is

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.890
that it gives us an implicit description
of the line as a single equation.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.100
In particular as the set of points
such that, a particular vector

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.200
dotted with those coordinates x and
y equals a given number k.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.760
this form also let's us quickly
read off the coordinates for

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.380
a vector that is orthogonal to the line
also called a normal vector to the line.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.270
In this case a normal vector for
the line 2x+3y = 6 will be 2 3.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.375
Since any vector that is parallel

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:41.125
to this line will be
orthogonal to the vector 2 3.

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.685
We will explore this concept
further when we look at

00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:47.855
planes in three dimensions as well as
when we start using linear algebra to

00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:49.425
solve systems of equations.
