00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:05.238
( intro music )

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:17.650
( applause )

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.818
Marc Kaufman:
Well, hello everyone.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.220
I... it's a delight
for me to be here

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.521
and to see all of you here.

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.858 line:0%
Ah, and I think this is going
to be a very interesting

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.394 line:0%
and, uh, pleasurable evening.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.663 line:0%
It certainly will be for us.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.332
So, I want to start

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:36.369
<i> by telling you
 a little bit about Mars.</i>

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.838
<i> A headshot of Mars,
 taken by the Hubble</i>

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:42.208
<i> and showing in, I think
 really wonderful detail</i>

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.043 line:0%
<i> what the place kind of
 looks like.</i>

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.511 line:0%
<i> In the modern era,</i>

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.715 line:0%
<i> when the Mariner flybys
 went past Mars,</i>

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.784 line:0%
<i> they found some things
 that were really interesting,</i>

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.286 line:0%
<i> deep canyons and so on.</i>

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:56.222
That increased interest
in sending

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.591 line:0%
a real, sophisticated
mission there and

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:02.261 line:0%
<i> that resulted
 in the Vikings spaceships</i>

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:07.200 line:0%
<i> and before taking off,
 you may recall Carl Sagan</i>

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.136 line:0%
<i> who is a wonderful and
 incredibly talented person</i>

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:16.909 line:0%
<i> nonetheless wanted cameras
 on Viking to see the animals.</i>

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.813
There was a great expectation
that there was going to be

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:23.849
not only life,
but like weird life,

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.187
big life, you know, cool life.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.622
So when they arrived
and they saw

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.790
<i> a lot of rocks, uh,</i>

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.662
<i> it was kinda disappointing
and there was a big debate about</i>

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:40.132
<i> whether or not there was any
 discovery of microbial life,</i>

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:42.101
<i> something that
 NASA itself has said</i>

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.737
<i> 'No', one of the PI's says
 'Yes'.</i>

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:48.173
It all ended in both confusion
and disappointment,

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:50.009
for the most part.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.745
As a result Mars funding

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:57.150
and Mars exploration
took a serious dip,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.820 line:0%
ah, and it wasn't
until 1997 that

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.390 line:0%
<i> the next lander
 came on to Mars.</i>

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.892 line:0%
<i> By the way, just an aside,</i>

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.095 line:0%
there have been six successful
landings on Mars

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.799 line:0%
and without being
nationalistic about this,

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.367 line:0%
they are all done by NASA.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.936
It's like what we do really,
really well.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.170
Putting that aside--

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.343
( applause )

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:27.813
Putting that aside,
ah... so in '97...

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.314
the Sojourner arrives

00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:31.951 line:0%
and then soon after
Spirit and Opportunity,

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.920 line:0%
<i> the two little plucky rovers
 that could arrive</i>

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.155 line:0%
<i> and they do
 all kinds of things,</i>

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:39.892 line:0%
<i> however, they did not have
 capabilities to do anything</i>

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:42.895 line:0%
<i> like what Curiosity can do.</i>

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.498
But before we get into
Curiosity, I want to tell you

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.501
a little bit about what--

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.437
what NASA and other
and scientists

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.340
were generally looking for,
which was...

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.509
Remember the mantra,
'follow the water'?

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.179
Well, initially that was like
looking for little gullies

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.217
and looking for, you know,
maybe little streams

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.919
or spouts that were coming out
in some way or signs

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.888
that there had
once been large,

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:13.726
catastrophic floods and so on.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:18.298
But, when first the Mars
Orbiter camera went up

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.266
and then later HiRise
and others

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.169
<i> they began seeing
 images like these,</i>

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.305
<i> which sure looks like
 a delta to me, doesn't it?</i>

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.474
<i> You know, it's like
 that could be the Amazon,</i>

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:33.545
<i> that could be, uh,
 the Potomac dried out.</i>

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:36.382
<i> Badly dried out, bad drought.</i>

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:39.118
<i> And the whole notion of
 'follow the water'</i>

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.821
<i> took on a very
 different meaning because</i>

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:45.691
<i> it was clear that there were
 signs, many, many signs</i>

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:48.560
<i> that there was
 significant water</i>

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.729
<i> that had run on the surface.</i>

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.765
And all of the climate
modeling said

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:57.503
that wasn't possible
but yet it was the case.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:01.207 line:0%
<i> Also, this picture
 which is not a Jackson Pollock</i>

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:05.311 line:0%
<i> but rather
 an image of Mawrth Vallis,</i>

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.680 line:0%
<i> which is one of
 the oldest sections of Mars</i>

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.519 line:0%
<i> and after it became clear that
 there were signs of water,</i>

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.688 line:0%
<i> then they began looking
 for minerals.</i>

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:20.092
There are classes of minerals
that are formed only in water,

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:22.895
uh... phyllosilicates
which are clays,

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:25.230
sulfates, some others.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.267
And they began finding those.

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:32.104
Ah, so, they had
this orbital information,

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:35.208
now it was the time
to do something called

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.977 line:0%
'ground-truthing'
which is Curiosity.

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:41.347 line:0%
<i> Send Curiosity to the ground
 and let's see what happens.</i>

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.949
<i> This is the heat shield
 leaving--</i>

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.451
<i> You may recall that Curiosity</i>

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.819
<i> in its 'seven minutes
 of terror'</i>

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.688
<i> where it hit the atmosphere
 with 32,000 miles an hour,</i>

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:53.192
<i> it had seven minutes
 to stop to zero.</i>

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:56.195
<i> Here is the sequence
 going down,</i>

00:04:56.195 --> 00:05:01.200
<i> the black is indeed black sand
 alongside of Mount Sharp,</i>

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.136
<i> which is the big mountain
 in the middle of the crater.</i>

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:07.573
<i> Here the thrusters are going,
 they are about to land,</i>

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:10.276
<i> at this point,
 it's largely the rover itself</i>

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.478
<i> and the descent device.</i>

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:16.282
<i> And then, first picture
 ever of an actual landing.</i>

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:19.385
<i> Look at it,
 that's the tire right there,</i>

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:23.489
<i> that's the tire of Curiosity
 about to land.</i>

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.591
<i> And it did.</i>

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.961
It became clear
quite soon that

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:30.996
this was-- that they landed
in a place

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:32.565
that was very different than

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:35.101
other landing sites
previously.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.270
They found pebbles
that were very interesting

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.972
because they seemed to suggest

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:42.742
the presence of water
at some point.

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.944
They found other...

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:49.182
conglomerate rocks
that did the same

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.383
and also they were
in the proximity to

00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:56.356
what appeared to be
a fossil stream.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.191
All of which are beyond cool
from the perspective

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:03.329
of people interested in Mars.

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:08.233
So, and the original plan was
to go directly to Mount Sharp,

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:10.169
which is this huge mountain
in the middle.

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.771
<i> A two mile high mountain
 in the middle of the crater,</i>

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:14.740
<i> but they decided against that,</i>

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.810
<i> and decided instead
 to take a detour to</i>

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.513
<i> what turned out to be
 named Yellowknife Bay.</i>

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:24.383
<i> Now look at this.
 What does that look like?</i>

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:28.287
<i> A dried up lake, right?
 What do you think it was?</i>

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:29.888
<i> A dried up lake.</i>

00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:31.823
<i> You know
 that's kind of the conclusion</i>

00:06:31.823 --> 00:06:33.325
<i> that they came to probably.</i>

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:35.861
<i> Nothing like this has
 ever been seen on Mars before</i>

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:38.030
<i> or any other planet
 outside of the Earth.</i>

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.001
<i> And it is
 an enormous breakthrough.</i>

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.603
<i> To your upper-left
 is Mount Sharp</i>

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:46.972
<i> and that is
 where they didn't go.</i>

00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:50.976
But they-- ( laughter )
they will go,

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:52.678
because
that's what the program says

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:54.580
they are supposed to go to.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.117
Alright,
now the red planet, right?

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:00.752
Mars, the red planet.
Every story except for mine

00:07:00.752 --> 00:07:04.123
says it's the red planet.
I say, 'No, it's not red.

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.125
It has rouge on it'.
( laughter )

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:10.095
<i> This... this shows a rock</i>

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:12.464
<i> that was run over
 by the Rover.</i>

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:15.100
<i> And look
 what color it is inside.</i>

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.070
<i> Bluish gray.
 And it turns out that</i>

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.640
<i> most of Mars is colors
 other than red.</i>

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.711
<i> That's just an iron oxide dust
 that kinda covers things.</i>

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:29.115
So, the red planet?
I don't think so.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:32.718
The blue-green planet?
Maybe.

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.321
<i> Curiosity has
 an array of instruments</i>

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:37.623
<i> that are unlike anything
 that has gone before.</i>

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.792
<i> This was obviously
 taken before they took off.</i>

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:44.697
<i> This is the arm.
 Seven feet long with a turret</i>

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:46.565
<i> that has
 drilling equipment on it,</i>

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:48.301
<i> that has a camera on it,</i>

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.270
<i> that has a number of
 other instruments on it.</i>

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.038
<i> Again, nothing like this has
 ever gone to Mars.</i>

00:07:53.038 --> 00:07:55.708
<i> Really, really hard,
 you know, to make this work,</i>

00:07:55.708 --> 00:08:00.012
<i> it's very heavy.
 This is the first drill.</i>

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:02.615
<i> Right in the middle,
 you see the thing go down,</i>

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:05.618
<i> it's drilling a hole that's
 about half an inch wide,</i>

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.253
<i> if I remember correctly,
 about two inches deep.</i>

00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:12.858
<i> And what they found it was
 something that made clear</i>

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:17.964
that the redness just
covered over a level of

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:21.166
potentially interesting,
habitable,

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:23.369
potentially habitable
environments

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.304
that we didn't know about
before.

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:29.074
Alright,
how does Curiosity get around?

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:30.409
<i> It's interesting.
 This is called</i>

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.111 line:0%
<i> 'driving blind',</i>

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:35.281 line:0%
<i> where what's blind
 is not the people</i>

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.350 line:0%
<i> or JPL driving this
 but rather the rover,</i>

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.619 line:0%
<i> which has its own autonomous
 abilities.</i>

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:44.023
<i> But here it is driving
 based on a program</i>

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.557
<i> that was sent up to it.</i>

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:48.227
<i> Rover drivers
 are well-known to be among</i>

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:51.864
<i> the coolest people on Earth,
 but in fact they don't drive.</i>

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.331
<i> I mean they make programs,
 right?</i>

00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:55.567
<i> You know...
 they are not at the wheel.</i>

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:58.804
<i> But it is nonetheless
 a remarkable and</i>

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:02.174
<i> very, very difficult job.
 And with a lot of pressure.</i>

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:06.211
<i> It turns out that after
 a year and a half or so,</i>

00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:09.781
<i> some serious holes
 came up in the wheels,</i>

00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:12.017
<i> various punctures and rips.</i>

00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:14.887
<i> This came from
 going over sharp rocks</i>

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:17.690
<i> that were embedded into
 a sandstone as opposed</i>

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.193
<i> to being in something
 that would be like sand,</i>

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:23.228
<i> where there wouldn't be
 as much force.</i>

00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:26.164
<i> And this is,
 you know, serious problem.</i>

00:09:26.164 --> 00:09:27.332
<i> They really did a lot of work</i>

00:09:27.332 --> 00:09:28.968
<i> figuring out
 how to deal with it</i>

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.670
<i> and they determined that</i>

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.607
<i> it would not
 ultimately affect the mission.</i>

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:37.509
<i> That it would not shorten
 the mission in any way</i>

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:41.013
<i> because
 they could drive backwards.</i>

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:42.180
( laughter )

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.151
<i> And that's what they do now,
 they drive backwards.</i>

00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.721
<i> Unfortunately,
 the autonomous part</i>

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:53.191
<i> which is what makes them go
 really far cannot go backwards</i>

00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:56.762
<i> and so they have to stop,
 going backwards.</i>

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.197
Then turn around, and then

00:09:58.197 --> 00:09:59.999
do the autonomous part
forward,

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:02.300
which is part of the reason
why it's taken a long time

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.571
to get to Mount Sharp.
But in any case, there you go.

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:09.708
Very briefly, October 19th

00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:12.811
there is a comet
that is going to go past Mars.

00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:15.347
Initially they thought
that it was going to hit Mars

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:17.883
or it could hit Mars,

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:20.352
which considering
the billions of dollars

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:23.221
that NASA has on Mars
and around Mars

00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:26.391
needless to say,
it was not a happy thought.

00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:30.196 line:0%
<i> But they now believe it will
 go to the side enough</i>

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:32.297 line:0%
<i> that it won't be
 a serious danger,</i>

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:34.299 line:0%
<i> though you can never tell
 exactly what happens.</i>

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:36.334
The dust particles themselves,

00:10:36.334 --> 00:10:38.870
although they are just
dust particles,

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.239
are moving at something like

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:46.145
153,000 miles... an hour?
An hour.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.813
Which makes them
basically bullets,

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.448
so they could go through
anything.

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:52.250
In any case, this is going
to be passing by Mars.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.054
And to me it was
really an interesting

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:59.725
reflection on where we--
where we are as people.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:03.328
There are-- we are now
a space fearing civilization.

00:11:03.328 --> 00:11:07.399
We-- something can
come close to Mars

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:10.636
and it matters to us.

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:13.071
And we can learn
an enormous amount from that.

00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:15.607
This comet will come
closer to Mars

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:19.812
than any comet has come
to Earth in recorded history.

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:23.015
So, that is what we can
really get a lot out of it

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:27.686
because of having the assets
that we have there now.

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:30.456
And let me just end
with this image

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.857
<i> from the camera
 that my colleague here,</i>

00:11:32.857 --> 00:11:34.659
<i> Ken Edgett, is the PI for it.</i>

00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:36.795
<i> You know those are
 little grains of sand.</i>

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:38.797
<i> Those are little grains
 of dust.</i>

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:41.200
<i> In terms of Mars up-close,
 I mean,</i>

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.268
<i> they are getting really,
 really up-close</i>

00:11:43.268 --> 00:11:45.537
<i> and not just
 in terms of the images.</i>

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:49.742
<i> In terms of the geo-chemistry,
 in terms of the geology,</i>

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.910
<i> in terms of understanding
 weather</i>

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.112
<i> and all kinds of,
 and radiation and the like.</i>

00:11:54.112 --> 00:11:58.317
<i> And that's what I think is...
 is the great message</i>

00:11:58.317 --> 00:12:01.353
<i> that comes from
 the Curiosity Mission so far,</i>

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:04.523
<i> which is that they are
 learning an enormous amount</i>

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:07.960
<i> because they have new tools
 and they are right there...</i>

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.395
<i> really seeing stuff.</i>

00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:12.298
( applause )

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:16.302
( outro music )
