00:00:02.543 --> 00:00:06.635
- Hello, and welcome to
Khan Academy Live SAT.

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:08.493
I'm Eric, I'm an SAT tutor

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:11.613
and one of the SAT experts
here at Khan Academy.

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:13.386
I'm so excited to be with you today

00:00:13.386 --> 00:00:15.854
to talk through SAT Reading.

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:18.495
Now if you've joined one
of our past live streams,

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:19.545
you'll notice that today's live stream

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:20.779
looks a little bit different,

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.685
and that's because our
amazing videographer Felipe

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:27.302
is out today, but so
that means we're using

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:29.188
a bit more of a homemade setup.

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:31.917
And so you'll actually get to see me

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:32.933
switching back and forth

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.491
a little bit between screens,

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:36.886
and so you get a peek behind the scenes.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:40.223
And hopefully, there won't
be any tech glitches,

00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:42.043
but if there are, just
you know, bear with me,

00:00:42.043 --> 00:00:43.508
and we'll get those resolved.

00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:46.329
And so like I said, today's
topic is SAT Reading,

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.521
and so I'm just gonna
give you a quick overview

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:49.958
of what we're going to cover today

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.121
before we get straight into the content.

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:56.317
Time to share my screen here,

00:00:56.317 --> 00:01:00.511
and so, for today, today's
class like I mentioned,

00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.477
the topic is SAT Reading,
and we're gonna cover a lot

00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:05.560
of different topics here.

00:01:06.977 --> 00:01:09.911
And next week, we will cover SAT Writing,

00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:11.188
and it'll be at the same time,

00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:14.674
so Tuesday at 7:00 p.m.
Eastern, 4:00 p.m. Pacific.

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:17.449
It'll be the third and
final part of our series.

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:19.306
And last week, in case you missed it,

00:01:19.306 --> 00:01:21.237
we had a SAT Math class.

00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:22.673
And if you missed that, don't worry,

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.895
just head to our Khan
Academy YouTube channel

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:27.741
and you can find the recording there.

00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:30.048
But, like I mentioned,
today's all about SAT Reading,

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.253
and that's what we're here for.

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:34.777
And so, let's scroll
through and you'll see

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:37.307
the schedule for today's class.

00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:38.715
So the first 10 minutes of class,

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:39.978
I'm gonna go through two things.

00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:42.532
The first is the rephrase
and predict strategy.

00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:45.260
And this is a proactive
strategy that you can use

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.642
to tackle SAT Reading questions.

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:51.820
The second topic I'm going
to cover is time management.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.287
And I'm gonna walk through some
of the most common questions

00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:57.959
I get when it comes to time
management and pacing yourself,

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.459
and not running out of time
on the SAT Reading section.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:02.617
Next up, I'm gonna work

00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:05.514
through a real SAT
Reading passage together,

00:02:05.514 --> 00:02:07.705
and then we'll do some Q&amp;A, and wrap up.

00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:10.268
At the very end we'll answer
some of your questions

00:02:10.268 --> 00:02:13.268
and also share a Khan Academy badge.

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:17.361
So I'll stop sharing then for now.

00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:19.959
And so that's what we
have planned for the day.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.149
There's a lot to get into,

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.359
and so let's jump straight
into the first reading strategy

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.803
which is all about the
rephrase and predict strategy.

00:02:26.803 --> 00:02:28.970
So, share my screen again.

00:02:32.054 --> 00:02:34.721
And so, the reason we're talking

00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:38.961
about this strategy is for a few reasons,

00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:40.935
and so let's think
through these questions,

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:43.373
and let me know if any of
these sound familiar to you.

00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:45.431
So have you ever read the answer choices

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.500
in a SAT Reading section
and thought to yourself,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.677
well, all of these look good,

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:51.665
and it could be any of them.

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.307
Or maybe you get it down to two choices,

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:55.635
but then pick the wrong one.

00:02:55.635 --> 00:02:57.416
So maybe you've got it down to A or C,

00:02:57.416 --> 00:03:00.193
but then you sometimes pick the right one,

00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:02.215
sometimes pick the wrong one.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.913
Or maybe you run out of
time in the reading section.

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:07.640
And so these things I've all,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.056
I've definitely experienced
all of these things myself,

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.120
and a lot of students have
been in this situation.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.414
And so that's why this
rephrase and predict strategy

00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:18.765
can really help address these situations.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:21.316
And so what is this strategy?

00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:24.696
Well, this strategy is all about coming up

00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:27.368
with your own answer to reading questions

00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:30.296
before you look at the answer choices,

00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:31.533
and this is really important.

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:33.405
And the reason you want to hold off

00:03:33.405 --> 00:03:34.733
on looking at the answer choices

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:39.442
is that one, it's lots of
information to take in,

00:03:39.442 --> 00:03:43.698
and two, perhaps most importantly,
it can be distracting.

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:45.993
And so it can sometimes lead you,

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:48.770
and influence your
interpretation and understanding

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.950
of the passage before
you have a good grasp.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.063
And so you know, I like to call this

00:03:55.063 --> 00:03:57.730
the the rabbit hole effect here,

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.750
and you don't want to be
led down the wrong path.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.749
And so the two parts to this
strategy are one, to rephrase,

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.032
and so this involves reading the question,

00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:10.401
but covering the answer choices.

00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:12.476
And then if possible rephrase the question

00:04:12.476 --> 00:04:16.309
into a how, what, or why
question to simplify,

00:04:19.214 --> 00:04:21.303
and make it easier to understand.

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:22.886
The next part in this strategy

00:04:22.886 --> 00:04:25.427
is to predict, and this involves

00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:27.560
reviewing the relevant
parts of the passage,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.227
and predicting the
answer in your own words.

00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:34.149
And once you have this answer,

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.355
you can then uncover the answer choices,

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:38.938
cross out the choices that don't match,

00:04:38.938 --> 00:04:40.769
and then select the
choice that best matches.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:43.324
And so this converts
the SAT Reading question

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.463
into more of a matching question.

00:04:45.463 --> 00:04:47.721
So if you already have something in mind,

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:50.333
it allows you to put these two things,

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:51.465
what you have in mind,

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.352
and compare it with the answer choices

00:04:53.352 --> 00:04:57.256
that you have on the SAT Reading test.

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:58.808
And once it's a matching exercise,

00:04:58.808 --> 00:05:03.023
most students find it
easier and faster, as well.

00:05:03.023 --> 00:05:06.186
So we'll get plenty of time
to practice this later today,

00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:09.178
but for now, I'm gonna
move on to time management,

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:12.429
and we're going to work
through some of the most common

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:14.234
time management questions that I get.

00:05:14.234 --> 00:05:18.401
And so, move your gaze to the
bottom of the screen here,

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:22.632
and we'll walk through these
questions one at a time.

00:05:22.632 --> 00:05:23.982
So the first question is

00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:28.149
should you read the questions
or the passage first?

00:05:29.256 --> 00:05:30.620
And if you have an answer,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.534
go ahead and type that in,

00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:33.464
and you know, feel free to share that

00:05:33.464 --> 00:05:35.426
with others who are
watching the live stream.

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:39.593
So should you read the
questions or the passage first?

00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:43.372
Well, I would recommend that,

00:05:45.338 --> 00:05:47.007
well, it actually kind of, is up to you,

00:05:47.007 --> 00:05:49.140
so you want to do what works for you,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.028
but I would say that
scanning the questions

00:05:52.028 --> 00:05:55.990
can help focus your attention
as you read the passage.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.531
And say you have trouble
running out of time

00:05:59.531 --> 00:06:03.493
on the reading passage, it
can be particularly helpful

00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:05.525
because maybe you realize, you know,

00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:06.962
I won't be able to read
through the whole passage.

00:06:06.962 --> 00:06:08.067
I won't be able to
answer all the questions,

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:11.754
but maybe I can hone in
on the easier questions

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:12.940
and do those.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.037
And so, you wanna do what works for you,

00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:17.666
but I would encourage you

00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:20.902
to try scanning the questions
first to see how that feels.

00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:25.195
Try reading the passage
first, and do what works best.

00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:27.130
Okay, next question,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.018
should you answer all
reading questions in order,

00:06:30.018 --> 00:06:32.622
or can you jump around?

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:35.388
I want to say this is within the passage.

00:06:35.388 --> 00:06:37.988
So say you have a passage
and you have 11 questions,

00:06:37.988 --> 00:06:40.572
should you answer all
reading questions in order,

00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:42.489
or can you jump around?

00:06:46.348 --> 00:06:47.933
You can absolutely jump around,

00:06:47.933 --> 00:06:50.037
so jump around to your heart's content,

00:06:50.037 --> 00:06:53.886
as long as you keep track of
the questions you've skipped.

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:58.660
And so, what that means is
say you skip number 17 and 18,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.840
you'll just want to star
these in your test booklets,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.364
so that you remember to go back.

00:07:02.364 --> 00:07:04.468
And the reason you want to jump around,

00:07:04.468 --> 00:07:06.413
well, we'll get to that in just a second,

00:07:06.413 --> 00:07:08.517
but it's absolutely okay to jump around

00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:12.517
within the SAT Reading
section within a passage.

00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:16.252
Next up, next question,
should you do the easy

00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:20.490
or harder reading questions
first as you go through?

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.657
Should you do the easy or
harder reading questions first?

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:29.795
So you definitely want to
do the easy questions first,

00:07:29.795 --> 00:07:31.464
and that's because all questions

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:33.786
are worth the same number of points.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:35.835
So it could be the
hardest reading question

00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:38.810
in the whole section,
it's worth the same amount

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.460
as the easiest question on the SAT.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.007
Furthermore, answering
the easy questions first

00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:46.212
can help with time management,

00:07:46.212 --> 00:07:49.216
and also help you better
understand the passage.

00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:52.322
So maybe you've read the
passage and you're still,

00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:53.955
you've got some question marks,

00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:55.975
and you're not quite
sure you've understood,

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.750
well, these easier questions can help you

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.188
break down the passage
into its individual parts,

00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:05.150
and then build your
understanding of the passage.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.141
Now what do easy questions
sometimes look like?

00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:11.173
Well, easy questions tend to be,

00:08:11.173 --> 00:08:12.450
now this isn't always the case,

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.048
but they tend to be more specific.

00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:16.992
And what I mean by more specific

00:08:16.992 --> 00:08:19.360
is that they'll have a
line reference in them.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.360
So line eight indicates,

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:25.447
and so it'll tell you exactly

00:08:25.447 --> 00:08:27.914
where in the passage you want to look.

00:08:27.914 --> 00:08:30.453
Whereas the harder questions,

00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:33.878
and this, you know, again,
doesn't apply in all cases,

00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:37.013
but harder questions tend to be broader,

00:08:37.013 --> 00:08:40.659
and they might ask you
to compare and contrast,

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.663
and so, those questions tend
to take a little bit longer.

00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:47.830
And so, if I have a choice, I
tend to leave those for later.

00:08:49.598 --> 00:08:53.765
Okay, so a few more time
management questions here.

00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:59.380
So should you jump between
questions for different passages?

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.340
Jump between questions
for different passages?

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.069
So I'm saying you have
passage one and passage two,

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:07.623
is it okay to answer some
questions in passage one,

00:09:07.623 --> 00:09:09.858
and then some questions in passage two,

00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:12.818
and kind of go back and forth?

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.493
If you have a hunch go ahead

00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:17.660
and type that into the comments there.

00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:21.634
So my recommendation is no.

00:09:22.898 --> 00:09:26.744
I would not recommend
jumping between passages,

00:09:26.744 --> 00:09:29.081
and you wanna do your best
to answer all questions

00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:32.636
related to a passage before moving on.

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:34.740
And the reason for that is that switching

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.252
tends to take your brain
a decent amount of time.

00:09:38.252 --> 00:09:40.328
So in this process,

00:09:40.328 --> 00:09:43.941
this process of switching back
and forth, is time consuming.

00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:47.528
And if you sometimes have
trouble finishing the section,

00:09:47.528 --> 00:09:49.574
you don't want to do anything
that's time-consuming

00:09:49.574 --> 00:09:51.321
and takes away your time.

00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:53.364
So this is different from
what I mentioned before,

00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:58.229
so within the passage, within
a passage it's okay to jump.

00:09:58.229 --> 00:10:01.979
Within passage is okay
to jump, okay to jump.

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:07.656
Great, now final question here,

00:10:07.656 --> 00:10:11.847
if you're running out of
time, should you always guess?

00:10:11.847 --> 00:10:16.014
If you're running out of
time should you always guess?

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:22.707
Answer is yes, you should
absolutely always guess

00:10:22.707 --> 00:10:25.016
because there is no guessing penalty.

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:27.551
So even if you have five or 10

00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:29.049
or however many questions left,

00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:33.800
always go to your answer sheet
and bubble in your best guess

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.402
especially if, you know,
you have a minute left

00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:37.868
or 30 seconds left, it's
always better to guess

00:10:37.868 --> 00:10:41.547
so you have a chance at
earning that last point.

00:10:41.547 --> 00:10:42.733
Now we'll do a quick review

00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:43.845
of these time management questions,

00:10:43.845 --> 00:10:45.035
but you have any questions,

00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:46.878
go ahead and type those in the comments,

00:10:46.878 --> 00:10:48.501
as I'll be answering a few

00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:49.832
time management questions shortly.

00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:52.416
So if you have questions,
go ahead and submit them,

00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:54.810
and I'll get to those in a second.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.655
So should you read the
questions or the passage first?

00:10:57.655 --> 00:10:59.585
Again, this is do what works for you,

00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:01.921
but scanning the questions can help.

00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:03.750
Should you answer all
reading questions in order,

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.143
or can you jump around?

00:11:05.143 --> 00:11:06.783
You should absolutely feel free

00:11:06.783 --> 00:11:09.163
to jump around within a passage.

00:11:09.163 --> 00:11:11.358
Should you do the easy or
harder questions first?

00:11:11.358 --> 00:11:14.870
You should definitely
do the easy questions,

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.830
try starting there it can really help.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.834
Can you jump between questions
of different passages?

00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:21.667
No.

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:23.359
Should you always guess?

00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:24.192
Yes.

00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:28.503
And so, those are some of the most common

00:11:29.448 --> 00:11:31.175
time management questions I get,

00:11:31.175 --> 00:11:33.425
and for now I'm going to answer a few

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:35.689
time management questions
that you all have.

00:11:35.689 --> 00:11:38.373
And so I'm going to flip back
here, stop screen sharing

00:11:38.373 --> 00:11:39.897
that's some screen inception there.

00:11:39.897 --> 00:11:42.132
So if you have other time
management questions,

00:11:42.132 --> 00:11:43.787
go ahead and type them into the comments,

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.804
and I'll work through a few of them

00:11:45.804 --> 00:11:49.766
before moving on to a
real SAT Reading passage.

00:11:49.766 --> 00:11:51.449
So let's take a look.

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:55.208
Should you skip certain
questions altogether?

00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:58.954
Now that's an interesting question.

00:11:58.954 --> 00:12:01.971
I'd say I would encourage you

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:05.323
to scan through all of the
questions relating to a passage,

00:12:05.323 --> 00:12:08.356
and then if you're running
particularly low on time,

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:11.493
in one question, you know, just looks like

00:12:11.493 --> 00:12:13.597
it's going to take a
solid three, four minutes,

00:12:13.597 --> 00:12:16.081
then in that case, it's
completely fine to say,

00:12:16.081 --> 00:12:17.572
okay, I'm making a decision.

00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:19.753
I'm gonna skip number 18.

00:12:19.753 --> 00:12:21.480
And just make sure like I mentioned,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.338
to note that you skipped that question,

00:12:23.338 --> 00:12:26.879
so that on your answer sheet
when you're bubbling things in,

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.678
you don't accidentally mis-bubble.

00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:30.010
So that's probably the
most important thing

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.817
you want to remember when
you are skipping questions

00:12:32.817 --> 00:12:36.750
is that you want to mark
down in your answer sheet

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.073
where you've skipped these questions,

00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:39.641
so you don't mis-bubble anything.

00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:41.788
But you know, if you if
you're running low on time,

00:12:41.788 --> 00:12:43.137
and you see a question that's going to be

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:47.304
really tough and time-consuming,
it's okay to skip it.

00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:52.376
Let's see, is it better to skim or fully,

00:12:52.376 --> 00:12:55.856
so is it better to skim
or fully read the passage?

00:12:55.856 --> 00:12:58.477
So that's another great question,

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:01.786
and I would say that you'll
want to practice that,

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:04.619
and try a few approaches yourself.

00:13:06.241 --> 00:13:09.241
So I like to read the whole passage,

00:13:10.406 --> 00:13:12.452
and you know, be pretty
active as I go along

00:13:12.452 --> 00:13:15.326
to mark down what this
paragraph is saying,

00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:16.850
what the author's next point is.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.517
But for some people
what they can do is skim

00:13:21.436 --> 00:13:22.843
through the passage and look through

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:24.657
what are called the topic sentences.

00:13:24.657 --> 00:13:27.284
And that's the first
sentence in each paragraph,

00:13:27.284 --> 00:13:30.665
and that can be a quicker way
of gaining some understanding.

00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:32.770
But I'd say, you know,
skimming the passage,

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.036
and hoping to get a large
number of the questions right

00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:37.951
is gonna be difficult.

00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:40.346
At some point, you will need to really

00:13:40.346 --> 00:13:43.600
read in more detail and understand
what the author is saying

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.763
and their position on on the topic.

00:13:46.763 --> 00:13:47.596
Let's see,

00:13:51.112 --> 00:13:54.087
what do you do if you
don't understand a passage?

00:13:54.087 --> 00:13:57.227
So there I would, again, go back to,

00:13:57.227 --> 00:13:58.547
there a few things I'd recommend.

00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:00.869
One would be to read
just the topic sentence

00:14:00.869 --> 00:14:03.496
of each paragraph to get
a broad understanding

00:14:03.496 --> 00:14:05.557
without getting too detailed.

00:14:05.557 --> 00:14:06.878
Another approach that I mentioned

00:14:06.878 --> 00:14:09.795
is to tackle some of the
easier questions first,

00:14:09.795 --> 00:14:12.436
and those easy questions
will be more specific

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:13.989
to just certain parts of the passage,

00:14:13.989 --> 00:14:17.428
and if you can digest that
smaller part of the passage,

00:14:17.428 --> 00:14:19.532
it can often build up your understanding,

00:14:19.532 --> 00:14:22.275
so that you understand
the author's main points,

00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:24.713
and the broader passage itself.

00:14:24.713 --> 00:14:28.880
So we'll have more time to
answer these questions later,

00:14:29.851 --> 00:14:34.074
but for now I want to take
some time to work through

00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:35.772
some real SAT Reading questions.

00:14:35.772 --> 00:14:37.949
But like I mentioned,

00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:40.097
as I'm working through these questions,

00:14:40.097 --> 00:14:43.086
if there's something confusing,

00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:46.331
or you want me to answer
a question that you have,

00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:49.320
type in those questions along in the chat.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.091
We'll be collecting those
questions all throughout,

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:54.298
and I'll do some more Q&amp;A at the very end.

00:14:54.298 --> 00:14:55.575
For now though, we're going to do

00:14:55.575 --> 00:14:57.868
a real SAT Reading section,

00:14:57.868 --> 00:15:00.190
and get to as many of
those questions as we can,

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.818
so you can see what these
strategies look like

00:15:03.818 --> 00:15:06.140
within the context of a real passage.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.557
So let's dive in.

00:15:08.665 --> 00:15:11.082
Share my screen again, share.

00:15:14.209 --> 00:15:16.376
Okay, so like I mentioned,

00:15:17.855 --> 00:15:20.801
I like to take a look at
some of the questions first.

00:15:20.801 --> 00:15:22.325
and just give a quick scan.

00:15:22.325 --> 00:15:24.182
And I've changed the format here

00:15:24.182 --> 00:15:25.866
just to make it easier for you to read,

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:28.275
but so let's take a scan
through these questions.

00:15:28.275 --> 00:15:29.842
What main effect do the phrases

00:15:29.842 --> 00:15:31.717
paradigm shift and tilt that equation

00:15:31.717 --> 00:15:33.531
have on the meaning of the passage?

00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:36.245
So that's a interesting,
we've got line eight here

00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:37.828
and line 48 and 49.

00:15:39.496 --> 00:15:42.829
Actually, let's bring this back in here.

00:15:43.864 --> 00:15:47.855
So paradigm shift line
eight, tilt that equation.

00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:48.885
So this one is specific,

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:52.658
but it also has two parts of the passage

00:15:52.658 --> 00:15:53.703
that I need to look at.

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.401
So it might take a little bit of time.

00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:56.998
Based on the passage,

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.842
what is the significance of
Jeffrey Bada's experiment?

00:15:59.842 --> 00:16:02.977
So Bada is a name I
wanna pay attention to.

00:16:02.977 --> 00:16:03.810
According to the passage,

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.098
the main problem with the
Miller-Urey experiment,

00:16:07.098 --> 00:16:09.449
so another name I wanna pay attention to.

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:12.134
And then I've got two
pretty specific ones here

00:16:12.134 --> 00:16:16.415
line 29 and line 44 about more vocabulary,

00:16:16.415 --> 00:16:18.142
and words in context,

00:16:18.142 --> 00:16:22.627
then we've got main objections
of Bada's conclusion.

00:16:22.627 --> 00:16:25.848
And then, which choice
provides the best evidence?

00:16:25.848 --> 00:16:29.056
So here, just from
scanning these questions,

00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:32.495
I've honed in on a few
important parts of the passage

00:16:32.495 --> 00:16:35.997
that I want to look at,
so line eight, line 48.

00:16:35.997 --> 00:16:38.393
I have some names that I
want to pay attention to,

00:16:38.393 --> 00:16:40.903
so Bada, Miller-Urey.

00:16:40.903 --> 00:16:42.688
And then from this question,

00:16:42.688 --> 00:16:46.287
I've picked up that there's
some back and forth here.

00:16:46.287 --> 00:16:49.858
So there's some back and forth here,

00:16:49.858 --> 00:16:51.831
but sounds like between scientists,

00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:54.008
so we're talking about
conclusions and experiments.

00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:57.549
And so I wanna look at
the the kind of arguments

00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:59.479
that are being made here.

00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:02.353
And so this is my quick scan of questions,

00:17:02.353 --> 00:17:06.387
and now what I'll do is flip
over to the passage itself,

00:17:06.387 --> 00:17:08.637
and do some active reading.

00:17:09.899 --> 00:17:12.337
And don't worry we'll go back
to the questions in a sec.

00:17:12.337 --> 00:17:15.269
But hopefully, you can see this clearly.

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:17.054
And what I mean by active reading

00:17:17.054 --> 00:17:20.232
is that I will be underlining, and boxing,

00:17:20.232 --> 00:17:22.453
and making comments and checks,

00:17:22.453 --> 00:17:25.297
and happy faces and
smiley faces along the way

00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:28.432
to help me understand
as I'm going through.

00:17:28.432 --> 00:17:30.652
And so I'll start with the blurb here.

00:17:30.652 --> 00:17:32.379
And so that, this is the blurb.

00:17:32.379 --> 00:17:34.919
This passage is excerpted
from Douglas Fox,

00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:38.840
Primordial Soup's On
Scientists Repeat Evolution's

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.975
Most Famous Experiments
by Scientific American.

00:17:41.975 --> 00:17:44.288
So again, it's a science passage.

00:17:44.288 --> 00:17:45.228
Let's take a read.

00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:47.361
A Frankensteinesque
contraption of glass bulbs

00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.453
and crackling electrodes has
produced yet another revelation

00:17:50.453 --> 00:17:52.397
about the origin of life.

00:17:52.397 --> 00:17:53.790
Okay, so that's my introduction.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.407
We're talking about the origin of life.

00:17:56.407 --> 00:18:00.190
The results suggest that
Earth's early atmosphere

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.658
could have produced
chemicals necessary for life,

00:18:02.658 --> 00:18:04.805
contradicting the view that,

00:18:04.805 --> 00:18:07.069
contradicting the view
that life's building blocks

00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:10.102
had to come from comets and meteors.

00:18:10.102 --> 00:18:13.310
So this is what's called a
topic sentence in the paragraph.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.964
And so it tells me a lot about what

00:18:14.964 --> 00:18:17.402
is gonna be ahead in the paragraph.

00:18:17.402 --> 00:18:19.550
And what I've gleaned from this

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.590
is that Earth might have had the chemicals

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.172
necessary for life.

00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:26.350
And we have a but word
here so contradicting

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.570
the view that life's building blocks

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.414
had to come from comets,
and so, that's important.

00:18:30.414 --> 00:18:33.331
I like to circle these contrasting,

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.147
kind of hold on but not yet worked.

00:18:37.989 --> 00:18:39.379
So, "Maybe we're over optimistic,

00:18:39.379 --> 00:18:41.417
"but I think this is a paradigm shift."

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:45.698
Okay so that was that
line eight word there,

00:18:45.698 --> 00:18:47.802
It says, chemist Jeffrey Bada,

00:18:47.802 --> 00:18:48.893
whose team performed the experiment

00:18:48.893 --> 00:18:50.707
at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography

00:18:50.707 --> 00:18:52.942
in La Jolla, California.

00:18:52.942 --> 00:18:56.527
Bada was revisiting the
famous experiment first done

00:18:56.527 --> 00:18:59.328
by his mentor, chemist Stanley Miller.

00:18:59.328 --> 00:19:01.882
Okay, so Miller that
was a name that I wanted

00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:05.191
to pay attention to, so
I've got Miller and Urey,

00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:08.979
used a sparking device to
mimic a lightning storm.

00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:11.129
The experiment produced a brown broth

00:19:11.129 --> 00:19:15.251
rich in amino acids, the
building blocks of proteins.

00:19:15.251 --> 00:19:17.645
The disclosure made the
pages of national magazines.

00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:19.839
Oh, so made pages of national magazines,

00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:22.147
and showed that theories
about the origin of life

00:19:22.147 --> 00:19:24.004
be tested in a laboratory.

00:19:24.004 --> 00:19:26.341
So this seems to be like
a pretty positive outcome,

00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:28.155
so I'm gonna add some pluses here.

00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:31.565
And produced brown broth
rich in amino acids,

00:19:31.565 --> 00:19:34.250
so I've got some amino
acids that are here.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.270
Okay great, so let's
continue reading here.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.607
Okay, here's another one
of those contrasting words.

00:19:40.607 --> 00:19:43.190
So, but, anytime that comes up,

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.253
it's usually worth paying attention to.

00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:49.343
The Miller-Urey results
were later questioned.

00:19:49.343 --> 00:19:52.463
It turns out that the gases he used,

00:19:52.463 --> 00:19:54.190
a reactive mixture of methane and ammonia,

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.615
did not exist in large
amounts on early Earth.

00:19:57.615 --> 00:19:59.865
Scientists now believe
the primeval atmosphere

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.840
contained an inert mix of
carbon dioxide and nitrogen,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.568
a change that made a world of difference.

00:20:05.568 --> 00:20:09.037
Okay so, just to recap
here in the passage,

00:20:09.037 --> 00:20:11.954
we have experiment by Bada up here.

00:20:14.145 --> 00:20:15.478
So this is Bada,

00:20:17.506 --> 00:20:19.923
and then we have Miller here.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.757
And so initially we're
feeling pretty happy,

00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:28.332
but then, now, we're feeling sad.

00:20:28.332 --> 00:20:30.349
So change made a world of difference.

00:20:30.349 --> 00:20:32.543
I'm gonna, well, I don't
know that it's sad yet,

00:20:32.543 --> 00:20:37.463
but there's definitely a
kind of shift happening here.

00:20:37.463 --> 00:20:39.437
So when Miller repeated the experiment

00:20:39.437 --> 00:20:41.381
using the correct combo in 1983,

00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:43.311
the broth failed to materialize.

00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:45.213
Instead it created a colorless brew

00:20:45.213 --> 00:20:47.099
containing few amino acids.

00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:49.508
It seemed to refute a
long-cherished icon of evolution,

00:20:49.508 --> 00:20:51.714
and creationists quickly seized on it

00:20:51.714 --> 00:20:55.226
as supposed evidence of
evolution's wobbly foundations.

00:20:55.226 --> 00:20:57.403
So seized was another one of those words

00:20:57.403 --> 00:20:59.580
that we were asked about in the questions,

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.599
so I wanna star this there.

00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:03.907
And so like it mentioned,

00:21:03.907 --> 00:21:06.133
it seems like the experiment

00:21:06.133 --> 00:21:07.976
did not go as well the second time around,

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.792
and then we have yet another but.

00:21:10.792 --> 00:21:14.957
So, but, another shift
that's happening here.

00:21:14.957 --> 00:21:16.092
Bada's repeat of the experiment,

00:21:16.092 --> 00:21:17.238
armed with new insight,

00:21:17.238 --> 00:21:19.792
seems likely to turn
the tables once again.

00:21:19.792 --> 00:21:21.563
Bada discovered that the reactions

00:21:21.563 --> 00:21:23.725
were producing chemicals called nitrites,

00:21:23.725 --> 00:21:26.729
which destroy amino acids
as quickly as they form.

00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:29.167
They were also turning the water acidic,

00:21:29.167 --> 00:21:31.809
which prevents amino acids from forming.

00:21:31.809 --> 00:21:33.392
Yet primitive Earth

00:21:34.442 --> 00:21:36.848
would have contained iron
and carbonate minerals

00:21:36.848 --> 00:21:39.025
that neutralized nitrites and acids.

00:21:39.025 --> 00:21:41.463
So Bada added the
chemicals to the experiment

00:21:41.463 --> 00:21:43.030
to duplicate these functions.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.468
When he reran it, he still
got the same watery liquid,

00:21:45.468 --> 00:21:48.008
but this time chock full of amino acids.

00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:50.330
So this amino acids keeps coming up,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.668
and so I'm gonna mark out
that this time he did have it.

00:21:53.668 --> 00:21:57.835
And so now we've shifted back
to Bada's point of view here,

00:21:58.892 --> 00:22:03.059
and I just want to note that
this had no amino acids here.

00:22:05.089 --> 00:22:07.484
Just so I know that, okay.

00:22:07.484 --> 00:22:08.717
I'll read a little bit more.

00:22:08.717 --> 00:22:10.691
So, "It's important
work," Christopher McKay,

00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:13.884
a planetary scientist at
NASA Ames Research Center.

00:22:13.884 --> 00:22:16.467
"This move toward more realism

00:22:16.467 --> 00:22:20.647
"in terms of what conditions
were on early Earth."

00:22:20.647 --> 00:22:24.161
So important work, so this is positive.

00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:26.803
Most researchers believe
that the origin of life

00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:29.197
depended heavily on
chemicals delivered to Earth

00:22:29.197 --> 00:22:30.881
by comets and meteorites.

00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:32.027
But if the new work holds up,

00:22:32.027 --> 00:22:33.566
it could tilt that equation.

00:22:33.566 --> 00:22:35.783
So that is another one of the questions

00:22:35.783 --> 00:22:37.366
that we were asked.

00:22:38.276 --> 00:22:40.177
Is astrobiologist at Princeton,

00:22:40.177 --> 00:22:41.294
"That would be a terrific result

00:22:41.294 --> 00:22:43.834
"for understanding the origin of life,

00:22:43.834 --> 00:22:46.925
"and for understanding the
prospects for life elsewhere."

00:22:46.925 --> 00:22:49.675
Okay, and a little bit more, but,

00:22:50.756 --> 00:22:52.788
another but, lots of buts.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:56.242
James Ferris, a prebiotic chemist
at Rensselaer Polytechnic,

00:22:56.242 --> 00:22:59.043
doubts that atmospheric electricity,

00:22:59.043 --> 00:23:03.043
so not yet there's a bit
of a hold-on tone here,

00:23:04.064 --> 00:23:07.315
could have been the only
source of organic molecules.

00:23:07.315 --> 00:23:09.217
"You get a fair amount of amino acids.

00:23:09.217 --> 00:23:10.644
"What you don't get are things

00:23:10.644 --> 00:23:13.039
like the building blocks
of nucleic acids."

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:15.215
Meteors, comets or primordial ponds

00:23:15.215 --> 00:23:17.654
would still need to
provide these molecules.

00:23:17.654 --> 00:23:20.193
So Bada's experiment
could have implications

00:23:20.193 --> 00:23:22.385
for life on Mars because the Red Planet

00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:23.821
may have been swaddled in nitrogen

00:23:23.821 --> 00:23:25.751
and carbon dioxide early in its life.

00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:27.609
Bada intends to test this extrapolation

00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:30.033
by doing experiments
with lower-pressure mixes

00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:31.283
of those gases.

00:23:32.151 --> 00:23:36.318
Okay, so that was a lot of
information, but as I zoom out,

00:23:37.495 --> 00:23:38.990
don't worry about trying
to read it right now.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.574
I just want you to look
at how many underlining,

00:23:42.574 --> 00:23:43.764
how much I've underlined,

00:23:43.764 --> 00:23:44.838
how much I've boxed,

00:23:44.838 --> 00:23:46.899
and how much I've annotated this passage.

00:23:46.899 --> 00:23:48.466
And that it takes some time,

00:23:48.466 --> 00:23:51.470
but as you practice more and more,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.344
you'll get faster at
reading while annotating.

00:23:54.344 --> 00:23:57.754
And what this annotation does
is make it easier for you

00:23:57.754 --> 00:24:00.279
to find the relevant information

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:03.080
once you go through the questions.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.241
So now I've done that.

00:24:04.241 --> 00:24:07.985
And now I'm going to bring
up the actual questions,

00:24:07.985 --> 00:24:12.194
and we're going to step
through these one by one.

00:24:12.194 --> 00:24:15.619
So I'm zooming in, making
sure you can read it here.

00:24:15.619 --> 00:24:19.508
So what main effect do the
phrases paradigm shift,

00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:21.093
line eight, and tilt that equation

00:24:21.093 --> 00:24:23.923
have on the meaning of the passage.

00:24:23.923 --> 00:24:26.913
So paradigm shift in line eight,

00:24:26.913 --> 00:24:29.133
I'm gonna change colors here,

00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:31.550
paradigm shift in line eight.

00:24:35.202 --> 00:24:36.842
And so let's take a read here

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:39.367
before we jump to lines 48 to 49.

00:24:39.367 --> 00:24:42.095
So you'll notice I haven't looked

00:24:42.095 --> 00:24:43.358
at any of these answer choices.

00:24:43.358 --> 00:24:45.665
I've gone straight from the
question to the passage,

00:24:45.665 --> 00:24:49.511
and this is all about coming
up with your own answer

00:24:49.511 --> 00:24:51.470
before you look at the answer choices.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:56.042
So let's see, let's read some
of the context along here.

00:24:56.042 --> 00:24:57.362
So maybe we're over-optimistic,

00:24:57.362 --> 00:24:59.409
but I think this is a paradigm shift.

00:24:59.409 --> 00:25:03.037
Um, contradicting the
views a paradigm shift.

00:25:03.037 --> 00:25:06.157
Shift usually means that
there's a change going on.

00:25:06.157 --> 00:25:09.846
So it sounds like there's
a change in our thinking.

00:25:09.846 --> 00:25:14.069
And then lines 48 to
49, tilt that equation.

00:25:14.069 --> 00:25:17.986
Lines 48 to 49 here, so
here I've starred this.

00:25:20.875 --> 00:25:25.752
And so most researchers
believe the origin of life

00:25:25.752 --> 00:25:28.163
depended on chemicals but
if the new work holds up,

00:25:28.163 --> 00:25:30.496
it could tilt that equation.

00:25:31.355 --> 00:25:33.809
That would be a terrific result

00:25:33.809 --> 00:25:35.129
for understanding the origin of life,

00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:38.061
and for understanding
prospects, so tilt that.

00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:40.934
So if the new work holds up,
it could tilt that equation,

00:25:40.934 --> 00:25:43.735
and so we're talking about beliefs here.

00:25:43.735 --> 00:25:48.074
And so this again, is
reinforcing this fact

00:25:48.074 --> 00:25:50.382
that there's a change in
beliefs that's happening.

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:51.778
And so my that's going to be my prediction

00:25:51.778 --> 00:25:53.778
for question number one.

00:25:54.622 --> 00:25:56.789
Oh, what's the main effect

00:25:58.655 --> 00:26:01.141
that these words have on
the meaning of the passage?

00:26:01.141 --> 00:26:03.508
And so the main effect I'm saying

00:26:03.508 --> 00:26:05.861
is that it indicates a change

00:26:05.861 --> 00:26:08.766
in the belief that's happening.

00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:10.917
And so now I want to match this

00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:13.736
against these answer choices here.

00:26:13.736 --> 00:26:17.186
So A, they imply that
the accepted theories

00:26:17.186 --> 00:26:20.930
regarding the origin of life
on Earth are groundless.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.978
So groundless, that seems pretty strong

00:26:23.978 --> 00:26:28.433
and it doesn't match my
prediction that it's these phrases

00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:32.221
just indicate that there's
been a change in the belief

00:26:32.221 --> 00:26:34.195
in what scientists believe.

00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:36.168
They indicate that Miller's experiment

00:26:36.168 --> 00:26:38.926
regarding the origin of life
on Earth has sparked a debate.

00:26:38.926 --> 00:26:40.609
So I like this word debate,

00:26:40.609 --> 00:26:43.076
so I'll leave a question mark here,

00:26:43.076 --> 00:26:45.340
and I'll leave that in contention.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.849
They suggest a shift in scientific thought

00:26:47.849 --> 00:26:50.330
regarding the origin of life on Earth.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.930
So that shift and scientific thought

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.366
regarding the origin of life on Earth.

00:26:54.366 --> 00:26:57.475
So this is pretty darn close to a change

00:26:57.475 --> 00:26:59.245
that I have in mind.

00:26:59.245 --> 00:27:02.075
And so, we've got a change there,

00:27:02.075 --> 00:27:03.628
and so I like that.

00:27:03.628 --> 00:27:07.808
And then, so that one is, you
know, in the lead right now.

00:27:07.808 --> 00:27:09.781
And then D, they signal that scientists

00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:12.176
are now certain how life began on Earth.

00:27:12.176 --> 00:27:14.193
So scientists are not certain.

00:27:14.193 --> 00:27:16.123
There's still a lot of experiments,

00:27:16.123 --> 00:27:18.982
and it seems like things are
going in a promising direction,

00:27:18.982 --> 00:27:20.753
but we are not certain.

00:27:20.753 --> 00:27:24.265
And so with that process of
elimination and matching,

00:27:24.265 --> 00:27:28.098
I know that my answer
is going to be C, great.

00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:30.825
So that was a early example

00:27:30.825 --> 00:27:33.785
of how you can use the
rephrase and predict strategy

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:36.557
to come up with your prediction here,

00:27:36.557 --> 00:27:39.097
and then match it with the answer choices.

00:27:39.097 --> 00:27:40.795
And it's usually easier to match,

00:27:40.795 --> 00:27:44.336
once you have a prediction in your mind

00:27:44.336 --> 00:27:48.210
than to go in and hope that
of one of these will fit.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:51.650
So for now I'm gonna do some quick erasing

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.914
just to make it easier later,

00:27:53.914 --> 00:27:56.105
but that was answer choice C.

00:27:56.105 --> 00:27:58.534
So bear with me, these are
some of the tech things

00:27:58.534 --> 00:28:00.617
that I mentioned earlier.

00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:05.602
Okay, so now I want to look
at question number two.

00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:08.272
So based on the passage,

00:28:08.272 --> 00:28:09.723
zoom in a little more,

00:28:09.723 --> 00:28:12.234
the significance of
Jeffrey Bada's experiment

00:28:12.234 --> 00:28:15.369
rests mainly on his success at,

00:28:15.369 --> 00:28:17.786
so the significance of
Jeffrey Bada's experiment

00:28:17.786 --> 00:28:20.369
rests mainly on his success at.

00:28:21.342 --> 00:28:24.856
Okay, so now I wanna go
back to the passage again,

00:28:24.856 --> 00:28:26.990
and look at the relevant parts

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.990
that relate to Bada and his success.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.367
And so we have Bada here,
and we've got Bada here.

00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:41.853
And so I'm almost using my notes as a map,

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:46.613
so I can jump directly to
where the relevant parts

00:28:46.613 --> 00:28:48.152
are in the passage.

00:28:48.152 --> 00:28:51.569
And so let's take a look, we've got Bada,

00:28:53.347 --> 00:28:56.351
so results suggest that chemical,

00:28:56.351 --> 00:28:57.572
Earth's early atmosphere could have

00:28:57.572 --> 00:29:00.272
produced chemicals necessary for life.

00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:01.810
We think this is a paradigm shift

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.227
and so this is creating life.

00:29:06.396 --> 00:29:09.154
Okay, so that's some context there,

00:29:09.154 --> 00:29:11.505
and then I've also got more

00:29:11.505 --> 00:29:13.406
about information from Bada here.

00:29:13.406 --> 00:29:15.612
So Bada discovered that the reactions

00:29:15.612 --> 00:29:17.745
are producing nitrites.

00:29:17.745 --> 00:29:20.793
Yet primitive Earth would
have contained carbonate.

00:29:20.793 --> 00:29:22.621
Okay, so I'm just scanning now.

00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:26.371
So Bada added chemicals,
and when he reran it

00:29:27.236 --> 00:29:28.586
got the same watery liquid,

00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:30.730
but it was chock full of amino acids

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.081
And so this is a success,

00:29:33.081 --> 00:29:37.248
right so, he kind of proved
that amino acids came in,

00:29:38.204 --> 00:29:40.605
and so that is successful.

00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:43.417
And so based on this
reread of the passage,

00:29:43.417 --> 00:29:47.335
the significance is really
that he was successful

00:29:47.335 --> 00:29:50.499
in reproducing the amino acids,

00:29:50.499 --> 00:29:53.749
and so that in an experimental setting.

00:29:55.506 --> 00:29:58.756
And so, the significance is that he had

00:30:01.282 --> 00:30:04.865
successfully produced
amino acids, one sec,

00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:14.182
success with amino
acids, with amino acids.

00:30:15.736 --> 00:30:18.552
So now let's see which
one of these matches here.

00:30:18.552 --> 00:30:20.223
So confirming that the
production of amino acids

00:30:20.223 --> 00:30:22.556
on early Earth was possible.

00:30:23.402 --> 00:30:26.086
So that is amino acids was possible,

00:30:26.086 --> 00:30:29.482
so that is a pretty close match.

00:30:29.482 --> 00:30:31.659
Explaining the critical
function of nitrates

00:30:31.659 --> 00:30:34.330
to the production of amino acids.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.637
So that did support the production,

00:30:36.637 --> 00:30:40.062
and the experiments, so
that is a maybe in my book.

00:30:40.062 --> 00:30:42.706
Verifying the presence of
nitrites in Earth's atmosphere

00:30:42.706 --> 00:30:45.100
as well as in comets and meteors.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.017
So he didn't mention
these comets and meteors

00:30:48.017 --> 00:30:49.701
when he reran the experiment,

00:30:49.701 --> 00:30:52.342
and so it's not that he verified

00:30:52.342 --> 00:30:54.606
that they were in them, so that is out.

00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:56.783
Then tracing the development
of different types

00:30:56.783 --> 00:30:59.018
of amino acids on Earth.

00:30:59.018 --> 00:31:00.823
So not only have we not talked

00:31:00.823 --> 00:31:02.690
about different types of amino acids,

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.794
but again my prediction is that

00:31:04.794 --> 00:31:06.927
the significance comes from the fact

00:31:06.927 --> 00:31:09.525
that he successfully
created these amino acids.

00:31:09.525 --> 00:31:12.942
And so that is most like answer choice A.

00:31:16.598 --> 00:31:19.597
Right, so now question number three.

00:31:19.597 --> 00:31:22.487
According to the passage, the main problem

00:31:22.487 --> 00:31:25.854
with the Miller-Urey experiment was that,

00:31:25.854 --> 00:31:28.829
so the main problem with
the Miller-Urey experiment.

00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:30.603
And so now I want to go through here,

00:31:30.603 --> 00:31:33.592
and look through the
Miller-Urey experiment.

00:31:33.592 --> 00:31:36.175
And look here, I've got Miller,

00:31:39.832 --> 00:31:42.358
and then I've got more Miller here.

00:31:42.358 --> 00:31:43.635
So I want to reread this,

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:45.376
and I'm looking for the problem

00:31:45.376 --> 00:31:47.713
in the Miller-Urey experiment,

00:31:47.713 --> 00:31:51.715
and I've got this but here
and at then this sad face,

00:31:51.715 --> 00:31:53.770
because it's probably where
I need to pay attention.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:56.164
So, but the Miller-Urey
results were later questioned.

00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:58.254
It turns out that the gases he used

00:31:58.254 --> 00:32:00.769
did not exist in large amounts.

00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:04.291
Scientists now believe
that the new atmosphere

00:32:04.291 --> 00:32:07.470
contained a mix of carbon
dioxide and nitrogen.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.037
The change made a world of difference,

00:32:09.037 --> 00:32:13.695
and then when he reran it, the
broth failed to materialize,

00:32:13.695 --> 00:32:15.495
and so didn't work anymore.

00:32:15.495 --> 00:32:18.412
And so it sounds like these results

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:23.491
were later questioned
because the gases he used

00:32:23.491 --> 00:32:27.241
were kind of incorrect
given this new belief.

00:32:28.533 --> 00:32:32.117
And so if I go back down
here to the questions,

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:36.544
the main problem was that
there was a new belief,

00:32:36.544 --> 00:32:40.069
and new understanding about the gases,

00:32:40.069 --> 00:32:42.557
about gases and then that meant that

00:32:42.557 --> 00:32:45.358
when he used this new system

00:32:45.358 --> 00:32:48.159
then amino acids did not show up.

00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:50.934
So let's take a read here at number three.

00:32:50.934 --> 00:32:53.531
According to the passage,
to these answer choices,

00:32:53.531 --> 00:32:55.046
the results have never been duplicated

00:32:55.046 --> 00:32:58.733
in subsequent scientific experiments.

00:32:58.733 --> 00:33:02.624
So the issue is not that
they've never been duplicated,

00:33:02.624 --> 00:33:04.743
and my prediction was that
there was a new belief

00:33:04.743 --> 00:33:07.243
that made amino acids invalid,

00:33:08.247 --> 00:33:11.137
and that original setup
didn't work anymore.

00:33:11.137 --> 00:33:13.647
So it's not about duplication.

00:33:13.647 --> 00:33:15.781
The discovery of new evidence invalidated

00:33:15.781 --> 00:33:17.698
the method of analysis.

00:33:18.756 --> 00:33:23.591
So new evidence is pretty much
syncs with new belief there,

00:33:23.591 --> 00:33:25.219
is similar to belief,

00:33:25.219 --> 00:33:28.136
and so invalidated the method of analysis.

00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:30.589
And so, yep, it meant that
his original experiment

00:33:30.589 --> 00:33:34.217
didn't work, so that's pretty close.

00:33:34.217 --> 00:33:36.162
And then the conclusion
neglected to account

00:33:36.162 --> 00:33:39.064
for the ambiguous nature of the results,

00:33:39.064 --> 00:33:41.705
neglected to account for the ambiguous

00:33:41.705 --> 00:33:43.316
nature of the results.

00:33:43.316 --> 00:33:47.003
Nope, again it's not
matching my prediction

00:33:47.003 --> 00:33:48.105
around the new belief,

00:33:48.105 --> 00:33:51.588
and so I can toss that out there.

00:33:51.588 --> 00:33:54.665
And then, the research
methods used in the study

00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:57.930
were ineffective in a laboratory setting.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.295
So this one also feels close.

00:33:59.295 --> 00:34:01.259
The research methods used in the study

00:34:01.259 --> 00:34:05.100
were ineffective in
the laboratory setting.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.930
And so now we are at
that age-old crossroads

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:11.195
of having to answer choices left, B or D.

00:34:11.195 --> 00:34:13.778
So which one do we think it is?

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:20.251
So maybe you suggested a
few things in the passage,

00:34:20.251 --> 00:34:21.528
or in the chat,

00:34:21.528 --> 00:34:23.429
but what I like to do is
go back to the passage,

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:25.504
and look at the evidence.

00:34:25.504 --> 00:34:27.071
Because the correct answer

00:34:27.071 --> 00:34:30.047
when it comes down to
50/50 things like this,

00:34:30.047 --> 00:34:33.646
will always be supported by
more evidence in the passage.

00:34:33.646 --> 00:34:38.159
So the main problem with
the Miller-Urey experiment,

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.234
and that's gonna be up here.

00:34:40.234 --> 00:34:43.500
And so the results were later questioned,

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.981
there was this new belief,

00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:48.652
and a change made a world of difference.

00:34:48.652 --> 00:34:50.759
And so rerunning it
meant that he no longer

00:34:50.759 --> 00:34:52.573
got the results he wanted.

00:34:52.573 --> 00:34:56.740
And so to me the new belief is
really what makes it for me,

00:34:59.089 --> 00:35:02.630
and there's more evidence to
support this in the passage.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.024
So the discovery of new evidence

00:35:05.024 --> 00:35:09.073
invalidated his original
experiment that you see up here.

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:11.656
And so answer is going to be B.

00:35:12.585 --> 00:35:16.085
And because we just did that, which choice

00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:20.132
best supports the answer
to the previous question?

00:35:20.132 --> 00:35:21.206
Which choice best supports

00:35:21.206 --> 00:35:22.526
the answer to the previous question?

00:35:22.526 --> 00:35:25.526
Well we just looked at that up here,

00:35:26.726 --> 00:35:30.893
and so this is really where
we wanna pay attention.

00:35:31.994 --> 00:35:33.968
It turns out that the gases he used

00:35:33.968 --> 00:35:36.188
did not exist and scientists now believe.

00:35:36.188 --> 00:35:40.355
And so let's see which
answer choice matches that.

00:35:41.369 --> 00:35:45.036
It turns out, and go,
so there's our answer,

00:35:47.624 --> 00:35:49.975
and that was exactly the text we used.

00:35:49.975 --> 00:35:52.224
So it turns out that the gases is he used

00:35:52.224 --> 00:35:54.895
did not exist in large
amounts in early Earth.

00:35:54.895 --> 00:35:56.752
So I'll do one more question,

00:35:56.752 --> 00:35:59.002
and let's take a look here.

00:36:00.221 --> 00:36:03.471
Let's see questions five through eight.

00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:06.766
I'll move this passage over,

00:36:06.766 --> 00:36:08.766
and look at that magic.

00:36:10.133 --> 00:36:13.633
Okay, and so questions five through eight.

00:36:14.835 --> 00:36:16.242
Let's take a look here.

00:36:16.242 --> 00:36:20.117
As used in line 29, seized
on most nearly means.

00:36:20.117 --> 00:36:21.867
so seized on line 29.

00:36:24.326 --> 00:36:26.590
It seemed to refute a
long-cherished icon of evolution,

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.423
and creationist quickly seized on,

00:36:31.568 --> 00:36:32.651
seized on it.

00:36:33.672 --> 00:36:35.172
I'll zoom in here.

00:36:36.255 --> 00:36:38.301
So Miller reran the experiment,

00:36:38.301 --> 00:36:40.072
the broth failed to materialize,

00:36:40.072 --> 00:36:42.670
we have no amino acids,

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.571
and creationists quickly seized on it

00:36:44.571 --> 00:36:48.417
as supposed evidence of
evolution's wobbly foundations.

00:36:48.417 --> 00:36:50.347
So it sounds like
creationists were pretty happy

00:36:50.347 --> 00:36:52.654
about the experiments failure.

00:36:52.654 --> 00:36:55.876
And so it sounds like they're
they're almost bragging

00:36:55.876 --> 00:36:59.432
about the fact that the experiment failed,

00:36:59.432 --> 00:37:02.087
and so that's my prediction for this word.

00:37:02.087 --> 00:37:04.920
And so what we've got is bragging,

00:37:07.036 --> 00:37:08.807
and so which one of these words

00:37:08.807 --> 00:37:11.898
bragging about the evidence
matches this prediction

00:37:11.898 --> 00:37:14.731
about bragging about the evidence?

00:37:15.591 --> 00:37:18.392
So they embraced the evidence,

00:37:18.392 --> 00:37:22.339
that is not the same connotation
or meaning as bragging.

00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:24.922
Took advantage of the evidence,

00:37:27.012 --> 00:37:30.147
that feels pretty close,
so we'll leave that in.

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:32.498
They caught the evidence,

00:37:32.498 --> 00:37:34.213
so that is not the same
as bragging about it.

00:37:34.213 --> 00:37:35.694
They grappled with the evidence,

00:37:35.694 --> 00:37:37.014
so this almost means,

00:37:37.014 --> 00:37:40.788
grappling is almost the same
as discussing the evidence,

00:37:40.788 --> 00:37:44.822
or wrestling with it to
see you know if it's valid.

00:37:44.822 --> 00:37:47.420
But they didn't really
discuss or wrestle with it,

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.974
it was more just about bragging,

00:37:49.974 --> 00:37:51.875
and kind of saying, aha I've got you.

00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:55.042
And so answer choice is going to be E.

00:37:58.477 --> 00:38:00.560
So that was a run-through

00:38:01.401 --> 00:38:04.724
of the practice reading strategies

00:38:04.724 --> 00:38:08.018
and time management
strategies within the context

00:38:08.018 --> 00:38:10.529
of a real SAT Reading passage.

00:38:10.529 --> 00:38:11.748
Now as I went through it,

00:38:11.748 --> 00:38:13.243
I, you know, took my time,

00:38:13.243 --> 00:38:15.886
explained my thinking a lot more,

00:38:15.886 --> 00:38:19.019
and so spent a little
bit longer per question.

00:38:19.019 --> 00:38:21.573
If you're doing this
by yourself you would,

00:38:21.573 --> 00:38:23.416
as you gain more practice doing this,

00:38:23.416 --> 00:38:25.738
get faster and faster at this.

00:38:25.738 --> 00:38:27.596
But wanna to call out

00:38:27.596 --> 00:38:29.105
that some of y'all are probably saying,

00:38:29.105 --> 00:38:31.616
huh, if you spent a lot
of time for a question,

00:38:31.616 --> 00:38:34.039
you know, it's just for
the purpose of illustrating

00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:35.737
how to use this strategy.

00:38:35.737 --> 00:38:39.612
But as you practice at home
by yourself with a stopwatch,

00:38:39.612 --> 00:38:42.079
with a timer, you'll really get faster,

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:44.140
and you'll be able to move
more quickly through this.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.854
So now I'm gonna do a walk through,

00:38:46.854 --> 00:38:47.884
how you'll get your badge,

00:38:47.884 --> 00:38:50.032
and then I'll answer some final questions.

00:38:50.032 --> 00:38:53.442
So to get your badge
look at the YouTube chat,

00:38:53.442 --> 00:38:54.838
next to the live stream,

00:38:54.838 --> 00:38:57.349
and there will be a link to the badge.

00:38:57.349 --> 00:39:00.397
Once you click the
badge you'll be able to,

00:39:00.397 --> 00:39:02.762
you'll be asked to log into
your Khan Academy account,

00:39:02.762 --> 00:39:04.402
and then in the top right corner

00:39:04.402 --> 00:39:06.666
is where you're going to get
a notification that says,

00:39:06.666 --> 00:39:08.219
hey, you've got your badge.

00:39:08.219 --> 00:39:12.108
And so click the link,
log in, get your badge.

00:39:12.108 --> 00:39:13.373
Now finally I'm gonna

00:39:13.373 --> 00:39:16.290
do some more questions and answers,

00:39:17.248 --> 00:39:19.164
and so if you have a
question about anything

00:39:19.164 --> 00:39:21.254
that I've covered go
ahead and type that in,

00:39:21.254 --> 00:39:24.650
and I'll answer as many as I
can in the next few minutes.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:26.400
So let's take a look.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.343
How much time should
you spend on a passage?

00:39:30.343 --> 00:39:32.196
Lots of questions around this.

00:39:32.196 --> 00:39:35.696
So in this case, I would say a few things.

00:39:38.364 --> 00:39:40.991
So within the reading section

00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:44.619
there are a handful of
passages, and not only,

00:39:44.619 --> 00:39:46.346
what I would encourage you to do first

00:39:46.346 --> 00:39:49.190
is actually look through the passages,

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:53.878
and focus on the one that
maybe looks the easiest,

00:39:53.878 --> 00:39:56.229
and prioritize the easier
ones over the hard ones.

00:39:56.229 --> 00:39:58.295
And so that'll let you

00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:01.497
one, just focus your time on the passages

00:40:01.497 --> 00:40:06.035
that you know look the easiest
and most understandable,

00:40:06.035 --> 00:40:07.815
but then I would just do the math.

00:40:07.815 --> 00:40:11.313
And so you you'll know
that a reading section,

00:40:11.313 --> 00:40:14.941
I think is, I don't want to misquote this,

00:40:14.941 --> 00:40:18.571
but so look at how much
total time there is

00:40:18.571 --> 00:40:19.788
in the total reading section,

00:40:19.788 --> 00:40:22.763
divided by the total number
of reading questions.

00:40:22.763 --> 00:40:25.071
Since there are 11 questions per passage

00:40:25.071 --> 00:40:27.146
that should help you get an idea

00:40:27.146 --> 00:40:29.976
of how much time to spend
on each individual one.

00:40:29.976 --> 00:40:31.456
And so just do the division,

00:40:31.456 --> 00:40:34.873
and that would be a good goal to aim for.

00:40:35.882 --> 00:40:37.609
Let's see, how do you
improve your reading speed?

00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:38.596
So another good question,

00:40:38.596 --> 00:40:41.905
and sadly there's not
a silver bullet to this

00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:44.300
other than practicing and reading a lot.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.564
So it's not that you have to read

00:40:46.564 --> 00:40:48.421
a million SAT Reading passages,

00:40:48.421 --> 00:40:50.729
but the work that you're
doing in your English class,

00:40:50.729 --> 00:40:54.560
and if you're reading a
novel or reading nonfiction,

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.014
will all speed up your reading speed here.

00:40:58.014 --> 00:41:01.511
The only thing I might
suggest within the SAT context

00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:03.238
is if you are running low on time,

00:41:03.238 --> 00:41:04.777
to scan those topic sentences

00:41:04.777 --> 00:41:06.213
at the start of each paragraph,

00:41:06.213 --> 00:41:08.724
as that can give you a good
overview of the passage

00:41:08.724 --> 00:41:11.772
without needing to read every single word.

00:41:11.772 --> 00:41:15.939
Let's see, okay, for those
questions asking a point,

00:41:16.996 --> 00:41:19.391
and then making you find the evidence,

00:41:19.391 --> 00:41:21.306
do you read the evidence first,

00:41:21.306 --> 00:41:23.889
or figure out the answer first?

00:41:24.908 --> 00:41:27.259
So I would strongly encourage

00:41:27.259 --> 00:41:29.480
that you figure out the answer first,

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.313
and what that will force you to do

00:41:33.154 --> 00:41:35.142
is to go back into the passage

00:41:35.142 --> 00:41:37.348
to the parts that are
relevant for the question,

00:41:37.348 --> 00:41:39.830
evaluate the evidence yourself first,

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.384
and then as you come
up with your prediction

00:41:42.384 --> 00:41:46.680
for the right answer, you
naturally make the connection

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.623
and you'll say in your head,

00:41:47.623 --> 00:41:50.134
well, I think it's, you
know, the author's point is

00:41:50.134 --> 00:41:52.273
because of this line right here.

00:41:52.273 --> 00:41:55.590
And the power comes from when you can say

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.245
it's because of this line right here.

00:41:57.245 --> 00:41:59.059
And when you combine those

00:41:59.059 --> 00:42:02.237
you have not only the answer
to the first question,

00:42:02.237 --> 00:42:05.198
but the because part, as
you're saying it in your head,

00:42:05.198 --> 00:42:06.521
is the evidence and the answer

00:42:06.521 --> 00:42:09.521
to that second part of the question.

00:42:11.092 --> 00:42:15.259
Let's see, how do you practice
reading comprehension?

00:42:16.259 --> 00:42:19.466
So I would say there are
the practice sections

00:42:19.466 --> 00:42:21.730
within official SAT
practice on Khan Academy

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.341
are a great way to do it.

00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:25.402
And so as you practice,

00:42:25.402 --> 00:42:28.246
those sections have 11 questions each,

00:42:28.246 --> 00:42:30.742
very similar to what
you'll see on the SAT,

00:42:30.742 --> 00:42:32.963
the real SAT Reading section.

00:42:32.963 --> 00:42:36.097
And I would just have a timer there,

00:42:36.097 --> 00:42:39.421
so that you're simulating
the time pressure

00:42:39.421 --> 00:42:42.309
that you'll actually experience.

00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:44.892
And work through it at a good speed,

00:42:44.892 --> 00:42:49.059
and try and make sure you're
doing it within the time frame.

00:42:54.209 --> 00:42:55.109
Do you need to annotate?

00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:57.242
How can you annotate that
much in the limited time,

00:42:57.242 --> 00:42:59.056
and can you write in the test book?

00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:02.321
So I would say annotate as much as you can

00:43:02.321 --> 00:43:05.079
without really slowing
yourself down too much.

00:43:05.079 --> 00:43:09.302
It's a bit of a compromise
that you're striking.

00:43:09.302 --> 00:43:11.203
So if you read really fast,

00:43:11.203 --> 00:43:13.786
you might be going too fast,

00:43:13.786 --> 00:43:15.121
so that it's actually,

00:43:15.121 --> 00:43:18.154
you you may not have
understood everything.

00:43:18.154 --> 00:43:19.635
By annotating you slow down

00:43:19.635 --> 00:43:21.783
and check for understanding at each place,

00:43:21.783 --> 00:43:24.119
but I do understand
that the first few times

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:26.630
you're annotating it might
take a little bit more time.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.502
So as you practice you'll get faster,

00:43:28.502 --> 00:43:29.895
and you'll get faster at reading,

00:43:29.895 --> 00:43:33.697
understanding, and annotating all at once.

00:43:33.697 --> 00:43:34.974
And your final question,

00:43:34.974 --> 00:43:36.048
can you write on the test booklet?

00:43:36.048 --> 00:43:39.594
Absolutely, so mark that test booklet up

00:43:39.594 --> 00:43:40.943
as much as you want,

00:43:40.943 --> 00:43:42.264
and the more you mark it up,

00:43:42.264 --> 00:43:45.631
the more hands-on you are, the better.

00:43:45.631 --> 00:43:48.072
Let's see, how do you best

00:43:48.072 --> 00:43:49.886
go about answering paired passages?

00:43:49.886 --> 00:43:51.090
So great question.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.354
So paired passages are a
really interesting beast,

00:43:53.354 --> 00:43:54.849
and the way I would do that

00:43:54.849 --> 00:43:57.897
is you have two passages,
right, passage A and passage B.

00:43:57.897 --> 00:44:01.278
What you want to do is
answer read passage A,

00:44:01.278 --> 00:44:03.049
answer passage A questions.

00:44:03.049 --> 00:44:06.561
Read passage B, answer
passage B questions.

00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:07.562
And then those questions

00:44:07.562 --> 00:44:11.437
that ask you to compare and
contrast passage A and B,

00:44:11.437 --> 00:44:13.280
those obviously require
the most understanding

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.397
across both passages,

00:44:14.397 --> 00:44:15.921
and you want to save those for the end.

00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:17.285
And so this goes back to
that time management tip

00:44:17.285 --> 00:44:19.143
that I shared earlier that says,

00:44:19.143 --> 00:44:21.450
you know, stay within a passage,

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:24.251
do all the questions related
to that first passage

00:44:24.251 --> 00:44:26.588
before you shift to the second passage,

00:44:26.588 --> 00:44:29.145
and then finally, the hardest questions

00:44:29.145 --> 00:44:32.323
that cover everything you
want to save for the very end.

00:44:32.323 --> 00:44:35.124
And so, I'll just do one more question

00:44:35.124 --> 00:44:37.624
and then we'll wrap things up.

00:44:41.666 --> 00:44:42.963
Ah, (laughs) wait we have one,

00:44:42.963 --> 00:44:43.950
when is the next livestream?

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.721
That's probably a good one to end on.

00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:48.681
So the next livestream is next Tuesday,

00:44:48.681 --> 00:44:52.469
same time, so 7:00 p.m.
Eastern, 4:00 p.m. Pacific,

00:44:52.469 --> 00:44:53.949
and we're going to cover SAT Writing.

00:44:53.949 --> 00:44:56.866
And so that's gonna be all about grammar,

00:44:56.866 --> 00:44:59.159
and kind of how important context is

00:44:59.159 --> 00:45:02.889
within an SAT Writing
and language passage.

00:45:02.889 --> 00:45:05.559
And so that'll be next
Tuesday, same exact time.

00:45:05.559 --> 00:45:06.474
You can't make it don't worry,

00:45:06.474 --> 00:45:07.547
we'll send out the recording,

00:45:07.547 --> 00:45:10.392
but that's all I have for you today,

00:45:10.392 --> 00:45:12.220
and hopefully you found this helpful,

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.558
and feel free to go back
and re-watch any of this

00:45:15.558 --> 00:45:18.287
if you want to slow down and see a repeat.

00:45:18.287 --> 00:45:19.549
But hope you found this helpful,

00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:22.786
