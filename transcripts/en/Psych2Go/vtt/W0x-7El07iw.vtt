00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.420
Everyone has some idea of what their ideal life looks like.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.620
Whether it means affording to travel freely,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.660
coming home to a loving family,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.100
or having all the cats and dogs in the world.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.225
But things are getting harder by the second.

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:22.560
It can be nearly impossible just getting out of bed in the morning.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.260
Why is it so much easier giving in to negativity than it is to get out of it?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.640
Depression doesn't just weigh down our shoulders.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:34.680
It lies, often telling us that we're not in control of our lives, but we are.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.400
Whatever you're going through, know it's not always going to be like this.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.800
Here are eight tips for dealing with suicidal thoughts:

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.860
1) Don't spend the night alone. When you're suicidal, it will be tempting to isolate yourself.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.720
Do you lock yourself in your room, shut the blinds and hide underneath your covers?

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.300
The thing about depression is that the darkness will welcome you, but this only makes you susceptible to believe your negative thoughts.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.900
Watch out for your safety, and don't spend the night alone.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.060
Call up your family, friends or lover. Tell them how you're feeling.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.860
If possible, sleeping over at their place is even better.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.280
Having company around can do wonders for you because it means keeping those bad thoughts at bay,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.240
or allowing the new environment to boost your mood.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.080
2) Cut off all ties with toxic people.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.860
Research shows that keeping toxic people in your life isn't just stressful, it can actually kill you.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.960
One study showed that subjects in negative relationships had a higher risk of developing cardiac problems.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.759
If someone is abusing you, physically or emotionally, please call the police for help.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:49.070
Your life might drastically change if your family members or partner are the toxic ones, but realize that they're putting you in more pain than they are supporting you.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.480
3) Make a list of your accomplishments.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.840
Hey you, yeah you, look at how far you've come!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.120
Failure can seem like a big slap in the face, but we often obsess over perfection instead of focusing on what we've achieved.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.680
There's a difference: striving for perfection doesn't allow you to be human.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.640
Embrace your flaws, failures and downfalls as much as you appreciate all the milestones you've reached.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.600
Listen closely to what isn't working, turn those into lessons, and grow resilient.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.560
4) Practice positive mantras. These are otherwise known as coping statements.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.300
Ending your life will seem like the only option to end your misery, but nothing lasts forever.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.160
Practice saying some of these: "I will get through this." "This is my depression talking, not me." "I don't really want to die,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.240
I just want the pain to end." Stick these to your mirror, fridge and carry them wherever you go.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.140
Let them be friendly reminders to be kind to yourself. You got this!

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.940
5) Find a therapist.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.060
Most people shrug this idea off because they might not be able to afford it.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.320
But there are options, especially if you're a student. An open mind is what will ultimately get you help.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.760
Call your insurance company for any insights they might have.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.360
It never hurts to ask your family doctor too.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.300
Networks exists for a reason, and the more professional advice you receive, the faster you can find and work with a professional.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.920
6) If it's urgent, please call the police.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.600
This won't necessarily stop your suicidal thoughts

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.760
but they will stop you from going through with the act.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.240
From here on out, they can take you to the ER where you'll be safe.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.540
We hope you never have to resort to this, but want to remind you that help is only one call away.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.500
7) Find out what's hurting you and make changes to it.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.440
Do you feel stuck at your dead-end job? Tired of the city you're living in? Or not sure about what you're studying in school?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.960
It's ok to address that you're feeling unhappy, but don't succumb to helplessness.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.840
It may take time to find what works for you, but this is why practicing patience is so pivotal.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.700
Big projects seem intimidating, but break them up into smaller tasks to make them more approachable.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.140
Remember, as you wait for your miracle, never stop working on yourself in the mean time.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.220
8) Whatever you do, please don't lose hope!

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.600
I know it's easier said than done, but committing suicide will end everything,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.520
including the amazing days ahead that you won't be alive for.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.740
People usually realize too late, while they're in the middle of the act, that every problem they ever faced could have been fixed.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.380
So please reconsider your health. You deserve so much more!

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.260
What do you do to keep going or stay inspired?

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.200
We want you to know that you're not alone and we're sending our best wishes your way.

Hey guys it's Yumi, one of the partners of Psych2Go.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.380
Today I'm here to talk to you guys about Bell Let's Talk, a mental health initiative that aims to raise awareness.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.700
Every year Bell, is dedicated to moving mental health board in Canada.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.620
Bell Let's Talk promotes awareness and action with a strategy built on four key pillars:

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.970
fighting the stigma,

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.080
improving access to care, supporting world-class research,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.020
and leading by example and workplace mental health.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.300
Psych2Go, being based in Canada,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.700
we can't help but want to participate along. As Ellen Degeneres puts it: "What the world needs more of is kindness and better mental health."

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.440
What Psych2Go wants to do is to encourage everyone to be a part of this movement by commenting below

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.880
about the time when you first opened up and struggled with mental health.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.200
We will pick five commenters and they will receive one of our digital magazines.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.200
Don't forget to hashtag Bell Let's Talk and hashtag Psych2Go. We can't wait to hear from you!
