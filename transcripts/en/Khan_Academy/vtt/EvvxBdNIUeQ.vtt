00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.310
Write a binomial to express
the difference between the area

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.170
of a rectangle with
length p and width 2r

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.890
and the area of a
circle with diameter 4r.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.180
And they tell us that
p is greater than 7r.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.830
So let's first
think about the area

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.530
of a rectangle with
length p and width 2r.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.640
So this is our
rectangle right here.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.390
It has a length of p and
it has a width of 2r.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.700
So what's its area?

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.090
Well, it's just going to be
the length times the width.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.680
So the area here is going to be
p-- or maybe I should say 2rp.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.145
This is the length
times the width,

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:43.395
or the width times the length.

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:46.444
So area is equal to
2rp for the rectangle.

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:48.860
Now, we also want to find the
difference between this area

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.875
and the area of a
circle with diameter 4r.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:54.750
So what's the area of
the circle going to be?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.020
So let me draw our
circle over here.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.380
So our circle looks like that.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.731
Its diameter is 4r.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.480
How do we figure out
the area of a circle?

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.350
Well, area is equal
to pi r squared

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.300
for a circle, where
r is a radius.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.890
They gave us the diameter.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.660
The radius is half of that.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.610
So the radius here is going to
be half this distance, or 2r.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.840
So the area of our circle
is going to be pi times 2r,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.937
the whole thing squared.

00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:30.020
This is the radius, right?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.519
So we're squaring
the entire radius.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:35.870
So this is going to be equal
to pi times 4 times r squared.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.490
I'm just squaring
each of these terms.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.710
Or if we were to change the
order, the area of the circle

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.610
is equal to 4 pi r squared.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.630
And we want to find
the difference.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.631
So to find a difference,
It's helpful--

00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:53.630
just so we don't end up
with a negative number--

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.820
to figure out which of
these two is larger.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.740
So they're telling us that
p is greater than 7 r.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.830
So let's think about this.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.800
If p is greater than 7r, then
2-- let me write it this way.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.626
We know that p is
greater than 7r.

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:15.000
So if we're going to multiply
both sides of this equation

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.520
by 2rr-- and 2r
is positive, we're

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.480
dealing with positive
distances, positive lengths--

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.180
so if we multiply both sides
of this equation by 2r,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.530
it shouldn't change
the equation.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.630
So multiply that by 2r, and
then multiply this by 2r.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.530
And then our equation
becomes 2rp is greater

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.952
than 14r squared.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.160
Now, why is this interesting?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.560
Actually, why did I even
multiply this by 2r?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.440
Well, that's so that
this becomes the same

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.149
as the area of the rectangle.

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.690
So this is the area
of the rectangle.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.350
And what's 14r squared?

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.310
Well, 4 times pi, is going to
get us something less than 14.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.970
This is less than 14.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.366
So this is 4 pi is less than 14.

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:18.550
14 is 4 times 3 and 2--
let me put it this way.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.330
4 times 3.5 is equal to 14.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.940
Right?

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.670
So 4 times pi, which
is less than 3.5,

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.470
is going to be less than 14.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.620
So we know that
this over here is

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.000
larger than this
quantity over here.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.810
It's larger than 4 pi r squared.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.120
And so we know
that this rectangle

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.880
has a larger area
than the circle.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.950
So we can just subtract
the circle's area

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.880
from the rectangle's area
to find the difference.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.430
So the difference is going to
be the area of the rectangle,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.020
which we already
figured out is 2rp.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.100
And we're going to subtract from
that the area of the circle.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.320
The area of the circle
is 4 pi r squared.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.750
So hopefully that made sense.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.510
And one point I want to clarify.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.730
I gave the equation of the area
of a circle to be pi r squared.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.390
And then we said that the radius
is actually 2r in this case.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.102
So I substituted 2r for r.

00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:23.560
Hopefully that
doesn't confuse you.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.600
This r is the general
term for any radius.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.740
They later told us
that the actual radius

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.690
is 2 times some letter r.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.320
So I substitute that
into the formula.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.680
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
