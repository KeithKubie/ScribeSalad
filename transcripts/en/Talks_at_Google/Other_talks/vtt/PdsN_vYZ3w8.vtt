CARL HART: Thank you for having
me here at Google.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.190
I always enjoy coming
to Google.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.000
I was at Google in Irvine,
and the facilities are

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.030
outstanding.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.235
Actually, you guys' facilities
here are better than the ones

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:17.900
out in Irvine.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.960
Don't tell people
in Irvine that.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.390
I really enjoyed
my time there.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.930
So today what I'd like to do
is talk today about my new

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.960
book called "High Price: A
Neural Scientist's Journey of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
Self-Discovery That Challenges
Everything That You Know About

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.270
Drugs and Society." Since we
have a number of young people

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.810
in the audience, I suspect that
there will be some things

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.130
that you do know about
drugs, right?

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.380
At least, I hope.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.540
So when I think about doing
these book talks, it's a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.030
difficult thing to do to
encapsulate a whole book in a

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.780
short talk.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.090
I'll talk about 20 minutes or
so, maybe half an hour, and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.660
then I'll open it up
for questions.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.370
And so trying to encapsulate a
whole book and in that period

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.870
of time it is difficult.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.360
So what I like to do is to break
it up in three parts.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.670
The book is a hybrid.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.710
It is part memoir, part big idea
science book, and part

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.370
policy book.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.660
And so, the reason why
I did the memoir--

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.970
I told a deeply personal story,
and it causes me a

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.590
great deal of anxiety to
share so many personal

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.510
details about my life.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.820
But one of the reasons that I
did that was so that people

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.070
who came or who come from where
I come from, so they

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.590
could have someone to identify
with, partly.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.090
And I also told this deeply
personal story because I know

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.680
that when we read books about
drugs and policy, only 10

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.470
people read them, or so,
because they're boring.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.510
And I get it.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.020
Me too, I'm bored.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.810
But if you tell a story with
some personal details, some

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.720
anecdotes, folks are more
likely to engage

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.970
and read the story.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.680
But there's a problem with
anecdotes and personal

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.810
information.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.170
You can sometimes learn
something from

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.150
it, learn by example.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.320
That's a good thing.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.900
But the problem is you sometimes
inappropriately

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.570
apply those anecdotes to more
general situations, and you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.530
make the mistake of taking
an anecdote that's not

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.780
representative.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.110
And so that's why I included
the science to bolster, to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.150
support the anecdote.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.620
And then when you do this, you
come to some decisions that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.670
need to be made.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.590
You have learned something,
I learned

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.120
something in the process.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.780
And when you learn something
you want to make

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.660
suggestions, policy.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.940
You want to tell people
what we should do.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.020
With that said, I just like to
talk a little bit about the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.830
personal stuff.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.460
Now, people oftentimes ask me,
how did you go from the hood--

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.090
a neighborhood entrenched with
poverty, and all the problems

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.380
that come with it.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.070
How do you go from point A--
that being point A--

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.200
to point B, to where you are
the first African American

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.660
tenured professor in the
sciences at Columbia?

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.160
How do you do that?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.670
How does someone do that?

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.570
Well, one of the major forces
that helped me to do that--

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.590
major contributing factors--

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.100
was I was deeply involved
in sports when

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.320
I was in high school.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.650
I played basketball throughout
high school, and this allowed

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.420
me to stay plugged in to the
society, into school.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.080
It ensured that I would go to
school, because if I wanted to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.450
be on the school's basketball
team, I had to actually go to

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.240
school, right?

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.810
It also required that I maintain
at least a 2.0 grade

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.839
point average.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.079
It's not as high as what they
make you maintain here at

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.220
Google, but it was enough to
make sure that I at least

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.580
graduated, right?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.040
So that kept me plugged in, it
ensured that I graduated.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.470
Another factor was that I have
five sisters who are older

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.390
than I am, and a grandmother who
did their best to keep me

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.890
on the straight and narrow
path as they could.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.350
I wasn't always on the straight
and narrow path, of

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.030
course, because I engaged in
petty crimes, sold a little

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.950
drugs, did some drugs, those
sorts of things.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.420
But I knew I couldn't get too
far off the path, because I

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.220
would disappoint my sisters,
and I would disappoint my

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.770
grandmother.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.660
And then I may also have
gotten kicked off the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.450
basketball team.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.550
So I had to keep things
in the check.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.190
I had to be in control,
to a certain extent.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.755
Another thing that was important
in my story was that

00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:16.040
there were programs when
I was growing up.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.350
There was a program called
Aid to Families

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.760
with Dependent Children--

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.240
AFDC.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.990
Some of you all might know that
as what we once knew it

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.890
as welfare.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.420
That changed in 1996,
the Clinton

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.432
administration changed that.

00:05:30.432 --> 00:05:35.440
There was also another program
in which people like me--

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.020
young people like me-- who
were from these poor

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.500
backgrounds, there were summer
programs or summer

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.170
jobs where we worked.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.580
Folks who were 14 years old
and older could get jobs.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.300
The government supported these
programs that kept us off the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.700
street, it put pocket change
in our pockets.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.380
Those programs are no longer
there, but those programs were

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.310
critical in helping with
me move along.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.300
Well, I didn't get the
basketball scholarship that I

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.370
thought I was going to get.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.230
So instead, I had a guidance
counselor who also

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.000
looked after me.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.870
She encouraged me to talk
to military recruiters.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.650
She actually knew how to
motivate me, so she simply

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.570
said, if you talk to these
recruiters on this particular

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.870
day, on these particular days,
I'll let you out of class.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.000
And that worked.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.170
She knew what she was doing.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.240
I talked to various recruiters
and decided to go

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.730
into the Air Force.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.120
The Air Force--

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.290
my time in the Air Force
was all spent overseas.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.510
Most of my time was
spent in England--

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.940
about three years in England.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.950
While in England, something
happened, something that's

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.010
critical to my developing
critical thinking skills.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.850
When I was in England, I started
to go to college where

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.160
I really intensified my college,
because in the Air

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.410
Force, there are college
campuses or college courses

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.010
that are offered on base.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:17.190
While in England, I noticed
that the British were--

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.140
they didn't have the same
reservations about critiquing

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.030
American society, particularly
as it relates to race.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.400
They were quite comfortable
showing documentary films

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.480
about our racial history.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.270
I mean, these are things that
I already knew from being in

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.150
the United States.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.850
At least I thought I knew.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:46.100
But I never had official
approval, or I never had my

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:52.000
beliefs corroborated by an
official government.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.010
And so, in England, I got
really interested in the

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.510
American Civil rights story.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.640
And in school I learned quite
a bit about it, and it just

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.040
inspired me to continue my
education even further.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.420
So I began my education, really,
in England, and I

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.990
continued it once I got
out of the Air Force.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.910
And I had mentors after I got
out of the Air Force, and

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.500
throughout the Air Force, who
encouraged me to go on to get

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.710
a Ph.D. And these mentors--

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.350
without these mentors, I don't
think I would have been able

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.559
to continue on to get a Ph.D.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.450
So that's the sort of
personal story.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:42.030
I tell that story in part
because I want people to know

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.250
that I'm not special.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.500
Those components that were in my
environment that helped me

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.540
move along, we certainly can do
this for other people if we

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.500
wanted to, as a society.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.150
But society has decided that
certain groups of people or

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.270
not so important, so we won't
ensure that they have those

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.770
type of components.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.230
So I'm not special.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.900
This is not an up from
slavery story.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.480
That's not the story here.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.310
It's a logical, rational story
that could happen to most

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.520
people if we put these things
in their environment.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.070
OK, shifting gears
to the science.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:30.560
I went to graduate school to
study what I thought was the

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.220
problem in my community.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.990
I had been told that drugs was

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.830
destroying the black community.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.450
This is what I learned, and so
I thought, what better way to

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.920
make a contribution, just like
my heroes who had made

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.080
contributions previously--

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.100
Fanny Lou Hamer, Malcolm X,
Martin Luther King, all of

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.200
those folks had made previous

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.230
contributions to the community.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.040
I wanted to do the same
thing in my own way.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.060
So I thought I'll study the
brain, and the effects of

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.660
drugs on the brain.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.940
I thought that drugs were
destroying the community, I'll

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.460
find out from a biological
perspective what's going on,

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.130
and once I figure that out, I
could help save the community.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.780
So I went to graduate school,
started studying drugs--

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.470
or the effects of drugs
on the brains of rats.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.900
Drugs like morphine,
nicotine, cocaine.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.850
Trying to understand
what was happening.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:34.360
Now, during in my education,
one of the things that I

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:41.550
learned was that, well, the most
of the people who take

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.490
crack cocaine--

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.510
the drugs that I thought was
really destroying the

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.070
community--

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.920
I learned that most of the
people that take that drug

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.400
we're not addicted.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.970
In fact, most of the people that
take that drug go to work

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.760
and are responsible people.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.510
They are paying taxes, they're
doing all the things that we

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.270
want them to do.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.150
Some of them even worked
at Google.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:11.110
So when I learned that,
I wanted to know more.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.350
Was that the case
for all drugs?

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.740
Turns out, yeah, that was
the case for all drugs.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.980
About 80, 90% the people who
use these drugs-- crack

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.150
cocaine, methamphetamine,
heroin--

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.760
you name the drug, 80, 90% of
them do so without a problem.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.120
They are responsible citizens.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.610
Hmm.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.450
So that shattered one of the
sort of assumptions that I had

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.310
about drugs and the
evils of drugs.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.610
Another assumption that was
shattered when I went to

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.710
graduate school and I learned
more about drugs was that, as

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.350
an undergraduate, we were all
told that you take a drug like

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.440
cocaine, allow an animal
to self administer it.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.140
Put a catheter in their vein,
allow them to press a lever to

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.120
receive a cocaine injection.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.280
The animal would do this until
the animal dies if you allow

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.050
them unlimited access
to the drug.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.340
I learned that as an
undergraduate.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.500
Maybe some of you all learned
this as an undergraduate?

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.520
Yeah.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.150
Right?

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.160
And so, yep, sure enough, that
was the story, and that was

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.800
one that helped me to understand
what was going on

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.560
in my community--

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.840
so I thought.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.780
As I looked at the data more
carefully, as I became a

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:30.410
better, more critical thinker,
what I noticed was that if you

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.530
provided alternatives for
the animal-- alternative

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.410
reinforcers--

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:40.210
an alternative would be, for an
example, if you provided a

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.750
sexually receptive mate in
the cage with the animal.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.070
No longer isolate animal, but
provide the animal with an

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.810
alternative, a sexually
receptive mate.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:57.370
Or even some treat, like some
sugar water, or some activity,

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.810
like a running wheel.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.750
If you provide these
alternatives, the animal no

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.390
longer kills themselves
with the drug.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.050
They no longer exclusively
take the drug.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.780
These alternatives become more
attractive, in many cases.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.840
So I thought, hmm, that is what
happens in animals, but

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.720
is that what happens
in humans?

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.110
One of the earlier studies that
I did was I brought some

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.300
crack cocaine addicts
into our lab.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.020
Of course, we passed all of
the ethical requirements,

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.240
brought some research
participants who were crack

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.380
cocaine addicts into the
lab, allowed them to

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.230
self-administer--

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.670
choose to take the drug,
if they want.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.010
But, in this case, we also
provided alternatives.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.040
The alternatives were something
like money--

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.100
cash money--

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.120
or merchandise vouchers, other
things, and you could vary the

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.640
amount of money and
also the impact of

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.680
the merchandise voucher.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.100
When you do that with escalating
doses or escalating

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.180
amounts of money, you
can wipe out cocaine

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.060
self-administration.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.940
The addicts no longer choose
to take cocaine.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.210
Instead, they take the money.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.720
Say, how much money?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.240
Well, if you provide the
addict with $1 as an

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.360
alternative, they will
probably take a

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.620
nice dose of cocaine.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.250
Well, any rational person
probably should do that--

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.820
if they have experience with
cocaine, of course.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.380
For people at home, this is
not to encourage people to

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.010
take cocaine.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.770
That's not the goal.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:52.090
But if you provide the person
with $5 as the alternative,

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.590
now they would choose the drug
on about half of the

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.720
occasions, and the money on
about half of the occasion.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.160
And you can completely wipe out
self-administration of the

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.570
drug if you provide $20
as the alternative.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.960
All of this is rational, and
that's precisely how people

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.450
who use drugs-- people are
addicted to drugs--

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.550
behave.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.770
Rational behavior.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:22.470
So now that myth was
shattered for me.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.030
I no longer thought that cocaine
addicts or any other

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.600
addicts are motivated solely
by another hit of the drug.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.480
The science, the evidence,
just simply

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.600
doesn't support that.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.860
So another sort of more recent
myth that I discover had no

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:47.510
foundations and evidence is this
notion that these drugs

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.950
cause these cognitive
impairments in

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.990
people, in the users.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.860
So one of the drugs that I now
study is methamphetamine.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.800
And if you look at
the literature on

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.080
methamphetamine--

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.630
whether it's the scientific
literature or the popular

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.590
literature--

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.910
there's this notion that this
drug causes all types of

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.940
cognitive impairments.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.910
Well, last year I published
a critical review of the

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:21.390
scientific literature, and I
concluded that we, in science,

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.250
have overstated the extent
of cognitive

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.230
impairments in this group.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:30.050
There are virtually none
found with this group.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.040
When you look at the literature
carefully, and you

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.820
have the appropriate controls,
and the studies are rigorous,

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.310
you don't find these cognitive
impairments.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.590
Another myth shattered.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.160
And you can do this with
the brain imaging data.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.345
When you look at
methamphetamine, the same is

00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:50.670
true with the brain
imaging data.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:55.850
These negative effects have
been wildly overstated.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:59.580
And you know it makes sense
because when we think about

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.670
methamphetamine as a drug--

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.069
you all know Adderall, right?

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.150
Everybody knows Adderall.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.829
Adderall's the drug that we
prescribe for Attention

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:09.819
Deficit Disorder.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:14.160
Children take it, adults take
it, writers take it, people

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.869
who need to write programs
take it.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.520
A wide range of folks
take this drug.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.200
So when you look at Adderall,
the active ingredient is

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.510
amphetamine.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.300
And then you compare it to
methamphetamine, they are

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.100
essentially the same drug.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.690
Methamphetamine has an
additional methyl group that

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.750
probably doesn't contribute to
its biological activity or

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.640
pharmacology.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.750
I have done the studies in which
I've compared the two

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:49.130
drugs in the same people, and
I measured behaviors--

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:54.350
from cognitive behavior,
subjective effects behavior, a

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.140
wide range of behaviors, heart
rate, blood pressure--

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.500
and found that the drugs exert
identical effects.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.050
But I'm not the only one
who's done this.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.030
Other researchers have
also done this.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:09.070
We've known this since 1971,
when the first paper in this

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.420
area was published in People.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.770
Yet the public seems
to think that

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.020
methamphetamine is some new drug.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.820
It's not new.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.700
It's the same drug
as amphetamine.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.980
And we currently prescribe
amphetamines to our military.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.950
Some folks who are working
extended periods of time.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.370
So we have a long history with
amphetamines, and we know

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.250
quite a bit about
amphetamines.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.640
And they can be useful in some
situations, of course.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.430
So that myth that
methamphetamine is so

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.430
dangerous shattered.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:50.510
So in the book, I go down
a number of myths and I

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.660
shattered them.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.440
And if these are not true-- some
of these assumptions that

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.450
we have about drugs are not
true- in led me then to say,

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:09.270
well, what is our drug policy
based on if this information

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.670
isn't true?

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:16.810
Well, our drug policy is
primarily driven by hysteria

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.770
and misinformation.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:22.720
And the people who make our
drug policies are more

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.400
concerned with sort of
faith-based thinking as

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.080
opposed to evidence-based
thinking.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.210
And so, given that that's the
case, I thought that in "High

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:36.840
Price", I like to talk to
the adults in the room.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.040
I'm trying to have an adult
conversation about drugs.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.220
And if you do that,
you have to say--

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.680
people will say, well, what do
you think we should do, then?

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.360
Given what you laid out.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.730
What do I think the
country should do?

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.200
Well, I'm glad you asked.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.190
This is what I think the
country should do.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:03.690
Each year, we arrest 1.5 million
people for drugs.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.940
Each year.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.270
80% or more of those people
are for simple possession.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.800
Just simply buying,
using drugs.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.040
Simple possession, not sales.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.180
That's 80%.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:24.160
Also, when we look at the racial
disparities in our

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:31.330
enforcement of drug laws, we
find, for example, you guys

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.000
have heard the crack
cocaine powder

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.690
cocaine disparity, right?

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.240
Well, maybe you haven't,
this is Google.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:43.550
All right, OK, let me
just explain it.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:50.420
In 1986, we passed legislation
that punished crack cocaine

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:55.790
100 times more harshly
than powder cocaine.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:21:00.660
Now, the only difference between
these drugs is that

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.320
powder cocaine has
a hydrochloride

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.000
salt attached to it.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.550
That hydrochloride salt prevents
it from being smoked.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.440
That's the only difference.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:17.070
Now, the effects of cocaine
is determined by the base.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.340
Hydrochloride--

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.790
powder cocaine has the
base, whereas crack

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.550
cocaine is just a base.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.000
It's just cocaine base.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.270
So they're the same drug, but
we punish them differently.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:34.670
Now, what does that mean in
terms of drug enforcement,

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:35.920
racial disparities?

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.140
Crack cocaine, of course,
has a harsher penalty.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:48.010
85% of the people who we arrest
and prosecute for crack

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:54.000
cocaine offenses are black, even
though most of the people

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.570
use crack cocaine are white.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.890
So you have these type of
disparities through the

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:07.810
enforcement of all of our drug
laws, which has resulted into

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.870
this situation.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.480
Right now, in the United States,
black men make up

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.620
about 6% of the population.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:22.580
They make up 35, 40% of
the prison population.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.570
We have more people in our
prisons today than any other

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.470
country that has inhabited
the earth.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:37.090
We have 5% of the world's
population, 25% of the world's

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.730
prison population.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:44.050
All of this is mainly driven
by our current drug laws.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.420
So that leads me to say--

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.500
and given what I know
about drugs--

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.920
that we've been lied to about
the potential harms.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.130
Not that they're not potentially
harmful, because

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.160
we'll come back to that.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.050
I just want people to understand
that I know that

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.510
better than anyone.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:10.260
But since we've been lied to
about drugs and our policies

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.670
are based on some false
assumptions, I'm arguing in

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:19.100
"High Price" that we should
decriminalize all drugs, from

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.430
methamphetamine to heroin,
to cocaine.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.240
Decriminalize everything.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.590
Now, some people say,
well, why should we

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.530
legalize all drugs?

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.710
That's not legalization.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.300
Legalization is what we're
doing with alcohol.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.590
Alcohol, you can purchase it,
people can sell it without

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.290
fear of criminal prosecution
if they are

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.140
21 years and older.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.480
Decriminalization, sales of
these drugs remain illegal,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.370
and you can still be criminally
prosecuted.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.910
The thing that changes
is possession.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:57.210
Remember, we're arresting 1.5
million people, 80% or so are

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.170
for simple possession.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.200
Possession of these drugs under
decriminalization will

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.880
be treated like a traffic
violation.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.550
You will no longer be subjected

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.520
to a criminal offense.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.280
The drug's still not legal, but
we won't ruin your life.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.120
Because if you get a felony
for some drug charge, it

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.090
decreases the likelihood that
you will get a job, you can be

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.780
legally discriminated against
for some housing, some student

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.530
loans, a wide range of things.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.210
Consider this, for example.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.440
Our last three presidents--

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.710
the current president,
Barack Obama, George

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.080
Bush, and Bill Clinton.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.900
Barack Obama used cocaine
and marijuana.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.870
George Bush used marijuana,
widely suspected of having

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.170
used cocaine.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.060
Bill Clinton used marijuana--

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.310
although he said he
didn't inhale.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:07.400
Now, I could say some things
about that, if you were

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.700
getting high with him and he
was blowing your marijuana,

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.130
but I won't.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:17.860
The point is, is that those
three guys all engaged in this

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.400
illegal activity.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.820
They didn't get caught.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:25.930
But if they did, if the war on
drugs was as intense as it is

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.010
today, and one of those guys
would have gotten caught--

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.550
and the one most likely to have
been caught is Barack

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.730
Obama, because we've go after
the black people with a

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.920
special sort of intensity with
this sort of thing, right?

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.270
It one of those guys would have
got caught, they would

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.610
not have become president.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.170
They all have made contributions
to the country,

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.105
despite your politics,
that's a fact.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.440
But the point is, if they
would've gotten caught, those

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.310
contributions we would not
have benefited from.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:03.870
So I'm arguing in "High Price"
the same should be done with

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.530
everyone else.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.430
Now, I also argue that if
you're going to have

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.280
decriminalization--

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.490
I should just say briefly that
the idea of decriminalization

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.430
is not new.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.410
The country of Portugal has
decriminalized all drugs, and

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.270
they have done this since 2001,
and they are faring

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.880
better than us on all of
the major indicators.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.120
And they are doing as well or
better than their European

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.430
counterparts on all of
the major indicators.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.550
Levels of drug use, drug related
deaths, all of those

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.800
sorts of things.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.030
And also, in this country, we
have decriminalized marijuana

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:53.100
in a growing number of states.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.880
So decriminalization is
not something new.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.060
But if you have
decriminalization as I'm

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:05.350
arguing, you have to also
increase the amount of

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.530
realistic education
surrounding drugs.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:14.400
That means that you can no
longer run those public

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.020
service announcements about this
is your brain on drugs.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.060
Are you guys old enough
to remember that?

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.300
With the frying pan thing, and
the guy says, this is your

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.120
brain on drugs?

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.410
So you can no longer do those
type of advertisements and

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.950
that type of propaganda.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.440
You must now have realistic
education.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.970
And you say, what does realistic
education look like?

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.980
We can go down the line,
drug by drug, I

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.300
do this in the book.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.150
Take methamphetamine.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.370
One of the major effects of
methamphetamine is that it

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.500
keeps people awake.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.390
We know that sleep
disruption--

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.190
chronic sleep disruption--

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:58.400
is inconsistent with
good health.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:05.120
So if you have chronic sleep
loss, it's associated with

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.320
health consequences like
some types of cancers.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.210
It's associated with psychiatric
illnesses, like

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.150
psychotic disorders.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.530
So you want to make sure people
are getting sleep.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.880
If you're taking amphetamine
that keeps you awake, you want

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.140
to encourage folks who are
taking the drug not to take it

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.570
near bed time.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.500
Methamphetamine is also good
at increasing cardio-based

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.660
vascular activity-- heart
rate, blood pressure.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.990
Number one killer in the United
States-- heart disease.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.290
You want to tell people if you
have compromised cardiac

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.080
functioning, you probably
don't want to take

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.540
amphetamines or other
stimulants, right?

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.160
Heroin.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.210
What would realistic education
look like with heroin?

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.380
Recently there's been a number
of reports in the major press

00:28:54.380 --> 00:29:00.070
outlets about opioid and
heroin overdose deaths.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:07.480
Now, what these reports failed
to do is to say that 75% or

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.550
more of these deaths are
not caused by heroin

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.590
or the opiate alone.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.790
They're caused by combining
heroin or another opiate with

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:21.200
something like alcohol.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.500
So the major concern with a
drug like heroin is that

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.380
people combine it
with alcohol.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.000
It increases the likelihood
of overdose.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.680
If you simply don't combine
this drug with alcohol or

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.740
another sedative, you
considerably decrease the risk

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.990
for overdose.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.530
So what would realistic
education

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:49.280
look like for cocaine?

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.810
Today a large percentage of
cocaine is being cut with--

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:59.020
or adulterated with-- a
drug called levamisol.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:04.080
It is an animal dewormer, one of
its side effects is that it

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.190
decreases white blood cell,
decreases the person's ability

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.780
to respond to infections,
and in extreme

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.600
cases, people can die.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.480
So you want to make sure
that people were

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.560
not taking bad cocaine.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.570
You want to test the cocaine
on the street.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:24.300
You want to let people know what
the real problem may be.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.795
The real problem may be this
adulterant, this cut product.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.610
So we can go on and on
about what realistic

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.500
education would look like.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:41.680
Now, at this point, I see
a hand up, at least one.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.230
I think it'll be better if
we-- what do you think?

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.880
You think we should open
it up for questions?

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.460
We'll do that.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.730
All right, we'll do that.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.560
OK, we'll open it up
for questions.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.010
You have to come to
the microphone.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.500
So now we have to
wait for you.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.660
You just interrupted me, and now
we have to wait for you.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.610
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering,
for example, when you say if

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.610
you want to test for cocaine,
I think probably

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.120
decriminalization would
not just do it.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.230
You probably would have
to legalize it.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.660
So I'm wondering why are
you stopping at that?

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.510
Is it just a mini step to get
people to finally legalize it?

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.150
CARL HART: Thank you.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:24.070
The question was why
am I not advocating

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.400
for legalizing drugs?

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.770
Great question, thank you.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.250
One of the things that I am
concerned that might happen.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.850
So, as you legalize drugs and
then you have opponents to

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:42.310
legalizing drugs, they will be
waiting for any event to say

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:47.150
that this is the negative
effects of legalizing drugs.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:51.630
Now, what I'm arguing is that
we inoculate the population

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:56.220
from such hysteria and
misinformation by providing

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.940
more appropriate education about
what drugs actually do,

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.510
and what drugs don't do.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.550
So if you have a more drug
literate society, you can no

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:10.010
longer make these exaggerated
claims about a drug.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.880
Think about marijuana.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:18.320
In the 1930s, we said that
marijuana caused people to go

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.270
out and murder their mothers.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.430
We did, and people
believed it.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.150
Harry Anslinger, he was the
commissioner of the Federal

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.810
Bureau of Narcotics.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:33.580
He said that it was
the most dangerous

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.330
drug known to mankind.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.030
And we, as a society,
believed it.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.870
Now, if you say that today,
people will look at you like

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.390
you're crazy, right?

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.280
And rightfully so.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.970
And one of the reasons that
they would because we have

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.910
increased amount of information
about marijuana

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:56.450
today, in part because it is
now marijuana is the most

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.640
widely used illicit
drug in the world.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.220
And so, it's harder to fool
people with this information

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.750
because of their own education,
because of better

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.570
education about marijuana.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.730
But certainly, if we take
a drug like bath salts.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:17.150
If you make these exaggerated
claims about bath salts, far

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.130
more people in this society are
more likely to believe it,

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.880
even though it's
an exaggeration

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.500
and it's not true.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.660
You see this today
with bath salts.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.270
People are saying these
kinds of things.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.060
Other questions?

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:36.851
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:37.730
Good talk.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.360
Do you think that the
politicians that were

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.840
initially promoting
the war on drugs--

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.390
were they influenced by the bad
science, or did they have

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:51.990
other reasons for pushing
this on the population?

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.940
CARL HART: So, do I think that
the politicians were motivated

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.360
by bad science?

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:01.070
One thing I want to make clear
is that science is simply a

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.700
methodology, and most
of it is not bad.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.110
It's the interpretation from
science-- if you look at the

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.850
data, the data don't lie.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.699
The politicians, I believe,
we're more

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:16.090
motivated by this fact--

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:19.370
as a politician you
have constituents.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:24.570
They have problems, and they
expect you to help solve them.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:27.420
Drugs are excellent
scapegoats.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.270
So, if you have communities that
have high murder rates.

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.760
I don't know, for whatever
reason-- you have increased

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.070
amount of males at a certain
age, at a certain time, that

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:42.790
certainly is a reason for
higher murder rates.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:48.286
You have unemployment,
people not working,

00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:49.719
a lot of idle time.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:53.960
All of these sort of things
contribute to the murder rate.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.700
But if you can say it's because
of crack cocaine, all

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.570
you have to do now as a
politician is to go after

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.240
crack cocaine.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.920
Remove the crack cocaine, or
show the people that you're

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.530
putting lots of money into law
enforcement efforts in

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.220
removing cocaine.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.540
And they think, oh, yeah,
Representative

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.200
Johnson, he's our man.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.230
He's doing what we
want him to do.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.600
Even though crack cocaine has
little to do with the murder

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.700
rate, little to do with the
fact that people are

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.800
unemployed.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.650
But it's an easy sort
of scapegoat.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.530
Yes.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.450
So admittedly, I don't have
very much first hand

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:40.590
experience with people using
hard drugs, but--

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.670
CARL HART: You say that like
you're embarrassed of it.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.550
AUDIENCE: No, I say that as,
I guess, a qualifier to my

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.350
question, which is, a lot of
the things you said were, I

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.420
found, pretty surprising.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:36:00.390
Like, if you offer a crack
cocaine addict $5, it's a coin

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.860
flip as to whether he'll take
the money or the drugs.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:10.580
How does that square with the
sort of popular media image of

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.130
junkies stealing from their
mothers or their grandmothers

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.600
to fund their drug habit?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.700
CARL HART: Thank you
for that question.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.330
Certainly, you have people who
use drugs and they engage in

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.820
those bad behaviors that
you just said.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.590
There are certain people who
will rob somebody to support

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.810
their drug habit.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.870
We certainly can show that.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.210
Now, what people don't
do, or what they

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.010
fail to do is go deeper.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.920
So it's like, well, was this
person robbing people before

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.790
they used cocaine or whatever
drugs they're using?

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.860
Probably so, yeah.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.880
And then, when you look at the
majority of people use

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.360
cocaine, are they engaged
in that behavior?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.720
Not no, but hell no.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:02.210
So when you have a more
comprehensive look at the

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.530
data, those stories
don't hold up.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:09.370
But those stories make
great films.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.730
They are great for documentary
filmmakers, who we think of as

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.360
being more thoughtful.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:21.540
They are great for reporters,
they're just great stories.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.040
Even though they're more
fictitious or they're less

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.640
representative of the
broader picture.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.670
So it's a hard sort of
image to get out of

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.410
the American conscious.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:36.850
But they simply are
aberrations.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.470
CARL HART: Hi.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:44.130
AUDIENCE: Some of the other
advocates of more sensible

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.000
drug policy--

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.330
like your colleague Professor
David Nutt in the UK--

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:54.460
they very often compare the
harms of illegal drugs with

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.180
legal drugs like alcohol, and
tobacco, and caffeine, and

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.250
even horse riding.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.370
And that is very controversial
in the UK.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:09.270
But I think it highlights the
fact that these things are

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.150
comparable, but only in a very
niche scientific community,

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.190
and the public doesn't really
like to compare their horse

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.120
riding with their ecstasy.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.000
Well, because they call
the drug equasy.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.340
CARL HART: I hear you.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.980
AUDIENCE: So yeah, he wrote a
paper about comparing equasy

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:25.860
with ecstasy.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.580
So, what do you think
about it?

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.130
Do you think that comparison can
lead to more sensible drug

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.560
policies, or does it hinder?

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.780
CARL HART: Well, I'll stick with
the comparison between

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.950
the prescription drugs
or the legal drugs

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.630
and the illegal drugs.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.530
Because, like my man here, I
don't have much experience

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.780
with horse riding.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:53.840
So one of the things that
concerns me sometimes when we

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.830
make these comparisons with
alcohol or legal, prescription

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:02.850
drugs in our zeal to show people
how comparable, say

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:07.730
methamphetamine is to Adderall,
we vilify Adderall.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.700
And that's not my goal, because
Adderall actually

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.460
helps a large number
of people.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.370
And my goal is not to vilify
alcohol either, because the

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.800
vast majority of people who
drink it do so safely, it

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.590
contributes to the tax base.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.470
It also--

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.330
well, it makes them more
interesting at parties

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.500
sometimes, right?

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.550
So I don't want to vilify those
drugs, but it's clear

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:39.860
that the body does not make the
same distinctions that we

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.590
make in society.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.050
So the body doesn't make
a distinction between

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.580
methamphetamine and Adderall.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.050
It doesn't make that
distinction.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.780
That's our own distinction.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:58.210
And that leads to us making drug
policies based on social

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.480
factors, cultural factors,
rather than

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.090
pharmacological factors.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.430
When you go through the history
of our drug policies,

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.410
drug policy is based largely
on cultural and social

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:12.050
factors, and less
on pharmacology.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:17.200
Because if that was the case,
our legal and illegal drugs

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.450
would look differently.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.320
AUDIENCE: So I really enjoyed
your talk, thanks for coming.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.210
CARL HART: Thank you.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.600
AUDIENCE: I want to go
back to the issue of

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.210
the legality of sales.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:37.100
Because most of what we, as
a society, perceive as the

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.300
negative effects of illegal
drugs are due to their

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:41.970
prohibition.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:46.990
You have gang issues with
sales, you have all that

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.010
illegal money flowing around,
being used to buy guns and

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.730
things like that.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:57.140
And it seems to me like, while
obviously, the arresting and

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.640
throwing in jail of a huge
percentage of the population

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.800
for simple possession is a worse
evil than all this gang

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.150
violence, it seems like it's a
very close second, and that

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:11.330
getting rid of a lot of the
perceived negative effects of

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.740
drugs in communities--

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.030
like New York, which has a
history of having an issue

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.780
with crack--

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:21.340
could be a huge step in
trying to change the

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.580
perception about drugs.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.390
Because when there's less
violence or less theft around

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:32.400
drugs, you would seem to have an
increased understanding of

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.190
how it's not necessarily
as big a problem.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.050
CARL HART: Is there a question?

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:38.430
I'm sorry.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:44.620
AUDIENCE: I guess is there a
way that you think that we

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.850
could focus on the legalization
of sales, or

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:55.230
providing some legal outlet to
get clean drugs and legal

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.140
drugs without and getting
some of the money out

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.180
of these back channels?

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.200
CARL HART: I see.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.030
I haven't really thought about
legalization that far yet,

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.350
because of our ignorance
with drugs.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:13.930
My goal as a
neuropsychopharmacologist is

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:19.180
to help people understand drug
affects, more so than the

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.890
legality in the markets and
that sort of thing.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.180
I'm less versed on that.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.760
And I recently wrote a piece in
the New York Times, saying

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.290
that public intellectuals
should

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.210
stick to their expertise.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.690
I'm going to take my own
advice with that one.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.830
Yes.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:41.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:42.960
Thanks so much for coming.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.380
CARL HART: Thank you.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.160
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
Portugal, and I've read a

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.970
little bit about it, and it
seems they decriminalize and

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:52.960
then also shifted some public
resources toward treatment and

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.030
things that we would call soft
punishment, so when somebody

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.860
who commits a criminal act gets
arrested for that act and

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.410
they also happen to be on drugs
while they committed the

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.590
act, they'll have rehabilitation
programs that

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:08.630
they're sentenced to and
treatment programs.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.960
And I'm just wondering, is
there much science--

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.070
because, certainly, drug
addiction is bad, and it can

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:19.420
get people to do-- is there much
science on what treatment

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:25.610
methods actually work to get
someone off a drug that is

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.130
causing them to do--

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:27.540
CARL HART: Yeah.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:31.480
So in the book, I talk about
some of the treatment programs

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.600
that we have.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.340
There's a lot of good treatment
research going on in

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.300
the country.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.000
One of things I describe is this
program or this strategy

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.300
called contingency management,
where you, essentially, pay

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.520
people to stay off drugs, and
you give them skills, so you

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.760
increase the likelihood of them
getting jobs, and those

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.780
sorts of things.

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.200
So, yeah, I think
we're doing--

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.710
although there is this belief in
the country that treatment

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.320
doesn't work, that's
just not true.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:12.300
There are a number of good
programs that are

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.670
available to people.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.650
But the problem is, is that
there are also a lot of bad

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:20.770
programs, and a number of people
go to those programs.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.350
I don't talk so much about
treatment in the book.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.990
I do talk a little
bit about it.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.100
In this book, I'm not
as concerned--

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:34.700
or the focus is not on the
10 to 20% of those users.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.312
The focus is on the 80, 90%.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:48.910
It's been alluded to here, why
do we continue to do this

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:52.570
awful strategy that I laid out,
when many of us think it

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:53.390
doesn't work?

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:57.650
Well, we continue to do it, in
part, because of the frame

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.620
that we're talking about.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.220
The frame is either
jail or treatment.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.030
But the majority of the people
don't need either.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.130
But that's our current frame.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:14.890
And you have treatment providers
who have a huge

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.420
stake in his drug hysteria game,
because they want to

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.570
keep the laws and the way we
view drugs the same way.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.390
Because if the people are
not going to jail,

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.690
they're coming to them.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.940
And, of course, law enforcement
has a huge stake

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.970
in continuing the same strategy
that we're doing,

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:38.200
because we spend $26 billion
a year on our

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.800
controlling of drugs.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.750
70% of that or so is going
to law enforcement.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.440
That's a lot of money,
and there's a

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.890
lot of jobs at stake.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:51.170
And so, that frame is a narrow
one, and it's one that I'm

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.290
trying to break out of
in "High Price".

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:56.040
Fascinating.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.325
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:00.325 --> 00:46:01.610
Thank you for coming.

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:02.770
CARL HART: Thank you.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.860
AUDIENCE: So I was curious
about your thoughts with

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.490
regards to teenagers
and preteens.

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.900
So decriminalization is based
on somewhat of an assumption

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.110
that an individual can
make a choice.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.350
And when I was 16, I thought I
was able to make a choice, but

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.220
in hindsight, I was
pretty stupid.

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:21.830
CARL HART: But yet you work
at Google, and you are

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.710
doing well in life.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:25.960
AUDIENCE: I manage.

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:30.830
So what are your thoughts, with
regards to approaches,

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:34.170
what's the right framework for
a population that, perhaps,

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:36.220
does need some protection?

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:36.960
CARL HART: You have children?

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.030
AUDIENCE: Nope.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.790
CARL HART: OK.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.450
Well, I do.

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:45.580
I have a 12-year-old,
18-year-old, 30-year-old.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.610
So I get asked that question
a lot about children.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:54.430
You would deal with them in
terms of this subject in the

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:59.310
same way you deal with them in
another potentially dangerous

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:00.360
activities.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.160
Driving a car, you make sure
they have skills to do that.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.770
You make sure that they
understand under what

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:10.340
conditions that should happen,
and how it should happen.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.840
Sexual behaviors.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.390
I'm sure you had sex at--

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:15.400
I don't know when.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.650
That's a joke.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:23.670
But the point is is that that's
certainly a potentially

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:27.780
dangerous activity, and we
manage to make sure that our

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.320
kids stay safe.

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.510
The same is true with drugs.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.330
Give them the appropriate
amount of education.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:39.370
They understand that if you use
some drugs before school,

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.980
that's inconsistent with
the goals of this

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.040
household, the family.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.190
And so, you just treat it just
like any other activity that

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.800
might impact negatively
on their ability

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.180
to do well in life.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.620
Thank you.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.640
AUDIENCE: So, I have a non-drug
question here.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.660
You mentioned in the first
section of your talk, while

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:07.150
you were in England, that you
were able to sort of ground

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.960
your knowledge of American
history there.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.050
For people who do not have the
opportunity to leave the

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:19.030
country, especially when
they're younger, is it

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.410
possible to get that kind of
grounding in history now, is

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.880
it easier or harder now, and
what sort of outlets are you

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.470
aware of, if any, for
people to pursue?

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:29.710
CARL HART: That was
a great question.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.180
Thank you.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.810
One of the things I try to do in
"High Price", I try and aim

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:38.330
it towards those folks, like me,
who grew up ignorant about

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.040
our history here.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:45.670
So I hope that those people,
they'll have more potential

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:49.020
education or information in
books, like "High Price",

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.270
that's one.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.110
And then people like me speaking
out, even though it's

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:02.460
popular to do this, pointing
out what the issues are.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.470
But you asked the question, is
it more difficult today or

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.130
easier today than when
I was coming up.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.160
Think it's more difficult for
young, ignorant people in the

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.750
situation where I was in when
I was younger, in part,

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:18.320
because they're told that we
have a black president, and

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.110
things are improved.

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:27.380
But yet, rarely do we hear
anything coming from the

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.140
official administration about
problems related to race in

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.130
the country.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.520
And so, there was a time--

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.950
when Ronald Reagan was
president, when I was coming

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.180
up, for example--

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:42.940
we were happy to criticize him,
particularly about all

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.490
the things that he was not
doing for the community.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:50.980
Folks who are community
protectors now are a lot more

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.850
reluctant to do those
sorts of things.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:57.150
So I think young, ignorant
people in those situations, I

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:59.190
think they have it more
difficult now.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:06.540
AUDIENCE: I have a
lot of questions.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:09.420
So, my first question starts
with, because you touched on

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.800
children, right?

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:16.710
And one of the things I want
to know is, is there any

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.380
science or evidence
behind what makes

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.490
someone become an addict?

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.510
Because I actually feel that
it permeates all walks of

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.580
life, all colors.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.890
It's more of a personality
thing.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.220
Are there any thoughts
on that?

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.790
And then the second question
I have is,

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.960
because I do have children.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.350
You mentioned having
a home, right?

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:42.830
And having rules which clearly
you grew up in, right?

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.710
But what about these communities
where there really

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:51.470
aren't those rules, because
there isn't a nuclear family

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:56.300
to keep younger kids today from
growing up and being just

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.120
like those that are
around them?

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.920
So how do you stop that?

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.820
Because I couldn't agree with
you more on the drug

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.190
conversation.

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:07.290
But how do you educate
them all together?

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:12.040
CARL HART: Now, I should tell
you, it's difficult for me--

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.700
my working memory
has been taxed.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.070
So I need you to repeat
that first question.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:19.510
AUDIENCE: So, the first
question is,

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.800
is there any evidence--

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.810
CARL HART: Oh, personality.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:23.720
AUDIENCE: Just about
the personality.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.040
Because it does seem
to me, and I--

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.430
CARL HART: Right on.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.980
I got you.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.980
AUDIENCE: I am totally a
proponent of drugs it is not a

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.140
color thing.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.592
CARL HART: It's OK, we don't
have to do our personal

00:51:32.592 --> 00:51:33.670
divulging here, it's
all right.

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.530
AUDIENCE: Oh no, no, I mean,
I'm just saying if someone

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:39.890
says it effects one race or
one gender or whatever

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.510
disproportionally to the other,
I completely disagree.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:43.870
I think it's a personality
thing.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:45.950
CARL HART: So a personality
thing.

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:48.370
There is no evidence to support
the idea that somebody

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:49.770
has an addictive personality.

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.230
Although it works well in
terms of pop culture.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:54.230
But there's no evidence
to support that's.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:55.370
That's one.

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:57.120
And you're right--

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.220
drug addiction certainly
does not discriminate.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.770
That's the fact.

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:07.270
But you're asking is there any
evidence for us to know what

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:12.150
causes someone to become
addicted to drugs?

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:14.850
A lot of science is looking
for the biological sort of

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.580
explanation, as well
as it should.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.490
But I think that it's more
simple than that.

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:26.720
If we look at the criteria
for addiction--

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:33.310
inability to cut down your use
of the drug, using the drug in

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:37.790
situations that are places you
in, potentially, harm's way,

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:41.320
using the drug despite the fact
that you have knowledge

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:46.100
that it causes you physical
or psychological problems.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:50.440
So, you go down the list of
these criteria, and these

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.460
criteria mainly are sort
of behaviorally

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.690
irresponsible people.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:53:01.020
And so, when you look at that
throughout, it tells you that

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.020
even before the drug use,
folks may have been

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:09.070
over-indulging or irresponsible
in some ways.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:12.100
Of course this isn't the case
for everyone, but I think

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.830
that's a large component.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:21.180
And so I think that if we simply
look at the behaviors,

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.580
help people to get better
skills, a wide range of

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:25.150
things-- how to be more
responsible, a

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:26.530
wide range of things.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.180
So I think that we
have overlooked

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.970
those sort of factors.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:34.680
Now, back to your second
question, about what about in

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.230
the communities where
people don't have

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.440
rules, as you put it.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.800
Believe me, there are rules
in every social circle.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.030
There are rules.

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:49.180
You may not understand those
rules, but there are rules.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.480
And I wouldn't worry
about that so much.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.030
I'd worry more about making sure
that those communities,

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:57.050
those people, have
a stake in the

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:58.890
society, the larger society.

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:01.490
And one way you do that is
make sure they have jobs.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:04.560
Make sure that they have
potential opportunities to

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.600
contribute to the
larger society.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.220
Make sure they're not
socially isolated.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.120
All of those are far more
important than us worrying

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.430
about whether they have rules.

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.370
And one of the things that
concerns me most of all is

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.960
when I give this presentation
to certain groups, they say

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.440
that they are concerned about
those communities, but that

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.490
concern is disingenuous.

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.900
Because their only concern when
someone like me comes

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.380
along and say, hey,
we need to do

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:35.590
something radically different.

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:37.460
But when you look at--

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.370
have you gone?

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:39.340
Have you said anything?

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:40.390
Have you contributed?

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:42.650
Have you tried to change
the situation in those

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:43.540
communities?

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.020
No.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:50.120
And so, I think that the things
that I outlined--

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.150
skills, jobs, all those--

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:53.400
are far more important.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.120
AUDIENCE: One other thought.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:57.460
CARL HART: Sure.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.030
AUDIENCE: So you had said
originally you benefited from

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.500
playing sports, I did, too.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.880
It kept me engaged in school,
I did well, it was one of

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.200
those things.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.160
For you, you probably just
kept going, right?

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.600
So in these communities where
there are no longer the

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.070
programs that you had available
to you in tandem

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:18.900
with your call for saying, OK,
let's at least decriminalize

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.330
drugs, are you also championing

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.540
resources so that--

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:27.200
because you do worry that it
only self-perpetuates.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.590
It becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy if no one actually

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:34.230
breaks that cycle of what they
believe is happening, even

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:38.060
within the isolation of
these communities.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.590
CARL HART: Certainly.

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:42.700
Your point is, is that
if we're calling for

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.260
decriminalization, that
alone is not going

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.160
to solve the problem.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.380
I agree wholeheartedly.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:54.660
The goal is to also make sure
that our politicians, our

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:58.630
population understand that we
have to provide skills, jobs,

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:02.800
education about drugs, as well
as other, broader education.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:08.170
So I agree wholeheartedly, and
I certainly try to say that.

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:08.730
Timeout?

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:09.230
Heather?

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:11.180
OK, Heather's said
it's time to go.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.440
All right.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.690
Thank you all very much.
