CHRIS DEFAY: I am Chris
DeFay, a member of the Authors

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.330
at Google Team here in Venice--
our Venice, Los Angeles office.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.010
And I'm pleased to welcome our
guest Olga Oliker who joins us

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.150
from the Rand Corporation.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.490
Ms. Oliker's based in
Rand's Washington office

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.010
where she is Associate Director
of International Security

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.570
and Defense Policy Center and
a senior international policy

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.450
analyst.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.160
Her research is focused on
international relations,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.050
national security policy,
and a context of countries

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.190
in conflict, post-conflict,
transition, development,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.640
and reform.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000
Her research
examines these issues

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.350
in Russia, Central Asia, the
Caucasus, Iraq, Afghanistan,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.360
and other countries.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.920
She joins us today for
a timely discussion

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.499
of recent developments
in Ukraine and Russia.

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.540
The title of her talk is
"Russia-- What Happened,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.670
What's Next."

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.789
Please join me in
welcoming Olga Oliker.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:04.289
Thank you.

00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:11.070
OLGA OLIKER: Thanks everybody--
thanks for coming out.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.060
It's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.360
So I've been asked
to talk to you today

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.630
about Russia, Ukraine--
what's going on,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.640
what it means for
the United States.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.740
And if you do tend to follow
US-Russia relations-- things

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.660
like that.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.430
What you've probably
noticed, even

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.130
without paying too
much attention,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.110
is that our relationship
has shifted from, kind of,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.240
this one of general tension--
a lot of cooperation--

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.020
didn't seem that bad-- to
what seems like a stand off.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.080
And all of this,
seemingly, because

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.180
of this little peninsula
in the Black Sea.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.360
So how did we get here?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.840
And where do we go now?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.380
What I'm going to
do today is I'm

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.791
going to break this down
into four components--

00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:55.790
talk about each of them.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.830
And then, actually, I hope
to have a good bit of time

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.377
to hear what you all think and
to talk about it a little bit.

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:04.710
So first I'm going to talk
about Ukraine-- Crimea-- what

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.080
that's all about.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.870
Then I'd like to
turn, a little bit,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.120
to what's happening in
Russia domestically,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.890
and what has happened
over the last few years.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.870
Third, move back
to Ukraine and what

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.210
this means in the context
of Russian relations

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.690
with the United States.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.420
And then, finally, you
know, my crystal ball

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.350
has been really in bad shape
throughout this entire crisis.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.980
I'm not going to
make any predictions,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.960
but I can talk a
little bit about what

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.020
it means going forward.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.930
So first of all, what
happened in Ukraine?

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.982
And there's a map over there.

00:02:40.982 --> 00:02:44.580
Here's Ukraine,
here's Crimea, here's

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.740
Russia-- I'm don't know if it's
a point-- a political point

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.340
that Russia doesn't get a label.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.330
I've noticed that you have to,
like, kind of, get most of it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.830
on before it starts
getting labeled.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.300
And it's so big--
it's hard to do.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.180
So the way I like
to talk about what's

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.160
happened in the last
few months in Ukraine

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.130
is there are several
different stories

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.950
you can tell about it-- several
kinds of truths-- several kinds

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.110
of narratives.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.400
So one story that
you may have heard

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.040
is that late last fall-- this
past fall the people of Ukraine

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.110
took to the streets to protest
a corrupt autocratic leader who

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.270
had turned his back on
an association agreement

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.680
with the European Union.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.560
And instead, decided
to ink a deal

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.240
with Russia to bail
out Ukraine's disaster

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.980
of an economy.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.810
These people who came out to
the streets demanded his ouster.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.950
He had his police force
fire on peaceful protesters.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.940
And then he fled the country.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.150
The parliament of
Ukraine was forced

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.760
to put in an interim government
to rule until elections could

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.130
be held, and they're
scheduled for May.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.660
But Russia, then
went and paid people

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.780
to cross into Ukraine to
protest the new government

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.020
and use that as a
pretext to grab control

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.560
the Crimean peninsula.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.380
And it's now fomenting
unrest elsewhere in Ukraine--

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.950
potentially, in order to invade.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.290
So that's one story.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.350
Here's another story.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.720
A mob came onto the
streets to demand

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.080
the ouster of a democratically
elected leader in Ukraine who

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.280
had made a choice to
work with Russia to save

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.520
a country in dire
economic straits

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.820
at a time when
association with the EU

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.840
would have led to further
austerity and hardship

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.200
for large chunks
of the population.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.269
That mob, egged on by the United
States and European Union,

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.110
which were helping finance
them, included a variety

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.610
of right-wing ultra
nationalist groups.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.540
And they threw Molotov
cocktails at police.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.260
They took police
officers hostage,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.380
and they engaged in a
variety of violent activity.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.830
The parliament then took
a series of illegal votes.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.320
One of them being to oust
the democratically elected

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.920
president and then
appointed a parliament that

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.250
has no legitimacy because
they just-- sorry--

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.020
appointed a government that has
no legitimacy because, well, it

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.394
was just appointed
by Parliament.

00:04:48.394 --> 00:04:49.790
Nobody elected them.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.759
And as a result of this, there
has been chaos in Ukraine--

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.800
throughout the countries.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.910
And right-winged militias
have roamed the streets

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.770
and been allowed to, kind
of, patrol and bring order.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.610
In Crimea, where
there's a majority

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.950
ethnic Russian population,
these people-- terrified of both

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.720
the fascists and the prospect
of future discrimination because

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.760
of cultural nationalists,
voted to secede from Ukraine

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.840
and then chose to join Russia.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.930
In other parts of the
country, ethnic Russians

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.000
and Russian speakers
are rising up

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.040
against this
illegitimate government

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.510
and seeking Russian
help and protection.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.040
So these aren't the only
two stories out there.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.340
You can tell other
stories, but they

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.080
are two of the most
important-- thank you.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.850
And they're part-- they are two
of most important because, as I

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.350
think, you might have noticed
the first one is, kind of, one

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.000
you hear from a lot
of Western outlets.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.833
And the second is one
that you hear from one

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.380
a lot of Russian outlets.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.880
And the Russian outlets
include Russian television,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.770
which broadcasts into
eastern and southern Ukraine

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.600
where a lot of folks who are
ethnically Russian or Ukrainian

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.340
speak Russian as
their first language.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.400
And indeed, there's
nobody in Ukraine

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.280
who doesn't speak some
Russian and some Ukrainian.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.030
It's not as though,
you know, there

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.105
are people who speak
just one or the other.

00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:01.940
And the problem is that neither
story is all true or all false.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.970
Yanukovych was
incredibly corrupt.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.290
But then so have been
every government in Ukraine

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.740
since independence.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.170
He was also
democratically elected.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.040
There are other-- there are, in
fact, ultra right wing groups,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.000
in the new government.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.377
But they're far from most of it.

00:06:16.377 --> 00:06:18.710
And the interim government
is trying to get control over

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.350
the militia's.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.757
And they've taken legal action.

00:06:20.757 --> 00:06:23.090
And, in fact, the police shot
one of the militia leaders

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.889
recently-- and under
questionable or-- according

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.930
to the police he shot
himself twice in the chest,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.900
so-- while resisting arrest.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.320
So, you know, there's that.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.650
Some of the protesters in
southern and eastern Ukraine,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.500
probably are paid, or at
least, reimbursed by Russia.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.650
And some of them may
be coming from Russia.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.190
But that's not all of them.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.800
And there are enough familial
ties between Russia and Ukraine

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.850
that there's an argument to
be made that these people do--

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.350
they-- some of them
do have a voice.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.415
Some of them probably
are coming to Moscow

00:06:53.415 --> 00:06:55.620
and have no relationship.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.652
And there is real
nervousness and discontent

00:06:57.652 --> 00:06:58.360
in these regions.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.026
I'm not saying it's
prevalent, but there

00:07:00.026 --> 00:07:01.930
are people who are nervous.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.770
The other problem
is that even if you

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.920
choose to believe one story
and dismiss the other one,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.860
the fact is that other people in
the US, in Russia, in Germany,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.860
and Poland, and
in Ukraine believe

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.350
the one you don't believe.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.190
And they act accordingly.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.665
So for instance, economic
analyses might indicate,

00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:25.390
and kind of does, that the
austerian measures called

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.700
for by the EU and
IMF won't actually

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.390
be that bad for Ukrainians.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.510
Particularly, if
they're instituted now.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.680
It's warm.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.060
You don't need that much gas.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.689
All these gas subsidies
aren't as big an issue.

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:39.480
But if Ukrainians in
the south and the east

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.840
don't believe that-- if they
think that this is really

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.410
going to hurt them, they're
still going to oppose it.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.020
They're still not going
to want it to take place.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.860
And it's a question of will they
believe the economist you trot

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.060
out as opposed to the economist
that somebody else trots out.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.600
So that's Ukraine, and
we'll come back to it.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.150
But I'd like to, also,
briefly talk about Russia--

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.210
where the annexation of
Crimea is stunningly popular.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.370
Especially if you consider
that a month and a half ago

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.320
nobody in Russia was thinking
about annexing Crimea at all.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.450
But since approval ratings
are through the roof--

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.170
and just as Russia
was consolidating

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.120
control of Crimea.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.080
If you were paying
attention you might also

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.970
notice that the Russian
government's shutting down

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.650
a few more bits of what was
left of the opposition media.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.030
Which has kind of
been a steady process,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.110
but right around the time of
the Crimea thing, the editor

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.191
of the news site [INAUDIBLE]
which-- you know,

00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:35.399
it was a very good news site.

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:39.177
I used it all the time-- was
fired because she had allowed

00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:41.010
for the publication of
an interview with one

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.390
of the Ukraine far
right leaders, actually.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.200
And then her-- the majority
of editorial staff resigned.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.920
And then [INAUDIBLE]
was effectively

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.800
gone-- though they've, kind of,
reconstitute themselves a bit.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.200
Now Russian new
media was already

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.900
pretty tightly controlled.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.930
And most people in
Russia don't mind, right?

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.390
They're fine getting their
news from the Kremlin approved

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.140
a television stations.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.700
So where the opposition
media mostly works

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.280
is-- they're preaching
to the choir.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.950
They're talking
to people who are

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.626
looking for that
sort of information.

00:09:12.626 --> 00:09:14.312
So shutting them
down is-- it's kind

00:09:14.312 --> 00:09:15.830
of a bit of insult to injury.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.520
It's basically saying, yeah, we
know no one's listening to you,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.861
but we don't want you
to have access anyway.

00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:24.360
And it's, kind of,
also worth noting

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.860
that as of today
Voice of America,

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.150
the US funded-- actually US
funded-- it's a US Government

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.322
agency-- broadcasts in
Russia have been told

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:35.030
their license wasn't
going to be renewed.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.400
And they're no longer going
to get their little AM

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.010
band to broadcast on.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.630
The political
opposition in Russia

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.835
hit its height a couple of
years ago-- winter 2011.

00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:48.300
Kind of on the eve of the
March 2012 election that

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.460
brought Vladimir
Putin back to power.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.379
Tens of thousands of,
mostly, middle class Russians

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:54.920
came out to the
streets, because they

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.160
weren't real happy
with the fact that

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.700
didn't have a real choice in
this presidential election.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.230
That they felt that
this wasn't real.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.020
That this wasn't right.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.255
Putin still won.

00:10:05.255 --> 00:10:06.755
And he probably
would have won-- you

00:10:06.755 --> 00:10:09.240
know there are talks about
how the election was doctored

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:09.740
da, da, da.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.210
He would have won.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.890
It wasn't that he
wasn't popular.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.960
But he was nervous
as a result of this.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.120
He looked out at all these
people who he thought about as,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.340
you know, all their wealth,
their comfort, their ability

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.060
to go to sushi bars
and coffee shops--

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.200
that was because of him.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.299
He was the one who had
presided over a decade

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:32.840
of strong economic
growth for Russia.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.900
He was the reason there
was a middle class.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.230
And what is with this, you
know, why aren't they grateful.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.630
Why are they, instead, coming
on to the streets demanding

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.338
his oust-- well not
have been his ouster,

00:10:42.338 --> 00:10:45.580
but demanding choice--
demanding that somebody else be

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.150
able to run.

00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:52.425
Mm, oh well, we've lost our map.

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:53.966
MALE VOICE: I'll
bring it up for you.

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:57.960
OLGA OLIKER: OK-- so,
because he was nervous,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.025
he instituted this campaign
against the opposition.

00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:02.400
And it's kind of
been a-- there's

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.590
been a slow, but steady,
process of arrest, harassment,

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.580
significant limits on what
the opposition can do.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.470
For instance, if you read in
the papers about a protest

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.290
with 50,000 people in Russia,
what you don't, necessarily,

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.750
read is that in order to
get their permit to protest

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.875
they have to say exactly
where they're going to be.

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:22.040
It's, kind of, closed off.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.320
The only people who
show up are the people

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.300
who've shown up to protest.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.780
So it's not as though
you're, kind of,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.405
in the middle of the
street and anybody

00:11:27.405 --> 00:11:29.630
can come by and watch
and listen and join.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.060
It's really-- these are the
people who know about it

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.140
and who can show up.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.805
And in the mean
time-- the other thing

00:11:36.805 --> 00:11:39.030
that Putin's nervousness
has led him to

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.367
is he's making his
decisions speaking

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:43.450
to fewer and fewer people.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.491
This is something that
everybody who watched this

00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:48.939
agrees that he's not
listening to a broad range.

00:11:48.939 --> 00:11:50.480
His Foreign Minister
probably doesn't

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.050
have a lot of influence over
what it is Putin decides to do.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.200
And you can see this, for
instance, in this crisis where

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.060
you had other Russian
officials saying,

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.536
Russia will, of course,
respect Ukraine sovereignty.

00:12:02.536 --> 00:12:04.160
We have no intention
of doing anything.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.790
Oh, hey look, we took
Crimea-- that's-- um-- yeah.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.722
You know, it's because
nobody told them.

00:12:11.722 --> 00:12:13.430
We have-- even have
every reason to think

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.138
that he's flying by
the seat of his pants

00:12:15.138 --> 00:12:16.560
on some things-- including this.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.520
But we also have no
way to influence it,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.422
and it's dangerous.

00:12:21.422 --> 00:12:23.380
Because what he's doing
is he's closing himself

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.720
off to a very real
debate that does go on

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.270
that you do-- you
can hear, and you

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.140
can access amongst
Russian thought leaders.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.644
But he is not listening to them.

00:12:34.644 --> 00:12:36.810
So the bottom line is you
have an incredibly popular

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.420
Russian president
making decisions

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.660
without broad consultation
and in opposition

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.160
that's fragmented and weak.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.743
At the same time,
you have a knowledge

00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:45.770
that there is a core
of dissatisfaction.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.520
You know, it's not surprising
that opinion ratings are really

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.640
high right now.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.796
If you look at the opinion
ratings for George Bush

00:12:51.796 --> 00:12:53.170
right after the
invasion of Iraq.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.650
They were very high, as well.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.960
It's, you know, people tend
to rally around the flag

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.702
when these things happen.

00:12:59.702 --> 00:13:01.910
So the knowledge that tens
of thousands of people did

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.760
come out onto the
streets in winter 2011--

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.720
and it's cold in
winter in Russia.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.430
And coming out into the streets
to protest in winter-- Ukraine,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.919
too-- I can-- that
is saying something.

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:14.585
That means that there
is something there

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.910
that could be harnessed
and could respond, even

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.040
with all the propaganda.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.060
So let's turn back to Ukraine
and the US-Russia relationship.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.140
The US-- its European
allies responded

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.870
to an annexation of Crimea
about as you'd expect.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.130
They said that it was illegal.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.900
They said it was improper.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.445
They had put
sanctions on Russia.

00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:38.290
And, you know, indeed
it's pretty illegal.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.780
And not only is it illegal--
and it's illegal in part

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.820
because you don't
violate sovereignty.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.080
And this has been Russia's
big soapbox for years--

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.130
that sovereignty is important.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.060
So it's a little odd.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.970
And then, Russia also signed
the Budapest Agreement back

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.060
in the early '90s, committing
to Ukraine sovereignty,

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.900
very specifically.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.030
So, you know, it's
pretty illegal.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.974
But the US and
Europe haven't said,

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:04.140
we're, therefore, going to
take up arms against you.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.760
They've said, we're
going to sanction.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.210
We're very unhappy.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.830
This makes us rethink
our relationship.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.020
And, of course, as Putin made
clear in a speech on March 18th

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.780
when he did talk about the
annexation of Crimea and did

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.220
try to justify it and say
that it was, in fact, legal.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.640
This isn't, really,
just about Ukraine.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.300
That's the red in the Russian
narrative about Western support

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.490
for the activists that
overthrew Yanukovych

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.020
is an important
thing to remember.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.940
Because from
Russia's prospective,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.370
what happened in Ukraine
over the last few months--

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.775
just like what happened
in Ukraine in 2004

00:14:38.775 --> 00:14:41.410
with the Orange Revolution
and what happened in Georgia

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.040
in 2003 with the Rose
revolution, and indeed,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.920
the opposition protests in
Russia a few years ago--

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.510
these are foreign funded
efforts to weaken Russia.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.980
To prevent it's exercising
it's natural influence

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.380
on countries on its periphery.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.460
And to, kind of, grow in
global influence, as well.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.620
And thinking about these
countries on it's periphery,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.870
you have to remember it's
not just that they were part

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.578
of the Soviet Union--
these countries are

00:15:06.578 --> 00:15:08.110
part of Russian empire.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.370
Russia hasn't bought into
the notion that these

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.370
are countries, and in the
case of Russia itself,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.110
people making
independent choices.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.020
The way Russia sees this is it's
in competition with the United

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.200
States for influence and
control in these areas.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.410
And this isn't a
Putin thing, right?

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.910
This-- you know,
you'll hear people

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.210
say, oh, it's Vladimir Putin.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.260
And some of it is.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.560
But this part isn't.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.320
You can go back to
the Yeltsin era.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.930
You can go back to '92-'
93, and everywhere--

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.150
every Russian
strategy document--

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.090
threat of NATO enlargement, the
need to protect ethnic Russians

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.050
outside Russia, and how
important the neighborhood is

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:41.720
to Russia.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.140
They're there-- again
and again and again.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.940
And Ukraine, particularly,
is very central

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.370
because as Putin
indicated in his speech,

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.250
the histories of
Russia and Ukraine

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.400
are incredibly intertwined.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.014
And they're intertwined in ways
that, not that surprisingly,

00:15:57.014 --> 00:15:58.930
are viewed differently
from the two countries.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.960
Again, you have
different stories.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.535
For Russia, Ukraine was
always, for the most part,

00:16:04.535 --> 00:16:06.910
you know-- kind of different
borders at different times--

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.830
but Ukraine's part of Russia.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.410
And it's Russia's hinterlands.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.780
It's the provinces.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.630
It's not-- kind of, it's
not a separate country

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.790
with links to Russia.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.400
It's part of Russia.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.440
Russians think of the
Ukrainian language

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.245
as a form of Russian
spoken by people

00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:27.125
who don't speak
Russian that well.

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:30.880
And for Ukraine--
for Ukrainians--

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.620
Ukraine had proud
indepenitration.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.370
OK, so it hasn't been
an independent state

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.980
for very long.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.340
And before that, it was
an independent state

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.170
for a very brief period in the
middle of a World War once.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.260
But they are a people.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.080
They are a nation.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.110
They have a language.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.590
And they've been
oppressed by the Russians,

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.540
even if they do come from
many of the same roots.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.345
Which some Ukrainian
nationalists question,

00:16:47.345 --> 00:16:48.760
but I think
linguistically that's

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.100
a tougher one to counter.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.460
But what this means
is the possibility

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.960
of loss of influence in other
post-Soviet states is bad.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.740
The possibility of not having
sway over Ukraine is anathema.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.860
It's just-- it's crazy.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.940
It doesn't make sense.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.167
So for Russia it's
about Ukraine,

00:17:08.167 --> 00:17:09.250
which is really important.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.630
And it's about the United
States and fighting the US

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.300
for influence in
it's neighborhood.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.750
And then what?

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.641
Because that's one
of the questions

00:17:17.641 --> 00:17:18.849
I think we're grappling with.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.369
It is, kind of,
just about Ukraine.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:22.109
Is it just about
the neighborhood?

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.940
Or is this part
of Putin's effort

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.876
to build up a global
role for Russia?

00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:29.500
Sometimes in cooperation
with this US--

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.520
sometimes in opposition.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.060
But we have seen Russia playing
more and more of a role.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.010
So is this Russia
flexing its muscles?

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.240
And if it is, what's
it going to do

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.490
with them after
it's flexed them?

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.710
Which is one of the
things that I think has,

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.960
you know, what has
shocked people.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.250
What has confused
people about Crimea,

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.570
specifically, is that
before these events

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.620
of the last few weeks,
the general view

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.360
was that Russia wanted influence
in the region, not territory.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.770
But it's just taken territory.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.909
And it's put troops
near Ukraine's border--

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:05.450
and walk them back
and put them back.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.090
And there are troops that
are stationed there normally,

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.048
and dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:18:08.048 --> 00:18:11.249
But, you know, some stuff moved.

00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:13.040
And then there are the
protests in Ukraine.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.230
And there is clear evidence that
Russians are involved in them.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.760
And then Putin's really
nationalistic speech

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.984
about Crimea.

00:18:19.984 --> 00:18:21.900
You start wondering,
maybe, he does want more.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.340
And you're seeing this debated.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.340
And if they do want more--
do they want Ukraine?

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.430
Do they want Transnistria
and then, Moldova?

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.210
Or does it go further?

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:36.110
And for the US and for its
European allies in NATO-- well

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.000
they don't want
Russia to go further.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.760
It's not because
of Ukraine itself.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.250
They don't-- this
may sound harsh,

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.790
but they don't actually care
about Ukraine specifically.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.950
They care about the principal.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.500
They're worried
about the possibility

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.580
that it means more than Ukraine.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.424
But where Ukraine
is concerned, they

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:54.090
have no alliance
commitments to Ukraine.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.990
They have no promises
to protect it.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.224
This is annoying and a
bummer and difficult.

00:18:58.224 --> 00:18:59.640
But if it's just
Ukraine, it means

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.430
something very different from
if it's broader than Ukraine.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.000
Particularly if it actually
does hit NATO's borders.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.380
Because that's where you do
have alliance commitments.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.020
And of course Poles, Romanians,
and the Baltic states--

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.700
who are the closest and who are
the ones that might have reason

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.810
to think that Russia has designs
on them, get really nervous.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.120
And then we get really nervous.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.199
Because these are allies.

00:19:19.199 --> 00:19:20.490
We do have commitments to them.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.128
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
is everybody there,

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:24.408
like along the Russian border
in NATO except Ukraine?

00:19:24.408 --> 00:19:25.158
These [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:25.158 --> 00:19:28.690
OLGA OLIKER: Um--
these guys are in NATO.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.950
NATO-- NATO-- so Belarus
isn't, Ukraine isn't, Moldova

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:37.480
isn't, Georgia [INAUDIBLE] that
we're getting out of Europe

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.664
aren't.

00:19:38.664 --> 00:19:40.080
But the Rumanian's
are-- so you're

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.780
kind of NATO-Europe over here.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.790
Non-NATO-Europe over there.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.967
And one of things
I've been watching

00:19:48.967 --> 00:19:51.300
over the last few years is
how the definition of Central

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.770
and Eastern Europe has shifted,
over the last 20 years.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:54.270
Right?

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.670
Because it used to be that
this was Central Europe.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.177
Now this is Central Europe.

00:19:59.177 --> 00:20:01.510
And, you know, people seem
to argue about whether or not

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.560
Russia is Europe,
geographically.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.280
You know, the Ural
Mountains in Europe.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.240
But, you know, there
is also the confusion.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.330
So is Eastern Europe,
now, just Russia

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.385
is also-- it's a fascinating
question of linguistics.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.710
And the problem with
this is that if you

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.710
are talking about some
sort of military conflict

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.740
with Russia-- well
the nuclear shadow

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.230
hangs over any military
conflict with Russia.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.295
And this makes everybody
pretty nervous.

00:20:29.295 --> 00:20:32.140
Not that they actually think
nuclear war's going to happen.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.030
But, you know what,
no one actually

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.238
thought that Russia was
going to annex Crimea either.

00:20:35.238 --> 00:20:38.700
So where do we go from here?

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.600
I think there's no question
that what's happened

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.230
changes the nature of US and
European relations with Russia.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.480
But to what extent
depends largely

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.662
on what Russia does next.

00:20:49.662 --> 00:20:51.120
There are a lot of
people who would

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.514
blame the US for these events.

00:20:53.514 --> 00:20:55.930
I mean, you hear a lot of
things of did we get this wrong?

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.435
How did we get this wrong?

00:20:58.435 --> 00:21:00.550
But you know, it's not
particularly clear to me

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.775
that I can point
to a policy that we

00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:05.400
could have had over the last 20
years that would have gotten us

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.320
somewhere else.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.300
You know some people-- and just
to, kind of, underline this,

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.580
Thomas Friedman has a piece
in today's New York Times

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.690
that says that we were too hard
on the Russians in the early

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.610
'90s-- shouldn't have
pushed NATO enlargement.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.100
Other people say we weren't
hard enough on the Russians.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.860
We didn't demonstrate to them
how important this stuff was.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.910
We should have let
Ukraine into NATO.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.030
So you hear both
of these things.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.550
But the fact of the matter
is, Russian positions on this

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.592
were always pretty clear.

00:21:29.592 --> 00:21:30.924
That this is their neighborhood.

00:21:30.924 --> 00:21:32.350
This is their
sphere of influence

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.930
and beyond that-- unclear.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.670
And while Washington-- what
Washington and Brussels were

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:41.430
trying to do during this
period was help-- kind of,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.110
help create the conditions where
Russia would get to a point

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.780
where the independence
of its neighbors

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.990
didn't feel threatening to it.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.510
That it was integrated into
the community of nations.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.443
That it had more to lose than
to gain from action like this.

00:21:54.443 --> 00:21:56.940
And I think they thought
they'd, kind of, gotten there.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.900
But they turned out to be wrong.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.800
That doesn't mean that there
was an obvious better solution.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.020
It just means that
it didn't work out

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.170
quite the way people hoped.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.720
So I would say that
if Russia doesn't

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.710
take any further
military action,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.800
we're in for a long
and difficult period.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.300
Not a Cold War.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.770
The Cold War, some
of you may remember,

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:23.260
was two countries that were
juxtaposed against each other.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.029
And everything they
did was informed

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:26.320
by how the other would respond.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.940
Everything they did
was partly geared

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.501
to how the other would respond.

00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:31.000
The United States
couldn't care less

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.629
what Russia thinks on most
of it's policies anywhere.

00:22:33.629 --> 00:22:35.420
Russia cares what the
United States thinks.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.480
But the United States doesn't.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.910
And this doesn't change that.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.520
Because there's no
particular reason for it to.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.180
Russia just isn't that
important to us globally.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.050
As the president said,
it's a regional power

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.240
not a global power.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.080
The problem is the
region's Europe.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.371
And we care a lot about Europe.

00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:53.215
But that's an aside.

00:22:53.215 --> 00:22:54.490
But it's going to be tense.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.320
And Russia might
behave a little bit

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.470
as though it's a
Cold War situation.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.760
And it has long looked
for opportunities

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.590
to tweak the United
States where it could.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.030
And that's not going to stop.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.660
And it's going to be difficult.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.340
And for Ukraine,
itself, it's going

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.541
to be-- continue to be mess.

00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:11.040
And the lead up to
these elections--

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.414
Ukraine gets-- if
Ukraine manages

00:23:12.414 --> 00:23:14.320
to get to have these
elections, there's

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.050
going to be a lot of
effort to keep it chaotic.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.390
To influence the
election process.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.260
And what the Russians
are pushing for now

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.250
is, basically, for them
and the United States

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.050
to sit down at a table and
write Ukraine a constitution

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.480
and force it on Ukraine.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.870
And their argument is that
the interim government

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.640
isn't legitimate, so they
can't be part of this.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.589
The US and Europe push back and
say, Ukraine must be involved.

00:23:37.589 --> 00:23:39.130
We're going to just
keep seeing this.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.280
And it's going to be messy.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.363
And it's going to be ugly.

00:23:41.363 --> 00:23:44.650
And it's going to be very
difficult for Ukraine.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.420
And then for us, and
for the Europeans,

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.217
kind of, staying the course
through a difficult process

00:23:50.217 --> 00:23:51.050
is going to be hard.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.226
Because there are two camps,
I would say, in both the US

00:23:55.226 --> 00:24:01.565
and in NATO Europe, which
have two very opposite lines

00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:03.310
of thought that both
kind of dangerous.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.350
One is nostalgia for
the status quo of,

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.080
I don't know, say,
last summer where

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.840
things were OK with Russia.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.810
And the idea is that,
OK, fine, so we give them

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:13.930
whatever they want in Ukraine.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.704
And then we can start
moving the gas back.

00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:17.245
And we don't have
to impose sanctions

00:24:17.245 --> 00:24:19.504
that are inconvenient
for us, too.

00:24:19.504 --> 00:24:21.170
And we can just go
back to where it was,

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.629
because we liked
it the way it was.

00:24:22.629 --> 00:24:24.211
And then the other
is the people who's

00:24:24.211 --> 00:24:25.410
nostalgia goes further back.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.990
Who really are nostalgic for the
Cold War, and who would like,

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.610
kind of, a nice clear enemy.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.460
And who'd like to make
it all about Russia,

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.370
and all about beating Russia
down and punishing Russia.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.710
And how many other
ways can we find

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.610
to make things worse for Russia?

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.130
Which will not,
in the long term,

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.620
really advance a lot of US
goals for European security.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.140
So that's what I think happens.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.390
So I think, kind of, bouncing
between these two things

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.510
and having a very long
and difficult process

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.390
of coordinating
policies-- what happens

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.910
if we stay at this stalemate.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.214
If Russia does take
military action-- well,

00:25:00.214 --> 00:25:02.880
I actually think what happens if
Russia takes military action is

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.330
it's going to find that this
is pretty self defeating.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.480
Russian forces are fighting
their Ukrainian brothers.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.390
I'm not sure how well that plays
in the Kharkov and Habaroff's,

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.540
and for that matter,
Moscow and St. Petersburg.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.060
And it will-- this
won't be Crimea.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.650
East and Southern Ukraine
are very different.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.100
Most people they
aren't ethnic Russians.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.800
Even of those who are--
and IRI poll just released

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.190
found that about 2/3 of the
ethnic Russians in Ukraine

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.370
don't feel particularly
under threat.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.540
In fact, fewer than 30%
do think that there's

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.190
anything threat at all to them.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.230
Most Southern and Eastern
Ukrainians-- again,

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.770
well over 60%-- have
no desire, whatsoever,

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.090
for Russian military
troops in their region

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.450
or in their country.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.460
So if Russia takes
military action in Ukraine,

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.671
it's not sanctions from
Europe and the United States

00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:50.920
that are going to punish them.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.870
It's the effects of doing this.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.460
And there are definitely those
in Russia who recognize this.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.170
Question is whether Putin
and his inner circle do.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.860
And whether-- and
the other question

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.490
is whether Russian traditional
views of Ukraine and, kind of,

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.610
this inability to recognize
Ukraine as separate

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.830
will undermine
rationality, in this case.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.020
So I'm going to
stop there, and I

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.435
want to hear you all
think and discuss this.

00:26:16.435 --> 00:26:18.620
CHRIS DEFAY: OK, so we're
happy to take questions,

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.899
but let's please pass the
mic to the person who's

00:26:20.899 --> 00:26:21.940
going to do the question.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.177
And you're right here,
so, first question.

00:26:24.177 --> 00:26:24.760
AUDIENCE: Hi--

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.170
CHRIS DEFAY: Should be on.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.451
AUDIENCE: Hi, hello--

00:26:27.451 --> 00:26:28.867
CHRIS DEFAY: Uh,
it's working even

00:26:28.867 --> 00:26:30.033
though it's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:31.650
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK, sorry.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.510
OK, so one thing that
I-- like for example,

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.930
when I hear this discussions,
one thing that I think is lost

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.230
is the fact that
people in Crimea

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.810
actually voted to be,
like, attached to Russia.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:49.150
So well, I don't-- I
know how-- I'm Iranian,

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:53.370
so I know how governments can
manipulate views and change

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.110
the way that people
see the news.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.760
But I think, like,
it says something

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.080
when most of the people
in that peninsula

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.440
voted to actually be
attached to Russia.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.390
And where I read the
news, and I see, like,

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.690
two or three other
cities, [INAUDIBLE]--

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.460
when I hear that-- again, there
are some Pro-Russian groups

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.740
of people that actually
want to attach to Russia.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.330
So I think, like-- and I've
heard from one of my friends

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.900
that are, actually, two
groups of people in Ukraine,

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.590
not related to US or Russia
who, actually, some of them,

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.120
want to-- like they're
Pro-Russian, and some or not.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.990
So I think it's more about
what Ukrainian people think

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.074
than what US wants there
or what Russia wants there.

00:27:40.074 --> 00:27:40.740
OLGA OLIKER: OK,

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.070
AUDIENCE: So

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.920
OLGA OLIKER: Go ahead.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.961
AUDIENCE: Sorry, and the
people who voted-- yeah,

00:27:43.961 --> 00:27:46.640
there are some people who
came from Russia to protest,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.870
but I think the people who voted
were actually Ukrainians that--

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:50.540
like--

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.142
OLGA OLIKER: OK--
so Crimea is weird.

00:27:54.142 --> 00:27:57.930
I will-- Crimea is about
60% ethnically Russian.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.160
Crimea also has a
population of about 25%

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.200
of a indigenous
population-- or fairly,

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.325
indigenous you know indigenous
varies year to year.

00:28:05.325 --> 00:28:06.866
MALE VOICE: As
indigenous as it gets.

00:28:06.866 --> 00:28:09.220
OLGA OLIKER: Yes-- called
the Crimean Tatars,

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.250
who were expelled
from their home region

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.260
after World War II by Stalin.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.160
Forced you to
Uzbekistan-- lots of them

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.740
died along the way-- weren't
allowed to come back.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.945
[INAUDIBLE] allowed to
come back until the 1980s.

00:28:20.945 --> 00:28:24.140
Those people boycotted
the referendum.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.620
So the Crimean Tatars are very
nervous about the possibility

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.950
of Russian rule, as
a people and felt

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.100
that the referendum was
not valid and not something

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.880
that was going to respond.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.260
Now, beyond that,
there is this question

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.506
of how do countries-- how do
pieces of countries secede?

00:28:41.506 --> 00:28:42.880
When the Soviet
Union fell apart,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.610
the Soviet
constitution, actually,

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.760
had laid out very clearly
how Republics could secede.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.380
And they all,
actually, did that.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:54.550
They followed these
rules-- including Ukraine.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.710
Ukraine's constitution
didn't really have this.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.920
But generally speaking,
there is a thing-- you know,

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.240
countries have borders.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.930
And, generally
speaking, there are

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.360
bits of countries that
are unhappy with that.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.767
And there are
movements to secede.

00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:10.850
And sometimes, eventually,
that happens over time.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.557
You've got Scotland doing that.

00:29:13.557 --> 00:29:15.140
But in Crimea that's
not what you had.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.210
It's not as though Crimeans,
last year, were thinking, gosh,

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.040
it would be nice
to rejoin Russia.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.540
It is very much a product of
what happened in the last two

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.710
months, and the Russian news
media and the propaganda

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:30.050
campaign, that created
this environment.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.680
So there's a reason that
these processes are usually

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.620
time consuming.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.770
There's a long lead up.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.530
There's a lot of discussion.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.740
You didn't have any of that.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.406
This was kind of--
this was very sudden.

00:29:39.406 --> 00:29:43.340
And then-- this is even just
taking out of the equation

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:47.130
82% of Crimeans voted
with 97% percent of them.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.000
We know 82% of
Crimeans didn't vote,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.240
because we know that the Crimean
Tatars boycotted the election.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.696
So-- and I'm really-- 97%?

00:29:54.696 --> 00:29:57.070
So there's a lot of question
about whether the referendum

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.250
is, in any way, valid.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.850
So, you know, just-- yes,
self determination is great.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.390
But self determination
is usually

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.940
pretty well controlled globally.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.504
And in this particular
case there's

00:30:07.504 --> 00:30:08.920
a lot of reason
to wonder just how

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.240
self-determined it really was.

00:30:14.114 --> 00:30:15.530
AUDIENCE: So you
started your talk

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.075
with describing two different
views of what's going on.

00:30:18.075 --> 00:30:19.575
And, of course,
when people disagree

00:30:19.575 --> 00:30:22.270
or two countries disagrees,
there's always two views.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.402
Each are not exactly the same.

00:30:24.402 --> 00:30:26.580
I think the question
that I have is

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.540
in your opinion,
which of those views

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.360
have more legitimacy
or more aligned

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.719
is reality-- for some
definition of reality.

00:30:35.719 --> 00:30:37.260
OLGA OLIKER: I'd
rather not take one.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.820
I mean I'd actually-- I think
that to understand what's

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.660
going on, you have to understand
that these are the views.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.600
Because they drive
how people think.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.360
And then, you can draw
your own conclusions

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.640
about what's really going on.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.090
And I would argue-- you know,
sorry, that was kind of,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.329
postmodernist, but, my
views, too-- they're

00:30:55.329 --> 00:30:57.870
based on who I believe; who I
don't believe; who I listen to;

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.230
who I don't; what
news sources I trust;

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.120
which news sources
I don't trust.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.050
So, kind of, when I ran through
this-- that, yes, of course

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.480
he was corrupt, but he was
also democratically elected.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.570
I don't think that
protests are a great way

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.510
to change governments.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.740
You know, sometimes it happens,
but over all, that's not a sign

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.680
that you have a
healthy democracy.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.840
It's a sign that you're
still working towards it.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.410
And if you keep having
protests to change governments,

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.260
that's, also-- that's not good.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.850
I think the parliament's choice
to oust Yanukovych and put

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.550
in a new government was a
questionable legality, though.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.990
I've heard another
story line that

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.165
says that the fact Yanukovych's
own party voted for this-- was

00:31:34.165 --> 00:31:36.540
actually their way of subverting
the process to make sure

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.539
it wasn't legitimate, so
that it would continue.

00:31:38.539 --> 00:31:41.290
So conspiracy
theories everywhere.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:46.260
But I also think the Russians
are fomenting unrest.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.179
And I also think that there is
a real danger from right wing

00:31:49.179 --> 00:31:50.470
groups in Ukraine's government.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:54.130
And I also think Ukraine
needs to develop-- if Ukraine

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.550
is going to succeed, it's
going to be better off

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.830
with economic reform.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.320
Which probably won't hurt
as much people think.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.199
And that it's going to
need to be economic reform

00:32:04.199 --> 00:32:05.740
and political reform
that encompasses

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.740
the whole country, including
the East and South.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.640
It can't ignore the interests
and concerns of these people.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.980
So my views of--
my view is you have

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.610
to take a little from column
A, a little from column B,

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.210
and then a few things from
just a few other places

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.320
to put together a truer story.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.380
But I also recognize that
all histories, at least,

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.240
somewhat biased.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.410
AUDIENCE: But do
you have a storyline

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.860
which you think is more correct?

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.740
Even though you don't
want to reveal it, or--

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.656
OLGA OLIKER: Well I think
I told you my story.

00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:34.429
No, I think I just tried
to tell you my story line.

00:32:34.429 --> 00:32:35.720
MALE VOICE: We'll go down here.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.130
AUDIENCE: My question
is about the Gazprom.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:49.050
So what's your-- think of
the prospect of Gazprom,

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.340
or on this geopolitical tension?

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.150
Gazprom, the
company, in the sense

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.029
of will it make a lot
of money off of this?

00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:57.320
Or will it lose a lot of money.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.861
Or will the sanctions
hurt it at all.

00:32:58.861 --> 00:33:03.550
AUDIENCE: The prospect that we
have it to be not [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.736
or national lines [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:06.736 --> 00:33:08.610
OLGA OLIKER: You know,
the joke about Gazprom

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.250
is that it's not always clear
whether it's that Gazprom has

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.480
influence over the Russian
government or vice versa.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.160
It's talking about
nationalization-- Gazprom

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.299
ignores, kind of, the very
tight links between Gazprom

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:22.090
and the government.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.460
I don't think they
need to nationalize it.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.668
I don't think they have any--

00:33:24.668 --> 00:33:26.162
AUDIENCE: Gazprom
might privatize

00:33:26.162 --> 00:33:27.120
the Russian government.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.620
OLGA OLIKER: Gazprom
could privatize

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.430
the Russian Government,
potentially.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:34.350
You know, I think over time,
if the Europeans do shift away

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:38.100
from Russian gas, that will
not be good for Gazprom.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.690
If Ukraine-- which Ukraine
really needs to do is

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.770
institute some
energy efficiency.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.190
I mean even a few, just,
moves towards a metering

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:50.190
and being a little more
efficient with their use

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.106
of energy, and they'd
be supplying themselves.

00:33:52.106 --> 00:33:54.800
They won't need Russia at all.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.790
And that would also
hurt Gazprom-- even

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.460
with all these reduced rates.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.850
But, yeah, the thing that
hurts the Russian gas industry,

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.220
in the long term, is failure
to invest in infrastructure

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.780
over time and continue to
rely on a lot of, really,

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.130
old infrastructure.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.500
And, kind of, looking for
new routes and new customers,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.040
rather than thinking about
ways to do things better.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.080
So overall, yes, if
this goes forward,

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.719
Gazprom won't be in good shape.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:18.721
But there's still a
lot of Russian gas.

00:34:18.721 --> 00:34:19.929
And people will still buy it.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:21.889
So I don't think it's
the end of the world.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:23.830
I think where Gazprom
runs into trouble

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.479
over time is failure to invest.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.620
AUDIENCE: China's been
surprisingly reticent

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.290
in all this.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:41.219
You would think given
Tibet, for instance,

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:45.110
they would be rather opposed
to redrawing borders.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.540
But what is your take
about the long term

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.480
interest of China
in this conflict?

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.520
OLGA OLIKER: So given,
yeah, given Tibet they'd

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.310
be opposed to redrawing borders.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:57.610
Given Taiwan, and all those
islands, they might be for it.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.521
Kind of like Russia,
and, actually, kind of

00:34:59.521 --> 00:35:00.145
like everybody.

00:35:00.145 --> 00:35:02.440
You know, there's--
your interests vary,

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.730
depending on a particular piece
of geography are looking at.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.230
I've heard different things
come out of different people's

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:12.880
conversations with Chinese
officials and Chinese analysts.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.189
One view is that their
abstention in the UN

00:35:16.189 --> 00:35:17.730
means that they've
got Russia's back.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.396
I've never quite heard
of those tensions

00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:22.210
meaning you have somebody's
back before, but OK.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.670
Another is that they are quite
nervous because of Tibet.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.570
And they are-- they
don't like this.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.530
Russia and China have had
a very odd relationship

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.177
over the last-- well,
over a long time,

00:35:33.177 --> 00:35:34.510
you know, from the Soviet Union.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.720
But if we just look at
Russia-- independent Russia--

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.220
that on the one
hand, they cooperate

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.310
and coordinate a
lot, because they do

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.900
you have a lot of shared views.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.780
One of the shared views
has, traditionally,

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.780
been about the importance
of sovereignty though,

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.380
so this is a little difficult.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.710
But they also really
distrust one another

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.390
and have consistently.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.190
So it's always been a
very fraught relationship.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:57.177
And if you look at how
Russian's view China,

00:35:57.177 --> 00:35:58.510
there's, kind of, a split there.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.350
People who think that China is
Russia's most important ally.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.020
And there are people who
think the Chinese are just

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.478
biding their time
until they decide

00:36:04.478 --> 00:36:06.580
to grab a big chunk
of Russia's far east.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.810
And in China it's a little
more difficult to parse this.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.980
But I think you have similar
split between those who think

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.680
that Russia is a good
partner, and those who don't.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.003
So this is not a great
answer, because it's

00:36:21.003 --> 00:36:22.310
an I don't know answer.

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:25.600
But I think, in general, the
Chinese are nervous about this,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.560
and they're going to
watch how it plays out.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.450
AUDIENCE: Given the
strategic importance

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:40.740
of Crimea and the, largely,
Russian population--

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.270
looking back to when the
Soviet Union was falling apart,

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.330
and the borders were getting
drawn how did it end up

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:49.313
part of the Ukraine
instead of Russia anyway?

00:36:49.313 --> 00:36:52.400
OLGA OLIKER: OK-- could
we get the map back?

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.250
So I think-- first
of all, I think

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.500
the strategic importance
of Crimea is overstated.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.760
It was extremely
strategically important

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.610
during the Crimean War--
which was a while ago.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.045
But if you-- if
we look at the map

00:37:06.045 --> 00:37:08.045
MALE VOICE: Google, itself,
has a very nice map.

00:37:08.045 --> 00:37:08.545
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:11.284 --> 00:37:12.575
OLGA OLIKER: This is a Google--

00:37:12.575 --> 00:37:13.270
MALE VOICE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:14.350
OLGA OLIKER: This
is Google Maps.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:15.730
And we can zoom into Crimea.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.610
Let's go to Crimea.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.110
And let's go to the
whole Black Sea.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.800
Can this get-- I want to get
the whole Black Sea in-- OK,

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.072
right-- thank you.

00:37:24.072 --> 00:37:25.780
And then we need to
get it on this frame.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.405
MALE VOICE: OK.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.330
OLGA OLIKER: OK-- so
this is the Black Sea.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.630
To get out of the Black Sea,
you got to go through here.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.090
It's pretty closed off.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:43.940
So you hear a lot about how
Russia has kept its Black Sea

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.067
fleet here.

00:37:45.067 --> 00:37:45.900
It's very important.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.300
And the fleet is based
in Sevastopal here.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.030
And, indeed, it's a nice port.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.990
It's-- you've got good
access and so forth.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.140
But Russia--
Russia's been hedging

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.640
against the loss of-- access
to Crimea for a long time.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.330
The way it's continued to have
it's Black Sea fleet there

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:06.510
is it's kept signing
these leases with Ukraine

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.460
over and over again.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.989
And Ukrainian
governments, even ones

00:38:08.989 --> 00:38:10.530
that were ostensibly
Western leaning,

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.560
have agreed to keep it there.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.625
But they knew that this
might not last forever.

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.500
So they've, actually,
for the last few years,

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.950
been building up facilities
in the [INAUDIBLE] here.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:20.640
Which isn't as handy, right?

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.040
You can't have quite as
much space around it,

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.590
but it's not bad.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.510
And it's doable.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.900
So that's one piece of it.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.500
And this is-- this
is purely military.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.000
It's not like there's
a lot of trade

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.100
going in and out of Sevastopal.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.990
So the other thing
that I would point out

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.650
is the Black Sea fleet is the
smallest of Russia's fleets.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.727
And it's not in great shape.

00:38:41.727 --> 00:38:44.310
So it's not as though-- unless
you count the Caspian Flotilla,

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.920
which is also in the Black Sea.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.350
So it's not as though Russia
was putting a lot of resources

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.920
and energy into keeping this
there for strategic reasons.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.503
I mean, kind of, if
you look at a map,

00:38:54.503 --> 00:38:57.260
you wonder to do
what exactly that it

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.620
couldn't do some other way.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.540
Or from the [INAUDIBLE]
if it needed to.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:08.084
So then, the history-- in
1954-- for a long time, Crimea,

00:39:08.084 --> 00:39:10.000
in the Soviet Union,
was, actually, autonomous

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.720
and didn't belong to anybody.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.290
And then, it belonged to Russia.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.737
And then in 1954,
Khrushchev as Premier,

00:39:15.737 --> 00:39:17.320
decided to give it
as a brotherly gift

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.736
to the Ukrainian
people-- thinking

00:39:18.736 --> 00:39:20.970
that this meant,
pretty much, nothing.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:24.697
Because all the Ukraine had a
vote at the UN and so forth.

00:39:24.697 --> 00:39:26.780
It was part of the Soviet
Union, just like Russia,

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.590
so this was, kind of,
a meaningless gesture

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:30.279
of something.

00:39:30.279 --> 00:39:32.570
And there's a lot of debate
as to what he was thinking.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.361
And you can find lots
of different stories.

00:39:34.361 --> 00:39:38.180
And nobody really knows.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:43.540
In 1991-92, when the Soviet
Union was splitting up,

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.734
a lot of people assumed that
Russia would take Crimea back.

00:39:46.734 --> 00:39:49.150
Because the Black Sea fleet
was there, it would be easier.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.800
It just seemed-- you
know, they didn't.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.450
I, for one, was
surprised at the time.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:54.073
I thought that they would.

00:39:54.073 --> 00:39:56.322
And I think a lot of it had
to do with just weakness--

00:39:56.322 --> 00:39:58.950
trying to get this done,
trying to draw the borders.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.727
Fine, we got it.

00:39:59.727 --> 00:40:00.810
You want your own country.

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:02.762
Here it is.

00:40:02.762 --> 00:40:04.720
There were there all
sorts of deals, initially,

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.140
for the fleet-- that
Ukraine and Russia

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.550
would both hold onto the fleet.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.160
And then Russia
held onto the fleet.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.410
So I think, in many ways,
it's an accident of history.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:15.800
But it's an accident of history
that wasn't that important.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.970
And I would argue it's
still not important.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.990
It's still important,
now, more as an accident

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.929
and an opportunity, than
because of Crimea, itself,

00:40:23.929 --> 00:40:24.595
being important.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.110
AUDIENCE: And how much does
the rest of the Ukraine care

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:38.720
about Crimea.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.400
I mean, I've seen very little
protests on the streets of Kiev

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.230
about losing Crimea.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.950
And I could even imagine that
a lot of Pro-Western people

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.260
in the Ukraine are,
almost, happy to get rid

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.195
of this Russian stronghold.

00:40:51.195 --> 00:40:53.040
OLGA OLIKER: No,
I think Ukrainians

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.998
are pretty pissed off
about the loss of Crimea.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.190
The same-- the IRI poll found
that the vast majority of them

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.430
did not think that--
and by vast majority,

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.870
I mean well into the
80th percentiles--

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.390
did not think that
this was the--

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.280
that the referendum was valid.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.970
Don't think that the
Russian action was valid.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.170
They are angry.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.540
They can't do an awful
lot about it, right?

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:18.720
And it terrifies them.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.303
Because they're
terrified the Russians

00:41:20.303 --> 00:41:22.430
are going to move
into more of Ukraine.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:28.034
But, yeah, I wouldn't say they
were eager to lose Crimea.

00:41:28.034 --> 00:41:30.660
AUDIENCE: OK, so I
have two questions.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.247
The first is about Crimea's
status within Russia.

00:41:34.247 --> 00:41:35.080
OLGA OLIKER: Uh-huh.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.930
AUDIENCE: So is it going
to be an autonomous

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.470
state within Russia?

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.400
And particularly, what's going
to happen the minorities there

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.140
who sum up 40% of
the population.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.340
Particularly, Ukrainians--
using their language, et cetera.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.690
So what's the foreseeable
future by that?

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:54.860
That's one.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.060
The other is this
whole operation

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:02.300
seems to be very professional
done by the Russians,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.160
unlike their
previous operations--

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.440
military operations and,
also, the elections.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.650
So it's really hard to
believe that this just

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.440
happened all of sudden.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.100
Do we have any data about
Russia's planning this-- maybe

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.510
for years?

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.520
OLGA OLIKER: So
Crimea's status--

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.570
Crimea has, historically,
been autonomous

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.580
wherever it's been and
had a lot of autonomy.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.400
And the reason for
that was primarily--

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.900
or the excuse for
it was the Tatars,

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.520
as the indigenous,
I think, population.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.240
That, kind of, they should have
their own state-- their own--

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.530
or stateling.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:41.070
I think how Russia treats
Crimea is a great question.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.550
And I'm-- to be really
honest with you,

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.920
I'm more nervous about
the Tatars than I am about

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.230
to the Ukrainian population.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:51.570
Because they have such a
history of being oppressed.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.730
And because, right now--
still people who had came back

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.830
are not living under
the best of conditions.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.950
There are still questions
about their access

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.780
to land and housing.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.751
So since Russia came in to
protect people's human rights--

00:43:04.751 --> 00:43:06.500
and I would say it's
a very important test

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.970
of what that means.

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:10.274
How they treat both the
Ukrainian population

00:43:10.274 --> 00:43:11.315
and the Tatar population.

00:43:14.189 --> 00:43:16.230
Then the military-- the
Russian military-- first,

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.650
I would say that military's
plan for all sorts of things.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.590
And they have tons of plans
on the books for everything.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.920
Just because they have a
plan, means nothing about what

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.635
they're actually
intending to do or not.

00:43:26.635 --> 00:43:28.510
So do they have some
sort of plan for Crimea?

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.000
Maybe.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.990
Was it this?

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.510
I think, probably,
aspects of it.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.630
Because what you actually do
when you implement these plans,

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.460
is you take something from
here and something from there

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.585
and you pull them together.

00:43:39.585 --> 00:43:41.670
Because the actual situation
is never quite what

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:43.259
you expect it to be.

00:43:43.259 --> 00:43:45.550
I don't think of Crimea as
a military operation though.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.260
I think of it as a
political operation

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.400
which was backed by force.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.880
But it's not as though Russian
armed forces were called on

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.290
to do an awful lot--
other than stand around

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.530
with guns in unmarked uniforms
looking, kind of, mean.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.992
So it's not as though
they faced any-- it's not

00:44:00.992 --> 00:44:02.700
as though they faced,
really, opposition.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.450
It's the Ukrainians
were trying very hard

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.740
not to provoke anything.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.390
So they didn't,
particularly, fight back.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.910
So it's not like
it's a-- I think

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.210
it's a great
propaganda operation.

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:16.487
I think it's a really
impressive political operation.

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.320
But I don't think it
tells me much about how

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.320
the Russian military
does, other than the fact

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.864
that it can send people
who will follow orders.

00:44:22.864 --> 00:44:24.530
And I knew that it
could do that before,

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:26.580
particularly, with
the elite forces.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.960
And honestly, from
Georgia I knew

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.640
that it could do it even
with the rank and file.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.680
Because even if the Russians
weren't that happy with how

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.230
they did in Georgia, most of
the reasons they weren't happy

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.100
we're about combined arms
and the use of technology.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.600
Not about their people being
able to follow order and behave

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.225
professionally.

00:44:40.225 --> 00:44:41.890
Which, they pretty much did.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.610
So we already
knew-- so, kind of,

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.026
my bottom line is I do think
the Russian military's better

00:44:46.026 --> 00:44:46.980
than it used to be.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.800
And my guess is it's even
better than it was in Georgia.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.776
But just how good it
is-- Crimea's no test of.

00:44:54.776 --> 00:44:58.190
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.047
I have a couple
Russian friends--

00:45:01.047 --> 00:45:02.130
they live in this country.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:05.290
They've been here
for like 15-20 years.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.425
And they're educated--
US universities.

00:45:08.425 --> 00:45:10.300
And so whenever something
happens with Russia

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.270
I ask them for their opinions.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:16.170
And basically, when
I asked my friend

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.750
what he thought about Crimea
he said, I'm no fan of Putin,

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:23.890
but Russian speakers
there are under threat.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.490
So he's basically, repeating
the same propaganda

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.590
that we hear from
Russian television.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:29.480
OLGA OLIKER: As opposed
to the propaganda

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.855
we hear from
American television.

00:45:30.855 --> 00:45:34.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
my question is--

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:39.250
to me that just seems
absurd because I

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.530
think that it is propaganda.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.750
And I don't-- I just--
my question's, basically,

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:44.172
is there any legitimacy to that?

00:45:44.172 --> 00:45:45.630
Are there-- are
the Russian-- like,

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:49.600
were the Russian speakers
in Crimea ever under threat?

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.450
Do we have evidence
of that at all?

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:52.400
OLGA OLIKER: I don't
think they were

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.816
under any kind of
physical threat.

00:45:53.816 --> 00:45:56.114
I think it was, kind of,
there was this concern

00:45:56.114 --> 00:45:58.280
that, oh my God, there are
ultra rightist patrolling

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.677
the streets of Kiev--
which there, kind of, were.

00:46:00.677 --> 00:46:02.510
And what is this going
to mean for me longer

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.093
term that a lot of these groups,
particularly, the ultra right

00:46:05.093 --> 00:46:07.995
groups, have said
virulently anti-Russian--

00:46:07.995 --> 00:46:09.700
and also, antisemitic,
and I can't

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.742
imagine their fond of
the Tatars-- things.

00:46:11.742 --> 00:46:13.700
But most people are, kind
of, willing to accept

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:18.281
that the government would not
be dominated by these people.

00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:20.030
Now I think that's
still-- it's dangerous.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.040
It's a concern.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.830
But that is very much what
the Russian media, include--

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:29.140
look if you're from Russia, and
you read Russian news sources,

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.521
again, you can pick and
choose which ones you read.

00:46:31.521 --> 00:46:33.770
Just like in the United
States, you can watch Fox News

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:34.820
or you can watch MSNBC.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:37.090
And you can here a story
you expect to hear.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:38.840
There are Russian's
who don't think this--

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:39.720
including in Russia.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.390
They get their news elsewhere.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:45.590
But it's not that shocking, and
it comes from a grain of truth.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:49.850
And I've talked
to Ukrainians who

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.370
say that they were concerned.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.820
Maybe not concerned
for their lives,

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.810
but concerned for the
economy, concerned

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:59.967
about the effects of the
EU Association agreement.

00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:01.300
And then again, the [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.550
You know, I said, most people
don't feel under threat,

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.180
but some people do.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:05.910
So you know.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.350
MALE VOICE: 30% is a lot.

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:09.767
OLGA OLIKER: 30% is a lot.

00:47:09.767 --> 00:47:12.350
Less than 30, really, but yeah,
it's kind of in the high 20's.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:13.862
But yeah, it's-- people do.

00:47:13.862 --> 00:47:15.945
And it's, you know, some
really feel under threat,

00:47:15.945 --> 00:47:17.500
and some think,
maybe threatened.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.000
So it breaks down further,
but there's a nervousness.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.350
And why wouldn't there be,
given what they've been fed?

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.400
And I'm nervous about
the ultra right wing

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.000
groups in Ukraine's
government, too.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.037
I mean, I think that it's
very important for Ukraine

00:47:34.037 --> 00:47:36.245
to find ways that they don't
dominate the discussion.

00:47:36.245 --> 00:47:38.620
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry-- one is
like manipulating the event,

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.914
because they can, like, you
hear both sides of the story.

00:47:41.914 --> 00:47:44.330
OLGA OLIKER: Sure, but you
have to look for it, don't you?

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.480
I mean I was just-- I was--
I have a Twitter feed, right?

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.250
I try to keep the news on
my Twitter feed balanced

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.760
from different sources.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.990
But I also know that
I believe some people

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:55.350
and I don't believe others.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:57.410
I mean, I have a bias
on how I read it.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:58.947
And I have friends
who watch Fox.

00:47:58.947 --> 00:48:00.405
And I have friends
who watch MSNBC.

00:48:00.405 --> 00:48:03.300
They just-- the only reason
they would hear the other

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:06.900
is if somebody's pointing
out how silly something is.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.339
I mean, I don't think this
is unique to Russians.

00:48:09.339 --> 00:48:10.630
I think Americans do this, too.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.390
I think one of the
effects of, kind of,

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.130
this broad access
to information is

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.252
we can pick and choose
what information we here.

00:48:17.252 --> 00:48:18.293
CHRIS DEFAY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:18.293 --> 00:48:21.660
You have one back here,
and we'll do one more.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.870
AUDIENCE: I wanted to move
a little bit to the West.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:26.040
And I haven't heard
much about Europe.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:30.310
And watching the BBC, they seem
to be pretty light and not very

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.640
aggressive in their language.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.270
So what's going on
with them, and what

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:37.600
Europe's thinking about this.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.736
OLGA OLIKER: Crop
story-- sorry, oops.

00:48:39.736 --> 00:48:43.070
AUDIENCE: What do [INAUDIBLE]
thinks about this?

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:44.873
OLGA OLIKER: Who do
your so it depends

00:48:44.873 --> 00:48:47.830
on what you mean
by Europe, right?

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:53.540
Romanians would really like
F-16s and a lot of US forces.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.880
Missile batteries
would also be nice.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.840
Germans don't, actually, want
to change their energy mix.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.410
And it's going to
be a big hassle.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.855
And if we have to impose
sanctions-- I mean,

00:49:03.855 --> 00:49:05.230
God, it's going
to be a big deal.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:09.050
Why did the Russians
have to do this now?

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.652
This is kind of what-- so
you get different views

00:49:11.652 --> 00:49:12.860
in different parts of Europe.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:17.200
And it-- where you stand,
depends on where you sit.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.460
I think there is, in
Europe, a nervousness

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.490
about the possibility
of Russia going further.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:25.930
But it is, kind of,
the story actually

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.967
before of there's the people who
are nostalgic for the situation

00:49:28.967 --> 00:49:30.800
before the Russians did
this annoying thing.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.670
And then there are people who
are nostalgic for the Cold War.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.310
And probably, the
further West you get,

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:36.810
the more-- they're
nostalgic for how

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.050
things were a few months ago.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.720
And the further East you
go-- they've been telling us

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.580
all along that the
Russians are dangerous.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.450
We should have paid attention.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:46.550
So that's how Europe
is looking at it.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.600
But that, kind of, in
terms of going forward,

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.610
I think maintaining
a European consensus

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:55.230
on sanctions will be difficult,
particularly, in the West.

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.610
Because it does hurt them, too.

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:01.260
Now they can-- they can adjust,
but they don't, necessarily,

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.060
want to.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:08.060
AUDIENCE: So I'm Ukranian, so I,
kind of, care about the topic.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:08.861
And I want--

00:50:08.861 --> 00:50:09.694
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:16.540
AUDIENCE: I try to stay
away from propaganda,

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:21.280
but what can be done to improve
the situation in Ukraine?

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.390
Kind of, have it be stronger.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.590
OLGA OLIKER: Ukraine needs
to have these elections.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.185
And needs to make them as
free and fair as possible.

00:50:29.185 --> 00:50:32.240
And to make sure that people
from the East and South

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.027
are represented.

00:50:33.027 --> 00:50:35.360
It does not, by any means,
have to move to the, sort of,

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.114
federalism Russia is suggesting.

00:50:37.114 --> 00:50:38.780
But I think direct
election of governors

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.190
is a nice move-- as
opposed to having

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.481
them appointed from the center.

00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:43.910
You know, it does give
people more of a voice.

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.347
It is going to need to move
forward on economic reforms.

00:50:46.347 --> 00:50:48.930
But it's going to need to do it
in a way that reassures people

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:50.638
who feel they're going
to be hurt by them

00:50:50.638 --> 00:50:51.490
that they won't be.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.980
Including-- by offering
some sorts of subsidies,

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:54.936
and so forth.

00:50:54.936 --> 00:50:57.060
But to do this, it's going
to need a lot of support

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.143
from Europe and the United
States-- and financing.

00:50:59.143 --> 00:51:01.365
I mean, we're going
to have bankroll this.

00:51:01.365 --> 00:51:03.490
And this creates a real
tension, because how do you

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.310
bankroll something like
this, while still holding

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:07.550
these people accountable for
both political and economic

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:08.049
reforms?

00:51:08.049 --> 00:51:10.900
You can't keep bankrolling
them if they don't do it.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.530
And for the last
20 years, Ukraine

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:14.930
has been very good at signing
on to things with the EU,

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:17.020
with Russia, with
whoever else and, then,

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.134
not following through.

00:51:18.134 --> 00:51:20.050
So-- I mean, I think
that will be a challenge.

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:23.020
And it's possible that this
crisis has been sufficient.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.996
That Ukraine's next
government will pull this off.

00:51:25.996 --> 00:51:27.870
But it's tough because
the business interests

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.142
and the corruption in that
country-- the go so deep.

00:51:30.142 --> 00:51:31.850
And most of the people
running for office

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.540
are still tied to that.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.760
And their ability to
cut themselves off

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:40.070
from these very lucrative
deals-- it's going to be tough.

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:42.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wonder
if there's any known ways

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:43.780
to fight corruption.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.840
Like globally-- or from
inside or from outside.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.730
What-- like, there been places
where it was really corrupt

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.680
and some how went clean.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.420
OLGA OLIKER: It's
a long process.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.670
I think the one thing we know
about overcoming corruption

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.510
is that it takes
real economic growth.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.960
And it takes time.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.130
And sometimes that time is
not quite generational--

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:06.860
close to it.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.960
Kahka Bendukidze, who's a
former Minister of Economics

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.847
in Georgia, said that what
Ukraine needs is three people.

00:52:13.847 --> 00:52:15.930
It needs somebody who's
going to jail everyone who

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:18.470
needs to be jailed.

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:21.250
It needs someone
who's going to protect

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.287
that person politically.

00:52:22.287 --> 00:52:23.870
And then, it needs
somebody else who's

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:25.286
going to protect
the both of them.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:32.960
So, you know, it's-- I think
that's-- fighting corruption

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.580
requires government's making
a decision not to be corrupt

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.990
and sticking to it.

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:41.290
It's really difficult to
fight corruption from outside

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.080
and, kind of,
impose these rules.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.859
It tends not to work.

00:52:45.859 --> 00:52:47.400
CHRIS DEFAY: OK,
thank you very much.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.250
OLGA OLIKER: All right, thanks.
