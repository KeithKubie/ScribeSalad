00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.929
The values of x that satisfy this inequality are from negative 5 halves to

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.317
positive 3. Great work if you found this interval. As usual, we begin by

00:00:09.317 --> 00:00:14.699
finding the 0s for this quadratic equation. We set this quadratic expression

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.630
equal to 0, and then factor it, and set each factor equal to 0. So we'll have

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.806
2x plus 5 equal 0 and x minus 3 equals 0. When we solve for the values of x, we

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:30.894
see that x can equal negative 5 halves or x can equal 3. We'll use the values

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:34.170
of negative 5 halves in positive 3 to set up our three intervals on our number

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.840
line. These two values make this left side of our inequality equal to 0. So, we

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.954
want to test other values, so that way, this left-hand side is less than 0. If

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:50.346
we let x equal negative 5 in interval I, we get the statement 40 is less than

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:56.848
0. We know this is not true, so this interval or this region is out. No values

00:00:56.848 --> 00:01:02.268
in here satisfy our inequality. For the second interval, we'll test the value

00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:07.102
of 0, since that's in between negative 5 halves and positive 3. If x equals 0,

00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:12.950
we plug it in and we get the statement that negative 15 is less than 0. Well,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.365
this is true, so this part is part of the solution set. And finally, for our

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:22.772
third interval, we just need to test a number greater than 3. If I let x equal

00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:28.360
5, I get the statement 30 is less than 0. This is not true, so again, this part

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.098
is out of my solution set. These are the only values that make the inequality

00:01:33.098 --> 00:01:38.230
true. We use parentheses at negative 5 halves and positive 3, since we can't

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.568
equal 0. We must be less than 0. Again, fantastic work if you got most of that

00:01:43.568 --> 00:01:46.860
solution correct. These are tough.
