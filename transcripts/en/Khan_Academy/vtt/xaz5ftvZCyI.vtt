00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.900
Now that we've touched on all
of the major players in the

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.840
specific immune system, what I
thought I would do in this

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.060
video is do a summary
so it all fits

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.510
together a little bit.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.650
So the first person or character
we got exposed to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.770
was the B cell, which
I always do in blue.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.550
And what made that interesting
is that every B cell has its

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.980
own specific-- or they have
membrane bound antibodies, but

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
for each B cell, the membrane
bound antibodies on each

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.270
specific B cell had its
own variable portion.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.770
So this B cell-- it'll be
variable right like that.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.030
And if I were to draw another
B cell right here, I would

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.440
draw the variable portion
a little bit different.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.780
This is why different actual
B cells will respond to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.390
different antigens or different
pathogens that have

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.640
entered our system.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:05.590
And a B cell gets activated--
let's talk about what happens

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.445
when it gets activated or
what needs to happen.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.370
It needs binding of the pathogen
onto one of these

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.863
membrane bound antibodies.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.890
But that's not all.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.480
I mean, sometimes that's all you
need, but usually you also

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.450
need to be stimulated
by a T cell.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.580
And you might say, where's
the helper T cell

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.070
stimulate this guy?

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.390
Well, B cells were also antigen
presenting cells so

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.010
he'll suck this guy in, break
him out, and present him on an

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.455
MHC II complex.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.410
Let's say this is an
MHC II complex.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.750
This guy gets cut up, part of
him gets presented right here,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.500
and then an activated helper T
cell whose variable portion of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.370
their T cell receptor is
specific to this could come

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.460
along and activate
this character.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.310
I'm not drawing that receptor
well, but that right there is

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.340
a helper T cell and that
is the B cell.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.290
Now, once it's activated, it
starts differentiating-- and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.910
it starts cloning itself and
it can either turn into

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.180
effector cells-- and this true
of B cells or T cells.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.640
Once they get activated, they
keep cloning or they either

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.540
turn into effector cells
or memory cells.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.150
Memory cells stick around a
lot longer so that in the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.570
future you're going to have
many more of this

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.880
version of B cells.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.790
So if you get the same antigen
or pathogen in the future, the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.780
likelihood of it bumping into
this type of B cell is going

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.700
to be higher so the response
will occur faster.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.550
The effector B cells produce--
they essentially turn into

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.710
antibody making machines.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.630
So they'll say, gee, this
antibody bonds to this antigen

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.570
that we have in the
system now.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.290
Let me just produce
a ton of them.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.160
So it starts building up all of
the cellular machinery and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.770
it starts producing antibodies
like crazy.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.300
I want to point out one thing
that my wife pointed out to me

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.490
when I was-- she overheard me
making the last video and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.890
she's a fellow in hematology
and a lot of hematology is

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.570
immunology.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.640
So I definitely have
to defer to her.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.880
She is the expert on this.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.070
In the last video, I kind of
very hand-wavingly said, B

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.230
cells, once they get activated,
if they're the

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.800
effector B cells, they
produce antibodies.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.570
I want to be very clear.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.950
It is only the effector B
cells that produce the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.560
antibodies and the common term
for them-- if someone were to

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.120
walk up to you and say, what
cells in the body are

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.820
producing antibodies?

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.640
You wouldn't be wrong if you
said effector B cells, but the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.030
common term that people expect
to hear are plasma cells.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.380
Plasma cells and effector B
cells are the same thing, but

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.980
normally when they say, what
happens to a B cell when it

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.050
starts producing antibodies?

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.620
They then call it
a plasma cell.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.340
They don't call it a B cell
anymore and I want to make

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.860
that very clear because my
wife's like, well, I have

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.390
attendings that if they asked
me, what cell in the body

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.350
produces antibodies?

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.000
And if you said, B cell, they
would say, no, wrong.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.480
It's a plasma cell-- or if you
said effector B cell, they

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.080
wouldn't be happy.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.920
They wanted to hear
plasma cell.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.290
This is the common term used in
immunology and apparently

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.560
rheumatology circles.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.290
Did I just say my wife
is a hematologist?

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.570
No, no.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.770
She's studying rheumatology.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.210
I get confused with all the
tologies sometimes.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.845
Anyway, that's what
the B cells do.

00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:55.250
And these antibodies can then
go attach things and mess up

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.650
viruses and antigen-- well,
viruses or instances of

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.290
antigens and bacteria-- and
tag them for pick up by

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.650
macrophages or other types
of phagocytes.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.390
Those were the B cells.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.620
Then you have your T cells.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.710
And here I'm going to talk about
T cells a little bit

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.310
differently than I had in
the last few videos.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.210
Just to give a little bit more
of a nuance-- so there's two

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.420
types of T cells.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.740
You'll say, hey, they are helper
T cells and cytotoxic T

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.710
cells-- and you're not wrong,
but what I'm going to do is do

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.010
a slightly different
differentiation just so that

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.600
you are familiar with these
terms. So there's

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.800
two types of T cells.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.710
All T cells have T
cell receptors.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.030
But they also have these other
proteins on them and some of

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:58.200
them have these proteins
called-- CD4 proteins and some

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.590
of them have what's
called CD8.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.430
So this one right here
would be called a

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.540
CD8 positive T cell.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.280
It has the CD8 proteins on it.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.770
And this would be called
a CD4 positive T cell.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.310
I've never used these
words before.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.250
You're like, gee, where
are these coming from?

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.170
Now, the CD4 receptor is the
thing that wants to bind--

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.760
this is the thing that helps to
go to the MHC II complexes.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.670
So most CD4 T cells are
helper T cells.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.460
Most of the time-- and I want
to make it very clear--

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.940
immunology is a very-- I mean,
this field, people are

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.560
discovering things on
a regular basis.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.460
So people are still
understanding these things and

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.060
there's all sorts of special
cases, but usually when people

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.280
talk about CD4 positive T cells,
they're talking about

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.030
helper T cells.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.760
So this is normally going to
be a helper T cell-- or you

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.430
could call it T helper,
just like that.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.830
Likewise, the CD8 proteins,
these are attracted

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.820
to the MHC I complex.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.480
This is what brings them to
the cells that have the

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.990
cancer, that have expressed
antigens

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.980
on their MHC I complex.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.930
So most of the time CD8

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.060
positive T cells are cytotoxic.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.170
And oftentimes, before a cell
gets activated, they just

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.890
describe it as a CD4 T cell
or a CD8 cell and after it

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:53.240
becomes activated and starts
wanting to kill things, then

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.400
maybe you call it cytotoxic.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.390
But this is all wordplay.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.680
I think you get the
general idea.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:04.170
But just to remember what they
do, this guy-- we just said he

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.520
wants to bond to the MHC
complex, so you have MHC

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.580
complex plus presenting
some antigen.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.840
This is MHC I right here.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.080
We learned in the last video,
every nucleated cell in the

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.870
body expresses an
MHC I complex.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.260
So this is the case where
something wacky is happening

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.500
inside this cell.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.060
Maybe a virus has infected it.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.210
Maybe it's cancerous.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.909
It needs to die, otherwise it's
going to keep producing

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.230
viruses if it's infected by a
virus, or otherwise it's going

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.360
to keep dividing if it's
a cancer and infect

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.320
the rest of the body.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.360
So the CD8 kills
infected cells.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.710
I'll just say bad cells because
I don't if you can--

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.210
cancer really isn't
an infection.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.445
Kills bad cells-- cells that
are-- if you don't kill them,

00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:54.960
they're going to keep producing
viruses or keep

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.110
splitting and spreading the
cancer, while T cells--

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.080
they're attracted to
professional antigen

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.460
presenting cells.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.950
And I always do a dendritic cell
right here because those

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.360
are the best antigen
presenting cells.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:16.860
And they have MHC II complexes
and it's digested some antigen

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.020
and it presents it right there
and then that activates the

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.200
helper T cell.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.810
And then when the helper T
cell-- all of these guys, once

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.620
they're activated, they all go
into effector-- they all start

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.690
differentiating into effector
and memory cells.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.640
An effector helper T cell
does a couple of things.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:46.840
So if we're talking about a
helper T cell, it can activate

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.970
B cells and it also releases
cytokines.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.080
Let's say this guy
gets activated.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.030
He'll also start releasing these
chemicals, which are

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.000
really those alarm bells that
tell other people to really

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.850
get in gear-- maybe B cells and
cytotoxic T cells start

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.430
proliferating more rigorously.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.730
Actually, part of the cytotoxic
T cell activation

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.690
can be assisted or kind of
given a boost by these

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.910
cytokines-- of so by
these alarm bells.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:24.500
So this guy's the alarm ringer,
while the CD8 cells or

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.570
the cytotoxic T cells--
in their effector

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.220
mode, they kill cells.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.590
And of course in the memory
mode, there's just a bunch of

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.450
copies of these originals around
that are ready and more

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.120
than they were originally were,
so that in the future if

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.730
something like this or something
like this occurs,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.500
they're going to be activated
faster because they're going

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.150
to be bumped into faster.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.210
So hopefully that clears up a
little bit and I introduced a

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.925
little bit more tough
terminology, but I really want

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:50.750
to stress my wife's point
because she said, hey, you

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.560
don't want people out there
saying B cells produce

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.090
antibodies even though it is
effector B cells-- activated B

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.340
cells that have differentiated
into effector B cells.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.680
Those are what are producing
antibodies-- because when they

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.570
go to medical school, people
are going to want to hear

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.560
plasma cell.
