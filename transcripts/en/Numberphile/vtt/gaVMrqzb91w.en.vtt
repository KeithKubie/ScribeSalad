00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.660
BRADY HARAN: So today I'm going
to do something I've

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.990
never done before, I'm
going to phone a

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.650
Numberphile file viewer.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.060
And the reason for that is this
viewer has a very special

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.610
phone number.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.870
So while I get ready
to do this, let's

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.120
get on with the video.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.670
DR. JAMES GRIME: This
came from Brady.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.770
So you heard of this
type of number.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.920
So it was a type number called
pandigital numbers.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.145
And when you mentioned it, I
said well, I've heard of

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.630
pandigital numbers and I even
have a favorite one.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.460
So that says start off my
favorite pandigital number.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.780
I'll show you what they
are, as well.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.820
381,654,729.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.800
This is my favorite
pandigital number.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.930
Well, first of all, what's
a pandigital number?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.840
You may notice from that number
it uses every digit.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.910
And it uses every digit once
there from one to nine.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.620
So that's called a pandigital
number.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.420
This one's my favorite.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.710
It has an extra property because
the first end digits

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.140
of it is divisible by n.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.440
I'll show you what I mean.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.230
The first digit is
divisible by 1.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.070
The first two digits
are divisible by 2.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.510
The first three digits,
so 381, is a number

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.310
divisible by 3.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.780
First four is a number
divisible by 4.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.160
That's divided by 5.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.180
That can be divided
by 6, 7, 8, and 9.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.190
And that's the only pandigital
number where that works.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.810
So this is a unique pandigital
number with

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.300
that special property.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.410
-It hasn't got a zero.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.510
DR. JAMES GRIME: It
hasn't got a zero.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.800
So there are different
definitions

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.790
for pandigital numbers.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.790
Some are more strict
than others.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.490
So some definitions allow you
to repeat the numbers.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580
So you can repeat the
digits as long as

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.870
you have all of them.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.150
Some of you don't allow you
to repeat the digits.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.440
Some definitions allow
you to have zero.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.060
So that one would be a zeroless
pandigital number.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.170
If you like, though, shall
I stick zero in it?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.240
What I could do is put
a zero on the end.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.620
And, then, there's a
number that can be

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.830
divided by 10, as well.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.360
And that's also unique.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.430
So that would be a unique
pandigital number including

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.650
zero, that could be
divided by 10.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.740
Of course, we can't
divide by zero.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.120
-Nice improvisation there.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.950
DR. JAMES GRIME: You like that?

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.844
-Yeah.

00:02:27.844 --> 00:02:28.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.060
BRADY HARAN: So you've probably
figured out by now

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.530
the person I'm going to call has
a pandigital phone number.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.530
I found out about it by putting
a message out on

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.550
Facebook and Twitter.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.590
So if you don't follow
Numberphile on Facebook and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.960
Twitter that's something
you need to be doing.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.070
But before I make this phone
call, here's James with a bit

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.490
more information about
pandigital numbers.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.410
DR. JAMES GRIME: The smallest
pandigital number-- pandigital

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.340
by the way, it sounds like a
radio station on Neverland.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.000
Did you like that?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.565
There you go.

00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:54.270
There you go.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.350
-No, I didn't particularly
like that.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.067
I think pandigital sounds
like a really

00:02:58.067 --> 00:02:59.470
modern way of cooking.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.850
DR. JAMES GRIME: Pandigital.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.840
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.850
I like that too.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.690
The smallest pandigital number
is one billion--

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.510
this has a zero in it.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.510
So one billion and the
rest, 23,456,789.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.620
So you can kind of see that
that one's the smallest

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.040
pandigital because you can't
put the zero at the start.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.040
You can see why that's the
smallest pandigital number.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.380
Here's another type of
pandigital number.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.100
This one's going
to be a square.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.080
So that's going to
be 9,814,072,356.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.620
That's not necessarily the
largest pandigital number.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.950
But it's the largest square
pandigital number.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.640
So that's square because it has
a square root that is a

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.480
whole number as well.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.730
Do you want me to check it?

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.540
356.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.920
And I want to check that's
a square number.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.290
Yeah, look at that.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.450
So 99,066 That's
a cool number.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.610
Is it 99,066?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.230
Or is it 99,066.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.670
I'm not sure.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.450
I'm not sure what is.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.863
-I see what you're
doing there.

00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:11.805
I like the upside.

00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:12.740
What are they called?

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.400
Numbers that look the
same upside down.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.310
DR. JAMES GRIME: Oh, well there
must be a name for that.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.709
-We'll do a different
video on them.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.279
DR. JAMES GRIME: I don't
know if that was

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.420
an interesting fact.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.010
-Yeah.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.940
DR. JAMES GRIME: Oh, but you'll
like a prime, won't

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.420
you?

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.380
-Oh, a prime pandigital.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.790
DR. JAMES GRIME: You want a
prime pandigital number.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.560
I thought you'd like that.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.050
So it's 10,123,457,689.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.910
That's one of the looser
definitions of pandigital--

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.370
cause you can see I've used
the one twice there--

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.870
definition.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.470
But that's a prime
number as well.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.080
So how many pandigital
numbers are there?

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.370
If we get really strict first of
all, so we use every digit

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.290
once and once only, then, it's
just rearranging the first,

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.006
well, these numbers here
from one to nine.

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:58.640
I'll not include zero to start
with cause that's going to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.960
make things a bit
more difficult.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.620
The number of ways you can
rearrange the numbers from one

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.430
to nine to make a pandigital
number is

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.780
going to be nine factorial.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.950
Nine factorial, which
is 362,880.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.780
And I reckon if we're allowed
to have zero, as well, then,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.400
it could go anywhere except
the first place.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.750
So with zero, it's going
to be 9 times

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.100
9 factorial, 3,265,920.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.070
-This is obviously purely
a recreational thing.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.170
DR. JAMES GRIME: That's
a recreational thing.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.120
And I know some people don't
like it when we're doing

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.250
things that are base
10 centric.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.350
And this is a base 10 centric
little fun thing to do.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.470
If we try base 2, which
only allows us to

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.110
use ones and zeroes.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.520
Well, then, all numbers are
going to be pandigital in that

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.720
case, except for numbers
that are one less

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.380
than a power of two.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.430
Cause in base 2 those
are 1111111.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.940
So those are the only ones that
wouldn't be pandigital.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.100
BRADY HARAN: So here we go.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.890
I'm going to be calling this
number for our viewer, Lara,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.640
who is in the Netherlands with
a pandigital number.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.930
And if you don't include the
area code it's a brilliant

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.140
pandigital number, very pure.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.220
Every digit just once.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.640
Shall we give it a go?

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.500
I have no idea what's going
to happen here.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.690
[PHONE RINGS]

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.690
LARA: Hello, it's Lara.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.940
BRADY HARAN: Hello,
is that Lara?

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.450
LARA: Hi, yes, it is.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.110
BRADY HARAN: Lara, it's
Brady Haran, here.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.860
LARA: Hi, I'm doing good.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.620
BRADY HARAN: How
are you doing?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.275
LARA: I'm just going into the
other room because I can't

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:44.820
hear you very well.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.590
Hang on.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.500
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.597
LARA: All right.

00:06:48.597 --> 00:06:50.840
I should be able to
hear you now.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.640
BRADY HARAN: So I have to say
this is the first time I've

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.270
ever phoned a pandigital
phone number.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.680
LARA: Really?

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.740
BRADY HARAN: Oh, I think so.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.490
I don't know.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.650
It's the first time I've
done it knowingly.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.250
LARA: I'm always telling people
when I give them my

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.010
phone number, I go, look
it has all the numbers.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.810
How cool is that?

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.380
And nobody ever thinks
it's cool, but I do.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.270
BRADY HARAN: Oh, well, I
think it's very cool.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.330
And I think a lot of the people
who watch our video

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.176
will think it's very cool.

00:07:17.176 --> 00:07:18.042
LARA: I hope so.

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:18.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.460
BRADY HARAN: What do you-- tell
us about you, though.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.660
What do you do and stuff?

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.821
LARA: I'm a student.

00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:24.180
I study psychology.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.090
BRADY HARAN: Psychology
student.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.740
LARA: Yeah.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.250
BRADY HARAN: What are you doing

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.760
watching Numberphile videos?

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.820
LARA: I really like maths
but I'm very bad at it.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.907
So Numberphile is sort
of a comfortable in

00:07:35.907 --> 00:07:37.500
between spot for me.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.090
BRADY HARAN: Well, we're
obviously not going to tell

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.460
anyone your phone number, but
thank you for sharing the

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.335
glory of your pandigital
phone number with us.

00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:45.225
LARA: Yeah, it is glorious.

00:07:45.225 --> 00:07:46.115
Isn't it?

00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:49.430
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, thanks so
much for being part of, I

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.670
guess, bit of a silly video.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.580
But, hopefully, when you watch
it you'll learn lots of other

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.886
stuff about pandigital
numbers, too

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:56.940
LARA: Yeah, I'm really looking
forward to it.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.420
BRADY HARAN: Excellent.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.680
Well, you're the star
of the show, now.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.752
So I hope you're looking
forward to it.

00:08:00.752 --> 00:08:02.138
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:02.138 --> 00:08:03.530
BRADY HARAN: Alright.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.210
All the best.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.502
Have a good evening.

00:08:05.502 --> 00:08:06.366
LARA: Yeah, you too.

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:07.230
Bye bye.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.106
BRADY HARAN: Bye.

00:08:08.106 --> 00:08:09.594
[PHONE DISCONNECTS]

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:10.590
BRADY HARAN: There you go.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.655
Pandigital phone number.

00:08:11.655 --> 00:08:12.905
How cool was that?

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.870
A special thanks to
squarespace.com for supporting

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.800
this video.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.960
Squarespace is this all-in-one
platform for designing

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.570
websites and blogs and
online stores.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.880
Why don't you check them out?

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.470
These are some websites that
have been designed using it.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.900
They're pretty slick looking.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.010
Much more impressive than
the Numberphile website.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.030
So go and have a look.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.140
It's free to join up.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.600
And if you decide to use it
and purchase anything from

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.130
them, you can actually get 10%
off by using numberphile5 as

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.260
the voucher code.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.450
I actually contacted them and
asked if we could change it to

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.490
numberphile and then a
pandigital number, but I think

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.680
someone decided that'd probably
be a bit complicated.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.960
So we're going with
numberphile5.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.940
Anyway, enough about that.
squarespace.com.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.830
Free to join up.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.120
If you buy anything, use
the code, numberphile5.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.530
And thanks to them for
supporting us and helping us

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.780
make videos.
