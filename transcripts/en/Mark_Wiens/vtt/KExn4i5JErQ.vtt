00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:00.992
- Hey, everyone.

00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:01.825
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:03.500
I am in Chonburi, Thailand,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.364
about an hour and a
half outside of Bangkok

00:00:05.364 --> 00:00:08.515
in the countryside not far from Pattaya,

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:12.227
and this is a restaurant
that is well known.

00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:14.367
It's actually in the middle of nowhere,

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:17.034
but they are known for serving traditional

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:19.166
and especially jungle Thai food.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.176
I am so thrilled to be here,

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:24.493
about to eat some incredibly
delicious Thai jungle food.

00:00:24.493 --> 00:00:27.076
(reggae music)

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:42.218
Hanging out with my
buddy Joel for this meal,

00:00:42.218 --> 00:00:44.258
and Ying and Micah.

00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:46.776
Micah, you ready to eat some jungle food?

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:48.463
This restaurant is so cool.

00:00:48.463 --> 00:00:50.134
You get off the highway.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:51.552
How long did we drive off the highway?

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:54.271
Like maybe five kilometers at least?

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.963
About five kilometers off the highway,

00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:58.952
and then all of a sudden
you get to this restaurant,

00:00:58.952 --> 00:01:02.285
and this is the exact type of restaurant

00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:06.061
that I just absolutely love.

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.996
Just a clearing in the coconut forest.

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:10.477
I haven't even eaten yet

00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:14.227
and already I'm in love
with this restaurant.

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:34.676
- Chef is giving us a taste.

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:36.509
This is coconut shell.

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:42.928
I have definitely never eaten
a coconut shell on purpose,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.097
other than a coconut shell
shard, but it's soaked in water.

00:01:50.957 --> 00:01:51.790
Wow.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.707
- You can tell how it will be good.

00:02:06.742 --> 00:02:07.575
- Very rare.

00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:10.742
I've never seen it in Thailand before.

00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:16.533
They're just showing us

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:17.986
some of the ingredients they use here.

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:19.653
The pineapple shoot.

00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:34.722
- It just balloons and puffs up.

00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:38.172
That egg just literally
soaked up all of that oil.

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:40.089
What a beautiful thing.

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:46.054
And they're all extremely friendly here.

00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:02.920
- When can you say you're having a dish

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920
made with coconut shell?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.420
(Mark laughs)

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.119
- Fried pork belly with salt.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.922
- Oh, I just got a nose full of chili.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:46.704
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:48.121
That's like tear gas

00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:50.043
from the aromas coming
out of this kitchen.

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:53.161
My nostrils are actually burning.

00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:55.249
I haven't even eaten the food yet,

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:59.416
and this is already my favorite
restaurant in Thailand.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.946
- Before I start eating, I just wanna say

00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:19.711
a huge thank you to
theskinnybib on Instagram.

00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:22.269
That's where I got this
recommendation from to eat here.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.497
We just watched them cook
all of the different dishes.

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:28.784
That literally increased my adrenaline

00:04:28.784 --> 00:04:30.774
watching them cook those dishes.

00:04:30.774 --> 00:04:33.424
This is an amazing jungle restaurant.

00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:35.503
We ordered up just some dishes

00:04:35.503 --> 00:04:37.318
that I've never tasted in Thailand,

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.429
some unique dishes,
some unique ingredients,

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:41.497
the passion that's oozing
from this restaurant,

00:04:41.497 --> 00:04:43.580
is just on another level.

00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:47.738
Joel and I are gonna eat
all these spicy dishes,

00:04:47.738 --> 00:04:51.903
but Micah is gonna have
some really good milk later.

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.198
Starting off with this dish
that's right in front of me.

00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:56.217
It's called moo-pa-choot-za-por-ote.

00:04:56.217 --> 00:04:58.498
And this is a jungle pig, a wild boar,

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:00.400
then with a very interesting ingredient,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.773
which is pineapple shoots.

00:05:02.773 --> 00:05:05.279
And then he stir fried this up
with a bunch of curry paste.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.034
There is some holy basil in here.

00:05:07.034 --> 00:05:08.522
There are green peppercorns.

00:05:08.522 --> 00:05:09.789
And you can see the little white pieces.

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.955
Those are the shoots of the pineapple.

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:16.509
And the curry paste is
just thick on the meat.

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.092
(reggae music)

00:05:26.282 --> 00:05:28.425
That's my first bite, and it's a winner.

00:05:28.425 --> 00:05:30.675
The meat is slightly tough,

00:05:31.704 --> 00:05:33.798
but like you want wild boar to be

00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:36.028
You can really taste the green chilis.

00:05:36.028 --> 00:05:37.913
It's spicy, oh yeah.

00:05:37.913 --> 00:05:38.746
- [Joel] For sure.

00:05:38.746 --> 00:05:40.470
- That gives you a nice burn.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.137
And then those pineapple shoots,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.783
they're softer than bamboo shoots.

00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:49.719
They're really, really silky crisp.

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.269
It almost has a green curry
flavor from that paste,

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.238
but in a 10 times kind of way.

00:05:55.238 --> 00:05:56.529
This is something I've never eaten,

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.210
and it's called geng-moo-ga-la.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.226
This is what the chef
gave us a taste test of,

00:06:02.226 --> 00:06:05.269
the coconut shell, which has
been sliced into thin strips.

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:07.686
And it's young coconut shell.

00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:13.531
Oh, that is insane!

00:06:16.702 --> 00:06:17.535
Oh, wow.

00:06:18.798 --> 00:06:20.411
That texture.

00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:22.661
The crunchiness is amazing.

00:06:23.522 --> 00:06:26.518
That's unbelievable, partly
due to that ingredient,

00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:29.748
the coconut shell, but
then also partly due to

00:06:29.748 --> 00:06:32.287
the flavor combination
that they've created.

00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:33.405
Oh.

00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:34.538
I think Micah wants some.

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:38.391
Next up, this dish is
called moo-ba-pa-la-kum.

00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.058
Similar to a salad or a mixture,

00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:43.730
but it's a type of Thai dish.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.438
This one is made with,
yeah, the wild boar.

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:47.794
Then there's chilis in here.

00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:48.983
Look at that piece of wild boar.

00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:52.015
Look at that skin, that all naturale.

00:06:52.015 --> 00:06:54.307
Rakam, it's like a type of snake fruit.

00:06:54.307 --> 00:06:57.514
There's two different main
types, salak and rakam.

00:06:57.514 --> 00:06:59.014
Rakam is the fatter one.

00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:01.472
It's like a sour snake fruit.

00:07:01.472 --> 00:07:03.294
- [Joel] Dude, smell that, too.

00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:06.711
- It's a little bit of a fermenty flavor.

00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:10.267
Oh, that goes up my nose.

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:11.542
Oh, that is stunning.

00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:12.556
That rakam does have

00:07:12.556 --> 00:07:16.662
a little bit of a fermented taste to it,

00:07:16.662 --> 00:07:18.554
a little bit of a rotting fruit taste,

00:07:18.554 --> 00:07:20.158
and it is wonderful.

00:07:20.158 --> 00:07:23.741
Here's the seed of the
fruit, of the rakam.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.633
It's so sour.

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:30.265
And then you can't eat the seed.

00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:33.735
It's a hard seed, but
you can just suck off

00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:36.430
all of that meaty fiber.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.263
It's so sour and almost
like fuzzy in texture.

00:07:41.675 --> 00:07:44.760
What a stroke of genius
to mix that with wild boar

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.970
and lots of chilis.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.041
And this dish right here is
called mut-don bai chamuang.

00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:51.950
And this is squid with squid ink,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.093
so that's why it's so black.

00:07:53.093 --> 00:07:55.645
And then a type of leafy herb.

00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:56.478
Do you know what it is?

00:07:56.478 --> 00:07:57.311
- [Joel] I've never (mumbles)

00:07:57.311 --> 00:07:59.968
- Yeah, I've never had
bai chamuang before.

00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:01.459
But it looks like they've shredded it up,

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:04.792
chopped it up, and also looks delicious.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.223
Oh, that has a really
immediate sweetness to it,

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.796
sweet and sourness to it.

00:08:11.796 --> 00:08:13.262
And I'm not sure if that
sourness and sweetness

00:08:13.262 --> 00:08:15.737
is maybe coming a lot from that leaf,

00:08:15.737 --> 00:08:16.570
because that leaf has a--

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.403
- It is sour.

00:08:17.403 --> 00:08:18.905
Just taste a bit of the leaf, yeah.

00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:20.766
Bai chamuang.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:21.974
- Whoa.
- Oh, okay.

00:08:21.974 --> 00:08:23.189
- The leaf is very sour.

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:25.488
- This soup is awesome.

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:27.252
- This is a traditional version

00:08:27.252 --> 00:08:29.669
of the fried Thai fish cakes.

00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:33.137
Wow.

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.452
The balance of flavor.

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:38.143
- Sweet, and then the delicious fattiness

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.222
comes through after.

00:08:39.222 --> 00:08:42.151
- They made sure to tell us
that it's 100 percent fish.

00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:44.984
That tastes like a rearranged fish.

00:08:44.984 --> 00:08:47.006
This one is kaeng kelux pla duk.

00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:50.294
It actually translates to
salt curry, and with catfish.

00:08:50.294 --> 00:08:51.720
And this is one of their signature dishes.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.539
We also saw him making this.

00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:55.684
It's just, yeah, a ton of curry paste.

00:08:55.684 --> 00:08:58.222
There's coconut milk in there.

00:08:58.222 --> 00:09:00.226
And it just looks like a flavor overload.

00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:02.987
My excitement for food is at
an all time high right now.

00:09:02.987 --> 00:09:06.820
- (mumbles) the wild catfish.

00:09:10.164 --> 00:09:11.742
- Oh, that's insane.

00:09:11.742 --> 00:09:14.361
It's so smooth and so jungly.

00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:15.979
It's so jungly tasting.

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:17.963
So not only do you feel like

00:09:17.963 --> 00:09:20.300
you're sitting in the jungle
eating here, which you are,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.804
but the herbs are just
packed into the food here.

00:09:22.804 --> 00:09:26.019
We're gonna be weeping tears
of joy here pretty soon

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:29.480
One of the funniest
dishes is their omelet.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.517
In Thai, and actually on the menu,

00:09:31.517 --> 00:09:34.482
it says ky-gee-oh al-oy thi-sud ni lo,

00:09:34.482 --> 00:09:36.265
and that literally translates to,

00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:38.794
"The best omelet in the world."

00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:40.694
There are some interesting
ingredients in here.

00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:41.700
There's salted egg.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.725
There's thousand year old egg.

00:09:43.725 --> 00:09:47.251
There's about a half a bottle
of oil within this egg.

00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:48.997
Let's look at that cross section.

00:09:48.997 --> 00:09:50.949
This is a pretty sizeable bite,

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:52.687
but I really wanna get the full experience

00:09:52.687 --> 00:09:56.770
of the best omelet in the
world in my first bite.

00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:04.338
It just juices in your mouth.

00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:10.176
- The most multi-textured
omelet that's just egg ever.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:12.290
(Mark laughs)

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.767
- It's salty.

00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:17.957
It definitely is like
a sponge full of oil.

00:10:17.957 --> 00:10:20.063
One thing you can definitely say for sure

00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:24.494
is that it will ruin you
for all other forms of eggs.

00:10:24.494 --> 00:10:25.814
- Okay, I could agree.

00:10:25.814 --> 00:10:28.723
- It's so good and so oily.

00:10:28.723 --> 00:10:30.013
It's like the type of omelet

00:10:30.013 --> 00:10:32.064
that you want to eat at three a.m.

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.323
I'm not gonna argue with
him about this omelet.

00:10:34.323 --> 00:10:38.468
It's undoubtedly among the
world's greatest of all omelets.

00:10:38.468 --> 00:10:41.695
It's like a warm blanket of egg.

00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:43.233
So for Thai omelets,
it's very common to use

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:46.028
something called sauce pik, which is,

00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:48.257
it's made from chilis but
it's sort of ketchupy.

00:10:48.257 --> 00:10:49.825
I will be one to admit that it tastes

00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:53.658
incredibly good somehow
with the salty omelet.

00:10:57.254 --> 00:11:00.158
That is an omelet that
will change your life.

00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:01.002
- Dude, you said it right.

00:11:01.002 --> 00:11:03.464
At midnight, I would want
nothing more than that.

00:11:03.464 --> 00:11:04.297
- Oh, wow.

00:11:05.672 --> 00:11:08.964
- To go to sleep with
this in your stomach, mm.

00:11:08.964 --> 00:11:09.797
- Yes.

00:11:18.174 --> 00:11:20.210
- I'm experiencing some deja vu.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.326
I think we were standing in
the same place before we ate.

00:11:23.326 --> 00:11:25.079
Now we're ordering again.

00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:26.277
One thing that I forgot to order

00:11:26.277 --> 00:11:28.293
that I wanted to order here is the,

00:11:28.293 --> 00:11:31.045
this is some type of
jungle yellow eggplant.

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:33.559
So he has just recommended a dish

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:34.990
that he's gonna cook with it for us.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.044
- We've been here for two hours,

00:11:36.044 --> 00:11:38.931
and we've just ordered another
round of five more dishes.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:40.936
We've already been here two hours.

00:11:40.936 --> 00:11:42.705
- [Mark] I could not resist.

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:43.796
This is the type of restaurant

00:11:43.796 --> 00:11:45.941
that you just wanna hang out all day long.

00:11:45.941 --> 00:11:47.449
- [Joel] They're so friendly.

00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:48.411
- They're so friendly.

00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:50.744
The breeze under this place.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.558
I'm in love.

00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:53.790
I'm actually in love.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.373
(reggae music)

00:11:58.908 --> 00:12:03.270
That first round of dishes
was so life changingly good

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.236
that we had to order more food.

00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:08.935
And I don't even know if
it's possible to stop eating.

00:12:08.935 --> 00:12:10.696
Ying says we should start
with the soup while it's hot.

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.771
This is gai-bon-dome-bru-kom.

00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:15.457
And it is free range chicken

00:12:15.457 --> 00:12:17.791
which is then boiled with that same fruit.

00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:21.958
I guess I'll just go in for
a seed in some of the broth.

00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:27.286
Oh, that's sour.

00:12:30.174 --> 00:12:31.091
Whoa, whoa.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:34.757
That goes down your body with sourness.

00:12:34.757 --> 00:12:37.271
Oh, it's so sour it's making
my teeth hurt immediately,

00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:41.688
like immediately, in front
of those green chilis.

00:12:41.688 --> 00:12:43.758
You know how sour a lime is?

00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:45.992
Take that and double the sourness

00:12:45.992 --> 00:12:48.517
and you have the sourness of that.

00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:50.291
But it's also sour in a
little bit of a different way.

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.788
It's not a citrusy sour.

00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:53.732
It's almost like a vinegar sour.

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.467
Okay, next up, we're gonna
try the pla duk pik-sote.

00:12:56.467 --> 00:12:58.755
They fried the catfish, slices of catfish.

00:12:58.755 --> 00:13:00.533
And again, it's wild catfish.

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:02.773
And then they stir fried it with,

00:13:02.773 --> 00:13:04.704
actually, if you were to
just look at this dish,

00:13:04.704 --> 00:13:07.427
you might think it's stir
fried with green beans.

00:13:07.427 --> 00:13:09.474
But since I saw them
making the entire dish,

00:13:09.474 --> 00:13:12.017
I can assure you, there are
no green beans in there.

00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:14.683
That's just all straight
up chilis and garlic.

00:13:14.683 --> 00:13:16.476
And it looks stunning.

00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:19.059
(reggae music)

00:13:20.989 --> 00:13:24.008
Oh, that is an eruption of chili flavor.

00:13:24.008 --> 00:13:27.478
That literally takes like
you're eating a bush of chilis.

00:13:27.478 --> 00:13:29.972
Next up, we got a plate of gai-koor-glur.

00:13:29.972 --> 00:13:32.449
Koor is like dry fried, but
I think this is deep fried.

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:33.684
Is that the butt?

00:13:33.684 --> 00:13:36.101
Oh, I think I'll go for that.

00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:39.272
One bite of a chicken butt.

00:13:39.272 --> 00:13:41.206
That is just simple fried chicken,

00:13:41.206 --> 00:13:43.488
just deep fried with salt,

00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:46.071
but it could literally be among

00:13:47.443 --> 00:13:49.674
the fried chicken hall of fame.

00:13:49.674 --> 00:13:50.918
It's so good.

00:13:50.918 --> 00:13:52.100
I think the reason is probably because

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.269
they're using local, free range chickens.

00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:56.238
I did see some chickens
running around back there.

00:13:56.238 --> 00:13:58.747
Those are probably the chickens
that this is made from.

00:13:58.747 --> 00:14:00.760
Just the way they've just
sprinkled it with salt.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.690
It's an absolutely beautiful thing.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.779
- And I'm like drooling between bites.

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:09.782
- There's something about,
it's even kind of dry,

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:13.458
but at the same time, it's oily moist

00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:14.804
from the skin and that.

00:14:14.804 --> 00:14:16.783
Oh, the skin, I just got a bite of skin.

00:14:16.783 --> 00:14:20.491
This dish is called
see-kong-moo-ba-ma-koor-lur.

00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:24.400
The ribs of wild boar stir fried
up with lots of curry paste

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.003
and the key ingredient
that I wanted to try

00:14:26.003 --> 00:14:27.682
is the yellow eggplant.

00:14:27.682 --> 00:14:28.640
So you can actually see.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.769
These are actually, is that cartilage?

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:33.484
So you can actually eat that.

00:14:33.484 --> 00:14:35.931
You think so, those little bones?

00:14:35.931 --> 00:14:39.535
But look, yeah, I think there's
actually pieces of the pork

00:14:39.535 --> 00:14:40.811
and then also pieces of cartilage,

00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:44.978
which I think you can just
chew all the way through.

00:14:46.247 --> 00:14:48.530
Okay, maybe you can't chew
through that cartilage, though.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.703
That's a pretty significant
piece of cartilage.

00:14:51.703 --> 00:14:56.007
Kinda has like a fingernail texture to it.

00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:58.182
But oh, that flavor.

00:14:58.182 --> 00:15:00.764
I just got some chili paste
to the back of the throat.

00:15:00.764 --> 00:15:01.996
That's wonderful.

00:15:01.996 --> 00:15:04.681
The yellow eggplant is almost like,

00:15:04.681 --> 00:15:07.454
it almost has a leathery texture to it.

00:15:07.454 --> 00:15:08.287
This has to be one of

00:15:08.287 --> 00:15:10.962
the greatest Thai restaurants of all time.

00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:12.277
The owner has come over,

00:15:12.277 --> 00:15:13.913
and she said we have
to have one more dish.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.449
We gotta try the nk pa.

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:16.282
Yeah.

00:15:33.017 --> 00:15:34.293
- Final dish, Joel?

00:15:34.293 --> 00:15:35.126
- Dessert.

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:35.959
Dessert has arrived.

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:37.217
- Yeah, this is dessert.

00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:40.242
And this looks to be one of
the most spectacular dishes,

00:15:40.242 --> 00:15:41.508
and we know it's gonna be good

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:43.957
because the owners themselves

00:15:43.957 --> 00:15:46.164
said we couldn't leave the
restaurant without trying it.

00:15:46.164 --> 00:15:47.765
It's a version of pun kra pao,

00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:49.936
but like bo-lon traditional version.

00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:53.144
It is made with a type of bird,

00:15:53.144 --> 00:15:55.977
a jungle bird which is
similar to a pheasant.

00:15:55.977 --> 00:15:59.810
I just love that ratio
of minced bird to herb.

00:16:01.484 --> 00:16:03.694
That ratio is insane.

00:16:03.694 --> 00:16:06.787
And they're just whole
green chilis in there.

00:16:06.787 --> 00:16:08.539
There's basil, holy basil,

00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:10.805
which he said is like a jungle holy basil.

00:16:10.805 --> 00:16:12.696
Maybe it's like a wild holy basil.

00:16:12.696 --> 00:16:16.691
There's probably just a head
of garlic within that dish.

00:16:16.691 --> 00:16:18.941
Let's make this bite count.

00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:25.995
Oh, that's a bite you wanna
tuck away in your cheek.

00:16:25.995 --> 00:16:26.904
Oh, they're the type of chilis

00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:29.663
that kind of go up your nose like wasabi.

00:16:29.663 --> 00:16:31.698
Oh, that is insane.

00:16:31.698 --> 00:16:35.215
Oh, you get the crispiness of those bones,

00:16:35.215 --> 00:16:37.548
just chilis folded in there.

00:16:39.006 --> 00:16:41.737
The basil is super strong and peppery.

00:16:41.737 --> 00:16:43.981
Layer upon layer of flavor.

00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:44.814
Ah.

00:16:46.264 --> 00:16:49.780
We have come to the end
of this monumental meal,

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.943
and without exaggerating whatsoever,

00:16:52.943 --> 00:16:54.712
I can safely say that this is

00:16:54.712 --> 00:16:57.285
one of the best Thai
restaurants, Thai meals,

00:16:57.285 --> 00:16:59.254
that I've ever had in my entire life,

00:16:59.254 --> 00:17:02.481
which makes this one
of my personal favorite

00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:05.774
best restaurants maybe that
I've ever eaten at ever.

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:08.929
Everything about this
place is just perfect,

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:12.925
from the food to the owners
and everyone working here,

00:17:12.925 --> 00:17:15.975
and especially this location,
sitting here under the tree.

00:17:15.975 --> 00:17:18.721
I could not be happier here eating a meal.

00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:21.309
And if you're looking for
some seriously spicy food

00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:25.476
that will literally keep on
giving inside your mouth.

00:17:26.456 --> 00:17:29.468
I can still taste all the
flavors in my mouth right now.

00:17:29.468 --> 00:17:32.280
This is a restaurant you're gonna want to

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.961
make a pilgrimage to.

00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:35.989
This is the type of restaurant
that you should just

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:40.023
fly from anywhere in the
world straight into Bangkok,

00:17:40.023 --> 00:17:42.285
and it's about an hour and
a half drive from Bangkok,

00:17:42.285 --> 00:17:44.471
drive straight here, and eat,

00:17:44.471 --> 00:17:46.451
and then it doesn't really matter

00:17:46.451 --> 00:17:49.543
what else you do after that.

00:17:49.543 --> 00:17:53.482
This was an amazing meal,
an incredible experience.

00:17:53.482 --> 00:17:55.743
I wanna say a huge thank
you for watching this video.

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:57.092
I wanna say a huge thank you

00:17:57.092 --> 00:17:58.482
to the owners of this restaurant.

00:17:58.482 --> 00:17:59.786
Kub-koon-ma-kob.

00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:01.923
This is the type of restaurant
you just wanna take a nap

00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:04.673
and then order again, and repeat.

00:18:05.675 --> 00:18:08.675
- Kub-koon-ma-kob.
- Kub-koon-ma-kob.

00:18:18.034 --> 00:18:20.222
- Thank you very much
for watching this video,

00:18:20.222 --> 00:18:21.772
and please remember to give this video

00:18:21.772 --> 00:18:23.273
a thumb's up if you enjoyed it.

00:18:23.273 --> 00:18:25.735
I'd love to hear from you in
the comments section below.

00:18:25.735 --> 00:18:29.197
And I will see you on the next video.

00:18:29.197 --> 00:18:30.919
Goodbye from Chonburi

00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:34.624
and one of the best Thai
restaurants in the entire world.
