Hello, and
welcome to your orientation for

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.820
the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.600
In the next few videos,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.200
we're going to make sure you have
all of the information and tools you

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.710
need to get started working on your
nanodegree and focus on your learning.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.420
&gt;&gt; It's super important that you go
through this orientation from the very

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.360
beginning to the very end.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.320
We'll talk about everything from how
the program is structured, to what

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.260
we're expecting from you, to the support
you will get throughout the program.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.190
So let's get started.
