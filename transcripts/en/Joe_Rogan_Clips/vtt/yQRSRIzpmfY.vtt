Well,
the Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.380
<v 1>well,
it's also that they're doing it publicly,
so they're doing it most,
I mean,</v>

3
00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:06.880
if you're,

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.130
you either reading comments or you're reading articles and if you're reading

5
00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:13.070
articles,
they're just looking for something to be upset about that watch you.

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.830
And they'll say,
okay,
is this a viable target?
Yes,

7
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.460
we got confirmation what he said about changing diapers or his wife being a

8
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.550
better parent is a viable target.
Let's go after him.

9
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.200
And then they just formulate some bullshit argument about who you really are

10
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.070
based on what might've been a throw away or a concession to your wife or even

11
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.060
just a compliment to your wife or being self deprecating to yourself.
Yeah,

12
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.970
but it doesn't,
people don't,
they're not looking at things rationally.

13
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.480
They're just looking at targets.
It's particularly people that write articles.

14
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.330
You know,
what's the best article?
It's got gotta be negative.

15
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.980
Like one of the things that came out of all this a Facebook algorithm stuff is

16
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:53.981
you find out that Facebook realize somewhere early on that the way to encourage

17
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:56.900
engagement is to get people upset.

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.360
They get way more engaged and they go back and forth and inter interact with

19
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:07.520
these posts way more if they're upset than they do.
If they agree with it.

20
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:09.860
If they agree with it,
they might give it a like or a thumbs up and say,
hey,

21
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.480
that's great and that's it.
That's where it ends.

22
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.170
But if you know someone's talking about,
you know,
we shouldn't build the wall,

23
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:18.570
we should let everyone in.
And you put that on some fucking Trump guys page.
They

24
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.930
<v 0>ah,
it's crazy.
I mean you will get thousands and thousands,
thousands</v>

25
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.580
<v 1>of interactions.
And so Facebook realized that the way to keep people,</v>

26
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.840
and you know,
they could claim that,

27
00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:32.500
that it's an algorithm and the algorithm just supports whatever the people are

28
00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:35.710
really interested in.
But what they're interested in this conflict

29
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.370
<v 0>that demonstrates my earlier point,
which I made up on the spot.
Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.090
Ai is not a neutral thing is resourced from human perspectives.

31
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.260
And cause that is a type of AI not as complex as right now what we're going to

32
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:52.100
experience,
and I can't even imagine,
but what I'm saying is,
is it still die?

33
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.630
What I want to say.
Resourced from a human from a human perspective.
And yes,

34
00:01:56.631 --> 00:02:01.631
of course we are evolved to respond more strongly to negativity than positivity

35
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:02.961
for loads of reasons.

36
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:07.010
And I think that's where we can stitch back to what we were saying about taking

37
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:10.100
personal responsibility for who you are.
Like that.

38
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.340
None of us after sit on social media guy fuck you.

39
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.850
Fuck you you but none of us have to do that.
We can try and resolve though.

40
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.370
I respect that some people don't have any other outlets.

41
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.120
They don't have the privileges I have of being out go to support groups where

42
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:26.270
people openly talk about this is the ways that I felt inferior today.

43
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.050
This is the ways that I'm trying to become a better man and a better father and

44
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:31.400
a back coworker.
You know,

45
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.160
like a lot of people aren't afforded those environments and probably the best

46
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:37.490
shot they got is having a go out with someone online.
And those people,

47
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.620
you know in a way deserve love and sympathy.

48
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:44.621
But until we on some level recognize that we can all are our own behaviors,

49
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.150
we can all are our own consciousness.
All right.

50
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.030
I don't see how there's going to be,

51
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.430
well at least then we can create a terrain upon which a better,

52
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.310
better systems can start to flourish.
Do you read comments?
No,

53
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.960
I actually like,
I'm too sensitive.

54
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.070
I can just about manage to listen to people's replies to like conversation like,

55
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.940
you know,
like sort of like,
yeah,
I don't go on to like,
I have a,

56
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.390
like I've work with someone who does my social media and like she,

57
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.510
she gives me stuff like here I'll respond to these things,
puts them out,

58
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.990
put on that because I don't,
uh,
I don't want to engage with that.

59
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.200
I don't want to like walk up and down any street knocking on the door.
Guy,

60
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:25.600
do you like me?
Do you like me?
You like me?

61
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.420
I don't want to deal with people's responses and various conditions.

62
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.410
<v 1>Well,
it's also much like the articles,</v>

63
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.620
the way people get a response out of you or the way that people to get your

64
00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:37.670
reaction is to say something really negative.
You know,
you look at some,

65
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.420
sometimes when people are not that savvy when it comes to social media.

66
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:44.390
One of the things that,
one of the things that you'll notice is they'll interact,

67
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.480
and I've been guilty of this in the past before I sort of realized what I was

68
00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:48.050
doing.

69
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.040
You would only respond to negative things like people were arguing with people.

70
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.040
Meanwhile people are saying nice things to you and you ignore them.
Yeah,

71
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.920
it's cause you don't,
you don't,
you at a certain level,

72
00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:01.730
you don't have the physical time.
It doesn't exist to respond to everyone.

73
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.840
It's not possible.

74
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.880
If you get 13,000 comments on one of your posts,

75
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.680
how the fuck does anyone have time to respond to 13,000 people?

76
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.513
You can't.

77
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.450
And then you have email and you have Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and
just,

78
00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:20.090
there's no way.
There's not enough time in this world.

79
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.140
So you would potentially would have responded to things that cause the more

80
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.020
visceral,
I saw someone saying something that was untrue.
I'm like,
fuck you,

81
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:30.410
that's untrue.
But then I realize like,
what are you,
why are you doing?

82
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.050
Like this is a new thing for people.

83
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:37.280
There's never been a time where people have had this instantaneous interaction

84
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:42.230
with people unfiltered on moderated globally.

85
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.310
Yeah.
It's very strange to,

86
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.370
to be able to do that and to be able to go back and forth and just,

87
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.560
just to be able to give your comments on things,
to be able to talk about things.

88
00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:55.480
And it's very addictive to people.
Yeah,
that's right.
And that's why I'm very

89
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.230
<v 0>cautious with it.
I have to sort of set my life out.
Like I'm essentially a monk</v>

90
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.340
<v 1>in a marriage that's basically our ugly.
Get up,
meditate,</v>

91
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.360
do yoga,
do exercises,
do things that are positive for you.

92
00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:09.860
Watch the way that you're thinking.
