00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My answer is it actually overshoots.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The problem is no matter how small this constant is over here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It will eventually turns its wheels quite a bit towards it's trajectory.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then it'll move towards a trajectory more and more,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and when it hits it, it's wheels will be straight,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but the robot itself will still be oriented a little bit downwards, so it's forced to overshoot.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What this means is that applied to a car, a P-controller will act like this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It'll slightly overshoot, and that could be okay. The overshooting is very small.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But it'll never really converge.

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It'll be what's called "marginally stable" or often just "stable" in the literature.
