Hi, and welcome to the set of "The Monkeys

Gabriel Crouse:
in the Lewis Center for the Arts. I am Gabriel Crouse, and I
will be directing this unique piece of theater for my senior thesis.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.560 position:72%
Gabriel Crouse:
OK, Catherine, when you guys come in, actually
by going from extreme cold to warmth, it is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.600
Gabriel Crouse:
an uncomfortable experience.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600
Catherine Cohen:
OK.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.949 position:73%
Gabriel Crouse:
In the same way, I think going from the strange
world outside of "snow storm" into "safe room"

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.000 position:98%
Gabriel Crouse:
is an uncomfortable experience, because although
this room is safe, it is very odd -- it is difficult to understand.

Jeffrey Kuperman:
Here's something for your meat pies.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:54.000
Crowd:
[scream] Wow, did you see that?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.449
Jeffrey Kuperman:
And go get 'em.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000

Ah!

A young Russian firebrand named Lev Lunts
wrote this play in 1920. Because of Soviet

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.950 position:70%
Gabriel Crouse:
oppression, it never got put on stage, so
I'm incredibly excited to be bringing it into

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.220 position:75%
Gabriel Crouse:
a theater for the very first time and channeling
the youthful, hectic and ambitious energy

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Gabriel Crouse:
that he infused in this piece.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.820 position:70%
Gabriel Crouse:
One of my favorite things about this play
is that Lunts will take a character and plonk

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.340 position:70%
Gabriel Crouse:
him on the stage and then give him absolutely
nothing to say or do for 20 minutes.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.650 position:75%
Gabriel Crouse:
That leaves an incredible space for the actor to
innovate and discover what that character

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.670 position:75%
Gabriel Crouse:
should be saying, who they should be saying
it to, and why they're doing what they're doing.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.380 position:67%
Gabriel Crouse:
Watching each actor individually trace out
their personal journeys has been one of the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.400 position:72%
Gabriel Crouse:
most fruitful parts of the rehearsal process
and continues to be one of the most delightful

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.009 position:58%
Gabriel Crouse:
experiences I've ever had in theater.

Jeffrey Kuperman:
Ladies and gentlemen, I am a Shoot. I'm a
very good Shoot, don't you think?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:13.530 position:70%

Come check out this play. It's hilarious,
it's horrifying and sometimes just plain odd.
