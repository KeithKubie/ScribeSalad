â™ª [upbeat music plays]

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:05.292
Anthony Romano: So Eureka Streams.

00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:08.958
It's built on GWT on the front end,
Java on the back end.

00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:11.500
And what it does is it,
similar to Twitter and Facebook,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.958
it provides social networking tools,
but for an internal company.

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.000
Everything's kept on their internal LAN.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.458
Companies can download it and use it
and communicate across teams,

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:25.000
special interest groups,
ethics, Go Green initiatives.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.542
Executives can use it to give
accolades or give kudos.

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:31.458
We have some executives
who have thousands,

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:34.583
a couple thousand followers
in the system.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:37.083
So right now, we get about
10,000 people a day,

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:41.167
unique people a day using
this system, 45, 000 page views.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.458
So, it gets a lot of use.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:44.292
Five hundred groups.

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:46.750
These range from, as I mentioned,
special interest groups.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.625
We have product groups.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.083
We have functional management groups.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:52.250
We have support groups.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.042
We've actually shut down
multiple help desk centers

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:57.917
to be replaced by support streams 

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.750
that can be manned by one person
instead of three people.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.250
Rob Keane: We decided
to use Google Web Toolkit

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.625
because on a couple of
past projects for our team,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:08.042
we had had some trouble maintaining
large code bases of JavaScript.

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:12.625
And we knew that we wanted to code
the back end of the project in Java.

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.667
So, Google Web Toolkit
was kind of a natural choice

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.792
because it allowed us to use Java
on both the front end and the back end

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:22.958
and gave us a lot of the advantages
that would be really hard to hand code.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.250
Like, the GWT compiler does
a lot of the optimization for you.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.375
You don't really need to worry
about that nearly as much as you do

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:30.625
when you're writing your own JavaScript.

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:33.708
Anthony Romano: GWT gets us a lot
of things for free--history management,

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:35.750
we have eventing, handlers.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.292
All of these things we have for free now

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:40.750
that the developers doesn't have to
reinvent the wheel with JavaScript

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.500
and try to manage the history themselves

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.000
or download a dozen JavaScript libraries

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.875
to get what GWT gets us
for free out of the box.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.000
Rob Keane: For Eureka Streams,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.375
next we're basically gonna
be focusing on mobile.

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.625
We're gonna be developing
some native apps

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:55.917
in addition to first class email support.

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:58.000
Anthony Romano: We have several
success stories on Eureka

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.458
where individuals from different teams
collaborated, came together,

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:02.542
solved problems, 

00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:06.542
saved probably thousands and thousands
of dollars of the company's time

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:10.125
by coming together and
they never would have met before.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.875
And so, if we demonstrate this,
if we go to executives and say,

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:16.000
"This is why transparency is good,
because it allows teams,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.625
people to communicate across these
stove pipe boundaries that you've set up."

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.792
And we can kind of crash
and destroy those barriers

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:24.500
and let people communicate freely.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.583
I think that would be
the path going forward.
