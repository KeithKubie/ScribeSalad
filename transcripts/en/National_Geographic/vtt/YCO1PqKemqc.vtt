00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.963
- The whole purpose of
being on this planet

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:05.588
is to learn more about each
other

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:08.925
and learn more about
the place where we are.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.177
We are curious by nature.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.971
I'm Erica Bergman.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.931
I'm a submarine pilot,

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:17.017
and a National Geographic
Explorer.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.146
Being a submarine pilot,
is my absolute dream job.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:25.942
It is unusual down there, in
such an awe inspiring way.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.778
The ocean is 75% of the planet.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.614
The majority of life on
Earth, is in the ocean.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.578
When National Geographic and
Coors Light approached me

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:40.248
about my My Next, they said
what's on your bucket list.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.042
I went bold.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.501
I was like, I want to go to
space.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.628
They said we can't do that.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.380
I said I still want to go up.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:52.635
I want to see the world
from the opposite direction.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.137
I wanted to come to the jungle.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.972
I wanted to climb into the
canopy.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:59.309
Costa Rica has 10 different
climate zones.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.978
Everything from tropical rain
forests

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.354
to coastal ecosystems.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.651
Curiosity keeps me excited about
life.

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:12.447
Look inside yourself and
find that thirst for more.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.241
Find your next adventure.
