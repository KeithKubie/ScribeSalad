00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.976
In 2015, the leaders of the world
made a big promise.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.736
A promise that over the next 15 years,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.336
the lives of billions of people
are going to get better

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.440
with no one left behind.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.416
That promise is the Sustainable
Development Goals --

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.640
the SDGs.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.296
We're now three years in;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.656
a fifth of the way into the journey.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.376
The clock is ticking.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.936
If we offtrack now,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.200
it's going to get harder and harder
to hit those goals.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.096
So what I want to do for you today
is give you a snapshot

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.856
on where we are today,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.016
some projections on where we're heading

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.600
and some ideas on things
we might need to do differently.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.256
Now, the SDGs are of course
spectacularly complicated.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.736
I would expect nothing less
from the United Nations.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.776
(Laughter)

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.016
How many goals?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.856
Maybe something tried and tested,
like three, seven or 10.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.296
No, let's pick a prime number
higher than 10.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.040
Seventeen goals.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.896
I congratulate those of you
who've memorized them already.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.056
For the rest of us, here they are.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.096
Seventeen goals ranging
from ending poverty

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.496
to inclusive cities

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.336
to sustainable fisheries;

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.800
all a comprehensive plan
for the future of our world.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.440
But sadly, a plan
without the data to measure it.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.090
So how are we going to track progress?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.776
Well, I'm going to use today
the Social Progress Index.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.896
It's a measure of
the quality of life of countries,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.936
ranging from the basic
needs of survival --

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.736
food, water, shelter, safety --

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.016
through to the foundations
of well-being --

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.376
education, information,
health and the environment --

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.976
and opportunity --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
rights, freedom of choice, inclusiveness
and access to higher education.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.736
Now, the Social Progress Index
doesn't look like the SDGs,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.096
but fundamentally,
it's measuring the same concepts,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.696
and the Social Progress Index
has the advantage that we have the data.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.976
We have 51 indicators
drawn from trusted sources

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.440
to measure these concepts.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.056
And also, what we can do
because it's an index,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.976
is add together all those indicators
to give us an aggregate score

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.080
about how we're performing
against the total package of the SDGs.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.576
Now, one caveat.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.456
The Social Progress Index
is a measure of quality of life.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.816
We're not looking at whether
this can be achieved

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.816
within the planet's environmental limits.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.640
You will need other tools to do that.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.680
So how are we doing on the SDGs?

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.616
Well, I'm going to put the SDGs
on a scale of zero to 100.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.056
And zero is the absolute worst score
on each of those 51 indicators:

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.576
absolute social progress, zero.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.696
And then 100 is the minimum standard
required to achieve those SDGs.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.600
A hundred is where
we want to get to by 2030.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.816
So, where did we start on this journey?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.736
Fortunately, not at zero.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.856
In 2015, the world score
against the SDGs was 69.1.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.640
Some way on the way there
but quite a long way to go.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.936
Now let me also emphasize
that this world forecast,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.336
which is based on data from 180 countries,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.056
is population weighted.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.536
So China has more weight in than Comoros;

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.440
India has more weight in than Iceland.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.936
But we could unpack this
and see how the countries are doing.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.576
And the country today that is closest
to achieving the SDGs is Denmark.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.200
And the country with the furthest to go
is Central African Republic.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.520
And everyone else is somewhere in between.

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:52.976
So the challenge for the SDGs

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.280
is to try and sweep all these dots
across to the right, to 100 by 2030.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.320
Can we get there?

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.376
Well, with the Social Progress Index,
we've got some time series data.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.696
So we have some idea of the trend
that the countries are on,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.200
on which we can build some projections.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.096
So let's have a look.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.136
Let's start with our
top-performing country, Denmark.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.120
And yes, I'm pleased to say that Denmark
is forecast to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.936
Maybe not surprising, but I'll take a win.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.016
Let's look at some of the other
richer countries of the world --

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.255
the G7.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:32.360
And we find that Germany and Japan
will get there or thereabouts.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:39.496
But Canada, France, the UK and Italy
are all going to fall short.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.256
And the United States?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.520
Quite some way back.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.616
Now, this is sort of worrying news.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.016
But these are the richest
countries in the world,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.856
not the most populous.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.856
So let's take a look now
at the biggest countries in the world,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.216
the ones that will most affect
whether or not we achieve the SDGs.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.656
And here they are --

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.896
countries in the world with a population
of higher than 100 million,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.976
ranging from China to Ethiopia.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.496
Obviously, the US and Japan
would be in that list,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.136
but we've looked at them already.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.376
So here we are.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.936
The biggest countries in the world;
the dealbreakers for the SDGs.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.656
And the country that's going to make
most progress towards the SDGs

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.816
is Mexico.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.856
Mexico is going to get to about 87,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.256
so just shy of where
the US is going to get

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.480
but quite some way off our SDG target.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.936
Russia comes next.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.576
Then China and Indonesia.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.656
Then Brazil -- might've expected
Brazil to do a bit better.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.976
Philippines,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.416
and then a step down to India,
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.720
and then Ethiopia.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.296
So none of these countries
are going to hit the SDGs.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.536
And we can then take these numbers
in all the countries of the world

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.376
to give ourselves a world forecast

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.296
on achieving that total
package of the SDGs.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.976
So remember, in 2015 we started at 69.1.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.376
I'm pleased to say
that over the last three years,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.896
we have made some progress.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.320
In 2018, we've hit 70.5,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.416
and if we project that rate
of progress forward to 2030,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.240
that's going to get us to 75.2,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.120
which is obviously
a long way short of our target.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.280
Indeed, on current trends,
we won't hit the 2030 targets until 2094.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.736
Now, I don't know about you,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.136
but I certainly don't
want to wait that long.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.560
So what can we do about this?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.896
Well, the first thing to do is
we've got to call out the rich countries.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.736
Here are the countries
closest to the SDGs,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.456
with the greatest resources,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.760
and they're falling short.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.336
Maybe they think
that this is like the Old World

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.136
where goals for the UN are just
for poor countries and not for them.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.376
Well, you're wrong.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.496
The SDGs are for every country,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.616
and it's shameful that these wealthy
countries are falling short.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.536
Every country needs a plan
to implement the SDGs

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.456
and deliver them for their citizens.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.536
G7, other rich countries --

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.760
get your act together.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.576
The second thing we can do
is look a bit further into the data

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.696
and see where there are opportunities
to accelerate progress

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.240
or there are negative trends
that we can reverse.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.056
So I'm going to take you into three areas.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.176
One where we're doing quite well,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.456
one where we really should be doing better

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.880
and another where we've got
some real problems.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.016
Let's start with the good news,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.336
and I want to talk about what we call
nutrition and basic medical care.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.816
This covers SDG 2 on no hunger

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.176
and the basic elements of SDG 3 on health,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.616
so maternal and child mortality,
infectious diseases, etc ...

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.816
This is an area where most
of the rich world has hit the SDGs.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.376
And we also find,
looking at our big countries,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.536
that the most advanced
have got pretty close.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.536
Here are our 11 big countries,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.896
and if you look at the top,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.976
Brazil and Russia
are pretty close to the SDG target.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.256
But at the bottom --

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.576
Ethiopia, Pakistan -- a long way to go.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.376
That's where we are in 2018.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.656
What's our trajectory?

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.336
On the current trajectory,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.776
how far are we going to get by 2030?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.136
Well, let's have a look.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.896
Well, what we see is a lot of progress.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.616
See Bangladesh in the middle.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.696
If Bangladesh maintains
its current rate of progress,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.816
it could get very close
to that SDG target.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.296
And Ethiopia at the bottom
is making a huge amount of progress

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.536
at the moment.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.720
If that can be maintained,
Ethiopia could get a long way.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.136
We add this all up
for all the countries of the world

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.856
and our projection
is a score of 94.5 by 2030.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.096
And if countries like the Philippines,
which have grown more slowly,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.416
could accelerate progress,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.776
then we could get a lot closer.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.760
So there are reasons to be optimistic
about SDGs 2 and 3.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.856
But there's another very basic area
of the SDGs where we're doing less well,

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.880
which is SDG 6, on water and sanitation.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.296
Again, it's an SDG
where most of the rich countries

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.256
have already achieved the targets.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.976
And again, for our big countries --

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.136
our big 11 emerging countries,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.896
we see that some of the countries,
like Russia and Mexico,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.016
are very close to the target,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.720
but Nigeria and other countries
are a very long way back.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.336
So how are we doing on this target?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.536
What progress are we going to make
over the next 12 years

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.520
based on the current direction of travel?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.696
Well, here we go ...

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.496
and yes, there is some progress.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.216
Our top four countries
are all hitting the SDG targets --

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.456
some are moving forward quite quickly.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.856
But it's not enough
to really move us forward significantly.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.136
What we see is that
for the world as a whole,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.576
we're forecasting a score
of around 85, 86 by 2030 --

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.800
not fast enough.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.856
Now, obviously this is not good news,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.136
but I think what this data also shows
is that we could be doing a lot better.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.736
Water and sanitation is a solved problem.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.336
It's about scaling
that solution everywhere.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.256
So if we could accelerate progress
in some of those countries

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.856
who are improving more slowly --

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.536
Nigeria, the Philippines, etc. --

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.640
then we could get
a lot closer to the goal.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.896
Indeed, I think SDG 6
is probably the biggest opportunity

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.400
of all the SDGs for a step change.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.720
So that's an area we could do better.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.616
Let's look finally at an area
where we are struggling,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.416
which is what we call
personal rights and inclusiveness.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.176
This is covering concepts
across a range of SDGs.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.536
SDG 1 on poverty,
SDG 5 on gender equality,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.656
SDG 10 on inequality,

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.016
SDG 11 on inclusive cities

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.696
and SDG 16 on peace and justice.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.536
So across those SDGs there are themes
around rights and inclusiveness,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.016
and those may seem
less immediate or pressing

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.176
than things like hunger and disease,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.240
but rights and inclusion are critical
to an agenda of no one left behind.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.955
So how are we doing on those issues?

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.536
Let's start off with personal rights.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.816
What I'm going to do first
is show you our big countries in 2015.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.056
So here they are,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.976
and I've put the USA and Japan back in,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.176
so it's our 13 biggest
countries in the world.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.016
And we see a wide range of scores.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.976
The United States at the top
with Japan hitting the goals;

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.136
China a long way behind.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.136
So what's been our direction of travel

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.656
on the rights agenda
over the last three years?

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.936
Let's have a look.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.056
Well, what we see is actually pretty ugly.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.976
The majority of the countries
are standing still or moving backwards,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.896
and big countries like Brazil,
India, China, Bangladesh

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.480
have all seen significant declines.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.440
This is worrying.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.416
Let's have a look now at inclusiveness.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.296
And inclusiveness is looking at things

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.056
like violence and discrimination
against minorities,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.216
gender equity, LGBT inclusion, etc...

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.536
And as a result, we see that the scores
for our big countries are generally lower.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.056
Every country, rich and poor
alike, is struggling

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.000
with building an inclusive society.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.416
But what's our direction of travel?

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.536
Are we building more inclusive countries?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.680
Let's have a look -- progress to 2018.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.616
And again we see
the world moving backwards:

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.376
most countries static,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.336
a lot of countries going backwards --

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.136
Bangladesh moving backwards --

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.696
but also, two of the countries
that were leading --

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.336
Brazil and the United States --

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.176
have gone backwards significantly

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.560
over the last three years.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.256
Let's sum this up now
for the world as a whole.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.176
And what we see on personal rights
for the whole world

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.816
is we're forecasting actually
a decline in the score on personal rights

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.256
to about 60,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.520
and then this decline in the score
of inclusiveness to about 42.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.936
Now, obviously these things
can change quite quickly

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.896
with rights and with changes in law,
changes in attitudes,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.216
but we have to accept
that on current trends,

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.120
this is probably the most
worrying aspect of the SDGs.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.016
How I've depressed you ...

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.336
(Laughter)

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.976
I hope not because I think what we do see

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.416
is that progress is happening
in a lot of places

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.536
and there are opportunities
for accelerating progress.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.296
We are living in a world
that is tantalizingly close

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:11.136
to ensuring that no one need die
of hunger or malaria or diarrhea.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.376
If we can focus our efforts,
mobilize resources,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.136
galvanize the political will,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.080
that step change is possible.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.416
But in focusing on those
really basic, solvable SDGs,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.736
we mustn't forget the whole package.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.856
The goals are an unwieldy
set of indicators, goals and targets,

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.416
but they also include
the challenges our world faces.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.936
The fact that the SDGs
are focusing attention

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.976
on the fact that we face a crisis
in personal rights and inclusiveness

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.520
is a positive.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.456
If we forget that,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.496
if we choose to double down
on the SDGs that we can solve,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:54.176
if we go for SDG à la carte
and pick the most easy SDGs,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.576
then we will have missed
the point of the SDGs,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.296
we will miss the goals

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.720
and we will have failed
on the promise of the SDGs.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.816
Thank you.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.480
(Applause)
