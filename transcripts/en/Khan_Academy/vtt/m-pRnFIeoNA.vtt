00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.900
So let's calculate
what 2/5 divided by 7/3

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.880
is, and I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.340
and try to calculate
this on your own.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.720
Well we just have to
remind ourselves that this

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:21.130
is going to be the exact
same thing as 2 over 5 times

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.120
the reciprocal of 7/3,
which is 3 over 7.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.830
And then multiplying
two fractions

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.200
is pretty straightforward.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200
This is just going to
be equal to the product

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.520
of the numerators.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.710
So 2 times 3 over the
product of the denominators,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:54.380
over 5 times 7-- I'm trying to
keep the colors consistent--

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.780
which of course is going
to be equal to 2 times 3

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.210
is equal to 6.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.590
And 5 times 7-- I'll do this
in a new color, let's see,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.320
I haven't used this shade of
blue yet-- 5 times 7 of course

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.250
is equal to 35.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.966
So this is equal to 6/35.
