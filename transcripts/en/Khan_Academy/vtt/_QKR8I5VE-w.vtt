00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.250
We're told that Naomi
lives at 2nd Avenue and 3rd

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.600
Street representing 2,
3 on the graph below.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.080
Her school is it 4th
Avenue and 10th street,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.730
representing 4, 10 on the graph.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.410
She walks over to 4th Avenue
and up to 10th Street.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.970
Plot her home and
school on the map.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.770
How many blocks does
Naomi walk to school?

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.520
So let's plot her home first,
2nd Avenue and 3rd Street,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.180
which they are giving
us the coordinates 2, 3.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.760
So the x-axis right
over here, this

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.820
is representing the avenues.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.150
And then the y-axis,
or the vertical axis,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.290
this represents the street.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.880
So 2, 3.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.870
So this right over here is
2nd Avenue and 3rd Street.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.634
So you see here, we
went to 2nd Avenue

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.050
and then we went
up to 3rd Street.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.383
This is where she lives at home.

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:55.150
We could have also said
3rd Street and 2nd Avenue.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.537
Now her school is a 4th
Avenue and 10th street.

00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:01.870
And now we're going to go,
so if we start at the origin,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.040
we go to 4th Avenue and then
go up 10 to 10th Street.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.150
So this is the coordinate 4, 10.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.860
So this is where our home is.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740
This is where a school is.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.350
They say she walks over to 4th
Avenue and up to 10th Street.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.730
So she walks from 2nd
Avenue to 4th Avenue

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.830
and then up to 10th Street.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.840
How many blocks does
Naomi walk to school?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.220
Well as she walks from
2nd Avenue to 4th Avenue,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.960
she's going to walk 2 blocks.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.780
1 block and 2 blocks.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.500
You shouldn't get confused by
they're actually marking off

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.600
with these lines
every half a block.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.590
So that's 1 block to 3rd
Avenue, 2 blocks to 4th Avenue.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.250
So that's 2 blocks so far.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.982
And then she goes from
3rd Street to 10th Street.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.940
Well, if you go from 3rd
Street to 10th Street,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.730
that's going to
be 7 more blocks.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.830
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.820
So 2 in the horizontal
direction and then 7

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.430
in the vertical direction.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.770
So that's 9 total blocks.
