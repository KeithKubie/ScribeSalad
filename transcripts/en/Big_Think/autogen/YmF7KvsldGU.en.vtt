among other projects and you were doing
 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.430
among other projects and you were doing
lots of stuff you get involved in some

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
lots of stuff you get involved in some
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.930
lots of stuff you get involved in some
very heady questions about the origins

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
very heady questions about the origins
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.419
very heady questions about the origins
of truth on the Internet and this is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
of truth on the Internet and this is
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919
of truth on the Internet and this is
where we're getting folks because the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
where we're getting folks because the
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.230
where we're getting folks because the
the work that Danny is describing now in

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
the work that Danny is describing now in
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.220
the work that Danny is describing now in
theory ultimately became a venture right

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
theory ultimately became a venture right
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.120
theory ultimately became a venture right
metaweb don't so so that's right so what

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
metaweb don't so so that's right so what
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.759
metaweb don't so so that's right so what
I really thought is that what we need to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
I really thought is that what we need to
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.339
I really thought is that what we need to
do is have a way of representing the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
do is have a way of representing the
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.630
do is have a way of representing the
knowledge of the world in a way that

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
knowledge of the world in a way that
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.880
knowledge of the world in a way that
machines can get out them and take

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
machines can get out them and take
 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.060
machines can get out them and take
advantage of it and that that should be

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070
advantage of it and that that should be
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.740
advantage of it and that that should be
shared everybody should be able to get

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
shared everybody should be able to get
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420
shared everybody should be able to get
at it that's in some sense that if the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
at it that's in some sense that if the
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430
at it that's in some sense that if the
nonhuman knowledge isn't a shared

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
nonhuman knowledge isn't a shared
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040
nonhuman knowledge isn't a shared
resource then what is I think what what

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
resource then what is I think what what
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.569
resource then what is I think what what
if civilization been doing all these

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
if civilization been doing all these
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.830
if civilization been doing all these
years so it created a company that built

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
years so it created a company that built
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.619
years so it created a company that built
this database called freebase was free

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
this database called freebase was free
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:08.660
this database called freebase was free
database the and the company basically

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
database the and the company basically
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.820
database the and the company basically
took any kind of public knowledge that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
took any kind of public knowledge that
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.649
took any kind of public knowledge that
we can get information about anything

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
we can get information about anything
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.399
we can get information about anything
and put it in a machine readable format

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409
and put it in a machine readable format
 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.370
and put it in a machine readable format
we were kind of creating it with the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
we were kind of creating it with the
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990
we were kind of creating it with the
idea that this is gonna be useful to the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
idea that this is gonna be useful to the
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370
idea that this is gonna be useful to the
world we didn't really have a business

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
world we didn't really have a business
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.840
world we didn't really have a business
model and we started building it up and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
model and we started building it up and
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999
model and we started building it up and
then it became useful to lots of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
then it became useful to lots of
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.280
then it became useful to lots of
different people including in particular

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
different people including in particular
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.280
different people including in particular
all the search engines so eventually

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
all the search engines so eventually
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.050
all the search engines so eventually
Google bought it of course and then I

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060
Google bought it of course and then I
 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.359
Google bought it of course and then I
got Google to agree to keep it open for

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
got Google to agree to keep it open for
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.830
got Google to agree to keep it open for
three years but they only kept the part

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
three years but they only kept the part
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.960
three years but they only kept the part
that was already open open and they

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
that was already open open and they
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.350
that was already open open and they
started building it up and so now if

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
started building it up and so now if
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.719
started building it up and so now if
there's all the Google has something

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
there's all the Google has something
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.950
there's all the Google has something
called the knowledge graph which is

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
called the knowledge graph which is
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810
called the knowledge graph which is
beyond the evolution of this and it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
beyond the evolution of this and it
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.580
beyond the evolution of this and it
probably has about a hundred billion

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
probably has about a hundred billion
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.999
probably has about a hundred billion
different entities so everybody in this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
different entities so everybody in this
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.969
different entities so everybody in this
room is in that graph the building this

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
room is in that graph the building this
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.280
room is in that graph the building this
building is in that graph yeah I took a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
building is in that graph yeah I took a
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.440
building is in that graph yeah I took a
screenshot or

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450
screenshot or
 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.419
screenshot or
when you're just Google know your house

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429
when you're just Google know your house
 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.979
when you're just Google know your house
and all of these different yeah this

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989
and all of these different yeah this
 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.270
and all of these different yeah this
event is and yeah so so anything like a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280
event is and yeah so so anything like a
 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.670
event is and yeah so so anything like a
person a place in the vend anything like

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
person a place in the vend anything like
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.949
person a place in the vend anything like
that is in this huge knowledge base and

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959
that is in this huge knowledge base and
 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.260
that is in this huge knowledge base and
they're all the relationships between

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270
they're all the relationships between
 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.290
they're all the relationships between
them are so when you for instance print

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300
them are so when you for instance print
 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.800
them are so when you for instance print
out a Google Mail that is rendered from

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810
out a Google Mail that is rendered from
 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.270
out a Google Mail that is rendered from
the knowledge graph so the knowledge

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280
the knowledge graph so the knowledge
 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.610
the knowledge graph so the knowledge
graph knows the bus schedules and it

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620
graph knows the bus schedules and it
 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.490
graph knows the bus schedules and it
knows you know the address the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500
knows you know the address the
 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.650
knows you know the address the
restaurant and the traffic slowing all

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660
restaurant and the traffic slowing all
 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.360
restaurant and the traffic slowing all
this information together around the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
this information together around the
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520
this information together around the
thing that these searcher cares about

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530
thing that these searcher cares about
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.350
thing that these searcher cares about
that's right so the map is just in some

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360
that's right so the map is just in some
 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.509
that's right so the map is just in some
sense a custom rendering of a piece of

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519
sense a custom rendering of a piece of
 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.640
sense a custom rendering of a piece of
the knowledge graph for your particular

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650
the knowledge graph for your particular
 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.670
the knowledge graph for your particular
purpose yeah and also by the way I don't

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
purpose yeah and also by the way I don't
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.770
purpose yeah and also by the way I don't
know the this doesn't have any ads on it

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780
know the this doesn't have any ads on it
 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.740
know the this doesn't have any ads on it
but the other thing is that the ads are

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750
but the other thing is that the ads are
 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.470
but the other thing is that the ads are
also a lot a lot of knowledge graph

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480
also a lot a lot of knowledge graph
 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.780
also a lot a lot of knowledge graph
about what the products are about and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790
about what the products are about and
 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.870
about what the products are about and
you know whether you know it probably

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880
you know whether you know it probably
 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.830
you know whether you know it probably
has knowledge about you specifically and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840
has knowledge about you specifically and
 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.930
has knowledge about you specifically and
so on so it's going to be way beyond the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940
so on so it's going to be way beyond the
 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.870
so on so it's going to be way beyond the
kind of public knowledge it's also

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880
kind of public knowledge it's also
 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.590
kind of public knowledge it's also
beginning to probably have very

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600
beginning to probably have very
 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.479
beginning to probably have very
particular private knowledge about

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489
particular private knowledge about
 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.460
particular private knowledge about

yeah so that it still does the old kind

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600
yeah so that it still does the old kind

yeah so that it still does the old kind
of search so right now when you let's

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519
of search so right now when you let's

of search so right now when you let's
say I put in museums of New York yeah

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400
say I put in museums of New York yeah
 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.910
say I put in museums of New York yeah
museums in New York well it still does

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920
museums in New York well it still does
 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.059
museums in New York well it still does
the old keyword search of searching for

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069
the old keyword search of searching for
 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.890
the old keyword search of searching for
pages that have the word museum and the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900
pages that have the word museum and the
 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.050
pages that have the word museum and the
phrase New York but it doesn't if you

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060
phrase New York but it doesn't if you
 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.430
phrase New York but it doesn't if you
say

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440
 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.340
an exhibition in Manhattan or something

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350
an exhibition in Manhattan or something
 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.290
an exhibition in Manhattan or something
but you might have something as a museum

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300
but you might have something as a museum
 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.090
but you might have something as a museum
in New York that actually didn't use the

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100
in New York that actually didn't use the
 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.890
in New York that actually didn't use the
word Museum in New York on the page but

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
word Museum in New York on the page but
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.690

the knowledge graph knows that Manhattan

Google Maps as a drawing a map is but if
you take sorting through fake news and

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:14.630
you take sorting through fake news and
 

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.640
you take sorting through fake news and
recognizing when rumors are getting in

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:16.650
recognizing when rumors are getting in
 

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.090
recognizing when rumors are getting in
on control in order to do that you

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.100
on control in order to do that you
 

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.820
on control in order to do that you
really need a very complex

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:21.830
really need a very complex
 

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.290
really need a very complex

you're from kind of trace well this

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680
you're from kind of trace well this

this person said that or you know the
 

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.200
this person said that or you know the
New York Times said that you know the

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.210
New York Times said that you know the
 

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:39.430
New York Times said that you know the
Drudge Report said that you know and so

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440
Drudge Report said that you know and so
 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.450
Drudge Report said that you know and so
there is something that needs to be

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:41.460
there is something that needs to be
 

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.290
there is something that needs to be
built on top of of the underlay that is

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300
built on top of of the underlay that is
 

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.690
built on top of of the underlay that is
essentially a network of trust for that

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700
essentially a network of trust for that
 

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.990
essentially a network of trust for that
purpose so you know somebody has to say

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000
purpose so you know somebody has to say
 

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.330
purpose so you know somebody has to say
well okay I trust New York Times where

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:53.340
well okay I trust New York Times where
 

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.510
well okay I trust New York Times where
that trust Fox News or vice versa or you

know I and these would be organizations

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120
know I and these would be organizations
 

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.730
know I and these would be organizations
or individuals with some sort of

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740
or individuals with some sort of
 

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.650
or individuals with some sort of
framework of analysis that could that

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660
framework of analysis that could that
 

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.710
framework of analysis that could that
would that would leverage the underlay

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720
would that would leverage the underlay
 

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.080
would that would leverage the underlay
and for interpretive purposes and

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.090
and for interpretive purposes and
 

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.670
and for interpretive purposes and
there's gonna be for different purposes

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680
there's gonna be for different purposes
 

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.640
there's gonna be for different purposes
I mean and you know the awful lot of the

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:13.650
I mean and you know the awful lot of the
 

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.530
I mean and you know the awful lot of the
things that people argue about I mean

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540
things that people argue about I mean
 

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.600
things that people argue about I mean
you know is Taiwan a Province of China

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:17.610
you know is Taiwan a Province of China
 

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.250
you know is Taiwan a Province of China
well you know if you're doing something

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:22.260
well you know if you're doing something
 

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.540
well you know if you're doing something
with the Chinese government you've got

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:23.550
with the Chinese government you've got
 

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.190
with the Chinese government you've got
account of this one if you're doing

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200
account of this one if you're doing
 

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.830
account of this one if you're doing
something with Taiwan you're probably

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:27.840
something with Taiwan you're probably
 

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.230
something with Taiwan you're probably
not gonna commit you know so for some

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240
not gonna commit you know so for some
 

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.360
not gonna commit you know so for some
purposes it is for some purposes it

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.370
purposes it is for some purposes it
 

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.960
purposes it is for some purposes it
isn't and and so there is what's the

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:35.970
isn't and and so there is what's the
 

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.580
isn't and and so there is what's the
truth of that well there is an exactly

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:37.590
truth of that well there is an exactly
 

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.980
truth of that well there is an exactly
the truth it's you know what's the

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:39.990
the truth it's you know what's the
 

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.370
the truth it's you know what's the
purpose what's the trust in it and so on

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380
purpose what's the trust in it and so on
 

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.960
purpose what's the trust in it and so on
and in many of these the so so I sort of

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:47.970
and in many of these the so so I sort of
 

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.870
and in many of these the so so I sort of
feel like the underlay is in some sense

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880
feel like the underlay is in some sense
 

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.780
feel like the underlay is in some sense
is a piece of the plumbing that we need

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:52.790
is a piece of the plumbing that we need
 

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.520
is a piece of the plumbing that we need
to deal with the fact that the amount of

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:55.530
to deal with the fact that the amount of
 

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.740
to deal with the fact that the amount of
information has become overwhelming that

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.750
information has become overwhelming that
 

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.580
information has become overwhelming that
no human can hold it all in their heads

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:01.590
no human can hold it all in their heads
 

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.800
no human can hold it all in their heads
no nobody can be sort of familiar with

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:03.810
no nobody can be sort of familiar with
 

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.620
no nobody can be sort of familiar with
all the new sources or things like that

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:06.630
all the new sources or things like that
 

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.320
all the new sources or things like that
and then that lets us build these things

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:09.330
and then that lets us build these things
 

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.300
and then that lets us build these things
on top of it where computers help us be

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:11.310
on top of it where computers help us be
 

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.870
on top of it where computers help us be
smarter in sort of navigate

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880
smarter in sort of navigate
 

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.740
smarter in sort of navigate
these networks of trust and and so

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:17.750
these networks of trust and and so
 

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.590
these networks of trust and and so
you're conceiving of this challenge this

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600
you're conceiving of this challenge this
 

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.880
you're conceiving of this challenge this
is in the mid-early odds right and what

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:25.890
is in the mid-early odds right and what
 

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.380
is in the mid-early odds right and what
was the you know what was the first

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:27.390
was the you know what was the first
 

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.840
was the you know what was the first
Inklings of an approach that technology

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:29.850
Inklings of an approach that technology
 

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.680
Inklings of an approach that technology
could provide to addressing this and to

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:33.690
could provide to addressing this and to
 

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.370
could provide to addressing this and to
kind of capturing the the chain if you

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380
kind of capturing the the chain if you
 

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.240
kind of capturing the the chain if you
will of custody of information so so the

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.250
will of custody of information so so the
 

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.880
will of custody of information so so the
idea was to build something that that

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:43.890
idea was to build something that that
 

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:49.760
idea was to build something that that
basically said what the agreed on what

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:49.770
basically said what the agreed on what
 

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.530
basically said what the agreed on what
the things you were talking about the

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540
the things you were talking about the
 

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.510
the things you were talking about the
entities that you were talking about let

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:53.520
entities that you were talking about let
 

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.800
entities that you were talking about let
people make statements about the

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:56.810
people make statements about the
 

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.390
people make statements about the
relationships between them but then have

00:10:59.390 --> 00:10:59.400
relationships between them but then have
 

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.070
relationships between them but then have
some provenance of who made those

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:01.080
some provenance of who made those
 

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.220
some provenance of who made those
statements so that instead of recording

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.230
statements so that instead of recording
 

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.640
statements so that instead of recording
that you know the glass is sitting on

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:07.650
that you know the glass is sitting on
 

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.200
that you know the glass is sitting on
the table you record Danny said the

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:09.210
the table you record Danny said the
 

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.030
the table you record Danny said the
glass is sitting on the table on

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040
glass is sitting on the table on
 

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.600
glass is sitting on the table on
such-and-such a day and then then you

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:14.610
such-and-such a day and then then you
 

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.000
such-and-such a day and then then you
want you to have all that information

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.010
want you to have all that information
 

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.820
want you to have all that information
recorded then that lets you first of all

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:19.830
recorded then that lets you first of all
 

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.140
recorded then that lets you first of all
it lets you record the information

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:21.150
it lets you record the information
 

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.570
it lets you record the information
without worrying too much about whether

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:23.580
without worrying too much about whether
 

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.820
without worrying too much about whether
it's true it's true that I said that

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:25.830
it's true it's true that I said that
 

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.760
it's true it's true that I said that
right which is much easier to determine

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:28.770
right which is much easier to determine
 

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.410
right which is much easier to determine
than whether it's true that the glass is

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420
than whether it's true that the glass is
 

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.510
than whether it's true that the glass is
actually on the table and but then it

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:35.520
actually on the table and but then it
 

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.580
actually on the table and but then it
also lets you apply basically your idea

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:40.590
also lets you apply basically your idea
 

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.440
also lets you apply basically your idea
of trust afterwards after you get more

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:42.450
of trust afterwards after you get more
 

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.890
of trust afterwards after you get more
information about Who I am or later you

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:45.900
information about Who I am or later you
 

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.020
information about Who I am or later you
find out I'm a liar or later you find

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.030
find out I'm a liar or later you find
 

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.820
find out I'm a liar or later you find
out the class with someplace else can

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:49.830
out the class with someplace else can
 

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.490
out the class with someplace else can
weigh those previous recordings against

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500
weigh those previous recordings against
 

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.060
weigh those previous recordings against
ya so so it's sort of the idea is that

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.070
ya so so it's sort of the idea is that
 

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.040
ya so so it's sort of the idea is that
what we really need to do is we need to

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.050
what we really need to do is we need to
 

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.300
what we really need to do is we need to
separate up two things we need to

00:11:59.300 --> 00:11:59.310
separate up two things we need to
 

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.070
separate up two things we need to
separate the record of what different

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:01.080
separate the record of what different
 

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.640
separate the record of what different
people said and who said it the

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:04.650
people said and who said it the
 

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.010
people said and who said it the
provenance of what was said and then

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:07.020
provenance of what was said and then
 

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.190
provenance of what was said and then
separately remember it separately have

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200
separately remember it separately have
 

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.010
separately remember it separately have
in some sense a network of trust which

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:13.020
in some sense a network of trust which
 

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.970
in some sense a network of trust which
is going to be different for different

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980
is going to be different for different
 

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.700
is going to be different for different
purposes ultimately there's lots of

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:16.710
purposes ultimately there's lots of
 

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.260
purposes ultimately there's lots of
