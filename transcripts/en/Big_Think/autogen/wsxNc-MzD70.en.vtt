today so this idea that there's some
 

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.730
today so this idea that there's some
huge problem that's simply not sure

huge problem that's simply not sure
 

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.680
huge problem that's simply not sure
there's a long-range problem that stems

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:17.690
there's a long-range problem that stems
 

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.210
there's a long-range problem that stems
from the fact we're projected to live

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:19.220
from the fact we're projected to live
 

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.130
from the fact we're projected to live
longer which hopefully will be true so

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.140
longer which hopefully will be true so
 

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.140
longer which hopefully will be true so
you know somewhere down the road we'll

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:23.150
you know somewhere down the road we'll
 

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.520
you know somewhere down the road we'll
have to make adjustments and that can

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:24.530
have to make adjustments and that can
 

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.320
have to make adjustments and that can
take the form that we might raise taxes

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:26.330
take the form that we might raise taxes
 

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.090
take the form that we might raise taxes
some at some point in the future might

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:28.100
some at some point in the future might
 

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.340
some at some point in the future might
decide to raise retirement ages you know

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.350

even maybe people have to work a little

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880
even maybe people have to work a little
 

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.430
even maybe people have to work a little
longer to their life but that's a

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440
longer to their life but that's a
 

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.170
