second audience that I actually care
 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.069
second audience that I actually care
about is we actually work on the

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079
about is we actually work on the
 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.870
about is we actually work on the
education for all initiative so you

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880
education for all initiative so you
 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.180
education for all initiative so you
person people talk about that the United

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190
person people talk about that the United
 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.920

underdeveloped countries people get the

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:23.029
underdeveloped countries people get the
 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.040
underdeveloped countries people get the
right to have education

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050
right to have education
 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.390
right to have education
and most of those people are not

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400
and most of those people are not
 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.369
and most of those people are not
connected so they don't have TV they

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:28.379
connected so they don't have TV they
 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.589
connected so they don't have TV they
don't have phones and somebody mentioned

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599
don't have phones and somebody mentioned
 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.020
don't have phones and somebody mentioned

those underdeveloped companies to the
 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.960
those underdeveloped companies to the
globe and by 2021 they predict that will

have ninety percent of the world's

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409
have ninety percent of the world's
 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.040

population will be connected through

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050
population will be connected through
 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.930
population will be connected through
mobile devices so it actually jumps

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940
mobile devices so it actually jumps
 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.850

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860
across all those infrastructure issues
 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.180
across all those infrastructure issues
so I think somebody mentioned leveling

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190
so I think somebody mentioned leveling
 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.770
so I think somebody mentioned leveling
the playing field this would level the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780
the playing field this would level the
 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.779
the playing field this would level the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.080
effective teaching for achieving that
learning and what we see is what real

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090
learning and what we see is what real
 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.869
learning and what we see is what real
meaningful learning is about is quite

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879
meaningful learning is about is quite
 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.529
meaningful learning is about is quite
different than what technology has been

you know people making such a big fuss

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500
you know people making such a big fuss
 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.029
you know people making such a big fuss
about it that's about information and

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039
about it that's about information and
 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.339
about it that's about information and
presenting information to people that's

presenting information to people that's
 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.010
presenting information to people that's
not what real meaningful learning is

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020
not what real meaningful learning is
 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.589
not what real meaningful learning is
meaningful learning is about how to use

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599
meaningful learning is about how to use
 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.330
meaningful learning is about how to use
that information and how to make

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340
that information and how to make
 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.200
that information and how to make
decisions with it and frankly all of our

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210
decisions with it and frankly all of our
 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.140

research I mean every video studies is

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150
research I mean every video studies is
 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.260

online you don't really learn anything

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009
online you don't really learn anything
 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.550
online you don't really learn anything
from it okay you can get information

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560
from it okay you can get information
 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.170
from it okay you can get information
government you get that same information

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180
government you get that same information
 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.450
government you get that same information
other places and you still won't learn

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460
other places and you still won't learn
 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.749
other places and you still won't learn
it it it so learning really requires

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759
it it it so learning really requires
 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.909
it it it so learning really requires
very different things and so far

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919
very different things and so far
 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.610
very different things and so far

technology hasn't really been used to
support it now can it yes I think it

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680
support it now can it yes I think it
 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.290
support it now can it yes I think it
definitely can but but it really

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300
definitely can but but it really
 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.080
definitely can but but it really
requires people to start rethinking what

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090
requires people to start rethinking what
 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.450
requires people to start rethinking what
learning is an understanding learning

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460
learning is an understanding learning
 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.279
learning is an understanding learning
and effective teaching is quite

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289
and effective teaching is quite
 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.010
and effective teaching is quite
different than providing information to

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020

be can you just from your experience
give a few details concretely because

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949
give a few details concretely because
 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.950
give a few details concretely because
you have studied what learning means I

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960
you have studied what learning means I
 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.510
you have studied what learning means I
think it's good for the audience not

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520
think it's good for the audience not
 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.800
think it's good for the audience not
just to describe it in

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810
just to describe it in
 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.409
just to describe it in
a short way but to give some concrete

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419
a short way but to give some concrete
 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.100
a short way but to give some concrete
examples so when when I say it mean it

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110
examples so when when I say it mean it
 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.560
examples so when when I say it mean it
comes to them making decisions with it

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570
comes to them making decisions with it
 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.080
comes to them making decisions with it
and so when faced with the situation a

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090
and so when faced with the situation a
 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.060
and so when faced with the situation a
question or a problem you know but if

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070
question or a problem you know but if
 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.740
question or a problem you know but if
someone is has learned something mean

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750
someone is has learned something mean
 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.080
someone is has learned something mean
evoke they they learned how to tackle

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090
evoke they they learned how to tackle
 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.260
evoke they they learned how to tackle
this problem like someone who's you know

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270
this problem like someone who's you know
 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.810
this problem like someone who's you know
an expert in the subject don't have to

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820
an expert in the subject don't have to
 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.310
an expert in the subject don't have to
be an expert obviously at a low level

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320
be an expert obviously at a low level
 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.550
be an expert obviously at a low level
but that means asking what is the

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560
but that means asking what is the
 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.340
but that means asking what is the
information that I should bring to bear

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350
information that I should bring to bear
 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.190
information that I should bring to bear
on this problem and and then you know

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.200
on this problem and and then you know
 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.320
on this problem and and then you know
answering that question correctly

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330
answering that question correctly
 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.960
answering that question correctly
realizing what information they should

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970
realizing what information they should
 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.330
realizing what information they should
use how they should use that information

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340
use how they should use that information
 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.580
use how they should use that information
how they can draw conclusions from it

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590
how they can draw conclusions from it
 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.950
how they can draw conclusions from it
what decisions should they make on the

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960
what decisions should they make on the
 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.500
what decisions should they make on the
basis of that conclusion and you know

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510
basis of that conclusion and you know
 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.469
basis of that conclusion and you know
that can be in a simple physics problem

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479
that can be in a simple physics problem
 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:33.960
that can be in a simple physics problem
of okay you know you give them what you

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970
of okay you know you give them what you
 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.820
of okay you know you give them what you
give them a question that car runs into

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830
give them a question that car runs into
 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.490
give them a question that car runs into
a truck and then they they have to work

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500
a truck and then they they have to work
 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.960
a truck and then they they have to work
through and then think about what

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:39.970
through and then think about what
 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.580
through and then think about what
concepts would apply how would I decide

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.590
concepts would apply how would I decide
 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.350
concepts would apply how would I decide
how would I justify this is the right

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360
how would I justify this is the right
 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.320
how would I justify this is the right
concept to use and then if I apply those

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330
concept to use and then if I apply those
 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.540
concept to use and then if I apply those
kinds of what would it say about an

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:51.550
kinds of what would it say about an
 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.420
kinds of what would it say about an
answer okay and so you people have to

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.430
answer okay and so you people have to
 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.060
answer okay and so you people have to
practice those reasoning and decision

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.070
practice those reasoning and decision
 

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.240
practice those reasoning and decision
making and information filtering skills

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.250

the fact it is also what universities

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:10.510
the fact it is also what universities
 

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.350
the fact it is also what universities
discovered MOOCs is not the solution to

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360
discovered MOOCs is not the solution to
 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.409

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640
interaction with teacher teachers who
 

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.480
interaction with teacher teachers who
are still teachers facing students and

using the best of the technology what is

00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:39.219
using the best of the technology what is

your experience in making this happen or
are there other aspects that we still

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200
are there other aspects that we still
 

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.930
are there other aspects that we still
need to take into account especially

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:45.940
need to take into account especially
 

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.420

if I think it's a big difference if we

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:52.470
if I think it's a big difference if we
 

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.519
if I think it's a big difference if we
talk about the school system the primary

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:55.529
talk about the school system the primary
 

00:08:55.529 --> 00:08:57.919
talk about the school system the primary
and secondary or if we talk about higher

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:57.929
and secondary or if we talk about higher
 

00:08:57.929 --> 00:09:02.150
and secondary or if we talk about higher
education and as we talked this morning

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160
education and as we talked this morning
 

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.929
education and as we talked this morning
I mean technology is there and I see

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:05.939
I mean technology is there and I see
 

00:09:05.939 --> 00:09:08.269
I mean technology is there and I see
that we can use the information through

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279
that we can use the information through
 

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.759
that we can use the information through
technology but that's just information

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:10.769
technology but that's just information
 

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:13.759
technology but that's just information
that is not learning and all the

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:13.769
that is not learning and all the
 

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:16.340
that is not learning and all the
discussions we have this morning was how

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:16.350
discussions we have this morning was how
 

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.549
discussions we have this morning was how
do we make the people is the English

00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:19.559
do we make the people is the English
 

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.879
do we make the people is the English
society in all the word capable of

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:22.889
society in all the word capable of
 

00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:25.609
society in all the word capable of
taking this information and making

00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:25.619
taking this information and making
 

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:28.280
taking this information and making
something into it so I think that what

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:28.290
something into it so I think that what
 

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.319
something into it so I think that what
we will see in the end the higher

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:30.329
we will see in the end the higher
 

00:09:30.329 --> 00:09:32.689
we will see in the end the higher
education as university is very

00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:32.699
education as university is very
 

00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:35.929
education as university is very
important that we continue to have the

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:35.939
important that we continue to have the
 

00:09:35.939 --> 00:09:38.329
important that we continue to have the
technology and the information through

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339
technology and the information through
 

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:40.699
technology and the information through
technology as a compliment the most

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:40.709
technology as a compliment the most
 

00:09:40.709 --> 00:09:42.919
technology as a compliment the most
important thing is that we have students

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:42.929
important thing is that we have students
 

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:45.470
important thing is that we have students
that are trained that using the

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480
that are trained that using the
 

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.599
that are trained that using the
different types of information putting

00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:47.609
different types of information putting
 

00:09:47.609 --> 00:09:50.119
different types of information putting
them into context discuss them to be

00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:50.129
them into context discuss them to be
 

00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:53.720
them into context discuss them to be
critical to be analytical because those

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:53.730
critical to be analytical because those
 

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.579
critical to be analytical because those
people would be the individuals for the

00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:55.589
people would be the individuals for the
 

00:09:55.589 --> 00:09:57.979
people would be the individuals for the
future and I don't think that we will

00:09:57.979 --> 00:09:57.989
future and I don't think that we will
 

00:09:57.989 --> 00:10:00.109
future and I don't think that we will
have a word I don't think that we can

00:10:00.109 --> 00:10:00.119
have a word I don't think that we can
 

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:02.419
have a word I don't think that we can
meet the sustainable development goals

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:02.429
meet the sustainable development goals
 

00:10:02.429 --> 00:10:05.059
meet the sustainable development goals
unless that we educate people and that

00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:05.069
unless that we educate people and that
 

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:07.159
unless that we educate people and that
is not just in the countries we are

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:07.169
is not just in the countries we are
 

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:10.129
is not just in the countries we are
living in here it is countries where

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:10.139
living in here it is countries where
 

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:13.369
living in here it is countries where
Julie is are representing where if I'm

00:10:13.369 --> 00:10:13.379
Julie is are representing where if I'm
 

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.159
Julie is are representing where if I'm
scared if we just sending out technology

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:16.169
scared if we just sending out technology
 

00:10:16.169 --> 00:10:18.650
scared if we just sending out technology
we be not have the individuals in those

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660
we be not have the individuals in those
 

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.619
we be not have the individuals in those
countries who can respond to what

00:10:21.619 --> 00:10:21.629
countries who can respond to what
 

00:10:21.629 --> 00:10:25.879
countries who can respond to what
information get up yeah I'm just wrapped

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:25.889
information get up yeah I'm just wrapped
 

00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:28.759
information get up yeah I'm just wrapped
up with peace I mean what we see in in

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:28.769
up with peace I mean what we see in in
 

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:31.970
up with peace I mean what we see in in
in higher education in particular is

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980
in higher education in particular is
 

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.229
in higher education in particular is
there places where technology can really

00:10:35.229 --> 00:10:35.239
there places where technology can really
 

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:38.239
there places where technology can really
extend the capabilities of a good

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:38.249
extend the capabilities of a good
 

00:10:38.249 --> 00:10:40.100
extend the capabilities of a good
teacher because a good teacher has to be

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.110
teacher because a good teacher has to be
 

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.069
teacher because a good teacher has to be
you know posing questions to students

00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079
you know posing questions to students
 

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:45.979
you know posing questions to students
and then giving them feedback based on

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:45.989
and then giving them feedback based on
 

00:10:45.989 --> 00:10:49.069
and then giving them feedback based on
what they know but also what they don't

00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079
what they know but also what they don't
 

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:50.869
what they know but also what they don't
know or what they think incorrectly that

00:10:50.869 --> 00:10:50.879
know or what they think incorrectly that
 

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:52.939
know or what they think incorrectly that
it there's a lot of ways we see we can

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:52.949
it there's a lot of ways we see we can
 

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:55.220
it there's a lot of ways we see we can
use technology where the teacher can

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:55.230
use technology where the teacher can
 

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.799
use technology where the teacher can
have a much better sense of the thinking

00:10:57.799 --> 00:10:57.809
have a much better sense of the thinking
 

00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:00.859
have a much better sense of the thinking
of you know not just for students at a

00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:00.869
of you know not just for students at a
 

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.500
of you know not just for students at a
time the 40 or 200

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:03.510
time the 40 or 200
 

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.390
time the 40 or 200
students at a time and therefore provide

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:05.400
students at a time and therefore provide
 

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.210
students at a time and therefore provide
better guidance immediate feedback to

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220
better guidance immediate feedback to
 

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.040
better guidance immediate feedback to
those students so that's that's one

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.050
those students so that's that's one
 

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.870
those students so that's that's one
place where we see that it's very

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880
place where we see that it's very
 

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.960
place where we see that it's very
directly benefit beneficial but it's not

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:14.970
directly benefit beneficial but it's not
 

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.180
directly benefit beneficial but it's not
replacing the teacher it's amplifying

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:17.190
replacing the teacher it's amplifying
 

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.340
replacing the teacher it's amplifying
the capabilities of teacher I mean

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:19.350
the capabilities of teacher I mean
 

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.790
the capabilities of teacher I mean
sometimes to stay for a moment within

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800
sometimes to stay for a moment within
 

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.250
sometimes to stay for a moment within
higher education and also the training

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.260
higher education and also the training
 

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.210
higher education and also the training
of researchers and I look to learn here

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:28.220
of researchers and I look to learn here
 

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.060
of researchers and I look to learn here
very often it is so important to get

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.070
very often it is so important to get
 

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.640
very often it is so important to get
students to ask the right kind of

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:34.650
students to ask the right kind of
 

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.500
students to ask the right kind of
questions that's much more difficult

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.510
questions that's much more difficult
 

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.470
questions that's much more difficult
then you know teaching them something

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480
then you know teaching them something
 

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.870
then you know teaching them something
that they will just be able to remember

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880
that they will just be able to remember
 

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.250
that they will just be able to remember
so what is your take on learning scene

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260
so what is your take on learning scene
 

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.680
so what is your take on learning scene
from that perspective in relationship

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:48.690
from that perspective in relationship
 

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.480
from that perspective in relationship
with technology and the use of

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:50.490
with technology and the use of
 

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.570
with technology and the use of
technology of course we heard this

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:53.580
technology of course we heard this
 

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.300
technology of course we heard this
morning also that if you have the right

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:56.310
morning also that if you have the right
 

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.670
morning also that if you have the right
methods and artificial intelligence can

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680
methods and artificial intelligence can
 

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.530
methods and artificial intelligence can
help you sometimes you can increase the

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540
help you sometimes you can increase the
 

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.810
help you sometimes you can increase the
level of learning quite a bit which was

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820
level of learning quite a bit which was
 

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.910
level of learning quite a bit which was
very good fflint and that is of course

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920
very good fflint and that is of course
 

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.480
very good fflint and that is of course
used in many different places here but I

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:08.490
used in many different places here but I
 

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.270
used in many different places here but I
think what we are aiming at it our

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:11.280
think what we are aiming at it our
 

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.000
think what we are aiming at it our
university is very much to look to Train

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.010
university is very much to look to Train
 

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.060
university is very much to look to Train
also the students in in challenges to

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:17.070
also the students in in challenges to
 

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.220
also the students in in challenges to
take on the big challenges and to think

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.230
take on the big challenges and to think
 

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.390
take on the big challenges and to think
independently and also work together and

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:23.400
independently and also work together and
 

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.930
independently and also work together and
I think this is for this you have of

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940
I think this is for this you have of
 

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.040
I think this is for this you have of
course you have you solve or

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.050
course you have you solve or
 

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:32.120
course you have you solve or
technologies for various kinds but just

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.130
technologies for various kinds but just
 

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.500
technologies for various kinds but just
to have a very large challenge like

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:35.510
to have a very large challenge like
 

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.630
to have a very large challenge like
sustainable transport and that is a big

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640
sustainable transport and that is a big
 

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.410
sustainable transport and that is a big
big challenge for mankind how we will

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420
big challenge for mankind how we will
 

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.080
big challenge for mankind how we will
achieve that and actually put a number

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.090
achieve that and actually put a number
 

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.320
achieve that and actually put a number
of students last year in a course which

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:48.330
of students last year in a course which
 

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.990
of students last year in a course which
is called challenge lab every day just

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000
is called challenge lab every day just
 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.970
is called challenge lab every day just
gave them this kind of challenge and

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980
gave them this kind of challenge and
 

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.980
gave them this kind of challenge and
some teaching how to approach a big

go to access also 22 company leaders and

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220
go to access also 22 company leaders and
 

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.340
go to access also 22 company leaders and
they will also go to access to

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:10.350
they will also go to access to
 

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.980
they will also go to access to
politicians so what the did first was to

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:12.990
politicians so what the did first was to
 

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.720
politicians so what the did first was to
try to formulate the problem and they

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:14.730
try to formulate the problem and they
 

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.579
try to formulate the problem and they
came from very different disciplines and

00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:16.589
came from very different disciplines and
 

00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:18.800
came from very different disciplines and
the formulated problems and then I went

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:18.810
the formulated problems and then I went
 

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.509
the formulated problems and then I went
to all these actors and I try to come

00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519
to all these actors and I try to come
 

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:26.179
to all these actors and I try to come
further and further to the problem of

00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:26.189
further and further to the problem of
 

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:28.429
further and further to the problem of
sustainable transport what's the benefit

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:28.439
sustainable transport what's the benefit
 

00:13:28.439 --> 00:13:30.460
sustainable transport what's the benefit
of dicks well they learn how to

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:30.470
of dicks well they learn how to
 

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.290
of dicks well they learn how to
integrate you with a different kind or

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.300
integrate you with a different kind or
 

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.840
integrate you with a different kind or
knowledge then know how to pose a

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:35.850
knowledge then know how to pose a
 

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.360
knowledge then know how to pose a
problem and they may also learn how to

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:40.370
problem and they may also learn how to
 

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.610
problem and they may also learn how to
change the world in the end and the good

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.620
change the world in the end and the good
 

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.019
change the world in the end and the good
thing about students they are not afraid

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:45.029
thing about students they are not afraid
 

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:49.309
thing about students they are not afraid
so they have good ideas they can cross

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:49.319
so they have good ideas they can cross
 

00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:51.319
so they have good ideas they can cross
the borders so they became more or less

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:51.329
the borders so they became more or less
 

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:54.710
the borders so they became more or less
some agents for for change and I think

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720
some agents for for change and I think
 

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.960
some agents for for change and I think
this is what we are looking for today

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:56.970
this is what we are looking for today
 

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.150
this is what we are looking for today
that we have trained people change young

00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160
that we have trained people change young
 

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.910
that we have trained people change young
people that can take on this these

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920
people that can take on this these
 

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.449
people that can take on this these
challenges of course there should be a

00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:04.459
challenges of course there should be a
 

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:07.160
challenges of course there should be a
knowledge base but to do this in the end

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.170
knowledge base but to do this in the end
 

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.740
knowledge base but to do this in the end
of the of the education I think it's

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:09.750
of the of the education I think it's
 

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.710
of the of the education I think it's
very interesting and stimulating and I

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720
very interesting and stimulating and I
 

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.499
very interesting and stimulating and I
think one way to tackle our challenges

00:14:15.499 --> 00:14:15.509
think one way to tackle our challenges
 

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:17.660
think one way to tackle our challenges
for the future I mean you gave us a good

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:17.670
for the future I mean you gave us a good
 

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.470
for the future I mean you gave us a good
example of really what one can call

interdisciplinary research mmm and in in

00:14:25.249 --> 00:14:25.259
interdisciplinary research mmm and in in
 

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:27.079
interdisciplinary research mmm and in in
the sense that it is necessary to

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:27.089
the sense that it is necessary to
 

00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:29.780
the sense that it is necessary to
formulate a problem together so it's not

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:29.790
formulate a problem together so it's not
 

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.600
formulate a problem together so it's not
someone else formulating the problem and

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:32.610
someone else formulating the problem and
 

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.879
someone else formulating the problem and
the others are helping towards helping

00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:34.889
the others are helping towards helping
 

00:14:34.889 --> 00:14:37.670
the others are helping towards helping
to solve it but it's a joint exercise

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680
to solve it but it's a joint exercise
 

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.009
to solve it but it's a joint exercise
which is much more demanding than people

00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019
which is much more demanding than people
 

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:42.199
which is much more demanding than people
can think of at the same time you know

00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:42.209
can think of at the same time you know

interdisciplinarity has been debated for

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.250
interdisciplinarity has been debated for
 

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.840
interdisciplinarity has been debated for
decades and there is still the view and

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:47.850
decades and there is still the view and
 

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.660
decades and there is still the view and
I share this view that universities

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:50.670
I share this view that universities
 

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.210
I share this view that universities
still have to teach disciplines because

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220
still have to teach disciplines because
 

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.069
still have to teach disciplines because
first you have to know what is a good

00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079
first you have to know what is a good
 

00:14:55.079 --> 00:14:57.290
first you have to know what is a good

inauguration of global chances program
at our University and what is that built

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:11.430
at our University and what is that built
 

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.449
at our University and what is that built
on has built on strong disciplinary

we need to bring them together from

00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:17.749
we need to bring them together from
 

00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:20.019
we need to bring them together from
humanities Social Sciences from

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:20.029
humanities Social Sciences from
 

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:23.229
humanities Social Sciences from
technology and from from medicine they

00:15:23.229 --> 00:15:23.239
technology and from from medicine they
 

00:15:23.239 --> 00:15:25.929
technology and from from medicine they
have to be together so and what I have

00:15:25.929 --> 00:15:25.939
have to be together so and what I have
 

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:27.939
have to be together so and what I have
seen in through the years is that we

00:15:27.939 --> 00:15:27.949
seen in through the years is that we
 

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:30.129
seen in through the years is that we
have become more and more disciplinary

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:30.139
have become more and more disciplinary
 

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:33.340
have become more and more disciplinary
and we don't meet other disciplines in

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:33.350
and we don't meet other disciplines in
 

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.259
and we don't meet other disciplines in
the Indian River see nothing that's a

00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:35.269
the Indian River see nothing that's a
 

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:37.210
the Indian River see nothing that's a
drawback and that's not good learning

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:37.220
drawback and that's not good learning
 

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.189
drawback and that's not good learning
that's not good for the future can

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199
that's not good for the future can
 

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:41.699
that's not good for the future can
technology help in making these bridges

00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:41.709
technology help in making these bridges
 

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:47.410
technology help in making these bridges
yes we can because technology is is a

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:47.420
yes we can because technology is is a
 

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.769
yes we can because technology is is a
driving force and I think that everyone

00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:50.779
driving force and I think that everyone
 

00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:53.199
driving force and I think that everyone
wants to be in that if we take the ICT

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:53.209
wants to be in that if we take the ICT
 

00:15:53.209 --> 00:15:56.410
wants to be in that if we take the ICT
but if we want to be have people have

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:56.420
but if we want to be have people have
 

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.569
but if we want to be have people have
students interest of that we have to

00:15:58.569 --> 00:15:58.579
students interest of that we have to
 

00:15:58.579 --> 00:16:00.220
students interest of that we have to
bring in humanities and Social Sciences

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:00.230
bring in humanities and Social Sciences
 

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.739
bring in humanities and Social Sciences
they want to have the more soft values

00:16:02.739 --> 00:16:02.749
they want to have the more soft values
 

00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:05.319
they want to have the more soft values
and Erickson has also pinpointed this we

00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:05.329
and Erickson has also pinpointed this we
 

00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:07.150
and Erickson has also pinpointed this we
cannot just come with technology and

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160
cannot just come with technology and
 

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.489
cannot just come with technology and
therefore it's so I think that that

00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:09.499
therefore it's so I think that that
 

00:16:09.499 --> 00:16:12.280
therefore it's so I think that that
could be a common question what is good

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.290
could be a common question what is good
 

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.199
could be a common question what is good
technology doing and then we bring

00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:14.209
technology doing and then we bring
 

00:16:14.209 --> 00:16:17.160
technology doing and then we bring
together different disciplines okay I

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.170
together different disciplines okay I
 

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:22.600
together different disciplines okay I
now would like to turn to sort and I

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:22.610
now would like to turn to sort and I
 

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.150
now would like to turn to sort and I
want to start out with something you

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160
want to start out with something you
 

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.949
want to start out with something you
know we have not defined learning here

00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959
know we have not defined learning here
 

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:29.379
know we have not defined learning here
and that's not our our task but we see

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:29.389
and that's not our our task but we see
 

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:32.169
and that's not our our task but we see
how multi-dimensional the concept of

00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:32.179
how multi-dimensional the concept of
 

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:33.999
how multi-dimensional the concept of
learning is whether you learn by

00:16:33.999 --> 00:16:34.009
learning is whether you learn by
 

00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:35.889
learning is whether you learn by
yourself whether you learn from a

students learn very much from each other

00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:39.939
students learn very much from each other
 

00:16:39.939 --> 00:16:43.210

technology enables you peer learning is

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.220
technology enables you peer learning is
 

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.340
technology enables you peer learning is
very important and it comes with

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:45.350
very important and it comes with
 

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.889
very important and it comes with
technology I clearly but then there is a

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:47.899
technology I clearly but then there is a
 

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:52.989
technology I clearly but then there is a
tension that I see between learning that

00:16:52.989 --> 00:16:52.999
tension that I see between learning that
 

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:55.780

is still very much embedded in a local

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:55.790
is still very much embedded in a local
 

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.329
is still very much embedded in a local
context you know there are questions

00:16:58.329 --> 00:16:58.339

00:16:58.339 --> 00:17:01.689

that come up demands needs the turn up

00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:01.699
that come up demands needs the turn up
 

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:03.759
that come up demands needs the turn up
in a local context that drive the

in a local context that drive the
 

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:05.860
in a local context that drive the
learner or the learning community and

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:05.870
learner or the learning community and
 

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.980

this is particularly the case in

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:07.990
this is particularly the case in
 

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.659
this is particularly the case in
countries like the ones you represent

and at the same time we have this

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:13.309
and at the same time we have this
 

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:15.939
and at the same time we have this
tension to you know what happens with

tension to you know what happens with
 

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:18.069

the causes of MIT and Harvard you know
 

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.529
the causes of MIT and Harvard you know
they're all over the place so how do you

00:17:20.529 --> 00:17:20.539
they're all over the place so how do you
 

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.079
they're all over the place so how do you
bridge this enormous also it's a

cultural gap that's the one that
 

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.900
cultural gap that's the one that
concerns me most for example when you

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:40.910
concerns me most for example when you
 

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.500
concerns me most for example when you
talk about technology we are very

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:44.510

that many languages will die very soon

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.170
that many languages will die very soon

so to speak other languages will die

develop our local language into could

develop our local language into could
 

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.870
develop our local language into could
encode a scientific language now when

the language died I think the whole

the language died I think the whole
culture died when a whole culture a

language will also die with it and the
 

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.400
language will also die with it and the
whole concept will die with it so there

whole idea the purpose of learning the

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280
whole idea the purpose of learning the

learning to be is the one that unifies

basically why is education now getting

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900
basically why is education now getting
 

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.620
basically why is education now getting
more and more expensive nobody even

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:00.630
more and more expensive nobody even
 

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.620
more and more expensive nobody even

and Columbia University this is a

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:09.660
and Columbia University this is a
 

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.690

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700
deflation rating in the u.s. education
 

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.060
deflation rating in the u.s. education
is now one thousand one hundred times

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.070
is now one thousand one hundred times
 

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.750
is now one thousand one hundred times
even higher than food and housing a

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760
even higher than food and housing a
 

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.090
even higher than food and housing a
question is why education is so

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100
question is why education is so
 

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.150
question is why education is so
commoditized and it becomes so expensive

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:23.160
commoditized and it becomes so expensive
 

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.400
commoditized and it becomes so expensive

people that's a question another thing
we need to solve and then technology

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:28.980
we need to solve and then technology
 

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.370
we need to solve and then technology
will come in in that kind of a context

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380
will come in in that kind of a context
 

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.410
will come in in that kind of a context
we cannot substitute technology when the

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:33.420
we cannot substitute technology when the
 

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.750
we cannot substitute technology when the
price of education wing I and I and

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760
price of education wing I and I and
 

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.490

hoping the technology was soft the

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500
hoping the technology was soft the
 

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.110
hoping the technology was soft the
problem I don't think it will solve the

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120
problem I don't think it will solve the
 

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.040
problem I don't think it will solve the
problem and second question is basically

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.050
problem and second question is basically
 

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.570
problem and second question is basically
this whole idea of technology i'm not

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580
this whole idea of technology i'm not

student learn on their own without even
 

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.730
student learn on their own without even
having intervention by teachers and he

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740
having intervention by teachers and he
 

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.830
having intervention by teachers and he
even managed to show that the student

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840
even managed to show that the student
 

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.930
even managed to show that the student
learning at that particular time is

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940
learning at that particular time is
 

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.820
learning at that particular time is
equivalent to the instruction that was

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:13.830
equivalent to the instruction that was
 

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.730
equivalent to the instruction that was
given in the school and she added one he

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740
given in the school and she added one he
 

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.070
given in the school and she added one he
added one more thing hiring a

stuff like that and he fine he found
 

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.580
stuff like that and he fine he found
that the the level of learning increases

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:28.590
that the the level of learning increases
 

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.100
that the the level of learning increases
even more so this whole idea of

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.110
even more so this whole idea of
 

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.080
even more so this whole idea of
technology that we talked about in the

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.090
technology that we talked about in the
 

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.380
technology that we talked about in the
context of modern technology i have some

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:35.390
context of modern technology i have some
 

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.360
context of modern technology i have some
reservation on it even it look at

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:38.370
reservation on it even it look at
 

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.610
reservation on it even it look at

good time être and i think there is

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:42.180
good time être and i think there is
 

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.330
good time être and i think there is
something we need to think about rather

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340
something we need to think about rather
 

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.890
something we need to think about rather
than just surrender the technology the

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900
than just surrender the technology the
 

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.200
than just surrender the technology the
way it is give it to us yeah Pam I think

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:48.210
way it is give it to us yeah Pam I think
 

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:52.550
way it is give it to us yeah Pam I think
Carl yeah let's go in that order go back

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:52.560
Carl yeah let's go in that order go back
 

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.320
Carl yeah let's go in that order go back
to school again I mean when you talk

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.330
to school again I mean when you talk
 

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.360
to school again I mean when you talk
about different languages when we talk

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:56.370
about different languages when we talk
 

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.310
about different languages when we talk
about different cultures we will be

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320
about different cultures we will be
 

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.110
about different cultures we will be
facing the same thing all around the

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120
facing the same thing all around the
 

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.210
facing the same thing all around the
world I mean if we look at just at the

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220
world I mean if we look at just at the
 

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.340
world I mean if we look at just at the
city we have a lot of people coming here

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:04.350
city we have a lot of people coming here
 

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.230
city we have a lot of people coming here
from different parts of the world we

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240
from different parts of the world we
 

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.060
from different parts of the world we
have to face the fact or or in school

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:08.070
have to face the fact or or in school
 

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.850
have to face the fact or or in school
that we are challenged with people with

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860
that we are challenged with people with
 

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.520
that we are challenged with people with
different backgrounds who takes new

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:13.530
different backgrounds who takes new
 

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.860
different backgrounds who takes new
knowledge in different ways and that

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:15.870
knowledge in different ways and that
 

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.600
knowledge in different ways and that
will be have a big demand of the

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:17.610
will be have a big demand of the
 

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.180
will be have a big demand of the
teachers and teachers are what we are

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:20.190
teachers and teachers are what we are
 

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:21.100
teachers and teachers are what we are
educating

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:21.110
educating
 

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.560
educating
higher education and we need to bring

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:23.570
higher education and we need to bring
 

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.200
higher education and we need to bring
them the competence and the knowledge to

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.210
them the competence and the knowledge to
 

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.820
them the competence and the knowledge to
handle this and this is not the

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:27.830
handle this and this is not the
 

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.220
handle this and this is not the
situation for this year on the next year

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:30.230
situation for this year on the next year
 

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.470
situation for this year on the next year
it's a situation for the word for a long

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480
it's a situation for the word for a long
 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.330
it's a situation for the word for a long
long time and we have to take that

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:34.340
long time and we have to take that
 

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.270
long time and we have to take that
responsibility which we changed the way

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:37.280
responsibility which we changed the way
 

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.940
responsibility which we changed the way
how we train campus is well come I

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:39.950
how we train campus is well come I

didn't want to correct a couple of

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440
didn't want to correct a couple of
 

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:48.820
didn't want to correct a couple of
statements to the stage so so first this

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:48.830
statements to the stage so so first this
 

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:50.680
statements to the stage so so first this
idea that sticking the computer in the

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:50.690
idea that sticking the computer in the
 

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.110
idea that sticking the computer in the
wall can do as much as the teachers

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120
wall can do as much as the teachers
 

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.960
wall can do as much as the teachers
local okay so yeah that I think that's

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:55.970
local okay so yeah that I think that's
 

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.020
local okay so yeah that I think that's
true i mean the restore the measurements

00:26:59.020 --> 00:26:59.030
true i mean the restore the measurements
 

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.690
true i mean the restore the measurements
there were pretty crude frankly but what

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:01.700
there were pretty crude frankly but what
 

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.940
there were pretty crude frankly but what
is really telling you is more about how

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:03.950
is really telling you is more about how
 

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.830
is really telling you is more about how
the teachers were functioning than the

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840
the teachers were functioning than the
 

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.659
the teachers were functioning than the
computer and it just gets back to my

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:07.669
computer and it just gets back to my
 

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:10.840
computer and it just gets back to my
point of you know those teachers are our

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:10.850
point of you know those teachers are our
 

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.299
point of you know those teachers are our
have rather limited content knowledge

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:13.309
have rather limited content knowledge
 

00:27:13.309 --> 00:27:15.880
have rather limited content knowledge
and they're standing up talking

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:15.890
and they're standing up talking
 

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.970
and they're standing up talking
basically talking textbooks and so

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:18.980
basically talking textbooks and so
 

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.669
basically talking textbooks and so
almost anything is as good as that that

00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679
almost anything is as good as that that
 

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:23.919
almost anything is as good as that that
doesn't mean that the computer and wall

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:23.929
doesn't mean that the computer and wall
 

00:27:23.929 --> 00:27:27.159
doesn't mean that the computer and wall
is providing much educational value the

00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:27.169
is providing much educational value the
 

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:29.260
is providing much educational value the
second thing about the rising cost of

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:29.270
second thing about the rising cost of
 

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.900
second thing about the rising cost of
education based on the u.s. numbers ok

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:31.910
education based on the u.s. numbers ok
 

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.350
education based on the u.s. numbers ok
but the education is not rising at

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360
but the education is not rising at
 

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.870
but the education is not rising at
anything like that rate this is based on

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880
anything like that rate this is based on
 

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.980
anything like that rate this is based on
you know on statements of intuition and

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:41.990
you know on statements of intuition and
 

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.500
you know on statements of intuition and
basically it's a shifting of costs

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:44.510
basically it's a shifting of costs
 

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.840
basically it's a shifting of costs
within the system and so it is actually

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:48.850
within the system and so it is actually
 

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.700
within the system and so it is actually
I'm not going to make a claim as to what

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:51.710
I'm not going to make a claim as to what
 

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.310
I'm not going to make a claim as to what
the actual increase in rates are but

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320
the actual increase in rates are but
 

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.560
the actual increase in rates are but
it's nothing like the thousand percent

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:56.570
it's nothing like the thousand percent
 

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.960
it's nothing like the thousand percent
that's so I'll just make that statement

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:58.970
that's so I'll just make that statement
 

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.240
that's so I'll just make that statement
that is a more complicated system and

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:01.250
that is a more complicated system and
 

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.970
that is a more complicated system and
you know university tuition is going up

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:03.980
you know university tuition is going up
 

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.440
you know university tuition is going up
because universities are doing more

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:05.450
because universities are doing more
 

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.620
because universities are doing more
research student tuition they don't they

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:08.630
research student tuition they don't they
 

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.240
research student tuition they don't they
hide it but it's actually going to

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:10.250
hide it but it's actually going to
 

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.460
hide it but it's actually going to
subsidize that it's it's a mess it's

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:12.470
subsidize that it's it's a mess it's
 

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.770
subsidize that it's it's a mess it's
very common system but it's the reality

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:14.780
very common system but it's the reality
 

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.710
very common system but it's the reality
is the basic Constitution are not going

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720
is the basic Constitution are not going
 

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.860
is the basic Constitution are not going
up nearly as high as the state but we

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:20.870
up nearly as high as the state but we
 

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:25.299
up nearly as high as the state but we
also have this opposite between the US

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:25.309
also have this opposite between the US
 

00:28:25.309 --> 00:28:28.450
also have this opposite between the US
and Europe when you're by and large in

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:28.460
and Europe when you're by and large in
 

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.710
and Europe when you're by and large in
many countries

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720
many countries
 

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.320
many countries
access to university is completely free

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:32.330
access to university is completely free
 

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.190
access to university is completely free
or with very low tuition fees so it's

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200
or with very low tuition fees so it's
 

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.740
or with very low tuition fees so it's
the state is the community that pays but

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:38.750
the state is the community that pays but
 

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.660
the state is the community that pays but
it remains within the system someone has

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:40.670
it remains within the system someone has
 

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.270
it remains within the system someone has
to pay for it yeah and at the US the

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:43.280
to pay for it yeah and at the US the
 

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.550
to pay for it yeah and at the US the
pinnacle II the public support has gone

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:45.560
pinnacle II the public support has gone
 

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.580
pinnacle II the public support has gone
largely gone away and so it's a shifting

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:48.590
largely gone away and so it's a shifting
 

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.560
largely gone away and so it's a shifting
of cos it's not a fundamental increase

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:50.570
of cos it's not a fundamental increase
 

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:57.990
of cos it's not a fundamental increase
yeah so did you want to reply to that

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000
 
 

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.630
 
your dad we're talking about the future

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640
your dad we're talking about the future
 

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.000
your dad we're talking about the future
of learning and and what we haven't been

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.010
of learning and and what we haven't been
 

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.920
of learning and and what we haven't been
talking to you through the day so far

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:05.930
talking to you through the day so far
 

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.370
talking to you through the day so far
what I've heard is we are not talking

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:09.380
what I've heard is we are not talking
 

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.700
what I've heard is we are not talking
about schools or the young people coming

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:12.710
about schools or the young people coming
 

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.810
about schools or the young people coming
into the universities but what we reform

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:15.820
into the universities but what we reform
 

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.540
into the universities but what we reform
education because people need training

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:19.550
education because people need training
 

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.000
education because people need training
throughout their working life and I

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:22.010
throughout their working life and I
 

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.070
throughout their working life and I
think that if we talk about technology

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080
think that if we talk about technology
 

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.670
think that if we talk about technology
in that perspectives we have students

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:27.680
in that perspectives we have students
 

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.600
in that perspectives we have students
that has another experience and also who

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:31.610
that has another experience and also who
 

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.170
that has another experience and also who
needs to have technology to combine the

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:35.180
needs to have technology to combine the
 

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.390
needs to have technology to combine the
meeting between individuals and teachers

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:37.400
meeting between individuals and teachers
 

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.390
meeting between individuals and teachers
and also to get information to handle

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:40.400
and also to get information to handle
 

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.480

where they are sitting so I see that

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:43.490
where they are sitting so I see that
 

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.920
where they are sitting so I see that
will be a large part of the population

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:44.930
will be a large part of the population
 

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.050
will be a large part of the population
all over the world that they have to

comment on that I it used to be you

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360
comment on that I it used to be you
 

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.540
comment on that I it used to be you
learn something whether it was a trade

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:55.550
learn something whether it was a trade
 

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.460
learn something whether it was a trade
or something in the University and then

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:57.470
or something in the University and then
 

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.080
or something in the University and then
you just leverage that for the rest of

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.090
you just leverage that for the rest of
 

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.700
you just leverage that for the rest of
your career and things are changing so

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:00.710
your career and things are changing so
 

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.370
your career and things are changing so
rapidly that you can find your skills

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:03.380
rapidly that you can find your skills
 

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.340
rapidly that you can find your skills
outdated pretty quickly so you kind of

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:06.350
outdated pretty quickly so you kind of
 

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.620
outdated pretty quickly so you kind of
need to see what's coming and the smart

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:08.630
need to see what's coming and the smart
 

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.240
need to see what's coming and the smart
ones are gaining skills all the time

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.250
ones are gaining skills all the time
 

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.520
ones are gaining skills all the time
learning all the time as adults and the

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:12.530
learning all the time as adults and the
 

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.050
learning all the time as adults and the
ones that don't sometimes they wake up

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:14.060
ones that don't sometimes they wake up
 

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.930
ones that don't sometimes they wake up
and they're unemployed and it takes a

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:16.940
and they're unemployed and it takes a
 

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.150
and they're unemployed and it takes a
huge effort to shift their skill set and

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:19.160
huge effort to shift their skill set and
 

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.520
huge effort to shift their skill set and
so you'll find an industry that I face

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:21.530
so you'll find an industry that I face
 

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.650
so you'll find an industry that I face
on one hand you people with skills maybe

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:23.660
on one hand you people with skills maybe

on one hand you people with skills maybe
you don't need as much anymore and you

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640
you don't need as much anymore and you
 

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.610
you don't need as much anymore and you
have a huge vacuum of skills that you

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:27.620
have a huge vacuum of skills that you
 

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.110
have a huge vacuum of skills that you
can't get from the universities in

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120
can't get from the universities in

that doesn't work out that way I think

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:36.800
that doesn't work out that way I think

teachers to do very simple experiments
like having a table with ants until you

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:09.170
like having a table with ants until you
 

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.950
like having a table with ants until you
put a obstacle so that ants can't go

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960
put a obstacle so that ants can't go

are expected to describe so to observe

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:18.620
are expected to describe so to observe
 

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.540
are expected to describe so to observe
to describe to analyze what is happening

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:22.550
to describe to analyze what is happening
 

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.940
to describe to analyze what is happening
and then they have a hypothesis you know

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:24.950
and then they have a hypothesis you know
 

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.220
and then they have a hypothesis you know
why do many ants go to the right side

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:27.230
why do many ants go to the right side
 

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.620
why do many ants go to the right side
and not to the left side etc so at the

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:29.630
and not to the left side etc so at the
 

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.780
and not to the left side etc so at the
same time with such a simple experiment

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:31.790

you can teach them how to do research

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.090
you can teach them how to do research

you can teach them how to do research
you observe you describe you have

hypothesis so this is something that

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:42.860
hypothesis so this is something that
 

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.850
hypothesis so this is something that
costs almost nothing and yet it's

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:45.860
costs almost nothing and yet it's
 

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.910
costs almost nothing and yet it's
something that you can keep for your

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:48.920
something that you can keep for your
 

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.980
something that you can keep for your
lifetime and I think there are many

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:50.990
lifetime and I think there are many
 

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.290
lifetime and I think there are many
examples of these kinds many small

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:53.300
examples of these kinds many small
 

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.120
examples of these kinds many small
experiments that are being done in

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:55.130
experiments that are being done in
 

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.610
experiments that are being done in
various parts of the world that I think

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:57.620
various parts of the world that I think
 

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.250
various parts of the world that I think
we need to recognize to encourage we

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:00.260
we need to recognize to encourage we
 

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.670
we need to recognize to encourage we
need to create more spaces for such

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:02.680
need to create more spaces for such
 

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.950
need to create more spaces for such
experiments that's somehow I feel that

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960
experiments that's somehow I feel that
 

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.240
experiments that's somehow I feel that
this is crossing the normal boundaries I

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.250
this is crossing the normal boundaries I
 

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:13.420
this is crossing the normal boundaries I
mean there's a project I start a number

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:13.430
mean there's a project I start a number
 

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.430
mean there's a project I start a number
of years ago that actually has rather

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440
of years ago that actually has rather
 

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.430
of years ago that actually has rather
complex interactive simulations online

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440
complex interactive simulations online
 

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.610
complex interactive simulations online
and what we've seen is that the sort of

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.620
and what we've seen is that the sort of
 

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.860
and what we've seen is that the sort of
things you're talking about are actually

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:23.870
things you're talking about are actually
 

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:27.040
things you're talking about are actually
as effective or more effective when done

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.050
as effective or more effective when done
 

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:30.520
as effective or more effective when done
online because I can essentially yeah do

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:30.530
online because I can essentially yeah do
 

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.740
online because I can essentially yeah do
the equivalent to tailoring the apps to

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:32.750
the equivalent to tailoring the apps to
 

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.750
the equivalent to tailoring the apps to
make it a little easier to follow and so

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760
make it a little easier to follow and so
 

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.920
make it a little easier to follow and so
on and so that's one clear place where

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:37.930
on and so that's one clear place where
 

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.960
on and so that's one clear place where
technology can really provide a medium

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:40.970
technology can really provide a medium
 

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.990
technology can really provide a medium
that that facilitates things that you've

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000
that that facilitates things that you've
 

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.360
that that facilitates things that you've
seen work but make it cheap cheaper and

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:46.370
seen work but make it cheap cheaper and
 

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:51.240
seen work but make it cheap cheaper and
easier for people to get access to yeah

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:51.250
easier for people to get access to yeah
 

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.980
easier for people to get access to yeah
good I

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:52.990
good I
 

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.560
good I
I agree that is low technology things

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:55.570
I agree that is low technology things
 

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:56.970
I agree that is low technology things
are really are very important to

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:56.980
are really are very important to
 

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.310
are really are very important to
stimulate the curiosity and so on so I

00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320
stimulate the curiosity and so on so I
 

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.200
stimulate the curiosity and so on so I
think one should really look for that on

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.210
think one should really look for that on
 

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.480
think one should really look for that on
the other end I'm since I'm responsible

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:03.490
the other end I'm since I'm responsible
 

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.240
the other end I'm since I'm responsible
for the European Asian source then I can

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:06.250
for the European Asian source then I can
 

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.340
for the European Asian source then I can
say is that that is perhaps on the other

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:08.350
say is that that is perhaps on the other
 

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.669
say is that that is perhaps on the other
end and in that case this is also

00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679
end and in that case this is also
 

00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:13.980
end and in that case this is also
stimulating the younger generation quite

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:13.990
stimulating the younger generation quite
 

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.900
stimulating the younger generation quite
a lot because they see that this is a

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:15.910
a lot because they see that this is a
 

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:18.750
a lot because they see that this is a
particular thing that can do fantastic

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760
particular thing that can do fantastic
 

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.200
particular thing that can do fantastic
images of atoms and so on and in

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.210
images of atoms and so on and in
 

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.049
images of atoms and so on and in
material or biomolecules and if they are

00:33:25.049 --> 00:33:25.059
material or biomolecules and if they are
 

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:27.120
material or biomolecules and if they are
really stimulated so I meet people when

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.130
really stimulated so I meet people when
 

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:31.140
really stimulated so I meet people when
i go on train when I play golf just a

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:31.150
i go on train when I play golf just a
 

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.919
i go on train when I play golf just a
few weeks ago as I I met a young guy he

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:34.929
few weeks ago as I I met a young guy he
 

00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:37.200
few weeks ago as I I met a young guy he
was about 14 years old and he was amazed

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:37.210
was about 14 years old and he was amazed
 

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.600
was about 14 years old and he was amazed
are you connected with the ESS and he

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:39.610
are you connected with the ESS and he
 

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.990
are you connected with the ESS and he
told me that he's his teacher he was

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000
told me that he's his teacher he was
 

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.570
told me that he's his teacher he was
having a science update every every week

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:45.580
having a science update every every week
 

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.820
having a science update every every week
every week there was a scientist update

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:47.830
every week there was a scientist update
 

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.530
every week there was a scientist update
what is happening on the science front

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:49.540
what is happening on the science front
 

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.840
what is happening on the science front
in with diverse areas and every week

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:51.850
in with diverse areas and every week
 

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.720
in with diverse areas and every week
there was something about the ESS and he

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:54.730
there was something about the ESS and he
 

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.760
there was something about the ESS and he
was so stimulated and well I want to

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:56.770
was so stimulated and well I want to
 

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.130
was so stimulated and well I want to
work there but this is something to aim

00:33:59.130 --> 00:33:59.140
work there but this is something to aim
 

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.770
work there but this is something to aim
for its stimulating it's like what we

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:01.780
for its stimulating it's like what we
 

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.630
for its stimulating it's like what we
had the telescope and astronomy is the

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:03.640
had the telescope and astronomy is the
 

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.080
had the telescope and astronomy is the
similar thing so that's I mean they're

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.090
similar thing so that's I mean they're
 

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.550
similar thing so that's I mean they're
motivated by this there are some

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560
motivated by this there are some
 

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.520
motivated by this there are some
relevance to to find new knowledge and

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:11.530
relevance to to find new knowledge and
 

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:13.800
relevance to to find new knowledge and
curiosity so I think this is on the

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:13.810
curiosity so I think this is on the
 

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.629
curiosity so I think this is on the
other end some stimulus but i agree

00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639
other end some stimulus but i agree
 

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.909
other end some stimulus but i agree
complete that these simple experiments

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919
complete that these simple experiments
 

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:21.869
complete that these simple experiments
are really stimulating the curiosity and

00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879
are really stimulating the curiosity and
 

00:34:21.879 --> 00:34:23.909
are really stimulating the curiosity and
the drive to go forward for new

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919
the drive to go forward for new
 

00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:26.909
the drive to go forward for new
knowledge I mean what several of you

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919
knowledge I mean what several of you
 

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:28.619
knowledge I mean what several of you
have been saying is also you know

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:28.629
have been saying is also you know
 

00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:31.320
have been saying is also you know
technology enables an outreach from

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:31.330
technology enables an outreach from
 

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.320
technology enables an outreach from
science to wider society and we have

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.330
science to wider society and we have
 

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.330
science to wider society and we have
movements like citizen science where

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:36.340
movements like citizen science where
 

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.770
movements like citizen science where
people are invited to participate you

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:40.780
people are invited to participate you
 

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.830
people are invited to participate you
know even if it is a relatively low-tech

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:45.840
know even if it is a relatively low-tech
 

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.690
know even if it is a relatively low-tech
defined task but nevertheless to feel

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:48.700
defined task but nevertheless to feel
 

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.889
defined task but nevertheless to feel
part of the process of research and so I

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:52.899
part of the process of research and so I
 

00:34:52.899 --> 00:34:55.680
part of the process of research and so I
think technology opens up but it also

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:55.690
think technology opens up but it also
 

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.070
think technology opens up but it also
opens up

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080
opens up
 

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.740
opens up
the way how we can tackle these grand

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:00.750
the way how we can tackle these grand
 

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.200
the way how we can tackle these grand
challenges and you know we started out

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:03.210
challenges and you know we started out
 

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.760
challenges and you know we started out
with you speaking about your lab we have

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:07.770
with you speaking about your lab we have
 

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.750
with you speaking about your lab we have
heard about climate change repeatedly

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760
heard about climate change repeatedly
 

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.640
heard about climate change repeatedly
what can be done so in your experience

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:13.650
what can be done so in your experience
 

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.390
what can be done so in your experience
what would you say are some of the

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400
what would you say are some of the
 

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.420
what would you say are some of the
underused resources the technology has

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:20.430
underused resources the technology has
 

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:24.920
underused resources the technology has
in getting a wider part of the public of

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:24.930
in getting a wider part of the public of
 

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.610
in getting a wider part of the public of
society engaged in this task where we

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:28.620
society engaged in this task where we
 

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.070
society engaged in this task where we
need everyone if we want to tackle these

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:31.080
need everyone if we want to tackle these
 

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.390
need everyone if we want to tackle these
grand challenges I'm interested in your

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400
grand challenges I'm interested in your
 

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.730
grand challenges I'm interested in your
experience and your comments my point of

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740
experience and your comments my point of
 

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.530
experience and your comments my point of
view I think technology is certainly

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:39.540
view I think technology is certainly
 

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.440
view I think technology is certainly
useful but there are conditions attached

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:42.450
useful but there are conditions attached
 

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.570
useful but there are conditions attached
to it I think basically it has to be

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:44.580
to it I think basically it has to be
 

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.010
to it I think basically it has to be
first of all from from what I've

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020
first of all from from what I've
 

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.100
first of all from from what I've
observed he has to be affordable if it

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:49.110
observed he has to be affordable if it
 

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.810
observed he has to be affordable if it
is affordable then I think it is not

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820
is affordable then I think it is not
 

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.130
is affordable then I think it is not
going to be used full too many countries

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140
going to be used full too many countries
 

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.810
going to be used full too many countries
around the world particularly we heard

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820
around the world particularly we heard
 

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.090
around the world particularly we heard
how the costs are falling dramatically

00:35:59.090 --> 00:35:59.100
how the costs are falling dramatically
 

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.550
how the costs are falling dramatically
yes so this should not be the major

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560
yes so this should not be the major
 

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.410
yes so this should not be the major
problem any but but still when you talk

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420
problem any but but still when you talk
 

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.850
problem any but but still when you talk
about affordability here we are

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:04.860
about affordability here we are
 

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.660
about affordability here we are
comparing food on the table and you know

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:08.670
comparing food on the table and you know
 

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.350
comparing food on the table and you know
so that that is not a kind of a kind of

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:12.360
so that that is not a kind of a kind of
 

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.390
so that that is not a kind of a kind of
different kind of a comparison yeah so

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400
different kind of a comparison yeah so
 

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.590
different kind of a comparison yeah so
he has to be affordable in that

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:15.600
he has to be affordable in that
 

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.930
he has to be affordable in that
particular sense and then once is

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940
particular sense and then once is
 

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.390
particular sense and then once is
affordable then I think many countries I

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400
affordable then I think many countries I
 

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.910
affordable then I think many countries I
think you might be with me a question of

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920
think you might be with me a question of
 

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.220
think you might be with me a question of
connectivity for Napoli is it accessible

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:25.230
connectivity for Napoli is it accessible
 

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.900
connectivity for Napoli is it accessible
in a particular and that particular

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:26.910
in a particular and that particular
 

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.030
in a particular and that particular
sensor so there are the conditions that

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040
sensor so there are the conditions that
 

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.640
sensor so there are the conditions that
needs to be met before we believe that

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:31.650
needs to be met before we believe that
 

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.700
needs to be met before we believe that
technology will be the solution for the

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:34.710
technology will be the solution for the
 

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.800
technology will be the solution for the
future my worry is that at least in my

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:36.810
future my worry is that at least in my
 

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:37.970
future my worry is that at least in my
part of the world when we talk about

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980
part of the world when we talk about
 

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.490
part of the world when we talk about
21st century education the first thing

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500
21st century education the first thing
 

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.370
21st century education the first thing
that comes to mind is technology you

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380
that comes to mind is technology you
 

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.740
that comes to mind is technology you
know so everything now is based on

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:45.750
know so everything now is based on
 

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.290
know so everything now is based on
technology and therefore the budget that

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300
technology and therefore the budget that
 

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.450
technology and therefore the budget that
you talk about shifted everything goes

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460
you talk about shifted everything goes
 

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.460
you talk about shifted everything goes
the technology textbooks are now no

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:52.470
the technology textbooks are now no
 

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.560
the technology textbooks are now no
longer required because you can get it

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:54.570
longer required because you can get it
 

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.680
longer required because you can get it
online but you get it online maybe four

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:57.690
online but you get it online maybe four
 

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.510
online but you get it online maybe four
hours in the day after that you don't

00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520
hours in the day after that you don't
 

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.790
hours in the day after that you don't
have it anymore so this whole idea of

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800
have it anymore so this whole idea of
 

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.890
have it anymore so this whole idea of
technology being the solution needs to

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900
technology being the solution needs to
 

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.160
technology being the solution needs to
be clarified that particular sense

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:07.170
be clarified that particular sense
 

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.620
be clarified that particular sense
other comments mmm well I still think

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:09.630
other comments mmm well I still think
 

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.809
other comments mmm well I still think
that even though not all people all

00:37:11.809 --> 00:37:11.819
that even though not all people all
 

00:37:11.819 --> 00:37:13.700
that even though not all people all
individual can have their technology I

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:13.710
individual can have their technology I
 

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.289
individual can have their technology I
think that the more we can bring out

00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:15.299
think that the more we can bring out
 

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:17.809
think that the more we can bring out
technology the more we can send out in

00:37:17.809 --> 00:37:17.819
technology the more we can send out in
 

00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:19.880
technology the more we can send out in
this case information about what's going

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:19.890
this case information about what's going
 

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.069
this case information about what's going
on and I say technology can illustrate

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079
on and I say technology can illustrate
 

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:24.410
on and I say technology can illustrate
what's going on in the climate and all

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420
what's going on in the climate and all
 

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.740
what's going on in the climate and all
that with scientific basis and have more

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:27.750
that with scientific basis and have more
 

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.440
that with scientific basis and have more
people involved in what's going on but

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:30.450
people involved in what's going on but
 

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.079
people involved in what's going on but
without education of larger populations

00:37:33.079 --> 00:37:33.089
without education of larger populations
 

00:37:33.089 --> 00:37:35.510
without education of larger populations
of the society there will be no

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520
of the society there will be no
 

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.329
of the society there will be no
responders because food on the table is

00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.339
responders because food on the table is
 

00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:40.190
responders because food on the table is
more important than looking into the sea

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200
more important than looking into the sea
 

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.220
more important than looking into the sea
youtube somewhere else so I think that

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:43.230
youtube somewhere else so I think that
 

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.520
youtube somewhere else so I think that
spraying knowledge and giving this out I

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:46.530
spraying knowledge and giving this out I
 

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.890
spraying knowledge and giving this out I
think it's a good thing but we also have

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900
think it's a good thing but we also have
 

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.900
think it's a good thing but we also have
to have educated people on all levels

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:50.910
to have educated people on all levels
 

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:54.079
to have educated people on all levels
around the world to way to bring us in

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:54.089
around the world to way to bring us in
 

00:37:54.089 --> 00:37:59.630
around the world to way to bring us in
to something that take action yeah well

00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640
to something that take action yeah well
 

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.299
to something that take action yeah well
I think the technology is an obvious

00:38:02.299 --> 00:38:02.309
I think the technology is an obvious
 

00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:04.970
I think the technology is an obvious
asset here let's about climate change

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980
asset here let's about climate change
 

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.250
asset here let's about climate change
for instance just to sense the planet

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260
for instance just to sense the planet
 

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.010
for instance just to sense the planet
Earth and what is happening with climate

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020
Earth and what is happening with climate
 

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.740
Earth and what is happening with climate
and and other things around the world

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:11.750
and and other things around the world
 

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.170
and and other things around the world
the globe I think that is very important

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180
the globe I think that is very important
 

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.630
the globe I think that is very important
that we we have these pictures and they

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640
that we we have these pictures and they
 

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.130
that we we have these pictures and they
are visualized and they can be

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140
are visualized and they can be
 

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.049
are visualized and they can be
transmitted and we can use them in the

00:38:21.049 --> 00:38:21.059
transmitted and we can use them in the
 

00:38:21.059 --> 00:38:23.359

powerful that have them and reproduced
 

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.920
powerful that have them and reproduced
as the technology is really important

here and actually we do have a MOOC

00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859
here and actually we do have a MOOC

questions from the audience we can take
 

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.380
questions from the audience we can take
two or three questions and there is a

two or three questions and there is a
 

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.980
two or three questions and there is a
microphone so who would like to ask a

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:54.990
microphone so who would like to ask a
 

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:56.780

discussion and I wonder if it's not time

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:17.910
discussion and I wonder if it's not time

to decouple learning from

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:20.740
to decouple learning from
 

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:25.170
to decouple learning from
and academia because right now it's only

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:25.180
and academia because right now it's only
 

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.040

discussed on a national level often as
 

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.990
discussed on a national level often as
an average compared to other countries

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000
an average compared to other countries

like here in Sweden Pisa is very common

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:34.060
like here in Sweden Pisa is very common
 

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.980
like here in Sweden Pisa is very common
for example but learning must down on a

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:37.990
for example but learning must down on a
 

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:41.910
for example but learning must down on a
on a personal individuals and local

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920
on a personal individuals and local
 

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.160
on a personal individuals and local
level and go from that build from that

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.170
level and go from that build from that
 

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.640
level and go from that build from that
context and not from a global more

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:47.650
context and not from a global more
 

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:53.160
context and not from a global more
global anonymous level okay I I think we

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.170
global anonymous level okay I I think we
 

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.380
global anonymous level okay I I think we
touched this tension between the local

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:55.390
touched this tension between the local
 

00:39:55.390 --> 00:40:00.180
touched this tension between the local
and the global and we tried to follow

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:00.190
and the global and we tried to follow
 

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.790
and the global and we tried to follow
what you are suggesting but kind well

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800
what you are suggesting but kind well
 

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.900
what you are suggesting but kind well
and the industry level to industry yes

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:06.910
and the industry level to industry yes
 

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.300
and the industry level to industry yes
so yes and and lifelong learning again

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:09.310
so yes and and lifelong learning again
 

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.520
so yes and and lifelong learning again
you know it goes far beyond this is why

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:11.530
you know it goes far beyond this is why
 

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.410
you know it goes far beyond this is why
I also said you know the lines become
