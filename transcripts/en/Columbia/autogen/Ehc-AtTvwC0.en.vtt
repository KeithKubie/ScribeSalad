time so this so the good thing about
having an endowment is that you don't

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159
having an endowment is that you don't
 

00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:28.920
having an endowment is that you don't
have to go back each year and beg for

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:28.930
have to go back each year and beg for
 

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.690
have to go back each year and beg for
money we don't ask any legislature to be

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:33.700
money we don't ask any legislature to be
 

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.029
money we don't ask any legislature to be
generous and and we don't have to go to

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039
generous and and we don't have to go to
 

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.219
generous and and we don't have to go to
individual donors again at least for

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:38.229
individual donors again at least for
 

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:40.110
individual donors again at least for
that portion that's already here and

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120
that portion that's already here and
 

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.839
that portion that's already here and
invested forever so having this

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:42.849
invested forever so having this
 

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:45.030
invested forever so having this
endowment has been tremendously

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040
endowment has been tremendously
 

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.110
endowment has been tremendously
important for the other

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120
