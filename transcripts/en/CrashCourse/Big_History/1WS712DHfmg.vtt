00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
Hi, I'm John Green and welcome to Crash Course
Big History where today we are going to get a life.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.080
Or at least the Earth is going to
get a life.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.860
But first, today we have to start with a disclaimer.
The origin of life is in many ways a "blank

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.200
spot" in the pages of history. Like, the mystery
surrounding the big bang or dark matter - the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.260
origin of life is still pretty puzzling to
us. Like, thanks to scientific research, we

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
have a general idea of what needed to happen to
bring about life, but we're pretty fuzzy on the details.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.060
Mr Green, Mr Green! I mean, if we don't know,
then why are we studying it as history? Maybe

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.280
we should just like, let scientists figure
all that stuff out and then they'll get back

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.149
to us, like, after this class is over?

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.929
Well, Me From the Past, I'm sure the thousands
of scientists working on that question appreciate

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:45.360
your patience, but even when we have blank
pages in the annals of history, it's still history!

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.219
Like, there's still competing ideas
and theories about the presidency of Franklin

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.299
Delano Roosevelt, but the fact that there are
open questions doesn't mean it didn't happen!

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.139
Sometimes we don't have a clear narrative
of events, and it's up to us to collect more

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:02.600
evidence and refine those theories. But first,
we have to know about the current evidence

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.080
and the current theories. I mean, ultimately,
that's what history is!

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:15.060
[Theme Music]

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.960
I'm Hank Green, and this is still Crash Course
Big History. Last time we left off with a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.030
newly-born Earth that was molten hot and pelted
by asteroids. Then millions of years of torrential

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.689
rainfall cooled the surface and created the
first oceans.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.780
We know that life emerged in the oceans between
3.5 and 4 billion years ago. We have solid

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.750
fossil evidence for life 3.5 billion years
ago and many scientists are pretty confident

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.909
that life was around 3.8 billion years ago.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.070
It's pretty clear that life is a different
thing from the rest of the universe, but what

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.999
makes up that difference? I'm kind of surprised
that this turns out to be a super puzzling

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.759
question that we have yet to come up with
a 100% satisfying answer to. But some of the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.659
major characteristics of most life are: it
adapts to the environment, it has a metabolism

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.919
that processes energy to keep itself going
(like humans do with pizza), and it reproduces

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:05.239
- whether it be a cell splitting in two or
two animals... doing their thing in nature.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.000
Even these simple criteria have their problems
though. Some animals like mules are born unable

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.080
to have offspring. Some micro-organisms can
shut down their metabolisms for long stretches

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.680
of time, but neither are exactly dead or not
life.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.020
Given the incredible variety of species,
definitions for life are, by necessity, very broad.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.220
But one such definition by big historian Fred
Spire, is, and I quote "a regime that contains

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.690
a hereditary program for defining and directing
molecular mechanisms that actively extract

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.720
matter and energy from the environment, with
the aid of which, matter and energy are converted

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.560
into building blocks for its own maintenance,
and if possible, reproduction."

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.860
In other words, what makes you different from
a star is that while a star burns down till

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.720
it dies and doesn't actively float around the
cosmos looking for more fuel, a living organism

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.120
does actively seek out pizza to keep itself going,
preferably long enough to, you know, have some babies.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.240
But how do we know what we know? How do we
know that life is just a different kind of molecular

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.520
mechanism, not something more profound? Well,
we can test these claims. And we do! Using science.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.620
Because life looks so radically different
from the inanimate universe, people once thought

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.790
that life was made of completely different
stuff. Then, in 1828, a German chemist, Friedrich

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.690
Wöhler, used inorganic chemicals to synthesize
an organic chemical. This was a big deal - just

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.760
as Newton's theory of gravity showed that
the heavens and Earth followed the same physical

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.900
laws, Wöhler's experiment proved that life
and non-life follow the same chemical laws,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.100
which implied that life could emerge from
non-life.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.820
Even this idea wasn't completely new. For
centuries, the Aristotelian idea that life

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.800
just spontaneously emerged from non-life was
widely believed. For example, if you put some

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.710
rotten meat out in the sun, eventually the
meat would transform itself into maggots.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.370
You can probably work out the weaknesses in
this theory. Seventeenth century scientists

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.650
took meat and various other objects thought
to spontaneously generate life, boiled them

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.040
to kill off any eggs previously laid by insects,
sealed them in jars and nothing happened.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.230
Oh, Aristotle, first you told us that snot
was our brain coming out of our noses, and

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.580
now you made all those nice people waste their
steak dinner!

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.100
This, however, did not rule out some form
of life-force in the air. Some invisible force

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.250
from the Earth's atmosphere that could enter
an object and literally breathe life into

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.570
it. But spores from plants can also travel
in the air, as can microorganisms. So in the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.930
mid-nineteenth century, Louis Pasteur boiled
some organic broth, friendly to life and placed

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.560
it in a flask with a swan neck, to trap plant
spores in smaller particles. If a life-force

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.600
was in the air, it could enter freely, while
spores and other particles would get trapped

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.910
in the U-bend. And what happened? Nothing!
A century and a half later, those flasks are

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.460
still devoid of life. The conclusion? The
ancients were wrong. After a dose of claim-testing,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.350
it became clear that life must emerge from
the inanimate world by chemical processes

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.620
that are discoverable by science.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.490
But what did early life look like? Well, for
a whopping 2.1 billion of the 3.8 billion

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.870
years of the evolutionary epic, history was
made by tiny single-cell organisms called

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.160
prokaryotes. That's roughly 55% of the entire
story of life. Now, some of those prokaryotes

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.020
evolved about 1.7 billion years ago into slightly
bigger single-celled organisms called eukaryotes,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.220
and then, you know, that kept happening and
then eventually - us!

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.850
But for now, let's just talk about prokaryotes.
Prokaryotes lived in the seas and ate chemicals

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.590
in their surrounding environment. Now these
microscopic prokaryotes might not sound very

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.690
impressive, but they do make up the vast majority
of your family tree. They're also distant

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.730
relatives of the modern bacteria that are
everywhere, crawling around the room that

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.040
you're in right now, crawling all over you, crawling inside
of your intestines. That's right, somewhere, right now,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.860
there is a bacterium that will give you food poisoning,
in an under-cooked hamburger, and it is your cousin!

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.300
But the thing is, even in its earliest stages,
single-cell life was massively complex compared

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.930
to the inanimate universe. I mean, I know
these are tiny, little specks, but compared

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.530
to everything else that had happened on Earth
until them, they were an immense tangle of

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.710
chemical networks and building blocks.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.720
But how did an object as ridiculously complex
as a prokaryote first emerge? Well, first

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.630
of all, it's very difficult to think of how
life would form in an oxygen-rich atmosphere

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.210
like present-day Earth. Oxygen is kind of
a nasty, highly-reactive chemical. In fact,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.040
if the oxygen levels in this room were substantially
higher and I was to just rub my hands together

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.389
really fast, I could burst into flames! And
while that would make for a nice viral YouTube

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.000
video, I would rather not be on fire than
get lots of views!

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.669
3.8 billion years ago, the free oxygen content
of the atmosphere was at negligible levels,

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.280
which had some not-so-pleasant consequences.
For millions upon millions upon millions of

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.000
years, life dwelled fairly deeply in the ocean,
eating chemicals and staying where the Earth's

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.720
heat kept it warm. Eventually, some prokaryotes
floated near to the top of the ocean and started

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.240
using sunlight, water, and the carbon dioxide
that was abundant in the Earth's atmosphere

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.970
to sustain their own complexity using this
sweet chemical process they'd come up with

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.300
called photosynthesis. The waste product of
this chemical process is oxygen, and these

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.919
photosynthesizing prokaryotes pumped a lot
of it into the atmosphere.

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.800
By around 2.5 billion years ago the amount
of free oxygen in the atmosphere was up to

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.810
about 3%. Oxygen can be nasty, and so scores
and scores of tiny single-celled organisms

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.100
couldn't handle it, and died off in a massive
wave, sometimes known as The Oxygen Holocaust.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.610
So many species of single-celled organisms,
each with the potential to evolve into more

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.580
complex life were wiped out. Even at this
early stage, our evolutionary ancestors were

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.100
squeezed through a bottleneck. And this would
not be the last such disaster that nearly

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.130
wiped everything out. Next time you have a
bad day, remember that it is amazing that

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.310
you are alive at all, much less a member of
a self-aware species, living at the height

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.940
of human technological progress.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.880
Speaking of ancestors, somewhere between 1.6
and 2 billion years ago, the eukaryotes evolved.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.960
And because you, your dog, the chicken you
ate last week, and the mushroom you ate the

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.080
week before all descended from them, they
really put the "you" in "eukaryotes."

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.100
And eukaryotes contained organelles, like
cellular organs that enhanced their abilities.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.949
About 1.5 billion years ago, eukaryotes invented
sex. Up until that point, single-celled organisms

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:15.729
split in two or cloned, with no need to find
a partner for romance and DNA exchange.

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:21.900
Sexually reproducing eukaryotes possibly obtained
these abilities through cannibalism - just eating

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.510
each other, which may have led to some accidental
exchange of DNA. After that, the evolutionary

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.699
advantages of sex probably resulted in it
catching on. Having a partner means having

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:36.699
two sets of genes and thus a wider range of genetic
diversity from which evolution can pick and choose.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.959
Sex, is a huge deal. It enhanced evolution
and therefore deserves to be classed as one

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:45.389
of the most revolutionary advances in the
history of life on Earth. And, a huge leap

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:49.019
forward in the rise of complexities since
the very beginning of the Universe.

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:53.219
So where did these complex single-celled organisms
come from in the first place? Well, Charles

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.439
Darwin's own hypothesis was that life evolved
in some, quote, "warm, little pond, suitable

00:08:58.439 --> 00:09:03.189
for fostering life." Other scientists postulate
that life may have formed from organic chemicals

00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:08.040
next to the warmth of underwater volcanoes.
And still others champion the idea of panspermia

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.420
which states that life may have evolved elsewhere
in the solar system and then been transported

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.610
here by an asteroid, which seeded the Earth.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.439
Like I said, this is a 'blank spot', where
many different historical theories are seeking

00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:23.889
evidence to clarify what happened. It is possible,
actually, that this problem could be solved

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:25.910
in our lifetimes, which is pretty exciting.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.779
Anyway, whatever physical forces were at play,
primitive organic chemicals eventually came

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:34.199
together into balls with protective membranes.
They would've reproduced and proliferated

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:38.980
much as life does today, but the earliest
blobs of organic chemicals would have reproduced

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.629
clumsily, inaccurately, with many useful adaptations
getting lost. Essentially, these molecular

00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:46.829
mechanisms were badly programmed.

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:50.910
In 1950s, James Watson, Francis Crick, Mauris
Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin discovered

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:57.009
how living cells replicate, using DNA, or
deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is a double-stranded

00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:02.009
molecule that contains a list of orders for
how it wants a living cell to be constructed.

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:07.720
And then, a single strand, RNA, reads those
program orders and sets in motion the production

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.089
of the proteins necessary to accomplish them.
All life on Earth has DNA, which is one of

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:17.929
the reasons we know that all living things on Earth,
from farmers to fish, from moles to microbes,

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:22.959
have a common ancestor. It's why you share
98.4% of your DNA with a chimpanzee, and why

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:28.329
you share nearly half of your DNA with the
banana that it likes to eat. Not quite cannibalism,

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:30.399
but we do eat a lot of our distant cousins.

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:35.540
But where do DNA and RNA come from? Another
mystery. How could such complex programming

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.660
evolve from simpler organic forms? One leading
contender is the RNA World Hypothesis, which

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.540
postulates that there might've been an earlier
version of just RNA, which was capable of

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:50.059
both coding and self-replicating, and out
of which separate and more complex structures

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:55.029
evolved, DNA. DNA and RNA operate in extremely
complex ways themselves, which is what you'd

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:59.129
expect with something with as many connections
and varied building blocks as life.

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:02.749
By the way, we're not expecting you to come
away from this video with a complete understanding

00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:06.649
of how DNA works. There is a link in the description
to our Crash Course Biology video on DNA,

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:10.569
though, if you want this mind-boggling concept
to come down a few boggles on the boggles-scale.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:14.720
Remember this as well: when looking at a historical
narrative, it's always useful to know how

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.579
things work. But it is still more useful to
know why they work, because they can influence

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:24.559
the future sequence of events. Like, you don't
have to know exactly how to design, build,

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:29.360
assemble, and fire a fifteenth century longbow
to understand the French and English conflict

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.529
in the Hundred Years War; all you need to
know is that longbows made things pretty unpleasant

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:39.269
for a lot of French people. Like, "There's
a piece of wood sticking out of me!"-unpleasant.

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:44.089
DNA replication is an amazing, flabbergasting
process that allows life to copy itself and

00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:49.619
sustain its own complexity. It copies a living
organism with stunning precision. But even

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:55.399
this impeccable copying process can occasionally
be... somewhat, peccable. Once every billion

00:11:55.399 --> 00:12:00.329
copies or so, there is an error. These errors
result in a slight mutation. These can have

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:04.829
no effect, they can be very good, or they
can be very bad. If useful, it allows an

00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:09.360
organism to be more successful and likely
to pass on its genes. If not so useful, things

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.639
go poorly, and the gene does not get passed
on. On the scale of millions of years, these

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:18.739
copying errors are the engine of evolution
and the origin of new species. They allow

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:24.069
the tiny layer of fragile organic materials
sitting atop of the hulking geological structures

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:29.309
of the Earth to be shaped and reshaped like
play-doh from prokaryotes to eukaryotes to

00:12:29.309 --> 00:12:32.089
trilobites to dinosaurs to Abraham Lincoln.

00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:36.019
As Charles Darwin put it at the end of the
Origin of Species, "there is a grandeur in

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:40.420
this view of life, with its several powers,
having been originally breathed into a few

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:46.329
forms or into one, and that whilst this planet
has gone cycling on according to the fixed

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:51.949
law of gravity, from so simple a beginning,
endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:55.569
have been, and are being, evolved."

00:12:55.569 --> 00:12:57.109
More on that next time.
