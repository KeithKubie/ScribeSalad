suffering is you could give an example
of for instance of it let's see a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
of for instance of it let's see a
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.430
of for instance of it let's see a
terrifying lethal disease which you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
terrifying lethal disease which you
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.290
terrifying lethal disease which you
could detect in an embryo before

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
could detect in an embryo before
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.209
could detect in an embryo before
implanting it and decide that that's not

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
implanting it and decide that that's not
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.040
implanting it and decide that that's not
the embryo that you want to implant but

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
the embryo that you want to implant but
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810
the embryo that you want to implant but
that depends on you and I saying that's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
that depends on you and I saying that's
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.330
that depends on you and I saying that's
a terrifying lethal disease and that's a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
a terrifying lethal disease and that's a
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830
a terrifying lethal disease and that's a
decision that you and I need to make

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
decision that you and I need to make
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.990
decision that you and I need to make
them I really mean society needs to make

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
them I really mean society needs to make
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320
them I really mean society needs to make
in consensus so it's a time to emphasize

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
in consensus so it's a time to emphasize
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.390
in consensus so it's a time to emphasize
that idea that we're making decisions

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
that idea that we're making decisions
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.910
that idea that we're making decisions
like this really this issue came to a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
like this really this issue came to a
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.840
like this really this issue came to a
head when researchers in China decided

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
head when researchers in China decided
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.560
head when researchers in China decided
to take non-viable human embryos and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
to take non-viable human embryos and
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.960
to take non-viable human embryos and
decided to try to attempt changing a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
decided to try to attempt changing a
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.330
decided to try to attempt changing a
disease linked gene and that non-viable

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
disease linked gene and that non-viable
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700
disease linked gene and that non-viable
human embryo set it they were important

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
human embryo set it they were important
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.810
human embryo set it they were important
it's important to note that they were

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
it's important to note that they were
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.060
it's important to note that they were
non viable in the long run but it's also

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
non viable in the long run but it's also
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.350
non viable in the long run but it's also
important to note but that they were

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
important to note but that they were
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.819
important to note but that they were
indeed human embryos or very early human

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
indeed human embryos or very early human
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.740
indeed human embryos or very early human
embryos and that the proof of principle

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
embryos and that the proof of principle
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.090
embryos and that the proof of principle
experiment was launched so it's it's

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
experiment was launched so it's it's
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.230
experiment was launched so it's it's
created a worldwide set of questions

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
created a worldwide set of questions
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.990
created a worldwide set of questions
about what we can and cannot do with the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
about what we can and cannot do with the
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600
about what we can and cannot do with the
human genome the wrote eugenics was was

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
human genome the wrote eugenics was was
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850
human genome the wrote eugenics was was
paved with the best intentions and it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
paved with the best intentions and it
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.460
paved with the best intentions and it
was a series of you can almost see the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
was a series of you can almost see the
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.460
was a series of you can almost see the
world tipping towards horror step by

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
world tipping towards horror step by
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.139
world tipping towards horror step by
step by step you know it seemed like one

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
step by step you know it seemed like one
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880
step by step you know it seemed like one
iterative step didn't seem that much and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
iterative step didn't seem that much and
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.399
iterative step didn't seem that much and
yet as you accumulated all of these very

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
yet as you accumulated all of these very
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709
yet as you accumulated all of these very
soon you went from you know in Nazi

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
soon you went from you know in Nazi
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.770
soon you went from you know in Nazi
Germany in particular starting with

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
Germany in particular starting with
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.780
Germany in particular starting with
trying to eliminate or sterilize those

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
trying to eliminate or sterilize those
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.430
trying to eliminate or sterilize those
who were

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
who were
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.820
who were
somehow physically different from from

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
somehow physically different from from
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.930
somehow physically different from from
others all the way including folks who

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940
others all the way including folks who
 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.770
others all the way including folks who
were deaf

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
were deaf
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.510
were deaf
folks who had various neurological

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520
folks who had various neurological
 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.140
folks who had various neurological
diseases and then sort of marched

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150
diseases and then sort of marched
 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.900
diseases and then sort of marched
inexorably towards other forms of

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910
inexorably towards other forms of
 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.910
inexorably towards other forms of
identity including obviously Jews

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
identity including obviously Jews
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.070
identity including obviously Jews
Gypsies homosexuals and so forth so it's

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
Gypsies homosexuals and so forth so it's
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.500
Gypsies homosexuals and so forth so it's
worthwhile remembering that that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
worthwhile remembering that that
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.240
worthwhile remembering that that
progression that occurred in the 1930s

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250
progression that occurred in the 1930s
 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.490
progression that occurred in the 1930s
was was perceived by the citizens at

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
was was perceived by the citizens at
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.400
was was perceived by the citizens at
that time as part of a progression it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
that time as part of a progression it
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.710
that time as part of a progression it
was not as if you know all of a sudden

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
was not as if you know all of a sudden
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.240
was not as if you know all of a sudden
someone woke up there was a kind of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
someone woke up there was a kind of
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.990
someone woke up there was a kind of
glacial silence - the progression of

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000
glacial silence - the progression of
 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.580
glacial silence - the progression of
eugenics in Nazi Germany and in fact

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
eugenics in Nazi Germany and in fact
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.590
eugenics in Nazi Germany and in fact
there was a glacial silence from the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600
there was a glacial silence from the
 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.590
there was a glacial silence from the
United States about what was going on in

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600
United States about what was going on in
 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.420
United States about what was going on in
Nazi Germany if anything you know folks

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430
Nazi Germany if anything you know folks
 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.330
Nazi Germany if anything you know folks
in the United States applauded the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
in the United States applauded the
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.520
in the United States applauded the
eugenicist indices applauded the efforts

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
eugenicist indices applauded the efforts
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.960
eugenicist indices applauded the efforts
of Nazis of Nazi scientists in their

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970
of Nazis of Nazi scientists in their
 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.820
of Nazis of Nazi scientists in their
attempts to cleanse the cleanse their

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830
attempts to cleanse the cleanse their
 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.750
attempts to cleanse the cleanse their
populations of all sorts of evil and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760
populations of all sorts of evil and
 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.820
populations of all sorts of evil and
emancipate themselves so it's incredibly

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830
emancipate themselves so it's incredibly
 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.620
emancipate themselves so it's incredibly
important to remember that history when

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630
important to remember that history when
 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.930
important to remember that history when
we step as we are going to as we're

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940
we step as we are going to as we're
 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.930
we step as we are going to as we're
stepping towards the genetic

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
stepping towards the genetic
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.960
stepping towards the genetic
modification of human embryos or even to

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
modification of human embryos or even to
 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.670
modification of human embryos or even to
some extent the genetic modification of

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680
some extent the genetic modification of
 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.710
some extent the genetic modification of
other animals or plants we have to

other animals or plants we have to
 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.410
other animals or plants we have to
remember that it seems as if there's a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420
remember that it seems as if there's a
 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.090
remember that it seems as if there's a
progression but all of a sudden by the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100
progression but all of a sudden by the
 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.830
progression but all of a sudden by the
time from the beginning to the end you

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840
time from the beginning to the end you
 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.210
time from the beginning to the end you
may land up in a very different place

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220
may land up in a very different place
 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.360
may land up in a very different place
it's it's it's important also not to

it's it's it's important also not to
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.100
it's it's it's important also not to
throw as we enter new genetic

with the the genetic bathwater I mean
 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.490
with the the genetic bathwater I mean
it's important to remember that there's
