00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.480
Fans of Pixar know that the studio is a big
believer in planting easter eggs in each one

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.200
of their movies, giving viewers tiny nods
to other franchises, usually tucked into the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.800
background as a subtle joke.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.860
But before long, some people started wondering
if the easter eggs were actually a sign that

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.670
there actually existed a Pixar Universe, a
world in which every one of their movies was

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.670
set.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.870
This “Pixar Theory” may have started as
an online joke, but as more and more fans

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.990
started filling in the blanks and connecting
the movies, the case only got stronger.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.489
But the darkest twist came when fans realized
that if the films are all set in a Pixar Universe,

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.409
the story being told is a darker, more apocalyptic
one than fans ever imagined – and it all

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.010
begins with Brave.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.880
We’ll break down the strongest points of
the fan theory, and let you decide how convincing

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.409
it really with this entry in our Documentary
Series, The Hidden Truth Behind Disney Films:

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.210
The Pixar Theory.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.210
Brave

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.310
It wasn’t the first movie Pixar released,
but it’s set centuries ahead of the rest,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.210
in a Scottish kingdom some time in the Dark
Ages.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.560
The most important fact isn’t that the movie
starred a young girl as its hero, but that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.840
it introduced magic into Pixar’s world,
bringing everyday objects like brooms to life

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.000
with personalities of their own.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.340
That fact goes a long way in explaining why
toys, cars, or even fish can all think and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.000
feel like humans in Pixar’s greatest hits,
but it’s the witch who does the magic that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.149
may hold the key.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.969
We’ll come back around to her as the final
piece of the theory, but for now, just remember

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:53.990
that this little old lady’s magic relies
on some familiar tricks from later films.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.990
Toy Story

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.380
Assuming the toys of Toy Story are alive thanks
to magic, the actual themes of the trilogy

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350
deal with some serious topics.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.360
From the first movie, audiences learned that
toys loved their human owners, just as much

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.009
as they were loved by Andy.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.611
But as the movies went on, we learned humans
aren’t always kind, with Jessie’s owner

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:19.410
having abandoned her, the same way that Lotso’s
did in Toy Story 3.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.599
So people aren’t always kind to their magically-alive
possessions.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.160
It was the realization that those toys could
be downright evil once brought to life that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.400
sends a clear message for every movie set
in the future of Pixar’s universe.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.810
Finding Nemo &amp; Ratatouille

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.430
Having shown that toys aren’t as friendly
as their owners might hope, Pixar showed that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.599
the same was true with animals.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.319
Even the creatures that meant well didn’t
exactly see humans in the best light, regularly

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.430
outsmarting them, giving them orders, and
showing that human beings were usually afraid

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.700
and angry towards things they didn’t understand.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.340
And since the Pixar Universe looks an awful
lot like ours at this point, their predictions

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.849
for the future could also apply to our own.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.980
If that’s true, then we’re in serious
trouble, since the movies set in the future

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.959
of Pixar’s universe show an even scarier
side to humanity.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.319
Or at least, they would, if humans were still
in the picture at all.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.319
Cars

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.090
Where other Pixar movies took place in, around,
or alongside the world of humans, Cars was

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.370
the first one to remove them completely, essentially
replacing our world and the people in it with

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.629
cars, planes, and other vehicles that could
think and feel on their own.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.959
In our world, smart vehicles with artificial
intelligence are already being designed, with

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.780
experts warning that a truly advanced AI might
not be as friendly as the animals, insects,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.870
and toys of Pixar’s movies.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.189
But it’s not like intelligent cars would
be evil enough to rid the world of humans,

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:56.189
would they?

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.660
Cars offers a chilling riddle, since most
of the film’s sports, infrastructure and

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.340
world is obviously the same one built by humans,
existing before cars and machines could drive

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.410
themselves.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.939
Even if the toys and animals became smarter
than humans realized, leading to a rise of

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.031
machines claiming their superiority, that
still doesn’t answer the question: where

00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:19.110
did all of Pixar’s people GO?

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.340
WALL-E

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.740
Humans voyaged into space, that’s where.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.690
In the future shown in Wall-E, the world is
completely destroyed, turned brown and lifeless

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.690
by pollution and smog.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.060
But humans didn’t find anything better in
deep space, turning into lifeless, bored couch

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.850
potatoes who only do what the intelligent
machines around them tell them to do.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.889
Eventually, fans looked at Cars and wondered:
did people leave Earth because it was dying

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.139
from pollution, or did they just head into
space following robotic orders, with the planet

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.190
winding up polluted long after.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.220
As in the kind of pollution caused by billions
of cars taking over the planet?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.960
The theory obviously draws on plenty of imagination,
claiming that intelligent cars got sick of

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.300
people, like the toys and animals that already
felt the same in earlier movies.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.340
But with Wall-E being the only machine left
working on Earth, the plan backfired.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.310
The cars died off, leaving Earth ready for
humans to return.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.000
But here’s where the theory takes it’s
darkest turn, claiming Wall-E’s happy ending

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.450
was just an illusion.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.300
By returning to a dead planet without their
robotic leaders telling them what to do, humanity

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.750
went extinct – and their machines along
with them.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.690
Leaving the door open for a brand new type
of lifeform to take over…

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.710
Monsters, Inc.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:41.880
That’s right, the monsters rise up to take
humanity’s place, building their own society

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.210
from the rubble - a society that needed power
on a dried up planet.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.580
Apparently, as the fan theory claims, some
of the toys that weren’t destroyed – like

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.789
the ones collected by Wall-E – gave up their
secrets, telling the monsters about the humans

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.710
who helped them, cared for them, or were terrified
of them.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.490
Seeing a solution to their energy problems,
the Monsters realized that scaring those same

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.849
children could power their city.

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.080
There was one problem, though: humans were
already extinct.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.449
But you know those doors the monsters use
to scare human kids?

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.210
What if they weren’t just doors in space,
but time?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.539
And what if the little girl of the movie,
Boo, wasn’t ever going to give up her search

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.990
for the monster that lived in her closet?

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.770
Since we know magic exists in the Pixar Universe,
it’s possible that Boo grew up to use it

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.770
herself, hopping from door to door, and time
to time, trying to find Sully and hear the

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.360
real secrets about the Monster world.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.889
It’s these trips, the fans claim, which
caused all kinds of artifacts and references

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.830
to pop up across the movies set in different
places and times.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.630
Boo left them behind as she traveled, eventually
finding her way back to one place long, long

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.759
before the world we know took shape.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.759
Brave

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:04.009
Finally, we return to the magical old woman
in the woods, eager to turn Merrida’s mother

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:08.020
into a massive, hairy, monstrous bear to bring
them closer together.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.330
The same old witch who has carved pictures
of the monster Sully, and the Pizza Planet

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.180
truck from the modern day world sitting around
her hut.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.940
The clues all add up to Boo, after decades
of time-jumping landed her in the middle ages,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.740
where she used her magic from the future to
enchant everyday objects and animals – introducing

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.539
magic to the Pixar Universe, and completing
the entire loop.

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:33.639
It’s anything but simple, and some Pixar
fans might think it’s more of a waste of

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.729
time than a use of imagination.

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:40.440
But The Pixar Theory wins more believers every
year, as more and more movies from the studio

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.509
seem to back it up – or add a new twist
of their own.

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:44.590
What do you think of the idea?

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.080
Are there any clues that are even harder to
ignore, or details you think fans are ignoring

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.910
to keep their theory intact?
