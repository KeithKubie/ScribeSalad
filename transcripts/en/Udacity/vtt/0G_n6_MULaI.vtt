charge money.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.750
Try to charge the user who use it most.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.480
&gt;&gt; Also, think about profitability
from the very beginning.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.750
&gt;&gt; Have a strategy to identify
the challenges, and manage them.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.500

ways to monetize your product.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.890
