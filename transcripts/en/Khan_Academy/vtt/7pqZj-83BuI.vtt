00:00:00.828 --> 00:00:02.068
- [Voiceover] So let's go
it through another way,

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.380
'cause this is a really
interesting problem.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.493
Let's think about another way
that we could have tackled it.

00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:07.216
So once again, x is equal to 20,

00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:08.751
so this is a 20 degree angle,

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:13.445
And y is equal to 30,

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:16.097
so this is a 30 degree angle.

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.385
What is the value of z?

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:19.788
So the last way we did it,

00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:21.965
we constructed a line right over here

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:23.509
to figure out the value of z.

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.212
We were able to figure out
that angle, then that angle,

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:26.852
then this angle, then z.

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:28.424
Another way we could have done it,

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:31.233
is we could have constructed a line

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:34.523
right over here.

00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:36.766
And we could say, well look,

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:40.229
the measure of this angle is a degrees,

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:42.693
and let's say the measure of this angle

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:44.348
is b degrees.

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:45.864
So what do we know?

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:49.372
Well, we would know that a plus b,

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:53.719
plus z,

00:00:56.103 --> 00:00:58.308
they're all the interior
angles of this smaller triangle

00:00:58.308 --> 00:00:59.208
right over here,

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:01.748
so they're going to add up to 180.

00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:04.555
And what else do we know?

00:01:04.984 --> 00:01:07.329
Well, a plus x is this
whole angle right over here,

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:08.522
so let's write that down.

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:09.801
So if we have,

00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.938
so a plus x,

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.299
is this whole angle right over there,

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.419
and then we have

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:20.475
plus b plus x,

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:22.222
which is this whole angle over here.

00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:23.166
Actually let me not,

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.582
instead of writing x let me write,

00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:25.741
'cause we know x is 20.

00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:28.977
So a plus 20,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.512
plus b plus 20,

00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:37.792
is this whole angle right over there.

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.552
Then you add that to y, which is 30,

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.988
so plus 30,

00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:45.244
that's going to be equal to 180.

00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:46.911
Because that's this whole angle,

00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:48.608
plus that whole angle,
plus that whole angle.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.384
It's the interior, some
of the interior angles

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:51.983
of this larger triangle.

00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:53.852
And so let me write that down.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:56.371
That's going to be equal to 180.

00:01:56.648 --> 00:01:57.727
And what's interesting here is

00:01:57.727 --> 00:01:59.748
we can solve for what a plus b is.

00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:02.578
And if we know what a plus b
is, then we can solve for z.

00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:03.733
So let's do that.

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:07.536
So we're gonna get a plus b,

00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:11.954
and then let's see, we're gonna have 20,

00:02:12.518 --> 00:02:14.167
let me do this in a new color.

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:17.970
We're going to have 20 plus 20

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.982
plus 30.

00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:22.650
So 20 plus 20 plus 30 is 40 plus 30 is 70.

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.087
So plus 70

00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:28.365
is equal to 180.

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:31.183
Or subtract 70 from both sides,

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:35.381
you get a plus b

00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:37.698
is equal to 110.

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:39.914
And now we can just
substitute back up here.

00:02:39.914 --> 00:02:43.046
A plus b is equal to 110.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.774
So we have z plus 110 is equal to 180,

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:51.786
or z would be equal to 180

00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:53.823
minus 110.

00:02:55.038 --> 00:02:56.888
I'm just subtracting 110 from both sides

00:02:56.888 --> 00:02:58.659
of this equation right over here.

00:02:59.623 --> 00:03:03.499
And we would get z is equal to 70.

00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:04.814
And we're done!

00:03:04.814 --> 00:03:06.632
So there's many ways to actually tackle

00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:10.562
this pretty interesting
problem right over here.
