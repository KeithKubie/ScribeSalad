00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:04.837
BILL COSBY WAS
ONE OF MY IDOLS I WENT TO
 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.506
HOWARD UNIVERSITY, HISTORICALLY
BLACK COLLEGE IN WASHINGTON,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.776
DC, THERE LARGELY BECAUSE OF A
SHOW CALLED A DIFFERENT WORLD

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.179
WHICH WAS THE PRODUCT OF BILL
COSBY'S GENIUS AND HIS 

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.380
INVESTMENT IN BLACK COLLEGES.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:18.818
I WENT TO WATCH COSBY SPEAK WHEN
I WAS A SOPHOMORE AND HE SAT

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:21.387
THERE AND TOLD US WE WEREN'T
GOOD ENOUGH AND WE NEEDED TO

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.924
PULL OUR PANTS UP AND I STILL
WAS NOT WILLING TO SHAKE THIS

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:29.729
IDEA OF MY GREAT HERO WHO WAS
THE REASON I AM A FIRST

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:30.897
GENERATION COLLEGE GRADUATE.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.901
I AM HERE BECAUSE OF YOU I AM
SUPPOSED TO GROW UP AND BE A

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.703
HUCKSTABLE, RIGHT? HAVE THE
PERFECT HUSBAND AND PERFECT

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:41.541
BROWNSTONE IN BROOKLYN AND AT
THIS POINT IN LIFE I AM A SINGLE

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:46.646
MOTHER AND I ENDED UP BEING A
SINGLE MOTHER ALMOST TWO YEARS

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.347
AGO, FAILED RELATIONSHIP, THESE
THINGS HAPPEN.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.283
&gt;&gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT  FAILED
RELATIONSHIP 

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:52.985
&gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.322
FIRST UNFOLDED AND I REALIZED I
WILL BE A COPARENT AND NOT

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:59.759
CLAIRE HUCKSTABLE I THOUGHT I
LET THIS MAN AND THIS IDEA HE

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:02.228
CREATED DOWN.

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.163
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU FELT LECTURED BY
HIM.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.332
&gt;&gt; I FELT LECTURED BY HIM AND
NOW I'M LIKE, HOLD ON, HOMEY

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.068
WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN YOU
WERE TELLING

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:11.671
PEOPLE LIKE MY PARENTS AND
TELLING ME, WHEN YOU WERE

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:16.042
TELLING YOUNG BLACK THEN THAT
ARE PROTESTING IN THE STREETS OF

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.845
FERGUSON WHO HAVE THEIR PANTS
DOWN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:22.148
AND THAT'S HOW THEY DRESS , THAT
WE WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:26.486
&gt;&gt; I GET THE HYPOCRISY THAT
PEOPLE FEEL, BUT TO ME IT IS A

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.589
SIMPLE CASE OF HERE IS A FAMOUS
GUY WHO PEOPLE PROTECTED AND

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.792
BECAUSE OF HIS FAME NOBODY
WANTED TO BELIEVE IT.
