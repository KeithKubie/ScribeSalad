MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Hello and welcome

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.710
to "What's New in
Google Play Services,"

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.270
and the first thing
we want to know

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.700
is, are you enjoying Google I/O?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.042
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:28.250
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That was
even better than I thought.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.150
Are you enjoying Google I/O?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.150
That's great.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.870
We're loving Google I/O.
Google I/O is great.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.240
It's like having one of
those birthday parties

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.600
when you were a child.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.710
It's exciting.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.510
It's something to
look forward to.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.699
It's a big party.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
you know, sometimes I

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.040
feel like working at I/O is like
one of his birthday parties.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.845
It's lots and lots of work but
it's a whole lot of fun, too.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.762
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And
speaking of fun, today,

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:57.470
we're going to talk
about something which

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.360
is a lot of fun,
building great apps

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.520
and using a key
technology in doing so,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.560
Google Play Services, because
if you use Google Play Services,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.677
you will build better apps.

00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:11.260
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Because today, there

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.200
are now more than 17 top level
APIs in Google Play Services

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.930
and we're adding new
capabilities all the time,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.580
and these APIs are available
to you as a developer

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.840
so that you can build these
better apps that Magnus

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.600
is talking about.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.308
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And
Google Play services

00:01:25.308 --> 00:01:27.950
are being pushed to more
than a billion devices

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.910
for each release.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.270
That means that your audience
is a massive one where

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.450
you can promote yourself
and your business.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
that leads you to earning.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.500
Did you know that in the
last 12 months alone,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.440
developers of Play Store apps
have earned over $7 billion?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.790
And this is what we believe
is a great demonstration

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.059
of the economies of scale
that are available for you.

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:50.850
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And
it doesn't stop there.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.000
Since last year, we have
released five new versions

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.810
of Google Play services.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.410
That's one release
almost every second month

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.330
packed with new
functionality for you

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.987
to use when you
develop your apps.

00:02:04.987 --> 00:02:07.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: But our
question to you is this.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.840
Are you capitalizing on
this massive opportunity?

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140
Are you thinking mobile first
and are you using Google

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.802
Play Services to think mobile
first in your development?

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:16.260
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Because at Google,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
we are super committed
to the mobile revolution,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.320
and a big part of
that is to provide

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.200
all of these great services
that we have in our data centers

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.400
running all over the world.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
a big looking data center.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.620
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: It is a
nice looking data center.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.550
And take all of those
services and make

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.900
them available on all of the
mobile devices out there.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.290
And we are pretty good
at building data centers,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.540
so we have lots of value there
to provide to mobile devices.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.680
And Google Play Services is
the key integration layer

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.110
that makes this possible
between the data

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.990
center and the mobile device.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: Because this
helps us as Google and you

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.300
as application developers to
push the boundaries of what's

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.550
possible together.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.520
And as Henry Ford once said,
"If everyone is moving forward

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.330
together--

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.664
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: --success
takes care of itself."

00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:03.330
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Wait a second, Magnus.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.010
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: What now?

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: We've
forgotten something.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.110
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Oh no.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.560
What did we forget?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.270
LAURENCE MORONEY:
We're not just doing

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.436
a list of all the stuff
that's in Google Play Store.

00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:11.000
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Oh, that's right.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.480
We're also handing
out some swag.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.690
Are you interested in swag?

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.124
All right.

00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:21.540
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You can take it.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.860
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: OK.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm worried.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.440
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Let's
see how this works now.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.148
So this is the way
this is going to work.

00:03:26.148 --> 00:03:30.130
At various parts of this
presentation, we will go out

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.880
and we will say,
"Google Play Services,"

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.154
and then you will say, "rocks."

00:03:38.154 --> 00:03:40.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
it's in Comic Sans font,

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.160
too, if you've noticed.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.920
We actually got to use
that in a presentation.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.860
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Are
you ready to try that?

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.980
All right.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.060
Google Play Services.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.910
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.868
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Great.

00:03:54.112 --> 00:03:55.320
Let's try that one more time.

00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:02.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: This
one's going to go far.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.850
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Is
this really packed?

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.641
LAURENCE MORONEY: This
one's really packed.

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:06.760
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Oh my.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.718
LAURENCE MORONEY: Anybody
got a catcher's mitt?

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.759
Let's try a different one.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.550
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: We
could try it like this.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.730
I mean, we can try.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.438
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Let's see what happens.

00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:21.070
Let me just hide
behind the podium.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.700
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Are you
ready in the front row?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.910
Google Play Services.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.180
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.180
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Whoa.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.031
LAURENCE MORONEY: Whoo.

00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:31.530
Bullseye.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.560
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: There you go.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.130
OK.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.210
Let's keep this party going.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.610
And what can be a better
place to start than games?

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.080
Have you ever tried to
set up a multi player game

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.670
and had technical challenges?

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh gosh, yeah.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.405
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:49.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's a pain.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.742
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
It's terrible, right?

00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:52.450
You're fiddling around
with the controls.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.840
You can't find
the configuration.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.490
Well, the Nearby Connections
API solves all of that.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.580
It just takes technology
completely out of the way

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.240
so you and your friends
can focus on the fun.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.220
It turns every smartphone
into a flexible controller,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.970
and since it's a
touchscreen, you

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.470
can use any types of controls.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.439
You're not bounded by
these physical things

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.480
that you see in consoles.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.400
LAURENCE MORONEY: So I could
use this instead of an Xbox

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.490
controller?

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.875
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Exactly.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.440
It's a remote controller.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.580
And then you can
display the game action

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.030
on a central screen
like a big tablet

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.000
or an Android TV or something
like that, for example.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.860
And of course, this thing is
not limited to just games.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.260
It can be used for any
type of apps out there.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.710
Another thing that we launched
for Play Game Services

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.200
is Play Game
Analytics, essentially

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.260
a analytics platform built
into all of the games

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.680
that you create that
helps you to get data

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.160
to understand your players,
to manage and set your revenue

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.100
targets, and also identify
hotspots in your game.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.820
These are three key things
to monetize on your game,

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.060
and those things were previously
done only by big studios

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.490
with big budgets.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.120
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I don't have

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.460
to do any kind of
development, right?

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.760
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: No.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.390
There is no coding whatsoever.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.750
All of this is
automatically recorded

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.260
when you use these APIs.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: And while
mobiles like this are great,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.670
the thing that makes
them really portable,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.070
this tiny little screen,
can be a limitation

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.200
when you want to share
content with your friends.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.590
It's hard to huddle over
a small screen like this.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.094
As a result, we released
Cast and the Cast SDK

00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:19.260
that would allow you to
reflect this on a big screen

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.690
like the ones behind me.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.814
Now, in addition to that,
in the last 12 months,

00:06:22.814 --> 00:06:24.980
we released something called
the Remote Display API,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.780
and what the Remote
Display API does

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.464
is it removes the
boundary of mirroring

00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:29.630
that you would have to have.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.060
So now you can drive independent
content on this screen

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.180
and on that screen.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.510
And as a result,
like maybe Magnus,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.720
we're both big hockey fans.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.700
Any hockey fans here?

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.942
Nice, nice.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.650
So Magnus and I are
both big hockey fans,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.129
and we could be watching
a game on the big screen

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:47.170
and chatting with each
other on our small screen,

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.517
and I could be telling him how
all those Swedish players suck.

00:06:50.517 --> 00:06:51.850
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: They are great.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.308
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Oh Magnus, sorry.

00:06:53.308 --> 00:06:54.267
It's your turn to talk.

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:55.099
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Oh.

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:55.690
I see.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.830
Many times I've thought, if
I build it, they will come,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.790
and that's really,
really tough, isn't it?

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.970
And it's not even enough, right?

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.791
You also have to monetize on
the stuff that you're building,

00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:07.290
right?

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.440
You have to earn money in
order to improve your game

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.530
and for your business to grow.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.370
So therefore, mobile ads
is a perfect way to do this

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.650
and it is at no
cost to the user.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.530
So the Ads team that
we have, they're

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.240
working really,
really hard on making

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.110
all of those mobile
ads as relevant

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.702
as possible to the user.

00:07:28.702 --> 00:07:30.160
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So does that mean

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.070
if we're watching
our hockey game,

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.820
I'm not going to
get ads for diapers?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.361
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: No, you're not
going to get ads for diapers.

00:07:36.361 --> 00:07:38.480
You're going to get sports ads.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.510
So this means that users will
get relevant ads, ads they will

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.340
actually be delighted to see.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.500
And if the users are getting
delighted by the ads,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.550
then the advertisers
will be delighted,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.180
and you as app developers
will also be delighted.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.869
A win, win, win.

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:55.410
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And a constant pain

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.820
point when you're building
applications is managing

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.940
sign-in for your users.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.440
It's a pain for you
because you have

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.810
to build the
infrastructure and you

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.726
have to secure that
infrastructure for signing

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:07.340
folks in, and it's a pain for
your users to remember yet

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.590
another username and password.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.150
What do I use to
sign into this app?

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.759
What do I use to
sign into that app?

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:14.050
One of the things we've
shipped in Google Play services

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.830
is Sign In with Google, and the
idea behind Sign In with Google

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.380
is it manages all
of that for you.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.240
Your users have a
much better experience

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.370
because they can just use their
existing Google IDs to sign in

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.180
and they don't have to remember
a whole new set of credentials,

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.554
and you end up having the
security of knowing that you've

00:08:28.554 --> 00:08:30.800
got this great bulletproof
infrastructure behind you

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.633
so you don't need to
build everything that's

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:35.194
needed to actually
support these end users.

00:08:35.194 --> 00:08:36.360
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Swag break.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.400
Now Google Play Services.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.005
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:43.020
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Whoa.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.860
How about that?

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.780
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You almost got him.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.680
So hang on.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.210
I think we've got a really
quiet crowd here today.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.670
Who wants Magnus to shoot
a T-shirt your away?

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.385
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:54.385 --> 00:08:56.010
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Which side is louder?

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.520
Is it this side?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.429
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:58.429 --> 00:08:59.970
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Or is it this side?

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.305
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Whoa.

00:09:02.305 --> 00:09:04.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: Maybe give
these two-- is it this side?

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.689
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:05.689 --> 00:09:07.230
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Or is it this side?

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.079
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:09.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh boy.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.605
That's close.

00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:11.010
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: I think per
person, they're louder here.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.890
Let's go here.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.960
Here we go.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.147
Whoa.

00:09:15.147 --> 00:09:17.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: When I
rehearsed this yesterday,

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.560
I ended up throwing
the remote by accident,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.245
so I have to be really careful
not to throw it this time.

00:09:23.245 --> 00:09:24.370
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: All right.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.480
Now turning to an
API that I think

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.350
is a hidden gem in the
Google Play Services

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.720
family, Google Drive.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.720
Did you know that every single
user of Google on the planet

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.800
has 15 gigabytes of storage
available right there free

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.926
of charge and ready to use?

00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:43.758
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
a lot of gigabytes.

00:09:43.758 --> 00:09:45.130
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah, 15 gigs.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.200
How can your app help
them use that storage?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.320
With Google Drive, Sign In for
Google, all of that capacity

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.240
is sitting right there already
authenticated and ready

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.530
for your app to use.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
in addition to that,

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.810
you can take advantage
of analytics,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.189
and analytics isn't just
about crunching numbers.

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:06.480
Really, it's about understanding
your users so that you

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.126
can continually delight them.

00:10:08.126 --> 00:10:09.500
Let me give a
couple of examples.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.080
If you built a mobile app that's
got a lot of screens in it,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.450
a lot of the time,
your users are going

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.741
to be leaving after one screen.

00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:16.520
Maybe it's your game
over screen in a game

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.260
or maybe it's your
hockey app where

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.968
as soon as they show
the Swedish players,

00:10:19.968 --> 00:10:21.770
everybody wants to leave.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.170
Sorry, Magnus.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.249
You can actually use
analytics to track this

00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:28.790
and you can see what it is about
my app that's causing people

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.572
to leave, and I can
follow up on that

00:10:30.572 --> 00:10:32.144
and maybe improve
my app in that way.

00:10:32.144 --> 00:10:33.810
Or my personal favorite
is when it comes

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.520
to localizing my application.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.670
Now, it's easy to make a finger
in the air estimate and say,

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.200
the next language
I need to have is

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.420
French or Spanish or Mandarin
Chinese or something like that.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.950
But when using
Google Analytics, I

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.360
might find out hidden
knowledge that maybe my app

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.592
is the most popular app
in Turkey or Armenia

00:10:49.592 --> 00:10:51.175
or some other country
like that and it

00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:53.580
would be smarter for
me to localize it

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.392
so that one to delight
my users in that country.

00:10:56.392 --> 00:10:58.350
There's just so many ways
that you can do this.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.725
There's so many
ways that you can

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:01.789
understand your users so
that you can continually

00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:02.330
delight them.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.690
I'm an analytics geek.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.620
I could just talk
about it all day.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.730
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: No,
no, no, no, Laurence.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.010
Let's not do that.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.140
I mean, we have lots
of stuff to cover here.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.473
LAURENCE MORONEY: We've got
Google Play Services, right?

00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:12.950
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Let's instead
talk about Android Pay.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.480
Mobile payments are
hot, if you didn't know,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.350
and Android Pay is
the technology that

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.000
makes this physical thing that
we carry around us every day,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.207
and it gets bigger and
bigger for every year

00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:24.290
as you pile up additional
credit cards and loyalty

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.090
programs into it, make
all of that content

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.030
be integrated into
your mobile device.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.890
So that's from a
user perspective,

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.730
but for you developers,
there's also great value

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.580
because Android Pay brings
money into your app.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.110
It allows you to deal with
trading physical goods

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.366
and get paid for them.

00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:43.740
There's also an
aspect, if you're

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.040
developing apps for charity,
where you can donate money

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.260
using Android Pay.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.650
So if you think about
this, what Android Pay does

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.680
is it takes the physical
world of commerce

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.270
and taking that into
the digital world,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.370
and your app is sitting
right there in the middle,

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.464
connecting the user
and the merchant.

00:12:02.464 --> 00:12:04.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
talking about connecting

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.040
the dots, another technology
that's in Google Play Services

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.364
is Google Cloud Messaging.

00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:09.780
And if you've ever
wanted to build

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.160
some kind of infrastructure
that provides notifications

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.987
to your users and asynchronous
notifications that gets synced

00:12:14.987 --> 00:12:16.820
across all of their
devices, you've probably

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.280
realized this is pretty hard
to do in a way that's easy

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.430
and it's pretty hard to do in
a way that's battery friendly,

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.305
but if you build with
Google Cloud Messaging,

00:12:23.305 --> 00:12:24.840
you'll get exactly all of that.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.540
It's all about asynchronous
messaging from the cloud

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.816
to your users and it's
at zero cost to you.

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:30.690
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hey.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:31.420
What did you say?

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.670
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Zero cost to you.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.530
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Zero cost?

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Zero cost.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.310
You can keep your
wallet in your pocket.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.100
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: How
can it be zero cost?

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.766
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Because we're awesome.

00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:42.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.979
So we've added the concept
of Topics to this recently,

00:12:45.979 --> 00:12:48.020
and if you've used Google
Cloud Messaging Topics,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.210
and we saw a little bit of it
in the keynote this morning.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.793
And the idea behind
Topics is that you

00:12:51.793 --> 00:12:54.770
can set types of messages that
your users will subscribe to.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.570
So for example, I live
up north in Seattle

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.137
near the Canadian
border, and I love

00:12:58.137 --> 00:13:00.720
on weekends during the winter,
because I manage a hockey team,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.819
to go across into Canada and
get slaughtered at hockey.

00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:06.360
But if I'm in that
country, and maybe

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.110
you've built a news application,
and your news application

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.640
is going to be delivering
news to an American audience

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.515
and your news application
could be delivering

00:13:13.515 --> 00:13:14.910
to a Canadian audience.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.740
I could pick the topic
of Canada and just

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.420
subscribe to news in that.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.440
And those kind of topics just
make it a lot more portable,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.800
make it a lot easier to
use, and like we said,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.746
it's at zero cost to you.

00:13:25.746 --> 00:13:27.120
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
And for Maps, we

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.340
added a new toolbar
that gives users

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.610
that you have access to
navigation immediately.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.360
Lite mode maps are also
introduced into the mobile API,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.090
allowing you to display
a lighter version of Maps

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.970
if you don't need the full
blown maps experience.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:43.977
And combined with--

00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:45.560
LAURENCE MORONEY:
--location, then you

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.330
can start thinking
in terms of building

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.225
hyper-local applications.

00:13:49.225 --> 00:13:50.600
And you've probably
used Location

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.725
and you're probably familiar
with Location Services

00:13:52.725 --> 00:13:54.260
and apps, but one
really cool thing

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.770
that's been added
in the last year

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.000
is the concept of an in
place location dialog.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.359
And the idea behind this
is if you've ever opened up

00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:03.400
an app that uses location,
and if you're like me,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.090
you turn Location
off to save battery,

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.755
and you open up the app and
it says, "Location services

00:14:07.755 --> 00:14:08.380
are turned off.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.280
Please enable them."

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.030
So you exit the app,
you go into Settings.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.710
You find Location in Settings,
you turn on Location.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.710
You then exit Settings,
you go back to your app,

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.980
and it's like--

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:16.950
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's awful.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: It is.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.636
It's a lot of work
for the user and it's

00:14:19.636 --> 00:14:20.710
very user hostile, right?

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.120
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.661
LAURENCE MORONEY: Shall we have
a moment of silence for that?

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.547
But now with the In
Place Location dialog,

00:14:27.547 --> 00:14:29.130
the idea is you as
a developer, if you

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.410
use this in your application,
that pain for the user

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.510
just goes away and you
make their experience

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.785
that much better.

00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:37.530
Uh oh.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.110
It's time for a--

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.270
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Google Play Services.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.220
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.986
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's good.

00:14:43.986 --> 00:14:45.360
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Oh, nice catch.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.130
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's
a pretty good one.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.432
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:14:47.432 --> 00:14:48.242
Got one more?

00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:49.950
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah,
I've got one more.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.356
Anyone want some swag?

00:14:51.356 --> 00:14:52.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.410
LAURENCE MORONEY:
See if you can hit

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.220
the cameraman with this one?

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.636
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: This is one
of those, again, that can hit

00:14:56.636 --> 00:14:58.820
the control tower over there.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.259
So 300 PSI.

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:01.300
That's going to be great.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.540
Google Play Services.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.932
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:15:05.932 --> 00:15:06.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Whoa.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:07.630
Nice.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.879
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That
went way over there.

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:12.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
a lot of new stuff

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.670
that we've spoken about.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.820
That was a good shot.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.736
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:15:15.736 --> 00:15:16.327
It's great.

00:15:16.327 --> 00:15:17.910
LAURENCE MORONEY:
There's so much more

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.510
that we can talk about.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.650
Why don't we, David
Letterman style,

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.650
do a top five countdown
of some of these things?

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.060
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
That sounds great.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.840
Yeah, let's do that,
but we're developers.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.410
It needs to be a 0x5 countdown.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.701
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's right.

00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:29.890
We've got to do it in hex.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.000
But then again, as
we're developers,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.760
we should start
counting from 0x4

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.490
because engineers count from--

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.090
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Zero.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:37.780
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, that's right.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.690
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Let's try that again.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.940
Because engineers count from--

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.620
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: Much better.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.964
So I think it's
great to have apps,

00:15:43.964 --> 00:15:46.130
and I love some of the apps
that I have on my phone,

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.260
but sometimes discovering
apps can be very difficult.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.200
So for me, it's great
that I find crazy hockey

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.284
apps that Magnus gives me
or those irritating tap,

00:15:54.284 --> 00:15:56.741
tap, tap games-- you know the
ones that I'm talking about--

00:15:56.741 --> 00:15:58.820
that my son usually
gives me, and a great way

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.440
to discover new apps is through
friends and through family

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.910
and through people
that you trust.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:08.870
So we picked number 0x4
on our countdown to be

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.940
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: App
Invites, where friends

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.570
help friends find great apps.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.120
Apps Invite provides
you with an API

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.190
as developers that can
percent a simple UI for which

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.980
the users of your app can
invite other users to install

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.930
the app as well.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.060
So I'm, for example,
using an app,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.240
of course, where I can see
Swedish hockey players,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.770
so this allows me to invite
my friends to use this app.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.360
My friends get the invite,
they install the app,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.710
they engage with the content.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.790
Everybody wins.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.560
And in particular, you,
the application developer,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.200
wins, since you get free word
of mouth marketing for your app.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.450
There is nothing better than
a friend referral of your app.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.200
And of course, there
are controls in place

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.867
to protect the user
experience for this.

00:16:55.867 --> 00:16:58.158
LAURENCE MORONEY: So shall
we celebrate the App Invites

00:16:58.158 --> 00:16:58.664
API with a--

00:16:58.664 --> 00:17:00.080
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
That sounds good.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.730
Google Play Services.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.397
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:04.271
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm
going to show some love

00:17:04.271 --> 00:17:05.619
to this side of the room.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:06.950
You folks ready?

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.230
This thing's got a
bit of recoil, so.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.329
Whoa.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.969
Almost.

00:17:12.969 --> 00:17:14.161
Shall we do one more?

00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:15.910
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Anyone
want one of these?

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.014
Good catch over there.

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:21.861
He I gave it away.

00:17:21.861 --> 00:17:24.069
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, so
when Magnus reached the back

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.680
of the room, it was at 300 PSI.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.610
I've just put it to 600.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.320
No, only kidding.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.342
Whoa, nice.

00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:33.800
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Watch the screens.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:37.800
All right.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.690
And we've already spoken a
bit about maps and location

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.520
and the importance of having
an accurate location to offer

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.480
the best possible services, but
it's not all about location,

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:47.980
right?

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.800
It's about places, and there's
no place like home, right?

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:57.575
So therefore, 0x3 on
our countdown list is--

00:17:57.575 --> 00:17:59.130
LAURENCE MORONEY:
The Places API,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.960
and there really is
no place like home,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.510
or if you've watched
me on YouTube,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.426
there's no place like
the nearest coffee shop,

00:18:04.426 --> 00:18:06.750
and that's what the
Places API is all about.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.250
It's got over 100
million locations in it,

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.445
and we saw lots of cool
stuff about the Places API

00:18:11.445 --> 00:18:13.820
and the things that you can
do with Places in the keynote

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.130
this morning.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.470
One story I like to tell
was a couple of days ago,

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.140
I've been to San
Francisco so many times

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.020
and I've never been to
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.150
So a couple of days ago, I went
to check out the Golden Gate

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.070
Bridge, and it's beautiful
and it's an awesome thing.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.680
And I was using an
app that showed me

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.240
that there was some latte
art in a coffee shop

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.490
that wasn't too far away and
I had to go check it out,

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.031
and this was the
kind of thing that I

00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:35.810
discovered from an app that
was using the Places API.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.770
So think about your app
and the kind of things

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.120
that you can do in your app.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.980
You can give your users
access to what's available

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.250
all around them at this
moment in time, particularly

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.310
when they're not at home, when
they're traveling somewhere.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.695
They can discover
new things that

00:18:47.695 --> 00:18:49.150
will actually delight them.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.100
And it's great to build
a generic app that

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.090
has coffee shop details or ski
run details or ice rink details

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.040
or anything like that.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.470
When you can build
one that takes

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.830
advantage of this rich
information about all

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.400
of these places, over
100 million places,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.920
think about how you can delight
your users with apps that

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.490
do that, and the time to
build apps that does this,

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.132
I believe, is right now.

00:19:11.132 --> 00:19:12.340
So are we going to celebrate?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.840
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
So let's celebrate.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.310
Yes, the Places API.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.600
Am I doing this right now?

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.372
I'm kind of forgetting
as I go along here.

00:19:19.372 --> 00:19:21.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: Have you
cranked it all the way up?

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.720
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm
going to hide again.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.652
Google Play Services.

00:19:24.652 --> 00:19:25.318
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.210
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That
came in pretty fast.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.210
This is not an exact
science by no means.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.360
It all depends how
you tape the shirts.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.437
Anything can happen.

00:19:40.437 --> 00:19:42.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: We had so
much fun preparing for this.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.440
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Google Play Services.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.270
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.436
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Here we go.

00:19:48.164 --> 00:19:49.080
Good catch over there.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice, and is
that a Portland Trailblazers

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.592
hat I see?

00:19:52.592 --> 00:19:53.300
AUDIENCE: Browns.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.160
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Cleveland Browns,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.160
and you can catch a ball.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.660
Nice.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.070
And this brings us to number
0x2 on our countdown, which is--

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.400
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: App Indexing.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.980
With more and more apps
coming out every day,

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.260
it's getting harder and
harder for the users

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.890
out there to discover your app.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.860
App Indexing solves
this by providing you

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.430
with the capability to take
specific content in your app

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.990
and surface that
through this API

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.100
and make it part of the
Google Search Engine Index.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.380
That means that users that are
using Google search out there

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.250
searching for this
type of content

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.360
can actually discover your apps.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.010
It's a great new feature,
and the search integration

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.310
goes even beyond this.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.620
Your users can now
engage with your app

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.370
through Google Voice
Search commands.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.977
So for example, OK, Google.

00:20:54.977 --> 00:20:56.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: Search
restaurants nearby?

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.740
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Search for
restaurants or hotel nearby.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm hungry.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.400
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
I'm hungry, too.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
don't have any food,

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.530
so I think I'm just
going to celebrate

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.488
by launching some swag.

00:21:03.488 --> 00:21:04.250
What do you think?

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.640
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
That sounds good.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.973
LAURENCE MORONEY: So can we
have a Google Play Services?

00:21:07.973 --> 00:21:09.197
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:21:09.197 --> 00:21:10.030
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Oh.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.126
That's going to hit the screen.

00:21:12.126 --> 00:21:13.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.062
All righty.

00:21:17.062 --> 00:21:19.120
One more?

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.870
All righty.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.270
Let's try this side of the room.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.318
Can we have a Google
Play Services?

00:21:23.318 --> 00:21:26.160
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.507
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Almost the camera.

00:21:28.507 --> 00:21:30.840
LAURENCE MORONEY: I wasn't
aiming at the camera, honest.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.710
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Were you aiming?

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: No.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.125
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hey, Laurence.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.083
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah?

00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:36.570
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: What's
up with this countdown?

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.000
There's so much stuff and
we still have two left.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.720
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's true, yeah.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.840
Well, that just
shows how much good

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.700
stuff we put into Google
Play Services, right?

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.690
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.420
So what now?

00:21:47.249 --> 00:21:49.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: Number two,
or number 0x1 on our countdown,

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.080
is Google Fit.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.380
Google Fit is really about
getting all of your fitness

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.900
data in one place.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.340
Think about the possibilities
for knowing yourself

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.380
that come from integrating
all of this data.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.880
In the not too distant past,
you might have had a heart rate

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.520
sensor or you might have had a
pedometer or you might have had

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.140
a cool app that
measures your bike

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.307
ride or a different cool
app that measures your run,

00:22:08.307 --> 00:22:10.598
but think about what happens
when you bring all of this

00:22:10.598 --> 00:22:11.120
together.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.536
What was your heart
rate like when

00:22:12.536 --> 00:22:13.900
you were cycling up a hill?

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.950
What was the impact on your
body when you were ice skating?

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.460
Think about all the ways that
you can bring this together.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.245
That new diet, Magnus, it's
looking good on you, buddy.

00:22:23.245 --> 00:22:23.960
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: I don't know.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: These kinds
of things you can learn.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.460
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: I don't
think it's working.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.500
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Fit gives you access

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.250
to all of these different
types of sensors

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.550
that I was talking about.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.480
It gives you access
to a Recording API,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.270
and the idea behind
the Recording API

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.170
is that you can smartly automate
want to record and when.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.014
It gives you access
to a History API,

00:22:41.014 --> 00:22:42.680
and the nice thing
about the History API

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.211
is you can then do a deep
dive into the historic data

00:22:45.211 --> 00:22:46.710
around your health,
and maybe you'll

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.150
discover trends that weren't
apparent to begin with.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.710
My personal favorite
is the Sessions API,

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.290
and the idea behind
the Sessions API

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.060
is it allows you to measure
fitness data in different ways

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.160
at different times.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.070
I'll give an example.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.387
My son runs track for his
team, and he's actually

00:23:00.387 --> 00:23:02.720
running in a track meet right
now, so after the session,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.500
I've got to find how he did.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.850
In the 400 meters race,
he can do 400 meters

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.750
in a little under 60
seconds, but his fitness data

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.500
while he's doing that
400 meters race is vastly

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.450
different than his
fitness data in the hours

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.080
that he's training
for that race.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.029
And with the Sessions
API, one could

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:20.570
build an application
that's optimized

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:21.909
for a scenario such as that one.

00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:24.450
And then another one which is
really, really cool, of course,

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:25.710
is Custom Data Type.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.780
So maybe somebody
here is an expert

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.017
on unicycling and the
impact that unicycling

00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:31.850
has on the body-- we've
got one at the back.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.400
Are you an expert on unicycling?

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.892
Nice.

00:23:34.892 --> 00:23:37.460
Or maybe you're an expert
on ice skating or something

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.110
else like that.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.880
So things that we
haven't thought about,

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.379
things that we
haven't built in, you

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:44.145
can actually extend using
these custom data types.

00:23:44.145 --> 00:23:45.270
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: All right.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:45.810
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Time to celebrate?

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:46.726
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:23:46.726 --> 00:23:50.170
Should we celebrate Google
Fit with Google Play Services.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.090
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.104
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:23:54.104 --> 00:23:55.520
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
That actually hit

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.100
exactly where I wanted it to.

00:23:59.511 --> 00:24:00.010
All right.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.656
Let's try another one.

00:24:02.656 --> 00:24:04.280
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Google Play Services.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.770
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.792
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Whoa.

00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:09.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.730
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Nice
catch over there.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.870
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So we're getting

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.411
to the end of our
countdown and we've

00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:16.440
reached number one, or
0x0, as we like to call it.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.060
Any C++ developers here?

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.060
That's not a null pointer.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.000
So we've reached the
top of our countdown.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.500
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Yeah, that's right,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.700
and our number one feature
is something that brings

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.750
all of these things together.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:35.770
It is Android Wear.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:40.050
We introduced Android wearables
at Google I/O last year

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.980
and boy, has it come
a far way since.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.690
If you haven't looked
into Android Wear

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.610
and you're not developing
for Android Wear,

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.630
you really need to
start because this

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.600
is a new computing
paradigm that is just

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.370
off its starting blocks.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:57.299
You can now, for example, attach
any number of wearable devices

00:24:57.299 --> 00:24:58.340
together with your phone.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.210
I've got two devices
right here that are

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.920
paired with my phone over here.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.160
And the new Channel API
and the Capabilities API

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.630
allow all of these devices
to talk in real time

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.890
and also transfer
files between them.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.010
And the Capabilities API
allows each of the nodes

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.800
to surface the capabilities they
have, for example, if they have

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.550
connectivity to the internet.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.790
And the devices are getting
more and more capable out there.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.590
For example, just
now, a couple of hours

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:31.350
ago, the Maps API was launched
for Android Wear in the Android

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.580
Wear SDK, and that
allows for you

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.580
building native wearable
applications that

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.789
use the Maps API directly.

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:40.330
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's pretty cool.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.510
So while I'm navigating,
I can see it on my wrist.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.220
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's amazing.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.980
It's thanks to
these advancements

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.200
in sensors, et cetera.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.110
Also, as you heard
in the keynote,

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:53.580
Google Fit now also supports
squats, sit ups, and pull ups,

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.100
in addition to running,
bicycling, and walking.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.410
So all of these capabilities are
there also to detect activity.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.300
And all of these
sensors are getting

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.220
better and the mobile
SDK we're enhancing

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.490
all the time to take advantage
of these new hardware

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.940
improvements.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.500
All these things, they are
transforming the wearable

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.990
to something beyond just
an extension of the phone,

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.180
so get on board
the wearables train

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.300
because it's sure
to change the way we

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.514
humans and technology interact.

00:26:24.514 --> 00:26:26.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
should we celebrate

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.574
the wearables platform,
our null pointer, the 0x0?

00:26:28.574 --> 00:26:29.740
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Absolutely.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.740
This is the first place.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.520
Go ahead.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: This is
my favorite color t-shirt.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.240
I want to keep this one.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.786
Let's have a Google
Play Services.

00:26:35.786 --> 00:26:36.452
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:26:38.685 --> 00:26:39.810
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: All right.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.032
Google Play Services.

00:26:42.032 --> 00:26:44.000
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.670
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Google Play Services.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.336
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: One more.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.931
I'll stay away from the
camera man with this one.

00:26:52.931 --> 00:26:53.970
Google Play Services.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:54.840
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.571
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Oh, it's
going to hit the screen.

00:26:57.571 --> 00:27:00.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: It did
actually hit the screen.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.100
Wasn't me.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.120
Can we scroll the
notes down a little?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.730
So when your users can find
new things that they love--

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.280
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Are continually
delighted by your app.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: When they
can connect with each other

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.940
and the technology just
gets out of the way.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.450
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Can put
the content on any screen.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.825
LAURENCE MORONEY:
When your users

00:27:24.825 --> 00:27:27.560
have gigabytes of free storage
that they can access anywhere.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.271
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Can
securely sign into your app.

00:27:30.271 --> 00:27:32.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: They can
easily, quickly, and safely

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.020
make payments online.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.070
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And are
always in the moment,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.565
immediately informed of
what they want to know.

00:27:38.565 --> 00:27:39.940
LAURENCE MORONEY:
When your users

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.940
are hyperlocally connected to
the world that they live in.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.155
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Find the
content that they desire.

00:27:45.155 --> 00:27:47.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: Have all
of their bio and fitness

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.832
information in one place.

00:27:48.832 --> 00:27:51.040
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And are
connected to the distributed

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.520
wearable computing revolution.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.730
When your users are doing
all of these things,

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.710
then you are developing
using Google Play Services.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.400
There is a huge
greenfield of opportunity

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.080
here to develop,
engage, and earn.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.700
If you look at all
of these things

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.150
that we've talked about
today, all of these APIs,

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.310
and start to imagine what you
can do when you combine them

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.030
together, it's going to
be something fantastic.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.260
We really look forward to
see what gets out there

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.290
in the next 12
months, and if it's

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.160
anything like the previous ones,
then you'd better buckle up.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.320
It's going to be
a heck of a ride

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.280
because Google Play Services--

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.645
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:28:31.645 --> 00:28:33.110
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank you.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.170
So we have a few
microphones set up

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.820
for questions and there's a
little bit more swag for folks

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.010
who have questions, so if you
have any questions for Magnus

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.850
or if you have any
questions for Magnus, just

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.391
please ask them with
the microphones.

00:28:43.391 --> 00:28:45.670
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Stop it.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.140
Also, please provide feedback
to the session using these links

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.000
over here.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we
have some of the folks

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.426
from the Google Play Services
team at the back here.

00:28:53.426 --> 00:28:54.650
Can you give us a wave?

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.880
So if you've got any
questions for those folks too,

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.240
they're going to be
here and they're also

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.170
going to be in the Code
Labs area at the back.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.370
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: These
are the engineering folks

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.110
at Google Play Services, so
take advantage of asking them

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.700
technical questions.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we might
have to pull some of them

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.009
up there if we can't
answer some questions.

00:29:09.009 --> 00:29:10.300
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Go ahead, sir.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.383
AUDIENCE: Can you just
talk about the relationship

00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:15.300
between Android Pay
Wallet, Instant Buy,

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.056
Buy With Google,
all these things?

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.580
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
So Android Pay, you

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.870
can look at that as an
extension of Google Wallet.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.750
It's a Google Play
Services component.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.990
When you look at
Instant Buy, that's

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.815
not an API directly connected
to Google Play Services.

00:29:34.815 --> 00:29:38.830
It's outside to deal
with virtual goods, not

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.600
physical ones, so if you're not
dealing with physical things,

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.570
so to say.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.989
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Maybe this side.

00:29:45.989 --> 00:29:46.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.660
So I've set up app
indexing in my Android app,

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.030
and I was wondering how long
does it take for those things

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.280
to start getting indexed?

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.660
When will you start seeing those
being surfaced in Google search

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.254
results?

00:30:01.254 --> 00:30:02.920
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
That's a good question.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm not
sure of the specifics,

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:05.160
but it should be pretty fast.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.150
How long ago did you set it up?

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.954
AUDIENCE: At least
a few weeks ago.

00:30:08.954 --> 00:30:10.870
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: You
should take that offline.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.940
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.270
Talk to these guys at
the back to check up.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.630
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: But it's
not an exact science,

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.329
as all things with
Google search.

00:30:17.329 --> 00:30:18.495
AUDIENCE: So it's black box.

00:30:18.495 --> 00:30:20.078
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: It
does its crawling.

00:30:20.078 --> 00:30:22.120
But certainly, we can
follow up with somebody

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.401
that's more technically capable
to answer that question.

00:30:25.401 --> 00:30:25.900
All right.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.000
LAURENCE MORONEY:
How about this side?

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.740
AUDIENCE: I saw that you had
the voice integration that you

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.080
could use the same way
that you use Google now

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.630
but inside of the application.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.380
Is that limited
to just the search

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.690
functionality or can you use
that to launch other things

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.295
or do other types of
actions in the app?

00:30:42.295 --> 00:30:44.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: There's
a limited set of keywords

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.550
that you can do with it right
now, but that set of keywords

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.071
is being extended,
and there's also

00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:50.320
some keywords that are white
listed that you can check

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.630
with the folks to get it used.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.745
And definitely, the folks
at the back of the room,

00:30:54.745 --> 00:30:56.370
if you have a specific
keyword that you

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.880
want to have triggered
in there, they'll

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.200
be able to lead you
and help you with that.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.658
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
But search x and y

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.090
will work for any of them.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.048
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:31:05.212 --> 00:31:06.420
AUDIENCE: I'm from Hong Kong.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.310
You just mentioned that Android
Pay is similar to Google Wallet

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.170
but is for physical goods.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.540
So are we going to have
the same profit sharing

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.760
scheme, that is, 30%
of the payment amount

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.887
have to give to Google?

00:31:21.887 --> 00:31:22.845
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Sorry.

00:31:22.845 --> 00:31:24.220
Can you repeat the question?

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.650
We are developers, so when
we doing in-app purchase

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.720
using Google Wallet, 30%
of the payment amount

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:39.590
will be taken by Google
Pay or by Google Wallet.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.490
So is this the same amount,
same proportion, on Android Pay?

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.100
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
We can't answer.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.250
Come to us afterwards.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.824
We'll find the person that can
answer that question for you.

00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:50.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.300
That's a good question, though.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.170
My understanding is that
the pay for selling goods

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.350
and that kind of thing is
separate from the amount

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.480
that you pay for
in-app purchases

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.830
or for app store purchases
and that kind of thing.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.996
My imagination would be
that it's somewhat different

00:32:04.996 --> 00:32:06.890
but I don't know
the exact figure.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.459
Maybe this side.

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:09.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.130
Are you guys doing anything
with the Location APIs

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.400
in order to add more
inputs to a fused location

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.420
provider, such as
indoor location

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.602
mapping or any other sensors?

00:32:19.602 --> 00:32:21.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: We're
working on this all the time.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.030
We're actually adding and
looking into new stuff

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.640
all the time but we don't
have any actual specific ones

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.240
that we can announce
at this time.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:28.740
Sorry.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.050
AUDIENCE: So for the Invite
API, is there any way

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:36.150
to detect a closed loop?

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.850
So if I invite anybody,
is there any way

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.810
you are going to notify me that
the people I invited, someone

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.272
of those downloaded
the app or not?

00:32:43.272 --> 00:32:44.980
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's a good question.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.420
I don't know.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.920
So to repeat the question,
when I invite somebody,

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.710
I want to know if they've
accepted the invite or not.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:53.950
I really don't know but let
me check on that one for you.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.741
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's
a detailed question

00:32:55.741 --> 00:32:56.680
for App Invites.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.520
Come, and we can
find somebody that

00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.100
can answer that to you also.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:32:59.410
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Because you don't

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.550
want to keep asking them again
and again and again, right?

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.278
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, thanks.

00:33:03.278 --> 00:33:04.580
Maybe this side.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.550
AUDIENCE: Hello, guys.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:11.960
I know that it's now possible
to connect to an iPhone device

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.070
to Android Wear and to
receive all the notifications

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.475
from iPhone to Wear.

00:33:17.475 --> 00:33:21.610
Will you expand the
framework to work

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.742
with Wear for iOS applications?

00:33:25.742 --> 00:33:26.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.350
Future looking stuff we can't
really comment on right now,

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.830
but I would say if you
want to understand Wear

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.330
and how Wear works
with iPhone, it's

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.560
best to speak with the
engineering folks, the guys

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.290
in the red shirts at the back.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:38.000
So sorry.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.146
We can't speculate
on future stuff.

00:33:40.146 --> 00:33:42.270
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: If anyone
of you engineering folks

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.670
down there know the answers to
a question, just raise your hand

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.430
and we'll just hand
it over to you, OK?

00:33:50.267 --> 00:33:52.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: We'll just
do that for every question.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.110
How about in the middle here?

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:56.700
AUDIENCE: So my question
is also about App Invites.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.200
How does that work
specifically for games

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.830
when you want to invite a
contact of yours or something

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:04.410
via games?

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.905
Is that through Google
Play Game Services?

00:34:06.905 --> 00:34:08.280
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
To my knowledge,

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.860
it would be exactly the same
thing as any application

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.489
app stored in Google
Play, regardless

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.929
of whether you use Play
Game Services or some

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:16.749
of the other APIs.

00:34:16.749 --> 00:34:18.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: They'll
receive an email invite

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.895
with a link to it
in the Play Store,

00:34:20.895 --> 00:34:22.770
and then they can just
click on it to install

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:23.630
it, that kind of thing.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.170
AUDIENCE: So it's
all through email?

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: It
can be through email,

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.421
and I believe it's
also through IMs.

00:34:28.421 --> 00:34:30.753
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: You can
invite through Google Contacts,

00:34:30.753 --> 00:34:32.370
you can invite
through email and SMS.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.540
Am I correct here?

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.170
Yep, I'm correct here.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: This stuff
is so hot off the press.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.476
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:41.239
This is released today, I think.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.309
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:43.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thanks.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.190
This side.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.000
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask, how
are you keeping the Android

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.179
payment credentials secure?

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.387
Are you using secure element?

00:34:51.112 --> 00:34:52.570
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Come up afterwards

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:53.653
and we'll find the person.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
a really good question.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.080
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: This is
the problem with Google.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.850
We have to realize we're
dealing with 12 APIs here.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:05.036
LAURENCE MORONEY: Over 17.

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:06.660
That's what I said
in the presentation.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.310
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Over 17 top level

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.790
APIs if you look
at the packages.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:09.410
Correct.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
one of those things

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.680
that this is just so new off
the presses we don't have

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.210
the specific technical details.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.390
I'm sorry.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.270
Last one on this side.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.970
Are the invitations limited
only to applications?

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.970
For example, I saw a good movie
or I listened to a good song.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:35.357
Can I send a recommendation
to a contact?

00:35:35.357 --> 00:35:37.190
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: App
Invites to my knowledge

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.230
is limited to apps, but
you as an app developer

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.290
decide which content actually
triggers the app invite.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.570
So if you have
content in your app

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.270
that you're interested in
telling your friends about

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.180
and that they engage through
your app to get that content,

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.410
you can actually deep link to
that content within your app

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.080
as part of the app
invite process.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.190
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.290
Well, thank you, everybody.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.690
Thanks for coming.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.731
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Thank
you so much for attending.

00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:07.030
[APPLAUSE]
