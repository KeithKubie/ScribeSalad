MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, I want to bring up

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:03.080
a good friend of mine.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.110
He's going to perform for you
guys and just amaze you like

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.000

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.620
How y'all doing?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.780
Let's not get it twisted.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.690
He's talking $30,000?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.530
Talking about $10 to buy a
CD when I got $30,000?

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.985
Boy, you better listen.

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:29.250
Let's start this off, though.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.175
Listen.

tonight, y'all.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.590
We're going to get to
vibe, get to groove.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.430
Short time, but we are going
to get to know each other.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.170
You all are going to know me
as not the dude with the

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.950
$30,000, but the dude who was
trying to bring y'all a little

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.103
bit of independent soul music.

You know what I'm saying?

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.480

little stuff like that.

So my name is Darien Dean.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.040
I'm very, very excited
to be here.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.930
I don't know how many of y'all
have actually been in the

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.610

but it's a

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.860
pretty exciting building.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.880
Ryan took me on a tour here
a while back, and it's

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.440
incredible.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.260
I mean, they have like
a petting zoo, I

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.100
think, in the west wing.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.940
And they paint your face
in the bathroom.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.460
It's bananas.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.480
Seriously, like it's crazy.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.940
You got to get a tour
of this place.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.030
It's real serious.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.220
So, you know.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.030
But no, real talk.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.830
I'm very, very happy
to be here today.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.800
I'm very happy to be here
during Black History

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.020
You know what I mean?

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.920
Especially as an independent
artist that really--

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.310
I'm into message music.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.330
So having a month where I can
really listen to some

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.670
messages, not everybody is
always open to those.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.160
So this is a good
time for that.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.990
But speaking of messages, we're
going to get on to our

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.080

not feeling it, right?

was [INAUDIBLE] day, that

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.005

have been fine.

is-- you're right.

44, about 44.

So we're going to have to get
that other-- let me do the

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.220
math real--

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.160
56%.

other 56 from y'all.

is me and my delivery

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.360
and the way we're doing this.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.090

to point fingers.

again, shall we?

give y'all the message

differently first and then we
try, can that work possibly?

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.750
Well, my name's Darien Dean.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.602
I'm an independent soul artist
out of Mount Vernon, New York.

00:17:30.602 --> 00:17:33.530
It's a great time to be an
independent artist, especially

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.880
one who has message-driven
music.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.330
And during Black History Month
I have an opportunity to

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.650
really, really showcase some of
the message music that I'm

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.520
putting forth.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.910
So right now I'm in the process
of working on a new

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.720
record, "Notes From the
Journey," but my previous

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.780
record, "If These Walls Could
Talk," had a song called "Love

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.850
Revolution." And I was able to
really tour with that song and

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.570
move throughout the country with
it really, and really not

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.010
just have it be a month, but
have it be something that is a

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.390
lasting effect and goes
wherever I go.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:07.010
So it's nice to have the month
to focus, but for me it's kind

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.780
of like a constant journey.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.080
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.770

going to be called?

From the Journey."

DARIEN DEAN: Indeed.

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:13.850
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.410
All right.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.600
You've been on the
indie scene.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.060
I wanted to ask you what is it
that you think-- there's so

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.770
many talented people in
New York and overall.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.130
What separates those who have
the talent, but those who get

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.010
more exposure, those who
are more successful?

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.380
What's going on out there?

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.640
Like what separates the
good from the better?

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.920
DARIEN DEAN: It's crazy,
because there

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.140
are a lot of talented--

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.880
I mean, I see you on a regular--
we're out and on the

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.780
scene and seeing the talent
that's out there.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.770
So it's not necessarily like
something that's split via the

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.790
talent at this point.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.650
I mean, there's a lot of
political stuff going on in

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.280
all areas of music, not just
independent music.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.920
I think the artists that hustle
the most-- and by that,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.530
I mean they're consistent and
they're working and putting

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.260
out the best product
that they can--

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.480
eventually do get a bit of a
foothold and move forward.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.310
But I think we're still at a
space where we do need some

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.180
taste makers with a little bit
more power to step up and make

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.660
some moves for these artists.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.910
Because I always say, if I've
got to step out of the

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.580
kitchen, I can't cook.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.960
And that becomes part of the
issue in being an independent

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.210
artist, is that you have to
juggle so many things, be good

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.020
at your craft, but at the
same time go out there

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.640
now, do this hustle.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.840
And there's a myriad of
musicians at this point, and

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.030
that actually makes it
difficult as well,

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.370
RYAN LOREN: Definitely,
definitely.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.810
So can you describe your music
for those who might not know

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.510
about you that are going
to be watching,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.550
and are here tonight?

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.030
DARIEN DEAN: Indeed.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.440
Well I mean, my music is an
amalgamation of all the things

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.320
that I've come across.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.090
I mean, I started
off as a dancer.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.330
I was a choreographer, and
I was deep into hip-hop.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.690
So definitely have those
hip-hop roots that

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.070
are infused in there.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.420
I've been traveling.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.230
The musicians that I play with,
they range from church

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.920
musicians to jazz musicians,
so they add their flavor.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.760
But at the end of the day,
the kind of music

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.330
that I write is--

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.470
I'm really into the craft
of songwriting.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.780
So I try to present stories.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.840
Hence the titles, "If These
Walls Could Talk," "Notes From

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.895
the Journey." Most of my songs
are stories about life that

00:20:12.895 --> 00:20:15.320
I've either come into contact
with people and had

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.260
discussions, or my own life.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.190
So that's pretty
much the range.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.580
But again, infused with a bit
of hip-hop and a bit of jazz

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.530
and fusion kind of thing.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.190
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.840
Yeah, and I think when I first
heard your album title for the

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.040
first one, it actually evokes
an image in my head.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.660
DARIEN DEAN: It's a
visual for sure.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.940
RYAN LOREN: And I think it's
really cool that that's how

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.180
you approach things.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.080
DARIEN DEAN: Absolutely.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.680
RYAN LOREN: So we're at Google,
so I'd like you to

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.160
talk a little bit about
technology.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.910
I know you're a techie.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.350
DARIEN DEAN: Oh, you
know I'm a techie.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.910
I'm into this.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.860
This is my thing.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.250
I mean, technology has been
really helpful in my journey.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.110
And I didn't get into
it after the fact.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.090
I had always been.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.670
But it just helps so
much in what we do.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.550
As an independent musician,
you're always fighting a

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.660
budget battle.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.640
It's always a budget thing.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.250
So the more that you're able to
do on your own, the better

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.803
it is for your pocket.

00:21:04.803 --> 00:21:09.260
And so in doing things like
mixing the album, I have my

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.400
own setup, and we do that kind
of thing at the house.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.340
For instance with Google tools,
like some of the things

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.760
that I do, there was a point
where I was writing songs on

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.900
random pieces of paper
everywhere, and I just could

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.610
never find them and piece
them together.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.230
And even later on, I got into
something where I was writing

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.290
songs on my laptop, but I might
not have it with me, so

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.640
now I'm doing something
here or there.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.520
But one of the things that I use
now is Google Drive, and I

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.300
actually write songs, and I'm
able to get into the cloud and

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.040
basically add to them from
wherever I am, my phone, my

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.050
iPad, whatever.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.830
So those are the kind
of things that help

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.640
me get things done.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.540
I find myself writing faster,
and I find myself getting my

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.640
ideas out more clearly because
I'm not looking for this scrap

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.290
and going, I know there's a
good scrap here somewhere.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.780
That's where I'm at sometimes
with this.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.110
So it's been really helpful,
absolutely.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.440
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:52.820
Yeah.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.070
And I know as a songwriter,
you never know when you're

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.600
going to get that idea.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.490
DARIEN DEAN: You never know.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.100
RYAN LOREN: So if you have the
phone and it all syncs, then

00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.730
it works out really well.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.710
DARIEN DEAN: Absolutely.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.400
RYAN LOREN: Cool, I'm
glad to hear it.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:03.740
Cool.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:09.030
So, I just wanted to thank
you again for being here.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.240
You have the album coming out.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.510
When should we expect that?

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.500
DARIEN DEAN: As an independent
artist, I don't

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.870
have the exact date.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:15.430
That's how it goes.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.630
But I will say I'm really,
really amped

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.610
about the new project.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.936
I have some incredible people
working on it with me.

00:22:20.936 --> 00:22:26.210
And I've been able to, I feel,
really build off the last

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.090
record and build my
skill set even.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.290
And so I can't wait
to present it.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.720
I'm really excited about that.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:31.980
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.330
Well, we're really excited to
have you here, and can't wait

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.220
for the performance.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.510
And I wish you all the best.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.290
And thanks for your
honest music.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:38.990
DARIEN DEAN: Thank you
once again, man.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.650
RYAN LOREN: All right, man.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.900
DARIEN DEAN: All right,
that's cool.
