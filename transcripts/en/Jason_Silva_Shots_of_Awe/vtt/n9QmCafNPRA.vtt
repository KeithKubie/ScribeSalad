00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.544
SUBJECT: So there's an amazing
book called Drugs and Travel

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:21.440
in 20th Century Literature,
which makes the case that drugs

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.060
and travel are so discursively
entangled, so discursively

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.090
intimate, that we use
the same metaphors

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.210
and analogies to describe the
subjective experiences of each.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.030
I mean even the
term hallucination

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.800
derives from the
Latin term [LATIN],

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.410
which means to
wander in our minds.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.170
So when we are hallucinating,
we are travelling in our heads.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.885
Why travel?

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:51.570
Well, the hero's journey, right?

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.400
This map that describes a
departure from the ordinary,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.900
leaving normal thoughts
behind, treading forth

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.610
in the new environment
dealing with conflicts,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.190
real ones or cognitive
ones, slaying the dragon,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.029
solving the conundrum
in the existential itch,

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:13.690
and then making the return
with a new lesson learned.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.030
Wandering in our minds and
taking the physical journey

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.115
both incorporate this motif of
transformation, an unfolding

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:26.358
that happens in time.

00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:31.660
We cross over, I mean, implicit
in the term ecstatic drug

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.575
experience is this notion of
ecstasy, the non-static, right.

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:38.070
The pushing through,
the crossing over,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.950
the breaking the threshold,
the piercing the veil.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.700
The curtain parts and
what has never been seen

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.230
is devoured by the eyes.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:56.480
We take a trip, we
call it tripping.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.760
You see the analogies,
you see the parallels

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.410
these two discursively intimate
universes revealed to us

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.690
that the outer journey
and the inner journey

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.900
mirror each other.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.835
In fact, there are
one in the same.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.380
And I love that.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.510
I love that because I
have the travelers itch,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.385
I have the wanderlust.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:18.430
I yearn for the holy other.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.420
I look at the departure
monitors in the airport listing

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.940
all those destinations.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.590
As Alain De Botton sites in
his book The Art of Travel,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.340
we look upon those
screens and we

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.380
think to ourselves London,
Amsterdam, Prague, Berlin,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.390
Mozambique, South
Africa, whatever

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.730
it may be, it's anywhere
else but here, right.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.590
We long to crossover,
we long to experience,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.080
to take the trip,
to take the journey.
