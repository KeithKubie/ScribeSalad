00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
LES VOGEL: And there we go.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.920
PETE HOLLENHORST: We're
here at South by

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.050
Southwest in the hangout.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.790
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.690
PETE HOLLENHORST: At the
Google Developer House.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.280
LES VOGEL: At the Google
Developer House, where all the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.710
excitement is happening.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.760
There are LEGO building
contests, and we're giving

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.950
away Android tablets.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.130
PETE HOLLENHORST: And
really cool tablets.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.360
LES VOGEL: Real cool tablets.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.840
So I'm here with Pete.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.790
PETE HOLLENHORST: I'm Pete
Hollenhorst. I work as a

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.030
national product
trainer for LG.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.280
ALAN QUEEN: And I'm
Alan Queen.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.360
I'm the CTO of MOVL
from Atlanta.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.950
HARPER LIEBLICH: And I'm
Harper Lieblich.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.190
I'm the user experience designer
for iHeartRadio.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.880
LES VOGEL: Cool.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.230
So the questions I was asked to
ask, till we get some folks

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.620
popping in, is--

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.020
well, we know why you've
chosen to develop.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.078
PETE HOLLENHORST: Yes.

00:00:56.078 --> 00:00:57.890
LES VOGEL: So why did
you choose to

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.475
develop for Google TV?

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:02.210
ALAN QUEEN: I mean the main
reason is, is that we're able

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.720
to use everything we already
use every day as far as the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.810
technologies go.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.840
So if you're an Android
developer, it's all about

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.510
being able to take your existing
work and put it on

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940
the TV experience.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.580
So not only that, but as far as
HTML5 and web development,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.770
comes right across with the
full Chrome browser.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.250
So it's really easy to get your
ideas up and running on

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.655
Google TV, because it's things
you use every day.

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:29.670
LES VOGEL: OK, cool.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.740
HARPER LIEBLICH: iHeartRadio
is a radio app, so it's all

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.430
about music.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.950
It's all about being able
to listen to your

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.070
favorite radio station.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.430
And for most people, the best
speakers in their house are

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.790
connected to their
televisions.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.040
So it was a real great
opportunity for us to get our

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.910
app on people's televisions and
connected to those nice

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.020
big speakers that they've
got them plugged into.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.510
And then we can also create a
neat living room experience

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.190
for people while they're
listening to their favorite

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.285
radio station, which is cool.

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:06.290
LES VOGEL: Cool.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.180
Let's see.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.196
I'm just going to--

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:12.100
PETE HOLLENHORST: We
traditionally supported Smart

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.775
TV for the last three years.

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:17.350
But one of the big things that
our customers came back, or

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.150
just the general consumer came
back and asked for something

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.990
that was faster.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.850
They wanted something that
provided aggregate data, as

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.930
opposed to just randomly
searching across.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.530
And Google has been that
partner for us.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.930
It's really the fastest way to
go out and search for data and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.230
take advantage of the current
content that you have, not add

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.100
to that additional content.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.920
So from a hardware perspective,
Google is a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.640
natural partnership, one
of the strongest

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.075
platforms that's out there.

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:47.456
LES VOGEL: And the LG TV is
really, really fast. And

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:48.065
Google TV.

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:50.640
PETE HOLLENHORST: Yeah, we
had talked about that.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.200
So when we looked and did our
consumer test focus groups

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.080
across the board looking at
coming in on this platform,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.970
one of the biggest things that
came across was the usability,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.110
but more importantly, the
performance capability.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.460
So when we selected a chipset,
we built our own chipset from

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.490
the ground up.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.150
It's an LG Unitech L9 chipset.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.300
And really what that does is
instead of just adding speed,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.550
it complements exactly where
Google's heading.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.230
And that's an app performance.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.630
When we think TV, we're
thinking video-based

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.930
performance, we're thinking
graphic-based performance

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.560
that's out there.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.860
So where it complements, I
think, is on that L9 chipset.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.370
When I look at things like
Novellus developing, or even

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.590
iHeartRadio, just the transition
between screens,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.730
hardware performance is very
important just for those fast

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.620
transitions or for faster
applications across the board.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.280
We're looking forward to opening
up the capabilities of

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.820
what the software side can do.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.800
With an accelerated speed you're
not only getting faster

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.405
search speeds, but you're also
getting better app development

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.612
that's supported.

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:04.340
LES VOGEL: And you're seeing
that in standard Google TV

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.560
apps, that they just run.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.900
You download from Google Play,
and it just works.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.580
PETE HOLLENHORST: That's
ultimately--

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.790
we can talk, we're going
to talk for a

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.579
while here at the hangout.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.390
But at the end of the day,
that's what the average

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.260
consumer's looking for.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.010
They want something that, I
think you guys would agree,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.105
they just want something
that works.

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:29.540
LES VOGEL: Very cool.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.370
Let's see, why don't I ask you,
you've got a lot of apps

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.520
that run on Google TV.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.250
ALAN QUEEN: Sure.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.760
LES VOGEL: Did you run into
any problems developing?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.575
And how did you overcome them?

00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:44.690
ALAN QUEEN: Well, when we first
started developing for

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.990
Google TV, it was last year.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.760
It was before we were able to
create native Android apps.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.850
And so we primarily focused on
developing for Google Chrome.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.050
And so we have full screen
apps running

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.610
right in the browser.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.310
And honestly, with that,
capabilities for us to be able

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.370
to develop locally on our
computers and have it run

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.820
almost identically on the TV,
was just great for us.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.460
So there wasn't a whole
lot of issues there.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.680
Obviously we've gone through a
couple of iterations of speed

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.970
and things like that, and just
working out some of the kinks

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.470
internally.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.100
But for us it really hasn't
been a problem at all.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.675
Now when we go to native
applications, one of the takes

00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:29.690
that we're doing is still trying
to use HTML5 but inside

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.840
of Android applications, web
views and things like that, to

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.830
take advantage of what
we're already doing.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.420
And so there's a couple issues
there that we've had, related

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.610
to making sure that the D-pad
still works in a normal

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.430
environment, getting into
things like that.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.290
But we've been able to work all
that out, so we're able to

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.680
add just a little bit of native
Android code to make

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.250
our existing web apps work
inside of a native app.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.300
LES VOGEL: Very cool.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.070
ALAN QUEEN: Yep.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.130
LES VOGEL: And iHeartRadio
is also a web app

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.035
that's coming out.

00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:02.280
HARPER LIEBLICH: Yeah,
we developed the

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.780
whole thing in HTML5.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.650
And we've made a lot of use of
transitions and animations.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.750
And I think this platform
especially, when people sit

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.950
down on their mobile phone or
wherever else they use a

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.130
computer, it's not
always for fun.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.220
But when you sit down in front
of your television, it's

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.870
almost always because you're
looking to have some fun,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.010
looking for entertainment.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.290
So we wanted to complement that
with some really neat--

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.770
you know, give it that whoosh,
give it that pizazz, and make

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.860
it really feel exciting
to use the app.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.560
And so that's also been a
challenge to really make sure

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.830
that that feeling comes across
on these televisions with

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.920
regards to some of
the chipsets.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.690
So it's also really neat to see
this running on the faster

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.940
televisions, because we can
really crank up that sexiness

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.800
of the app.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.460
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.650
HARPER LIEBLICH: Which has
been a lot of fun.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.610
LES VOGEL: And iHeartRadio
has got all kinds of cool

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.020
transitions, and it
really is good.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:23.320
OK, I'm hoping to get a few
folks asking questions.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.550
Ah, that's one of the
ones we get a lot.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.960
The one question I have that's
been posted to the stream is,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.670
when does Hulu Plus show up.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.530
And that has nothing to do
with us, unfortunately.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.030
I wish I could answer that.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.180
It doesn't.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.830
Any of you have questions?

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.210
LES VOGEL: We're doing a live
hangout out here at South by

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.866
Southwest. Yeah?

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:57.340
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.360
Can everyone hear me OK?

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.925
LES VOGEL: Oh yeah.

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:01.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you, guys.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.790
I am really happy to be here.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.520
I'm a big fan of Google TV,
and especially what

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.220
you guys are doing.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.560
So thank you.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.650
I was wondering, when you
leverage using television as

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:19.040
that larger medium as a screen,
as far as resolution,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.350
what are some of the benefits
that most consumers can really

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.420
get or extract value from by
having a much larger screen

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.415
than a computer screen
has in the past?

00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:40.620
LES VOGEL: Well, I'll start, but
one of the things that you

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.200
think about for a television is
it's actually not larger.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.950
For the 10-foot experience, if
you hold a tablet up close and

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.890
then look up at your TV, the
TV actually looks smaller.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:01.420
And so the information density
is not as great.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.120
So you need to think about TVs
differently than you do a

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.830
computer or a tablet, and not
put as much information.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.920
Put bigger things up there.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.082
Make it more fun but more
focused in a sense.

00:09:19.082 --> 00:09:24.550
HARPER LIEBLICH: I think the
biggest advantage of this form

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.650
factor is it's a
social screen.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.430
It's not a bunch of people
crowding around a computer.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.910
It's not even a cell phone,
which is very personal.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.170
This is about a bunch of
people sitting down and

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.750
watching something or
using something.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.800
So the apps that really take
advantage of that-- and you

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.100
can speak to this-- are the
ones that are really gonna

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.630
take advantage of that
social experience.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.478
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:09:51.478 --> 00:09:52.750
ALAN QUEEN: Yeah, definitely.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.020
I think that when we
use our mobile

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.200
devices, that's a very--

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.720
like you said, it's a
personal experience.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.670
It's my little view
into the world.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.160
But the TV is something that's
common to everyone in the

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.320
house most of the time, you
know, when you have it above

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.570
your fireplace or things
like that.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.120
So it's a very social
experience, where everyone's

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.140
in the living room
watching it.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.000
So being able to take advantage
of not just a larger

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
screen, but that social nature
is what we're all about.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.120
Creating multi-screen
applications for multiple

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.450
people to use at the same time,
all controlled from

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.220
their mobile devices.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.460
So we really think that's a very
exciting opportunity for

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.290
Smart TV apps.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.610
Everyone's already in their
living room using these

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.630
devices while they watch TV,
so we're trying to take

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.930
advantage of that, and let
people actually be social

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.610
around the TV, rather than just
looking at their phone

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.620
while they're watching TV
and ignoring each other.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.580
So anyway, that's just another
aspect that we think is really

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.280
great about bringing
applications to the TV.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.380
Of course, obviously TV is a
lean back, veg-out experience,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.430
traditionally.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.240
But there's a lot of interesting
things you can do

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.150
once you get some interactivity
going with all

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.342
the people in the house all
gathered around the TV.

00:10:58.342 --> 00:11:00.010
PETE HOLLENHORST: I'm actually
going to take a

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.990
different take on it.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.010
I think that by going to a
TV aspect, you open the

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.310
demographic up.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.250
If you watch who's interacting,
not just at South

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.250
by Southwest, but just in the
general public, it's a very

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.730
dedicated sect of people.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.070
I mean, it's a wider
variation.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.210
But going to a TV platform opens
that up to people that

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.970
traditionally wouldn't get
involved in this content area.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.400
I've got a 90-year-old
grandfather that probably

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.250
wouldn't have, and isn't.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.850
He's got an iPhone and he thinks
it's cool because he

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.180
can FaceTime, but
that's about it.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.160
For him, that's all that
experience is.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.640
When I showed him the
capabilities of Thuuz, or when

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.160
I show him the capabilities
of iHeartRadio, again, it

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.600
personalizes that experience.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.460
He never would've gotten that
through any smartphone or

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.370
tablet application if it hadn't
been on a TV. There's

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.370
something intrinsically
about TV that makes

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.830
it familiar to everybody.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.680
From a very early age we were
taught that it's OK to be in

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.360
that TV experience, and
to promote that social

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.040
capability.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.050
So it's just that spoonful of
sugar, if you will, to help

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.685
the medicine go down.

00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:17.530
LES VOGEL: Yeah, TV is a very
relaxing, fun, social

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.650
experience.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.884
And so you're thinking about
everything differently.

00:12:22.884 --> 00:12:24.530
PETE HOLLENHORST: That's
a good question.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.230
LES VOGEL: Yeah, it is.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.260
PETE HOLLENHORST: It's a
really good question.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.740
I'm sure there's something else,
though, that somebody

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.110
else has got.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.205
LES VOGEL: Anyone have
any other questions?

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.005
OK.

00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:40.235
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
developers talk about their

00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:41.850
favorite parts of
their own app?

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.440
What they think is [INAUDIBLE]
the best features [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.335
LES VOGEL: Cool.

00:12:45.335 --> 00:12:46.200
HARPER LIEBLICH: Sure.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.960
AUDIENCE: Better repeat
the question.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:53.830
LES VOGEL: Yeah, we were asked
for each developer to talk

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.630
about what part of their apps
highlights the Google TV

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.130
experience and what is really
exciting about their apps.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:02.880
HARPER LIEBLICH: Yeah.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:09.410
I think, like Les said earlier,
because you can only

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.200
fit so much information on the
screen at a time, you have to

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.530
really think clearly about what
it is that's the core of

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:23.130
your app and why people want to
use it, and remove all of

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.020
the extra bells and whistles
so that you've really got a

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.310
clean, easy-to-use experience.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.980
And it's that focus that for
us was sort of refreshing.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.890
It allowed us to strip away all
of the extraneous things

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.670
that we've got going on on our
other platforms, and just

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.390
focus on that core
radio-listening experience.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.870
So that's one of my favorite
things about it.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:52.780
And then the other was the
freedom to really play with

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:58.490
the visual style and to make
it feel open and inviting.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.170
Because it's in somebody's
living room, we want to make

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.830
sure that they feel comfortable
as soon as they go

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.974
into that app.

00:14:05.974 --> 00:14:10.000
And I love that I feel like
we've been able to make

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.310
something that draws you in
instead of making you feel

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.644
overwhelmed by information
on your screen.

00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:23.830
ALAN QUEEN: I don't want
to turn this into a UX

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.095
discussion, but it brought up
an interesting thing that I

00:14:26.095 --> 00:14:29.120
always like when people say, an
app is not done until you

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.310
can't take anything else away.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.750
So that's very important for
TV, strip out everything.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.710
It's not done when you can't
add anything else to it.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.830
But what MOVL does is really
take advantage of the TV and

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.020
the second screen experience.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.620
So we're all about everybody
around the living room using

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.430
their mobile devices, their
tablets, to interact together

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.860
in a social experience where
the TV is the anchor point,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.070
whether that's in a living room
at home, or it might be

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.180
in a bar in a restaurant, that
people can actually use this

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.880
TV and the mobile devices in a
really social way to have a

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.420
lot of fun, entertainment-based

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.330
applications.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.710
So for us, that's the best thing
about developing for TV,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.060
is being able to use this thing
to actually do all of

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.455
your text input, your searching,
your finding all

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:16.620
your content, and using the TV
to really act as the anchor

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.660
point in the display area
for the device.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.590
And obviously for Google
TV, we're able to

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.420
do that very easily.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.650
So we've been really happy
with the experience.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.280
LES VOGEL: Oh, cool.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:34.200
So Cliff writes in, asks about
two things about the LG.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.320
One is, do you support
the NTFS file system?

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.570
PETE HOLLENHORST: Yeah.

00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:45.610
LES VOGEL: And then the second
one is, do you have any good

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:50.370
video chat apps being planned,
and supporting

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.200
a camera for this?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.360
I don't know you've announced
anything, but--

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.220
PETE HOLLENHORST: No.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:04.020
So on NTFS, not at this point
that we're going to discuss.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.670
I can tease the video aspects.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.795
If you've taken a look at some
of the specs that got leaked

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:12.740
or talked about from CES,
or even here at South by

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.560
Southwest, we talked about
the USB inputs.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.550
And we've always natively
supported cameras with that,

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.000
so there is a lot that's being
planned, nothing that we're

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.450
announcing here at South
by Southwest.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.740
What I was going to say is just
my favorite part of--

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.380
LES VOGEL: OK, sorry.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.400
PETE HOLLENHORST: --where that
goes into is, coming into this

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.550
platform, we tried to attack it
from three dedicated points

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.740
in terms of usability.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.550
And that's where that magic
motion came into play, with a

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.570
very easy-to-use remote control,
coming in and talking

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.440
about just the overall
performance, and not only a

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.250
good chipset, but a native UI
that worked well and then in

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.430
terms of content.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:54.480
But all three of those feed back
into, what is that total

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.100
user experience for it?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.250
So tying in our 3D, tying in
Google TV, tying in all of

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.600
that, we want to make sure that

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.640
people are able to interact.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.079
So we're not announcing
anything, but I will point out

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.240
again that we've got two USBs.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.460
Most of the time you
only need one.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.420
And we do have a USB camera
that's available.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.339
So you can draw your
own conclusions.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:18.250
LES VOGEL: OK.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.130
And then there's another
question from

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.580
Russia, from Alexander.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.196
PETE HOLLENHORST: Hello,
Alexander.

00:17:26.196 --> 00:17:29.915
LES VOGEL: And he asks, what
media formats and containers

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:32.830
will LG TV support?

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.830
Will MPEG-2 be supported?

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.090
And will DTS be supported?

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.250
PETE HOLLENHORST: So yeah, we're
actually that format

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.925
king across the board.

00:17:41.925 --> 00:17:43.920
In fact, there's very
few formats that we

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.830
don't play nice with.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.860
But for Alexander that's out
there, MPEG-2 is definitely

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.670
something we're going
to support.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.960
Plex is a great way to
bring that back in.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.250
Any of your native content, if
Plex supports it, we're going

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.230
to be able to play that back
on our TVs across.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.980
I'm sure there's some
good questions,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.210
though, coming through.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.700
Actually, I was going to
ask about iHeartRadio.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.960
Where is the evolution
then coming from?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.580
From a radio standpoint on TV,
where's the user impact?

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.500
Why would I first
be interested?

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.410
And what's the nice to know, not
the need to know, but what

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.800
the nice to know feature about
iHeartRadio that you're

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.680
anticipating?

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.320
HARPER LIEBLICH: In terms of
what's coming up, or what's on

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.170
there right now?

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.580
Well, one of the things that
we're trying to do is,

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.860
obviously, we interview
lots of artists

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.870
and bands and musicians.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.290
We've got great photos and
videos and articles about

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:53.680
them, so that's one thing we're
talking about bringing

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.090
into the experience across all
of our different platforms.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.470
But I think especially the video
aspect of that works

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.560
great on the television.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.290
And then the other is just
enhancing that social

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.300
experience so that people feel
like they're sharing with each

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.740
other, because radio is
such a social medium.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.110
There's always people
calling in.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.770
There's always people talking
to each other, whether it's

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.330
DJs and hosts.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.470
And so we want to really try
to tie that in and make it

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.920
feel even more social when it's
in people's living rooms.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.300
LES VOGEL: One thing I didn't
find out when I first saw

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.940
iHeartRadio a couple weeks ago
was, is it just Clear Channel

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.420
radio stations or is it
a broad selection?

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.070
HARPER LIEBLICH: Up until
recently it was just Clear

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.845
Channel radio stations.

00:19:42.845 --> 00:19:45.620
And that's 800 radio stations
across the country.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.560
But we're now starting to
bring in other stations.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.120
And that's including
Univision.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.810
We've got a couple of public
radio stations coming in,

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.810
including WNYC in New York.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.630
And we're now, for the first
time, starting to talk about

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.680
bringing in college
radio stations.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.170
LES VOGEL: Oh, very cool.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.360
HARPER LIEBLICH: So you'll be
able to listen to a whole

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.890
gamut of different

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.212
terrestrial-type radio stations.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.505
LES VOGEL: So it's a
good eclectic set?

00:20:16.505 --> 00:20:17.590
HARPER LIEBLICH: Yeah.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.728
I think there's something
in there for everybody.

00:20:21.728 --> 00:20:23.330
LES VOGEL: Let's see.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.895
Anyone else in the room
have another question?

00:20:25.895 --> 00:20:26.661
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:27.643
LES VOGEL: Yeah?

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:31.276
AUDIENCE: MOVL, can you talk
about building from the living

00:20:31.276 --> 00:20:35.980
room, and then also just the
way you're thinking about

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.710
Google TV and bringing it to,
like, a bar or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.460
ALAN QUEEN: Sure.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.440
So the question is about how
MOVL is transforming our

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.660
living room games into more
public space applications for

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.910
bars and restaurants
and other things.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.310
So when we started all this,
we always thought that it

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.490
would be great to take that
multi-screen experience from

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.640
the living room to bars
and restaurants.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.920
Any bar you go to, I mean if you
guys are going up and down

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.330
Sixth Street, just count the
number of TVs that are in all

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.490
those bars.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.190
So we see those there and how
many people see those every

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.190
single day and every
single night.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.850
And imagine if all those
have Google TV on it.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.570
What would you do with it?

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.180
So the way we approached it
is, we want to have apps

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.765
running on the TV, but then have
everyone else pull out

00:21:23.765 --> 00:21:26.360
their mobile device and
be able to play along.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.430
So it's just as easy as
downloading an app.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:32.370
And in a bar you might play
trivia, you might play poker.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.420
So that's what we're doing.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.900
We actually have a new product
coming out called The

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.210
Neighborhood, which is going
to be launching in several

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.780
bars and restaurants
in the Chicago

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.340
area in a couple weeks.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.560
And we're hoping to launch that
in many more across the

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.170
country over this year.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.600
But it will allow you
to do just that.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.330
So you'll be able to walk into
the bar and actually compete

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.100
with other people.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.920
And it's a really social
experience because the TV on

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.300
the wall functions as where
everyone discovers it and

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:58.930
plays along.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.080
But they're also connected
to each other.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.960
So private messaging, chatting,
you can imagine all

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.470
the different things that are
gonna happen in a bar setting

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.820
or a cafe setting.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.730
It's not just for bars.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.050
It's actually for retail, bars,
cafes, coffee shops,

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:12.810
that kind of a thing.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:17.120
LES VOGEL: And that can work
with anyone's mobile phone.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.760
Do they download your app or
just go to the website?

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.310
ALAN QUEEN: So we're going to
be doing both versions.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.110
So you can actually just go to
a URL on your phone, and

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.150
you'll be able to play along.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.260
And so all the connection
stuff happens via HTML5,

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.520
WebSockets, that kind
of a thing.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.400
So any HTML5-enabled browser
for mobile phones

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.710
will work just fine.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.730
And then we'll also have a
downloadable version, so you

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.405
can get to it a little
faster as well.

00:22:40.405 --> 00:22:45.370
LES VOGEL: And Summer asks, how
are mobile devices able to

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.300
interact with the Google TV?

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.460
I'm assuming she's asking
about the SDK.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.330
ALAN QUEEN: Yeah, so we actually
have a platform and

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.920
an SDK, a set of APIs that
anyone can use to create

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.560
multi-screen applications
for Smart TVs. I

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.380
know that's a mouthful.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.900
But if you go to
connect.movl.com, all you have

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.460
to do is sign up and you can
download APIs for iOS,

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.330
Android, JavaScript,
and even Flash.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.480
And everything is designed from
the ground up around the

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.180
Smart TV experience.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.520
You create an app on the TV.
We call that the host

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.450
application.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.130
And then you create an app for
your mobile device that acts

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.630
as the companion application.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.250
We call that the controller
application.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.710
So once all the devices are
connected, you can route

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.100
messages between them and it
doesn't have to be over the

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.550
same local Wi-Fi network.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.180
It actually works through
the cloud as well.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.670
So you can have TV-to-TV play,
so social in the living room,

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.420
and social across the net,
multi-user, multi-user gaming,

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.116
things like that.

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:39.060
PETE HOLLENHORST: I--

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.480
ALAN QUEEN: What?

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.100
Oh, oh thank you so much.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.670
We got a fan, we got a fan.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.380
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:51.750
And so the camera's not
on it, but your app

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.410
over there has a code.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.670
They just enter that code and
they're immediately synced.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.920
ALAN QUEEN: Yeah, it's
really simple.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.310
So on the TV, every TV has a
special pairing code to it,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.860
and you just enter
it one time.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.300
Enter the code once.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.390
It's a five-digit code.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.040
And then you're connected
to that television.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.690
LES VOGEL: OK.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.120
ALAN QUEEN: And then that
television is also connected

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.930
to other televisions and
[INAUDIBLE] down the line.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.190
And then whatever activity is
happening on that TV at that

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.470
moment, you also see the
companion interface show up on

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.500
your mobile device
at the same time.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.685
LES VOGEL: Very cool.

00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:25.660
ALAN QUEEN: And then we're going
to extend that too, so

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.280
that if you walk into a bar,
it'll be location aware.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.380
So we'll be able to connect
you even easier

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.230
than entering a code.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.440
LES VOGEL: Oh, that's
a great idea.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.530
[PHONE RINGS]

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.000
ALAN QUEEN: Yeah.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.375
Nothing like getting
a live phone call.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.270
Get them-- there.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.910
PETE HOLLENHORST: Yeah,
I'm that guy.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.015
I'm sure it's somebody calling
in with a question.

00:24:50.015 --> 00:24:50.570
ALAN QUEEN: Yes, exactly.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.340
PETE HOLLENHORST: It's
not a call-in show.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.290
LES VOGEL: OK, so do we
have other questions?

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.045
AUDIENCE: Before you wrap up,
can each one of you give a

00:24:58.045 --> 00:24:59.082
one-sentence tip?

00:24:59.082 --> 00:25:01.006
It has to be different
from each one of you.

00:25:01.006 --> 00:25:03.772
Each one of you has to give a
different tip for making a

00:25:03.772 --> 00:25:05.070
great app or a TV experience.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.400
PETE HOLLENHORST: OK.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.520
I know.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.260
[INAUDIBLE] that way.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.450
HARPER LIEBLICH: I would say
it's really important to make

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.405
sure that the user always knows
where their focus is.

00:25:19.405 --> 00:25:21.260
This is a different--

00:25:24.104 --> 00:25:26.300
ALAN QUEEN: From a developer
point of view, I would say,

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.150
get a TV and test on your TV.
Don't rely on anything else.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.990
Yes, you can do the custom
builds for the Linux boxes for

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.830
Google TV, but get a TV and
get people using it.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.030
Obviously, that goes with any
application, but this is

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.918
definitely for TV.

00:25:42.918 --> 00:25:48.300
PETE HOLLENHORST: Mine is just,
if we're developing key

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.850
structure, just what may be
intuitive for you or what you

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.460
think works well for you, please
test it amongst as many

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.750
people as you can find.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.920
In fact, approach random
strangers.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.870
I've seen a ton of different
apps where

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.310
it's just not intuitive.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.236
And if it's not intuitive,
it's an app

00:26:09.236 --> 00:26:11.060
that doesn't get used.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.655
That's my biggest request if
you're watching right now.

00:26:14.655 --> 00:26:18.760
LES VOGEL: And the number one
feature that we test for that

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:26.260
prevents apps from getting
featured that play audio is

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.790
respecting and requesting
audio focus.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.020
We reject apps because
of that.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.280
When you're in the living room,
play well with others.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.750
And that's a real key thing.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.260
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.970
just Google Android
audio [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:52.120
It's usually a line before you
start playing, a line after,

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:58.380
and about four or five lines
of code [INAUDIBLE] one man

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.720
for [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.180
recognizing.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.232
And now we're getting an
incoming broadcast, maybe.

00:27:07.232 --> 00:27:09.870
OK, it's not happening.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.960
All right, thank you very
much for coming.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:16.460
We're live from South by
Southwest in Austin.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.140
Aloha.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:22.967
