IDO GREEN: Hello, and welcome
to GDL-IL, Google Developer

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.870
Live Israel, and thank
you for joining us.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.760
Today we're going to speak about
startups, and I'm going

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.870
to share a few of the tips and
advices that I have after

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.450
starting six companies so far
in the past 18 years.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.009
And if you have any questions or
comments, just please feel

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.230
free to either pass them on the
chat here or just ask them

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.620
in the end of this Hangout.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.800
So without further ado, let me
just share with you a few

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.730
slides that I prepared.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.860
And basically, what we're going
to cover in the next 10,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.320
15 minutes will be some of the
main things that I see more

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.950
and more when I'm working
here with startups.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.970
And for those of you that are in
the Tel Aviv area, I highly

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.780
recommend you to check out
campus Tel Aviv, that we are

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.740
basically devoting and helping
startup to bootstrap and to

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.690
leverage the knowledge that we
have here in Google in order

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.790
to bootstrap their initiatives
and to make sure that they are

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.000
leveraging and using the
right technologies at

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.580
the starting point.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.010
So who am I?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.550
My name is Ido Greene,
and I'm Developer

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.830
Advocate with Google.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.610
You could reach me out after the
show or any time that you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690
have any comment or feedback
on one of the products.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.170
We basically acting as Developer
Advocates and not as

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.986
evangelist, because we like to
devote at least 50% of our

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:45.560
time to listen to developers--
it could be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.700
developers in startups.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.260
It could be developers in
big organizations--

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.210
and to bring those comments
and feedback back into the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.400
engineering groups.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.990
I'm mostly focusing on
Chrome HTML5, Chrome

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.110
OS, and Cloud platforms.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.860
And if you have any other things
that you would like to

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.700
touch on, please feel free to
ping me, and I'll try to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.009
redirect you to the right people
that taking care of the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.470
so many other platforms
and APIs that we

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.000
have here in Google.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.690
I'm mostly active these
days on G+.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.230
And you could reach me out at
plus.google.com, and then just

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.600
+greenido as one word.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.420
And greenido as one world will
work also on Twitter, and you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.610
could, of course, check
out my blog.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.850
By the way, all the slides of
this show will be in the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.910
footnotes of the Google
Developer Live event, and of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.300
course on my blog.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.800
So first and foremost, when we
are starting a company-- and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.260
I'm hearing it a lot when
I'm talking with young

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.880
entrepreneurs--

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.740
basically, make sure that you
don't thinking about the exit

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.870
strategy from the beginning.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.180
If the only thing that is
guiding you is how can I sell

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.590
this thing as soon as possible,
you're probably not

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.330
going to build it to last, as
Jim Collins said, but you're

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.160
going to build it to flop
with a high probability.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.710
So planning for legacy or
planning to build something

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.300
that will last for many years,
much more healthy approach.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.070
And I like this quote from
Mark Cuban, because it

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.060
emphasizes exactly what
I said, but in his

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.000
own words, of course.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.320
A few things to keep in mind,
and that's basically, I guess,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.200
the first step that each and
every entrepreneur needs to do

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.770
before they're starting to run
on their venture, is to do

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.780
research and thorough
research.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.980
Today we have sites like
AngelList and many other, as

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.440
like second market and
just Google it.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.690
But try to find if someone
is already answering this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.960
specific pain point that
you recognize.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.080
And keep in mind that companies
that are active and

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.820
basically are doing business in
the market, let's say for

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.830
quite nice time in the past, are
quite efficient, because

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.600
the ones that aren't efficient
aren't there anymore.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.020
So it's not a healthy point of
view to say something like,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.120
the company that I'm executing
against is just too slow, too

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.610
dumb, too inefficient.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.910
Keep in mind that if the
company's active--

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.430
it might be that some cases,
there are inefficiency in big

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.710
organization, and of course you
want to tap and leverage

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.780
them, but keep in mind that in
a macro view, most companies

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.040
are quite efficient.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.030
Technology is becoming
commodities more to emphasize

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.370
that if you are building yet
another app, or you are

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.342
launching a feature that is part
of a bigger [INAUDIBLE],

00:04:47.342 --> 00:04:52.930
like let's say for example, a
startup that will hold all

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.630
your photos in the Cloud.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.040
It's just yet another feature
that Facebook, G+, and many

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.340
others could and actually
now already doing it.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.470
But let's say that they didn't
provide this specific service.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.220
It's just yet another
feature, and this is

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.550
the last point here.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.160
You want to try to avoid it,
because if you already worked

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.900
on it for two years and then
this big gorilla, or giant, if

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.290
you will, is executing against,
you're basically in

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.120
the path of the elephants,
and you don't want

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.470
to be in this path.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.060
Aim for the real need.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.540
I see more and more NGOs and VCs
and actually entrepreneurs

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.750
as well, they're trying to
emphasize this point of let's

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.700
build companies that are built
on real computer science and

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.510
not just another hack
here and there.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.010
And I think it's very important,
because in the end

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.900
of the day, you do want to
make sure that you are

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.070
building something that
will be meaningful.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.970
Let me try here just to make
sure that you see my screen.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.460
And let's, again, try to share
it, because I think I saw that

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.520
you lost it.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.020
Hopefully, you're
seeing my slide.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.540
Coffee drinkers get it right.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.260
Actually, I just rephrased what
DHH from 37signals said.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.230
He spoke about drug dealers,
but I like to speak about

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.550
coffee drinkers.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.290
And as an addicted coffee
drinker myself, I know exactly

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.040
what does it mean.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.820
And here, we're coming to say
something like build an

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.680
amazing, great product that
people will be addicted to.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.280
And yeah, you could give free
samples, and you could give

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.360
short espresso cups.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.600
But in the end of the day, you
do want to make sure that your

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.710
experience, your service is
amazing, and people get

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.880
addicted to it, and they are
keep using it on a daily

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.230
basis, hopefully even
more than that.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.720
Keep in mind that usually
efficient organizations are

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.140
actually delivering and building
themselves in a way

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.440
that they will act as efficient
as possible.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.190
And in this case, it's just
coming to show what we learned

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.150
in "Freakonomics," that drug
dealers organization are

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.310
exactly mimicking what
McDonald's is based on in

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.160
terms of the hierarchy and how
managers are delegating

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.450
responsibilities.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.840
And it's true in the startup
early days you don't need to

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.360
pay too much attention to it,
because each and every member

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.470
is wearing lots of
different hats.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.940
But you do want to put
organization and structure and

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.200
objectives and [INAUDIBLE]
results and make sure that

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.530
everyone is running through
the same goals.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.700
If you are not sure about why
users are dropping you or are

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.380
not [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.330
you want, just go to the drawing
boards or try to

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.530
improve and iterate quickly
on your product.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.750
And we'll touch about
it a bit later.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.730
Hiring the right people, I think
it's one of the most

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.800
problematical challenging
aspects.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.430
You want to make sure that
at least the core team is

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.010
composed of people that you
really admire, people that

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:13.110
could do lots of things and do
it with a very high quality.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.030
Do everything that you can
yourself in the early days.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.010
It not only will give you more
runway, because you'll be more

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.070
efficient and you'll leverage
the cash or any other

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.510
resources that you have better,
but because it will

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:33.120
force you to hire and start
spending your capitalization

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.659
only when you must.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.090
Don't pass on great people.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.520
That's another hard lesson
that I learned myself.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.550
Usually, those people are very
busy, very active, and when

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.130
you are lucky enough to meet one
of them, and you see that

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:53.640
they and your venture are on the
same page, definitely go

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.930
and do whatever you can in
order to put them on

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.760
the boat with you.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.060
We know today that CVs and
actually any resume that

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.510
candidates will give you
composed for many years of

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.700
irrelevance.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.050
And one of the best things here
is not only to make sure

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.570
that you are giving some
problems and see how the

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.200
candidate is thinking, but just
try to start small, and

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.110
in some cases, if the candidate
is already working

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.100
as a freelancer, it might be
better just to try before you

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.500
hire him for full time.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.280
And that could actually make
expectation and be for the

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.060
benefit of both sides.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.230
Empower your team.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.570
I think that it's crucial that
the cofounders and the

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.390
management team will know that
they are there just to

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.650
delegate and make sure that
they are giving their

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.060
developers, designers, product
leads, all the [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.430
and capabilities in order
to build what they

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.540
think is the best.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.340
And Jim Collins, that I
mentioned before, wrote some

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.200
several amazing books that I
highly recommend you to read,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.880
like "Built to Last" and "Good
to Great." And he's describing

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.580
a level five leader as
the top level of the

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.650
leader it could be.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.030
And you could think of someone
like Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.110
of Amazon as people that you
want to mimic, but behave, of

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.500
course, nicely.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.890
Good is fine.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.440
One of the things that we're
seeing more and more in

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.220
startups is the trying to
polish too much things.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.320
And of course, it's always gray,
because you do want to

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.160
have this amazing,
magic experience.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.560
But on the other side of this
equation, you do want to focus

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.340
on your most valuable
product, service.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.890
And sometimes you just want to
get it out, get the feedback

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.063
from your users, and
then iterate and

00:10:45.063 --> 00:10:45.860
improve it over time.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.530
So the main point here is not
to wait two years down the

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.760
road and then put something in
the air and get real knowledge

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.890
from your users on what it does
to them, but be agile and

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.830
try to take small decisions
that are much better to

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.640
encapsulate, and then just
keep iterate on them very

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.590
frequently.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.250
I think Google is a great
example for doing exactly

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.200
that, even in a large
organization,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.950
not only in a startup.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.350
In a startup, in my last
startup, we actually called

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.550
ourself more of a--

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.760
looked at ourself more as a
small car, not a small boat,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.550
but basically you're enjoying
the ability to pivot quickly

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.790
and to move quickly.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.180
And that's something that you
really want to grasp and take

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.280
it to your own hands an
advantage, because big

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.970
organizations are moving
much more slowly.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.820
It's true that when they are
taking the decision and they

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.260
are moving, they are the
elephants on the path, and you

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.540
don't want to be
on their path.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.880
But at least you could pivot
quickly and avoid them.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.450
So the main point here is to
keep in mind that your money

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.650
that you raised and the
resources that you got are

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.410
very limited, and you probably
need more than you expect, so

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.340
try to be as efficient as
possible and execute as

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.220
quickly as possible.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.360
When we're coming to speak about
a business and not a

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.140
startup, I think it's just
connecting us to the first

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:18.100
point, which is try to avoid
this la-la-land or this

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.190
ever-lasting land that some
people are living in.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:27.410
And don't neglect the ability to
monetize or to leverage the

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:32.000
ability to have this other
side of the equation of

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.820
revenue or some kind
of revenue stream.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.300
And I mentioned, of course, that
people that are building

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.540
just to exit are basically,
with a high probability,

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.790
building to flop.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.010
Beliefs and reality, I
see some of the young

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.710
entrepreneurs that are coming
here to the campus, and we're

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.560
mentoring them, coming
with sentences like

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.080
the first two here.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:02.240
And in most of the cases, it's
very, very far from reality.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.315
So the only way that you confirm
yourself that you know

00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:08.110
what your users really want is
after you launch a product,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.050
and you have the metrics,
and you measure them.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.740
And as you all know, you can't
manage what you can't measure,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.430
and you do want to measure
everything and anything in

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.880
order to understand deeply
what is making your user

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.750
happy, and then iterate over
it and try to make it even

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.570
more magical.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.950
Predicting the future or the
far future, of course, you

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.860
could see all over that people
fail tremendously in trying to

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.410
predict the near future, and
actually the far [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.480
greater [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.400
The progress and measuring
progress, there's lots of

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.650
thoughts about [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.670
trying to move us and shifting
us into [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.700
that you can predict better,
set [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.630
in order to accomplish them.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:09.400
And then helping us be the
speedboat that we spoke about

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.670
on the last slide and respond
quickly and act quickly.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.950
Focusing, I think, is one of
the most important aspects.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.610
Because you have limited
resources, limited time,

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.950
limited money, you want to make
sure that you're focusing

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.950
on all the people in
your organization.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.500
And it could be the three
co-founders are just focusing

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.480
on the same needle that
we want to move.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.670
Passion, of course, if people
are not passionate, especially

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.270
in the core team, if you don't
see the light in their eyes,

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:47.340
and they don't put those 140% or
200% of effort and time and

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.950
devotion into the startup,
probably it won't be a

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.190
successful one.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.970
And execution, execution I
think is one of the most

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.540
important aspects to consider.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:03.000
Great ideas are all over, but
what's really differentiates

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.970
is the execution and how well
you execute according to your

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.830
objective [? and pure ?]
results.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.040
Plan, of course it's a must.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.540
And you do want to plan, and
you do want to set goals

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.400
quarterly, yearly, and probably
something above, so

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.060
everyone will be clear about
what is the North Star of your

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.750
venture, your company, and where
you want to see yourself

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.780
on the long run.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.750
But keep attention that
everything is changing,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.400
everything is volatile, and you
do want to be as agile as

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.560
possible, because this is one
of the strength capabilities

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.990
that you have at
the beginning.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.340
Find good advisors.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.720
Easy to say, really
hard to do.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.060
But when you do find them, pay
attention that you listen and

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.100
you are able to gain and
leverage their feedback.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.190
What to do fast?

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.860
So we spoke about those
main components.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.340
And I highly recommend you, if
you are in the front end

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.480
development arena, and you're
producing interesting

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.520
products, services to the web,
the diagram here are coming to

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.540
emphasize that we need and are
actually changing today the

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.220
ways that we work in the past.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.240
So basically, this diagram is
just showing us that it's a

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.590
never ending story.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.240
We keep iterating after we're
working and launching the

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.490
first version of something.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:29.560
And this is the way to make sure
that we are executing as

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.070
fast as we can.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.080
What to avoid.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.810
So yeah, if you're not an expert
on bikes, probably you

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.190
do want to avoid
this situation.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.825
And in our case, when you're
coming to pitch to angel

00:16:42.825 --> 00:16:49.730
investors, each and every
sentence here is well--

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.120
how should I put it--

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.040
is very known and

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.350
well-preserved from their side.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:01.370
They know to identify it as pure
BS, and you probably want

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.490
to avoid them.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.660
So our product will go viral,
because we're doing x or y.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.960
You want to pay attention and
to make sure that you have a

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.650
good plan because in most
of the cases, it won't.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.020
No one else is doing,
probably it's a bad

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.109
sign and a red flag.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.369
Because if no one doing
it, probably

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:22.069
there is a good reason.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.950
Try to think about successful
companies that you know and

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.869
amazing ventures that you see.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.700
In most of the cases, they did
have some competitors at the

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.660
early days.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:37.130
And there's lots of
examples on that.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.040
Projections are conservative.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.670
Well, you could smile when
you're saying it.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.480
And all the others are also
very, very good points.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.710
And as I mentioned, large
companies might be too small

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.920
or too big or too whatever, but
you need to come with real

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.570
arguments why it's viable niche
or why you could execute

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.510
much better than the current
competitors.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:07.370
And on the other side of the
equation, for investor, when

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.100
you're seeing one of these,
probably a flag should

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.530
rise in your eyes.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:18.430
And each and every sentence here
is quite well-known and

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.270
quite common, unfortunately.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.270
As you all know, VC or a
typical angel will see

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.520
hundreds of startups and
entrepreneurs, and then they

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.370
will invest in, I don't
know, a dozen or less.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:35.190
So the probabilities that you
will be able to raise money

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.370
are quite low.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.650
And some of the things here
are quite common.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:47.800
And actually try to just go and
put your efforts and move

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.490
on with other investors
or VCs.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:55.280
Some resources that I highly
recommend you to check out.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.180
If you want to see what the
Google Cloud Platform is

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.610
offering entrepreneurs these
days, this is the link on

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.985
cloud.google.com.

00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:07.000
Any other materials that we have
today for startups and

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.470
entrepreneurs and developers
are on

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.230
developers.google.com/startups.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.940
For the entrepreneurs that want
to launch and start new

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.350
businesses, there's an amazing
[INAUDIBLE] series from

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.840
Stanford, and it's in
Entrepreneurship Corner.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.870
And it's great, great ability
to listen to thought leaders

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.490
and amazing entrepreneurs that
did it and to learn and gain

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.130
from their experience.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:39.750
And some blogs that I personally
really like, AVC,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:44.660
of course Fred Wilson from
Twitter fame and lots of other

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.540
companies like Foursquare of
course, and Paul Graham from Y

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.550
Combinator and Ben Feld, all of
them are great, great angel

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.120
investors, VC investors, and
of course people that write

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.330
extremely well.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.880
If you have any questions,
please feel free.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.430
Right now, it's a great
opportunity.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:13.050
And if not, just ping me on
G+ or through my blog.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:17.100
Thank you very much, and
until next Wednesday,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.350
be strong and happy.
