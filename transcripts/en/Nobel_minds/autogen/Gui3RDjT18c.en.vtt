hi I'm Rebecca and my question is what

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030
hi I'm Rebecca and my question is what
 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.880
hi I'm Rebecca and my question is what
would happen if we traveled over the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
would happen if we traveled over the
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.509
would happen if we traveled over the
speed of light hi Rebecca

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519
speed of light hi Rebecca
 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.240
speed of light hi Rebecca
so you asked what happens or would

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
so you asked what happens or would
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.240
so you asked what happens or would
happen if you could travel faster than

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
happen if you could travel faster than
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.450
happen if you could travel faster than
the speed of light

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460
the speed of light
 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.939
the speed of light
you obviously know that Einstein told us

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
you obviously know that Einstein told us
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.679
you obviously know that Einstein told us
the speed of light was a limiting

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689
the speed of light was a limiting
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.820
the speed of light was a limiting
velocity and what that means is that you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
velocity and what that means is that you
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.460
velocity and what that means is that you
can't travel faster than the speed of

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
can't travel faster than the speed of
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.160
can't travel faster than the speed of
light and the reason you can't is that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
light and the reason you can't is that
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.100
light and the reason you can't is that
it would take an infinite amount of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
it would take an infinite amount of
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.729
it would take an infinite amount of
energy to speed you up to the speed of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
energy to speed you up to the speed of
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.319
energy to speed you up to the speed of
light so for you know we accelerate

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
light so for you know we accelerate
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.020
light so for you know we accelerate
protons and these big accelerators and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
protons and these big accelerators and
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630
protons and these big accelerators and
smash them together the protons and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
smash them together the protons and
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.619
smash them together the protons and
these big accelerators with enormous

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629
these big accelerators with enormous
 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.119
these big accelerators with enormous
expenditure of energy have been

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
expenditure of energy have been
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.849
expenditure of energy have been
accelerated to almost the speed of light

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859
 
 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.560
 
99.999999% of the speed of light and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
99.999999% of the speed of light and
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.250
99.999999% of the speed of light and
that requires a lot of energy but even

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
that requires a lot of energy but even
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830
that requires a lot of energy but even
to go from that velocity which is very

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
to go from that velocity which is very
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320
to go from that velocity which is very
close to the speed of light to the speed

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
close to the speed of light to the speed
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.340
close to the speed of light to the speed
of light would require another infinite

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350
of light would require another infinite
 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.440
of light would require another infinite
expenditure of energy so you cannot be

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
expenditure of energy so you cannot be
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999
expenditure of energy so you cannot be
accelerated to the speed of light unless

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
accelerated to the speed of light unless
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249
accelerated to the speed of light unless
you have an infinite amount of energy to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
you have an infinite amount of energy to
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.730
you have an infinite amount of energy to
spend the only thing that does travel at

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
spend the only thing that does travel at
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950
spend the only thing that does travel at
the speed of light are particles which

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
the speed of light are particles which
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.569
the speed of light are particles which
have no mass and they always traveled

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
have no mass and they always traveled
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.850
have no mass and they always traveled
the speed of light now people have

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
the speed of light now people have
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.859
the speed of light now people have
hypothesized that there might exist

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
hypothesized that there might exist
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.440
hypothesized that there might exist
particles which we've never seen that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
particles which we've never seen that
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.270
particles which we've never seen that
travel faster than the speed of light

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
travel faster than the speed of light
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.580
travel faster than the speed of light
and in imagining such objects

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590
and in imagining such objects
 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.020
and in imagining such objects
immediately gets you into all sorts of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
immediately gets you into all sorts of
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.940
immediately gets you into all sorts of
problems given everything else we know

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
problems given everything else we know
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.060
problems given everything else we know
about how the universe works given such

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
about how the universe works given such
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.219
about how the universe works given such
particles you could communicate backward

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
particles you could communicate backward
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.190
particles you could communicate backward
in time and that leads to all sorts of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
in time and that leads to all sorts of
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.980
in time and that leads to all sorts of
causal inconsistencies you could go back

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
causal inconsistencies you could go back
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.770
causal inconsistencies you could go back
and do things in the past that would

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
and do things in the past that would
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.800
and do things in the past that would
change the present which doesn't make

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810
change the present which doesn't make
 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.490
change the present which doesn't make
so most of those ideas are not taken

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500
so most of those ideas are not taken
 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.170
so most of those ideas are not taken
very seriously and it is as far as we

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180
very seriously and it is as far as we
 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.160
very seriously and it is as far as we
know going to continue to be impossible

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170
know going to continue to be impossible
 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.520
know going to continue to be impossible
to accelerate ordinary matter to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
to accelerate ordinary matter to
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.820
to accelerate ordinary matter to
velocities of light not speak of

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830
velocities of light not speak of
