&gt;&gt; Announcer: With over 15 million books sold
in the United States alone, more thank four

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.289
dozen books to his credit and numerous game
credits, Bob, yes, you can call him Bob, has

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.949
become one of the most important figures in
in modern epic fantasy. He's probably most

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.130
well known for his iconic forgotten realms
character, the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden, whose

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.019
story continues in his newest book. I'm getting
close, like I said, I'm the Star Wars fan.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.079
I'm just coming in by proxy. The third volume
the Neverwinter Saga, Charon's Claw. And please

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.680
join me in welcoming him to authors at Google,
we'll have time for some Q and A at the end

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.070
and I present to you Bob.
&gt;&gt; Bob: It's good to be here, ah a great place.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.410
I was a little blown away coming in as. I
texted my friend whose using my Red Sox tickets

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.530
with his kids today and I said "Hey I'm at
Google" and he goes, "What do you mean you're

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.030
at Google?" I said "I'm at Google, you know
holy Crap, you should see this place." He's

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.829
like "What are you doing at Google?" I said
"I'm doing an event" He goes "Are you searching

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.630
for things?" I'm like "Nah, no no."
Anyway, it is good to be here. Yeah, I'll

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.290
tell ya, I'll tell ya a little bit what's
going on and really open it up for questions.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.179
We could talk about anything, we could talk
about Star Wars, we could talk about the Dark

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:15.720
Elf books, we could talk about 38 Studios,
Big Sad, we could talk a little bit about

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.469
that before the lawyers get me. This book
amazing thing happened to me a couple of years

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:30.040
ago, when I was doing the collected stories
of Drizzt and all the Forgotten Realm stories

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.520
I had written. And when I was writing them,
I mean when I was doing the book, putting

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.060
them together, I had to read all the stories
again, because they wanted it annotated, they

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.310
wanted me to say what, why I wrote this story,
what was the point of this story? And so as

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.590
I'm re-reading all these stories, every time
I would read one it would put me right back

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.430
in the time and place I was when I wrote it.
And that's when I realized that what I'm really

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.689
doing here over all these years is, it's almost
like this is my journey and I'm just using

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.340
the books to ask myself all the questions
that everybody asks themselves. I'm using

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.850
the characters as my sounding boards for all
of that. So it's this is very cool epiphany

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.430
for me that this isn't like my job, this is
the journey of my life. Which is kind of scary

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.520
too, I think. And then the other thing I realized
as I was going through it from the from the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.410
letters I continually get is what these books
have become for a lot of people who have been

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.670
reading them for many many years now, is kind
of a of a lifeline back to maybe a simpler

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.720
time in their lives. You know there's a great
quote when they had a pro hockey player and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.320
they were talking about where hockey was and
they said "What is the what is the golden

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.250
age of hockey?" And he looked at the guy and
he shrugged and he said "When you were twelve."

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.080
And I think that's true. Doesn't matter what
year it was, when you were twelve. And so

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.000
for a lot of people I think when they read
these books and they open up the next dark

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.370
elf book it just puts them back to 1989, or
1992, or 1995 or whatever when they were playing

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.940
Dungeons and Dragons with their friends. So
it's almost like a lifeline home for a lot

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.020
of people and it is for me as well when I'm
writing. So it's been it's been a couple cool

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.150
epiphanies that have happened as we've gone
through and. So if you and the other thing

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:28.010
is last month, July, marked 25 years ago,
last month, July 1987 is when I started writing

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.510
the Crystal Shard. 25 years ago, last month
is when Drizzt was born, essentially. It's

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:42.810
been that long, I'm old. And it's very cool
that it's still going, still going strong.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.790
So anyway, a few years ago, Wizards of the
Coast asked me "You going to be anywhere near

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.460
Neverwinter, with your next book?" And I'm
usually in that area with my books because

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.820
that's where the cities, Luskan, Icewind Dale
is there, the cities and the areas I usually

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.910
use in the books are in that part of this
vast Forgotten Realms world. So I said "Sure

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.780
why?" And they said "Well, Cryptic Studios
is doing Neverwinter Nights III, new computer

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.440
game. It'll be coming soon." And you know,
"Are there some things you could do in your

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.340
books to, to help them get the region the
way they need it for the computer game?" And

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.799
I said "Well what does that mean exactly?"
And they said "Well basically can you blow

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.840
up Neverwinter?" And I was so excited because
in the shared world you rarely blow up cities.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.290
So I got to blow up Neverwinter and it was
very cool. And then the other thing and this

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.639
is when you work shared world, this is the
fun part of it, right? Because now as I'm

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.830
writing in the book, I've got all these bad
guys and these heroes and all this fighting

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.580
going on and there's always one or two characters
that, you know you could either kill or leave

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.160
for another adventure, right? The recurring
characters and I had a couple of really really

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.760
kind of bad villains that I liked and I they
they didn't really have to die, so I got in

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.030
touch with Cryptic and I said "Ok, do you,
you know, ok I can kill this character, or

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.870
I can leave her alive if you want to put her
in the game, what do you think?" And they're

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.570
like "Leave her alive, leave her alive!" So
it was this back and forth and that's the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.560
way writing is now, because of the multi media,
because everything has changed and everything

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.169
really has changed. Two years ago I track,
I was in finance, I was a financial analyst

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.240
when I, all of a sudden writing found me and
I had published books and things and I retired

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.750
and like 1990 to just be a writer but I track
all the books. Like the publishers hate me

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.700
because if my check is a $1.50 short I know
and I let them know that I know. But so one

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.060
of the things I've been tracking lately is
electronic book sales. Now my backlist is

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.250
pretty huge. It's, there's a lot of books
out there on backlist. This book right here

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.870
is the 33rd I think book I've written in the
Forgotten Realms. Like the 25th about this

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.550
character. Which is really weird. But anyway,
two years ago two percent of my back last

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.680
sales were electronic books. The year after
that it was 19%, first half of this year was

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.490
41% and now it's over 50. So it's just incredible,
you know the world's changing. And just to,

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:31.020
I had a an interesting contract negotiation
a couple of years ago and the publisher was

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.490
trying to play hardball with me and they said,
instead of doing the old formula for books

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.220
is royalties, right? They sell the books and
they give you royalties, they wanted to go

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.620
to profit sharing. And I'm smarter than that
because I worked in finance. Profit sharing

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.830
means they never show a profit. And so I was
resisting and we had this big argument going

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.650
on and they said "More and more of the books
are going eBooks and you should, you know,

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.910
you should want profit sharing." With eBooks,
profit sharing makes more sense. And I said

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.479
"Ok we can do it with just the eBooks". They
said "Yeah but now 95% of our sales will become

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.340
eBooks and you're going to wish that you had
done this contract for profit sharing." And

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.760
I said "If 95% of the sales become eBooks
why exactly do I need you?" And the whole

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:17.300
tone of that conversation changed. I always,
I find that like amazing the changes that

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.040
are going on in the world and with the video
games, working with a video game company,

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.330
working with a game company. Wizards of the
Coast for example is coming out with another

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.990
version of Dungeons and Dragons which I really
love. Because they're throwing it back quite

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.550
a bit to what it was. Fourth edition, they're
already up to fourth edition which is really

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:45.020
five editions. And fourth edition was a dramatic
change, it really became a tactical game more

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.150
than a role playing game in the fourth edition
and a lot of people didn't really like that.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.990
So they're coming out with a new edition that
allows you to still play that way but is really

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.300
throw back. And whenever you're working in
a shared world like that, when things like

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.419
that happen to the world you have to be a
part of it. You know you have to because the

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:04.540
books are how we tell the story of the world
and if they're changing the game, it's going

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.290
to make changes in the world. So you got to
be on your toes when you're doing these shared

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:15.040
world things. I've increased my pace. The
next book after this one will be out in March

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.210
of next year instead of a year away. Well
basically what happened is I was working with

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.610
a video game company for several years, 38
Studios, I created the world for them. 38

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.770
Studios had this spectacular collapse a couple
of months ago. So that's all done and so I

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.710
threw myself into more of the Forgotten Realms
for the next year while I clear my head. some

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.190
of you may know my other work I've done, Demon
Wars Books, which I love that world. I did

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.540
the Highwayman and I'm happy because the Highwayman
just came out on audio from a company called

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.380
Graphic Audio. And when they do audio books,
they don't just have someone reading it, they

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.990
have a bunch of actors and it's like a mo-
they call it a movie in your mind and it really

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.101
is. And I just listened to the Highwayman
it was very cool, it just came out. And you

00:08:57.101 --> 00:09:00.240
know as I try to figure out whether I'm going
back to Demon Wars, whether I'm doing the

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.170
Highwayman books or whether I'm doing more
Demon War books, Seven, the others, while

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.260
I'm doing all of that and clearing my head,
I'm just throwing myself into the Forgotten

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.950
Realms. So I've got this book, Charon's Claw,
it just came out. It's the third of four in

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.060
the Neverwinter saga, fourth books going to
be in March. In between that, in October I

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.560
did three books, they were young adult books,
but they're really Drizzt books, with my son

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.750
and they came out a couple of years ago, but
then October all three are coming out in a

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:32.440
single volume. And the other thing we're doing
is comics. I'm now writing Drizzt comics,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.620
which is slightly different way to look at
everything. And I, it's very cool. I'm having

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.120
a lot of fun, it's been a lot of years, you
know, 25 years doing this. And it, I'm really

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:49.180
not slowing down, I'm actually going faster,
which is kind of incredible to me, so with

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:55.050
that, I think I've covered everything coming
in the near future. I'll open it up to questions.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.420
Like I said I could talk about anything, even
about the writing process, if anyone here's

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.830
writing, you know a writer and they want to
talk about it.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.740
[inaudible]
&gt;&gt; Bob, oh they going to get formal with this,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.050
ok. So yeah, we could talk about Star Wars,
we could talk about 38 Studios even and or

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.870
just about the writing process, if you're
a writer, or, what, go ahead.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.470
&gt;&gt;Male 1: Do you have any idea what's going
to happen with the IP from 38 Studios?

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.170
&gt;&gt; Bob: That's the $21 Million Dollar question,
isn't it?

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.160
&gt;&gt;Male 1: Is it interesting to you, is that
something you'd want to-?

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.330
&gt;&gt; Bob: Of course, I mean, here's what happened.
In 2006, I was sitting at my house, I got

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.130
a phone call, I'm a Red Sox fan and it, I
pick up the phone and a guy on the other end

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.940
says "Can I talk to Bob Salvatore?" I said
"Speaking" He goes "Oh man, I can't believe

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.540
I'm talking to you, you're my favorite author.
This is cur-chilling." I was like "Screw you".

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.180
You know, and my wife's laughing at me because
this publicist had called earlier and she

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:54.290
knew it really was him. So when I finally
figured out it was him I'm like "I can't believe

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.180
I'm talking to you bloody sox guy, I can't
believe I'm talking to you." "I can't believe

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.600
I'm talking you." We did that for about twenty
minutes. And then he explained to me that,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.050
you know, he's getting ready to retire and
he didn't want to go sell insurance and he

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.020
should've, apparently. But he didn't want
to go sell insurance and what he really loved

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:17.610
were video games, a big EverQuest player,
a big World of Warcraft player. And he wanted

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:23.230
to start a video game company and he wanted
me to create the world for it and it turns

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:28.520
out we live like an hour apart. He had no
idea I even lived in Massachusetts, but I'm

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.410
like an hour from him. And where we put our
first office in Maynard, Mass was like halfway

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:42.600
between our houses. So I came in and I I didn't
want, it was a start up company and video

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.360
games were expensive. So I didn't want to
take any money up front, at all. I didn't

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.290
get paid, but I worked with the team, I created
the world of Amalur and they the entire like

00:11:54.290 --> 00:12:01.520
this 10,000 year history working with the
team for this world and. You know as it went

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.899
on my job was pretty much done by 2009, you
know and after that pilot, point I just became,

00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:12.279
I had two roles, I was an editor for all of
the narrative guys working at 38 Studios and

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:16.570
the content team and all of that. And I would
work with the art team to make sure the art

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.351
fit, you know what I was thinking of when
I was when I was creating it. And then I was

00:12:21.351 --> 00:12:25.040
a part of the dog and pony show that went
to the conventions, essentially and sold the

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:32.000
IP to the, you know, to the people, to go
out there and just talk it up. And so I never

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.160
got anything. And the only way that I'm ever
going, for four years of work, the only way

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.370
I ever recoup anything, but even more important
than that, the only way I protect my name,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:52.140
if that IP gets sold is to become a part of
it. Again, with whoever buys it. And EA just

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.240
signaled the other day that they really want
to publish a a Reckoning 2. Reckoning did

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.810
really well; it sold like $1.3 million or
something. For a new IP on a brand new engine

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.760
that's not bad.
&gt;&gt;Male 1: Did the idea of like a character

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.180
that has no predeterminate fate did that play
out a lot in the 10,000 year history.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:15.580
&gt;&gt; Bob: Do that was actually something Big
Huge Games brought to the table. The idea,

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.830
in Reckoning you're fated, or everyone is
fated except this one guy is not. And that

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.190
was something Big Huge Games brought to the
table but we always argued about that. I never

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:31.390
looked at it, that the people were fated.
What that whole world meant to me was that,

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.041
because of the things that were going on with
magic at the time. So if you're a cobbler's

00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:40.490
son and you're making shoes all day, right,
you're being trained to make shoes. The magic

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.980
would reinforce that, so you become really
good at making shoes. Because of the, this

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.920
is the time of heightened magic. And they
interpreted that to be you're fated. And I

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.640
always thought of fate in the world during
that very small slice of time, you know, this

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.970
was 2,500 years before the MMO. But fate in
the world was more like the opiate of the

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:06.670
masses. So the king's loved it, right and
the landowners loved it because it's keeping

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.490
everybody, you know, you're a cobblers son,
you have to be a cobbler. You can't usurp

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:16.010
my throne. Right? So it was like that's what
fate became in that world essentially and

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.560
that's the way I always looked at it. That
was an ongoing argument between, you know,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.210
my side of it and the other side of it. And
that's what made working for that company

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:29.850
so much fun, is that we would fight all the
time. And in a good way, a respectful debate,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:36.190
with lots of swear words, it was fun. So,
yeah, that I thought we could've done more

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:41.779
with it in the game than we did but we were
going to, now we're not. Yeah.

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:45.860
&gt;&gt; Male 2: Can you talk more about working
in the shared world and how much of it you

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.450
actually get to drive? It sounds like Neverwinter
currently you're just sort of doing you own

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.070
thing and then got approached, but I feel
like Drizzt and Alminster in particular are

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.660
sort of the main plot quote unquote of the
realms to a large extent. So how much of that

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.230
do you drive proactively and what's the process
like for that, vs. how much is you writing

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:07.870
and forming people and how does it all work?
&gt;&gt; Bob: Yeah, the ah, it depends. Who is working,

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:14.500
I've gone through so many different, over
25 years, so many different teams up at Wizards

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.360
of the Coast. So it depends on who's there
at the time and the way they're doing it,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.260
but generally speaking what I've done in this
vast shared world is hide. You know, I stay

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.980
off in the corners, I remember set, the first
book, you know I've got this, first I thought

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.339
they wanted me on the Moonshae Isles that's
an entirely different story, but when I found

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:36.290
out I had this vast world and I had to set
a book and I said "This area looks good, I

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.100
want to be here" Although that's Cormare and
that's where Eds' going to be working with

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.209
his Elminster books and I go well how 'bout
here, "Well that's the Bloodstone Lands and

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:47.300
Doug Niles up there, well how about down,
oh no no, that's Calimshan, and we're doing

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.210
this game product down there." And he's got
this giant map and every place is filled up

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.959
and I finally looked at the map and they had
these mountains up top and there was this

00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:58.240
little strip of land I said, "See that little
typo between the mountains and the sea of

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.829
moving ice?" "Yeah?" "Is anyone there?" "No"
"That's Icewind Dale, leave me alone" And

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:08.421
so I spent most of my time hiding, of course
from there I went underground to the dark

00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:12.450
to create the dark elf race in the world and
by the way, that was a trip because after

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:17.200
I, when I finished the Halflings Gem, which
was the third book of that series. The fourth

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.620
book I had planned was going to send my heroes
back to recapture this dwarven homeland. And

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.450
TSR, it was TSR back then, this was before
Wizards of the Coast called me up and said

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.600
"You know we think people are sick of these
characters so just tie it up in this book

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.130
and we'll go do something else.' And that
was 1990; and we're still writing them so

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.400
they were wrong and so I agreed and I tied
it up in that book. And then all of a sudden

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.370
I got a call "You know we're getting a lot
of letters about this dark elf guy, so maybe

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.720
we should do a series about where he came
from." And so I thought that would be great

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.450
and I had these old modules by Gary Gygax,
the Scent of the Depths of the Earth, you're

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:58.200
nodding, the classics the ones that followed
the Giant series. The Scent of the Depths

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.360
of the Earth, Queen of the Spider Web pits,
and you know and I, so I took the old modules

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.150
and they had all this information about dark
elves, just a little bit here and there. And

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:12.600
the theme folio, one of the first edition
monster books had just come out and they had

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.620
like a one page entry on dark elves. And so
I had all of that, I gathered all of that

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.370
and I'm reading it and I'm like "Oo that's
not a lot" So I called up to TSR and said

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.400
"ok I've got all these things, what else are
you going to send me?" And they said "That's

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.820
all there is" I said "Wait a minute what are
you talking about?" And they said "Oh no,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.290
we're giving you carte blanche you're going
to created the dark elves in the forgotten

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:44.350
realms" I go "Ok" so I went and I got out
one of my favorite books of all time the Godfather,

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:51.490
Mario Puzo's The Godfather. And that is the,
that is basis for the structure of the dark

00:17:51.490 --> 00:18:00.559
elvin city. Well that and the fact that I
have five older sisters. [Laughter] They always

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:07.309
come up to me and say "I'm the good one, right?"
There really isn't any good one. But yeah,

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:12.040
that's and that's where it came from. But
I spent so much time hiding. And it always,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.669
we always get in trouble when they pull me
out, because when I was doing the Thousand

00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:20.140
Orcs, they say "You know, you're hiding too
much, but we need you to do more with the

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:27.250
realms. So you know, can you use some characters
from the campaign setting." And so I'm looking

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.140
through and I'm finding characters that fit
like King Obould - Many Arrows of the Orcs.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.570
And I'm like "Oh this is cool can I use?"
"Yeah yeah yeah" "Well look I'm warning you

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:43.280
if I use him, I can kill him" "Yeah, of course,
of course, no problem" So I write the book

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.120
and I send it in and my editors like "Bob
we got a problem" "Well what's the problem"

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.490
"Well on the timeline, your book is actually
set before the campaign setting, so you can't

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.179
kill him" Like "Wait a minute!" This always
happens because you have so many hands in

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:04.540
this giant pot, you know. And with Neverwinter
I was, I was happy, I'm always happy to play

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:10.059
with others in this sandbox, as long as it's
not going to hinder on what I wanted to do.

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:14.740
I have a reason for writing all of these books.
There's something that I want to explore.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:20.720
And with the new books, Gontal, Grim through
the book that's coming in March. For most

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:28.321
of the books, my main character is surrounded
by people of similar wheel, right? Anyone

00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:32.929
of that group, Cattie-Brie, Bruenor, Regis,
Wulfgar and Drizzt, anyone one of them would

00:19:32.929 --> 00:19:38.160
take an arrow that was aimed for somebody
else. And now here's my main character and

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.950
he's alone, he's depressed, the world's gone
dark, it's all cynicism, he's wondering if

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:50.540
his whole life and his entire moral code was
nothing but a sad joke after all. And now

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.410
he's surrounded by people who not only wouldn't
take the arrow aimed for him but would pull

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:59.480
him in front of them to block the arrow. So,
it's like the kid you know in high school

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.940
who falls in with the wrong crowd, or if you
have a friend, who starts dating someone and

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.260
they're getting serious and you know this
persons really bad for him but there's nothing

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.120
you can do about it. And you can only hope
that they're going to lift this person up

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.280
instead of getting dragged down, right? And
that's what, that was the story of the Neverwinter

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.200
saga. And then they just said, "So for the
icing on the cake, can you blow up a city?"

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:26.570
Yep. "Can you add some characters to the city?"
Yep, I can do that. And when it works like

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.780
that, it's awesome, shared world is awesome.
Because you are standing on the shoulders

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:35.280
of giants. Best example of that I'm writing
Streams of Silver the second book. And I've

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.450
got to get from Icewind Dale go about a quarter
way across the world to the Silver marches.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.950
And I'm trying to figure out what I'm going
to do. You know, when you're doing a travel

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:50.110
book, it's hard to, you know, have a random
encounter table, like you do in the games.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.950
So it's hard to make it interesting. And there
was this one town along the way called Long

00:20:53.950 --> 00:21:00.240
Saddle. And so I looked in my grey box at,
my 25-year-old Forgotten Realms box set and

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:07.350
this was 24 years ago, so, and they talk about
this town and all it said was that Long Saddle

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.740
is ruled by a family of eccentric wizards
who reside in the Ivy Mansion. That's like

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:18.490
all it said. So, now the wheels start turning,
how can I make this fun? And so I come up

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:24.360
with the Harples I think it said the Harples.
But I came up with the main the actual characters

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.650
and I started having them do really goofy
things, like the wizards house was surrounded

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.360
by an invisible wall and so everyday someone
would have to come up and scrape the birds

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:41.000
off it. Right? And one guy turned, he had
this brilliant spell that would turn him into

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.870
a statue and he had another spell to take
them out without realizing that once he turned

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.960
into a statue he couldn't do the other spell.
So he's standing there. And they had a bridge

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.350
that you don't walk over you walk under, right?
It's all these weird stupid things and it

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.080
was so much fun. And I called Ed Greenwood
and Ed Greenwood was the guy who created the

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:04.970
Forgotten Realms when he was eight years old
and that's true. And I said "Ed, I want to

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:09.380
read you what I have about Long Saddle, what
do you think?" And we just had the best time

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.980
going back and forth about that. That's when
shared world works and it is so much fun.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.390
&gt;&gt; Male 3: I'm really curious about the writing
process, I'm not a writer I've never been

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.070
a writer, my dad taught English in high school.
Ah, but I always wanted to write and never

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.010
been able to. But I'm curious about how you
actually go about writing, it sounds like

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.750
you're much more structured about how you
approach the story, you sort of figure out

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:36.070
the the arcs and the small arcs and you fill
in the details. Whereas like, for example,

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.450
Terry Pratchett I've heard talk and he said
he just goes into his office and writes 500

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:43.950
words a day, like boom boom everyday and just
comes up, the story just emerges. It sounds

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:48.039
like you are much more structured.
&gt;&gt; Bob: I fooled you. Hah hah. Here's what

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:54.520
I do, I have to an outline for a few reasons,
whether I'm doing a shared world or my own

00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:00.190
books, I have a lot of books in my own world,
so I can blow up everything, right? And I

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.180
have to do an outline, the publishers demand
an outline, because they want to know, you

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.730
are actually thinking about it and working.
So I write my outline and I send it in, because

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:14.040
I want to get paid and then I start writing
and I throw the outline away. And the characters,

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:21.620
the characters tell me what's next. And I
often don't know, I am often shocked at things

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:28.510
that happen in the books. They surprise me
all the time. You know, oops I accidentally

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:35.900
just killed that person, oh, wait a minute,
you know. This is the way it works and I think,

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.610
I think I write the books the way other people
read books. And that's what makes it fun for

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:47.580
me, without that it'd be boring. Now there
are times that it doesn't work like that.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:55.169
Star Wars, you have to tell them exactly what
you're going to do in Star Wars and I remember

00:23:55.169 --> 00:24:02.100
when I signed on to do Vector Prime, the infamous
one, you know I wrote the outline and I sent

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:10.030
it in and I'm in a conference call with Lucas
Film in Del Ray. And, you know, "Aw, this

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.570
is great, this is exactly what we want." They
had told me the overview of this new Jedi

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:19.300
order, like A to Z and I was supposed to to
A to B or A to C and I had certain things,

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.960
beat points that I had to hit and I had to
leave everything in a certain way. I just

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.010
had to come up with a story that made it through
those beat points. And they go "This is great,

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.880
this is exactly what we wanted, but didn't
anyone tell you?" I said "what?" "You have

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.670
to kill Chewbacca" and I was like, next words
that came out of my mouth I'm never going

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:47.809
to say on camera, but it wasn't nice. Oh no
this is from on high, the Wookie gets it.

00:24:47.809 --> 00:24:57.380
And So that was much more structured, working
in Star Wars, but no, I, they tell me. That's

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.640
what makes it fun.
&gt;&gt; Male 3: Quick question, where you actually

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.350
ever a dungeon master?
&gt;&gt; Bob: I still am.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.370
&gt;&gt; Male 3: Oh, ok.
&gt;&gt; Bob: I just started running a game again

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:10.070
and it's funny because my son was running
so we're playing fourth edition as soon as

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:16.780
I take over we're playing first edition again.
That's my edition. So yeah, yeah, I have been

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:26.040
playing since 1980, if you want to have some
fun, just to kind of insight into my D and

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.559
D what they're like, my D and D sessions.
A few years ago I addressed a Mythic, Mythic

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:35.730
was doing the Warhammer game they were doing
Dark Age Camelot at that time and I was at

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:40.820
their Round Table in Las Vegas. And I told
a story called Wubba Wubba, so if you get

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:47.330
some time and go to Youtube and look up Salvatore
Wubba Wubba and it's about a wand of wonder

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:52.150
in my group and what happened and it's pretty,
it, if you're a gamer you'll get, you'll get

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:57.539
it. If you're a gamer, you'll get it. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Male 4: So you mentioned, a number of ways

00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:02.950
in which new media is kind of changing things
for you and for the industry. How does the

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:07.950
majority- now that the majority is going towards
eBooks, how does that change the dynamic of

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.220
book signings?
&gt;&gt; Bob: I sign a lot of kindles. No. The book

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.610
signings haven't changed a lot, they've actually
gotten bigger because of social media. Because

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:23.010
if I'm going somewhere now, it's real easy
to let, you know, 100,000 people know like

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:29.450
that, right? So the signings have gotten a
little bigger but people still like, especially

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.620
the hardcovers. The book signings are really
only for hardcover books, that's when you

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.600
go out, you don't go out with a paperback
comes out; you go out when the hardcover comes

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.690
out. And people like having that. And you
know, as much as eBooks are convenient, especially

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:45.830
if you're going to go, if you are on vacation,
right? You are not going to pack ten books.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.690
If you've got your kindle and you start reading
a book and you don't like it, you just go

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.919
to the next book. Or you get your nook or
whatever reader you're using, right? So there's

00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:58.120
a lot of convenience there. But to me, that
hardcover, particularly a hardcover book,

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.230
or paper books too. They're really a piece
of furniture and if you've got that bookshelf

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.910
in youre house, that's a statement about who
you are. So people come in and they look at

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:14.010
that bookshelf and that's like an icebreaker,
you know? If you're a fan of of my books,

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.049
for example and somebody comes over and they
see that, you've got the Crystal Shard and

00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:21.799
the Dark Elf trilogy and all this, that's
like a connection. They're not going to go

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:26.210
through your kindle and see what's on there,
now that's like an invasion of privacy, right?

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:33.590
But, so, people still buy hardcovers and the
book signings haven't changed all that much.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:38.240
I'm sure that, except well one thing that
I do on my website, I have a RASalvatore.com,

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.809
this is a cool story, a guy, back when the
internet was first coming big, I was getting,

00:27:43.809 --> 00:27:48.370
I got this letter from this kid in High School
basically and he's like, remember when people

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:52.330
were buying domain names and getting the domain
names and selling them back to people for

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:57.860
lots of money. And this guy writes to me and
he goes "I own RASalvatore.com" and I went

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:02.110
"Oh here it comes" and he said "I'm going
to give it to you for nothing if you look

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.220
at this website I set up for you. Just come
look at it and I'll give you the domain name.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.100
I just bought it because I was afraid someone
would buy it and try to blackmail you." I'm

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:15.770
thinking "This is a cool kid, right?" And
I went; he had a really good website. And

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:23.659
so I let him keep the name and we do things
called e-signings through the website and

00:28:23.659 --> 00:28:29.580
I actually have the copyright on the term
e-signing, I actually copyrighted it to me.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.910
Because I thought this is going to be a big
thing. And so what happens is, people order

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:40.169
the book through my website, he gets them
from the distributor, through Baker and Taylor

00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:45.720
or whatever and he, he puts his order in a
few days, he can't ship them until the day

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:51.280
the book comes out. But he gets, you know,
he fills his van up with books and drives

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.630
up to my house with it from Pennsylvania,
he and his buddy they make a day of it out

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.830
my way and we sign the books. Because when
you order the book, you can say you know "To

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.840
Matt, Happy Birthday, RA Salvatore" or I'll
just put something in. And so Saturday we

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:11.080
did the e-signing for Charon's Claw. He drove
up to my house with 900 of them. And 100 of

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:17.090
the last hardcover and 140 of some other books
I had bought on remainder that we could sell

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:23.371
cheap, hardcovers for 7 bucks type of thing.
So I sat there and signed 1,150 books, on

00:29:23.371 --> 00:29:29.409
Saturday of last week and that's kind of cool.
Because, you know, people always say "How

00:29:29.409 --> 00:29:35.210
come you're never coming to Utah?" I do go
to Utah. "How come you're never coming to

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:41.510
Idaho?" You know, I don't know, I don't make
the tours, to go on a tour where everybody

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:46.580
wants you to, I'd be on the road 51 weeks
a year and that's not going to happen. So,

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.070
you know, it's that has actually helped a
lot and it's really great when you have guys

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:56.100
serving overseas, because you can ship to
the APO's, right the army post office, so

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:00.700
that's really great, when you get all these
orders from Afghanistan and stuff, that's

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:05.950
very cool.
&gt;&gt; Male 1: Another question about writing,

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:09.669
particularly your mention of the new multi
media setup, how do you see that a

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:13.590
effecting newer authors, like if you're established
and have the publishing company relations

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:18.440
and can sort of pull rank it works very well
I'm sure and has for you, but if you're newer

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.840
now and trying come on to the scene in sci-fi
fantasy how does it work with the newer market

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.039
world?
&gt;&gt; Bob: I probably don't have a good answer

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:30.340
for this, but I'll tell you what I've learned.
You know, now that it's so cheap to self publish,

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:35.950
a lot of people are doing it, that's good
and bad. What's good about it is a lot of

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.480
people who were never going to get a chance
can do it and they can get their book out

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.240
there and you can even print, you know, back
when I started, if you were going to print

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:52.520
a book, you had to print 10,000, the costs
were just so unreal, if you were under that

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:58.070
number of the print run. But now they change
those big web presses, they change right on

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:02.779
the fly you know, I need 73 of this book,
boom, I need 15 of that book, boom and it

00:31:02.779 --> 00:31:08.430
just completely just switches over automatically.
Before that, they had to shut everything down,

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:12.799
you know, put the new plates in and everything,
so it wasn't worth it. Now you can go and

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:19.020
print on demand at you know minimal cost and
plus you have eBooks, where you can sell them.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:26.890
The problem, however, is that instead of having,
you know 50 or 60,000 books a year being printed

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:37.190
in the US, with self publishing you have 200,000
and that means that, the, you know any prospective

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:43.720
readers, how are they going to find you, over
the noise of everybody else? So there are

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.090
people, you've, I'm sure most of you have
heard of Chris Paolini he wrote the Eragon

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:53.990
books and he was self published, his parents
self published him. And they would take him

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:58.809
all around the Northwest and go to like junior
high schools and stuff to give talks and he'd

00:31:58.809 --> 00:32:04.090
be in costume from Eragon. When, he was like
20 at the time. And they would go all around

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:10.460
with the book and through that he found a
publisher, so a lot of people now, it is so

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:16.720
hard to go to a publisher because the book
industry with all the changes is in such flux,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.890
you know, the margins are razor thin, so it's
so hard for a new author to find a publisher

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:27.880
now. A lot of them will self publish, try
to build some kind of a following then try

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:34.580
to go the traditional route with that. I don't
know how it's working for most, I do have

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:40.010
several friends, several of the guys at 38
Studios actually I edited books for them and

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:46.640
then they they put them out there on eBook
format. So it's better because you can be

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:53.450
published but I think being published and
being able to like, make any money at it is

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:59.620
much harder. It was always hard, I mean, it
was always a brutal business, but now it's

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.710
you know, if you self publish and sell a few
hundred books that's a lot of work for a few

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.060
hundred books. You know?
&gt;&gt; Male 1: Thank you.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:11.890
&gt;&gt; Male 5: Thanks for coming to Google. I
grew up in New England and fondly remember

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:17.309
seeing you at a few gaming conventions in
the late '80's and early '90's and you talked

00:33:17.309 --> 00:33:21.610
about going back in time. One thing that has
changed for my life and interaction with the

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:27.850
fantasy genre is it's become much more mainstream.
When I was a kid, you know, the local churches

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:33.480
expressed their disapproval of me playing.
&gt;&gt; Bob: Bad about D and D, remember that organization.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.750
&gt;&gt; Male 5: and today, you know, my sister
in law in Appalachia, plays World of Warcraft

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.750
everyday.
&gt;&gt; Bob: Sure.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:44.250
&gt;&gt; Male 5: I'm curious, has that mainstreaming
has that effected you and I'm curious, how

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:54.510
how has it effected your life and your career?
&gt;&gt; Bob: I think it has, I'm not sure yet what

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:59.261
the end result of it's going to be, I'll put
it that way but what's really cool to me by

00:33:59.261 --> 00:34:03.779
the way, is playing an MMO and then seeing
some variation of my characters come running

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:09.429
by. I was playing EverQuest many many years
ago and I played a character named Thibbledorf,

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:14.159
right, the Shield Dwarf and I walked out of
[Caladeem] and I was like a third level warrior

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:19.129
or something, I walked out of [Caladeem] and
some guy was playing a character named Brunner

00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:25.529
and so I go "I got to torment this guy". Right?
Brunner is the king, he's Thibbledorf's king

00:34:25.529 --> 00:34:31.389
and so I ran over to him and I kept typing
"Me king, me king" right and he's like, he

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:35.649
would start a fight and if you remember EverQuest
you could kill steal, and he was like first

00:34:35.649 --> 00:34:39.299
level character and I was third. So he would
start a fight down on and I'd run "I'll save

00:34:39.299 --> 00:34:44.730
you me king" and I'd kill steal him. "Do that
again and I'll report you" "I'm saving you,

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:49.539
me king!" You know, and he's like "What the
heck" and this was going on for like a half

00:34:49.539 --> 00:34:53.359
hour, this poor guy couldn't get a kill. I
was just making his life miserable. Finally,

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:59.079
he starts running, trying to run away, I'm
chasing across, shouting out the zone "Me

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:07.660
king! Me king!" "Leave me alone" right? So
he reported me. We get to G. Fay; we ran all

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:15.170
the way from [Caladeem] all the way to Greater
Faydark. We get to Greater Faydark and the

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:20.680
GM shows up and I know him, because all the
guys at Sony knows me, right? And he sees

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:26.579
my account and he's like "Bob is that you?"
[Laughter] And I'm like "Hey Rumble Belly

00:35:26.579 --> 00:35:31.890
how you doing?" His name was Rumble Belly,
the GM, right, like my Halfling character.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:37.299
No it was Rumble Tummy, he did a variation
of my the nickname of my Halfling character.

00:35:37.299 --> 00:35:43.269
I'm like "How you doing Pat?" And he's like
"What are you doing? This guys like got this

00:35:43.269 --> 00:35:51.869
four page ticket open against you wanting
you banned" And so the GM made him milk and

00:35:51.869 --> 00:35:58.719
cookies and made me promise I'd leave him
alone, but that happens all the time. I, so

00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:03.890
I love that stuff. But as far as it going
more mainstream, you know that's hard to,

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:08.470
it's hard to say, because even still, where
it's at is that certain things have made the

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.650
leap to mainstream, but then they always say
"Oh but that's different from the rest of

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.989
it" Peter Jackson does those wonderful Lord
of the Rings movies but that's different,

00:36:16.989 --> 00:36:21.359
that's Tolkien that's classic stuff, that's
not this fantasy genre thing. And a lot of

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:26.460
the other fantasy authors who become mainstream,
I'm thinking, [Marger That], Terry Goodkind,

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.750
they're immediately no longer fantasy authors,
you don't call them a fantasy author, right?

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:37.599
Oh no no, I don't, I'm writing speculative
fiction, mainstream fiction. What? Recently,

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:45.700
however, George Martin, of course made the
jump with that HBO series Game of Thrones.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.690
If you went up to George Martin and said "You
write fantasy"' he'd say "You're darn right

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:54.589
I do" so because, and it's mostly technology
that's driving it, right? If you look at the

00:36:54.589 --> 00:37:01.880
fantasy movies of the 1980's, some of them
were pretty good, but you know, the one I

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:07.030
keep going back to is Dragon Slayer, which
had this wonderful special effects for the

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:11.609
time, but they just couldn't do the things
in the movies to make it as fantastical in

00:37:11.609 --> 00:37:17.109
someone's minds as the book would be. Now
they can and so with the World of Warcraft

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:26.019
and it's much more accepted particularly like
on college campuses and in academia. I spent

00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:32.329
the first 15 years of my writing career arguing
with high school teachers. As much as anything

00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:39.569
else saying "Look it" the biggest, the biggest
trouble you're having in teaching kids to

00:37:39.569 --> 00:37:45.859
read and write nowadays is distraction. There's
so much more for them to do, everything's

00:37:45.859 --> 00:37:50.249
coming at them a hundred miles an hour. It's
not like even when I was a kid, when I was

00:37:50.249 --> 00:37:56.019
a kid, you know, the big devil to the English
teachers was television, right? TV's, no ones

00:37:56.019 --> 00:38:01.109
ever going to read another book when TV came
out, that's what they used to say. And I remember

00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:05.680
when I was over in England with Tom Dehaven,
we were being interviewed by BBC and they

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.339
said "How come your books are outselling Tolkien's
books?" They were very mad at that and that

00:38:10.339 --> 00:38:14.390
was before the movies. The Tolkien books has
really kind of fallen off, then the movies

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:19.440
came out and everybody realized how wonderful
they are again, which I'm glad because they're

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:25.849
my favorite books. But anyway, Tom told them,
he said "Because we grew up with television

00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:30.511
and so we're doing things in the books that
the people before television didn't do" Like

00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:35.200
I change point of view all the time in my
books. And when I first started doing that

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.809
my classically trained editor said "You can't
do that, you can't change point of view" I

00:38:38.809 --> 00:38:42.910
said "Why not?" He said "Well you'll confuse
the reader?" "Were you confused?" He's like

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:47.359
"No, but I was trained to looked for this
stuff, you're going to confuse the" I said

00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:51.920
"Eric, we're not going to confuse the reader
because they watch television and all television

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.959
is is point of view shifts." And so the books
are faster and think about it, when when Melville

00:38:56.959 --> 00:39:01.749
was writing about Moby dick what percentage
of his readers had ever seen a whale? Or even

00:39:01.749 --> 00:39:08.150
a picture of a whale? So he had to describe
it, right? Front to back, that's a big front

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:14.219
to back to describe. When Tolkien was writing
the Lord of the Rings, he had to describe

00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:19.410
the dragon. Now if you're writing a fantasy
book and you say the word dragon you're reader

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:25.519
has the image in his mind already, ok? So
that's one way it's all changed, it's got,

00:39:25.519 --> 00:39:29.829
the whole worlds gotten smaller in a lot of
ways, shared experience, shared understanding

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:37.849
of what fantasy is. So the books get faster
paced because of that. So for the first 10,

00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:42.749
15 years I would argue with the high school
teachers, "The way you teach someone to read,

00:39:42.749 --> 00:39:49.009
is to give them a book that he or she falls
in love with. I don't care whether it's Steven

00:39:49.009 --> 00:39:56.160
King, or one of my books, or Terry Brooks,
or Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, or a crime

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:03.589
book, give a kid, a teenager a book that he
or she will fall in love with and get out

00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:11.069
of the way. Your job is done." And I see it
all the time. My friend has twin daughters

00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:18.079
who are dyslexic and they wouldn't read because
it was it's a chore and they found the Twilight

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:23.309
Books and they love them. And now they're
reading like six or seven books a week because

00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:29.180
of that. Because they found something to love.
They, if when you read that first book that

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:35.849
you love and you're so involved in it, that's
an experience; it's hard to explain that experience

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:40.880
to someone. Now for me, when I was very young,
I used to read all the time. I was reading

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:46.039
in kindergarten and I had this collection
of Peanut's books, the old Charlie Brown stuff,

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:49.369
first edition, still have them, you can't
have them, I'm never selling them on eBay

00:40:49.369 --> 00:40:53.910
either. These are mine. And my mom had, I
had a deal with my mom, that I could bag school

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.459
as long as I was getting A's. She'd let me
bag a lot of school to stay home and read

00:40:57.459 --> 00:41:03.279
my Charlie Brown books. And but then as I
went through school they beat the love of

00:41:03.279 --> 00:41:08.239
reading out of me. I'm in the eighth grade
and they're giving me Ethan Fromm and Silas

00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:13.269
Mariner and Moby Dick, Right? Now you can
argue with me that those are good books now

00:41:13.269 --> 00:41:16.239
that I'm an adult I'll probably still argue
with you, but when I was in the eighth book,

00:41:16.239 --> 00:41:21.640
those were awful books. They're totally irrelevant
to anything in my life. I really, I don't

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.620
even remember them; I don't want to remember
them. You know, Moby Dick I thought if you

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:34.759
took out about 68 chapters, it'd make a great
short story. You know, and then, it was so

00:41:34.759 --> 00:41:40.109
bad that I actually started college as a math
major. I was undeclared, but I was going for

00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:45.440
math computer science, because that was my
strength was Math. But then my freshman year

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.229
of college, my sister for Christmas gave me
a copy of the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

00:41:50.229 --> 00:41:54.489
And they were in their little white Ballentine
slip case from the '70's, right, from the

00:41:54.489 --> 00:42:01.329
late '70's. I'm looking at it, I wanted money,
because I had this really nice '69 Cougar

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:05.819
that broke down everyday. And the car was
draining my pockets, I just wanted money and

00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:09.910
she gave me books. What am I going to do with
these? Books. So I kind of threw them aside.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:15.589
Well a month and a half later in February
of 1978, and you say you're from New England,

00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:20.680
well, you had to have heard of the blizzard
of '78 if you're from New England. Because

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.240
what happened, it was Monday night and I'm
going to bed and the weatherman said that

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.979
we might get a little snow and of course being
a student, I hope we get school cancelled.

00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:32.299
Even though I was in college at the time I'm
still hoping we get school cancelled. Might

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:36.160
get a little snow. The next day I wakeup and
I look out and my car was missing and I freaked

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.829
out because I thought somebody stole my car
and I go running downstairs screaming "Somebody

00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:43.769
stole my car" And I realized that little spot
I saw wasn't the driveway it was the roof

00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:48.569
of the car. So school is cancelled for the
week. You couldn't leave your house, there

00:42:48.569 --> 00:42:53.279
were no roads, you were stranded, in fact,
you would be arrested if they found you on

00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:58.059
the road in a snowmobile. You were stuck.
So here I am, 19 years old stuck in my mom's

00:42:58.059 --> 00:43:05.369
house, oh joy! But I wasn't stuck there, because
of the Christmas present my sister Susan had

00:43:05.369 --> 00:43:11.170
given me. And all of a sudden I went to Middle
Earth with a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:15.579
I read those books like three times, all four
of them and the next week, I couldn't stop

00:43:15.579 --> 00:43:20.729
reading. And I went back and changed my major
at school. You give a kid, when somebody finds

00:43:20.729 --> 00:43:27.819
that book that gets them, whatever it is,
that just pulls them in and won't let them

00:43:27.819 --> 00:43:33.050
go, there's nothing you will ever teach that
person about reading again that they won't

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:38.650
teach themselves. So that's how it's changed
and now fantasy, the schools are accepting

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:42.529
it, which is really cool and about time.
&gt;&gt; Male 1: So sort of a follow up to that,

00:43:42.529 --> 00:43:46.029
in addition to fantasy and sci-fi becoming
a lot more mainstream, they've also become

00:43:46.029 --> 00:43:49.759
a lot more standardized as you were saying
there's very clear picture now, not just of

00:43:49.759 --> 00:43:54.160
what a dragon is, but also what a elf is what
a dwarf is. It gets emulated almost to the

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.400
point of esthetic, essentially being identical,
do you find that constraining, do you feel

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.460
that innovation in the genre has gone down?
Like what do you feel about the state of the

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.109
genre right now?
&gt;&gt; Bob: I think the genre is a thousand times

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:08.479
better now than when I first started. The
reason I started writing books is because

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:13.980
I ran out of fantasy books to read. Because
back in 1981 I had read the Terry Brooks,

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:18.009
the Stephen Donaldson's, the Michael Moorcocks,
the Fritz Leibers, of course Tolkien and Anne

00:44:18.009 --> 00:44:23.569
McCaffrey, I was out of fantasy books to read.
So I wrote one. Seriously, now you couldn't

00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:28.250
have that problem, but back then, I think
the genre was actually more standardized by

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:34.549
the mid '80's because and it was very limited,
because like there, the female characters

00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:38.809
were either damsels in distress or chicks
in chain mail, that doesn't work anymore,

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:43.020
at all. It's made the genre better because
you know what? I don't care whether you're

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:50.130
writing about a trip to go reclaim a dwarven
homeland or to destroy a magic ring or to

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.319
land on mars or whatever, whenever you're
writing a novel it's about the characters

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:59.769
period. When I got my first rejection letter
at the beginning when I was introduced up

00:44:59.769 --> 00:45:04.609
here, Leominster is known for four things,
right? We're the plastic pioneer city, we're,

00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:10.079
we've got Johnny Appleseed and I'd say three
things, and the third would be Robert Cormier

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:16.609
who was one of the most important twentieth
century young adult writers out there. I mean,

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:23.279
the Chocolate War, I am the Cheese, The Bumblebee
Flies Anyway, these are brilliant young adult

00:45:23.279 --> 00:45:29.099
novels, he's he's well regarded and he's still
taught in most schools in the country. When

00:45:29.099 --> 00:45:33.540
I got my first rejection letter, I called
him up, because his phone number was actually

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.829
in the movie, I Am the Cheese, that was actually
his phone number in the movie and I knew that.

00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:42.079
Because he had come to talk at my school.
And I called him up and said "You don't know

00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:45.651
me, but I got to talk to someone, I just got
this awful rejection letter today" And he

00:45:45.651 --> 00:45:51.239
kept me on the phone for like two hours and
what he really taught me was that, character

00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:58.150
is more important that plot. Because you,
if you have a really great plot but your characters

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:03.619
stink, no one will care, you have a mediocre
book. But if you have really, like, a hero

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:07.349
that the people will fall in love with you
give them a hangnail and they're really on

00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:13.940
the edge of their seat. And I think of the
only author I've ever read, or recently read

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:20.999
who, that seemed to go against that was Michael
Crichton, because his plots were, they just

00:46:20.999 --> 00:46:24.449
grabbed me. I didn't care who the characters
were, I just wanted to go to Jurassic Park

00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:34.209
or whatever. But, so you know, whether you're
writing a dwarf or a dark elf or even a dragon

00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:39.740
there has to be a human aspect to that character
that touches the reader or you've failed.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:45.460
And I don't think, you know, I maybe it's
becoming more homogenized but that's only

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:51.339
because it's everything you can do is being
done, so it's starting to seem cliché. I

00:46:51.339 --> 00:46:56.859
remember this great time when EverQuest came
out there was they had tier dal, the dark

00:46:56.859 --> 00:47:01.809
elves, right? And of course they were very,
"This is our world, we created all of this

00:47:01.809 --> 00:47:06.989
stuff" and, I always got to laugh at that,
because it was clear that they're a bunch

00:47:06.989 --> 00:47:13.449
of D and D players, I mean, the trolls regenerated,
I mean it was D and D. Right? And one guy

00:47:13.449 --> 00:47:17.191
who would, you know you could write your own
stories for the characters in EverQuest, he

00:47:17.191 --> 00:47:24.549
had written his story. And, he got banned
because it was just he was a wretched drow,

00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:31.201
I mean and then the people came back arguing
with Sony about "You shouldn't ban him. You

00:47:31.201 --> 00:47:35.739
know these drow elves are supposed to be evil
and look at the quests you give them in the

00:47:35.739 --> 00:47:40.339
game, these are not drow elves these are tier
dal. They are different, they have their own

00:47:40.339 --> 00:47:44.089
thing and blah blah" And then I posted on
this big fight that was going on on one of

00:47:44.089 --> 00:47:48.309
the message boards under my own name and I
said "Then why do they all have V's and Z's

00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:56.270
and apostrophes in their name" [Laughter]
Sony didn't appreciate that, but, so, you

00:47:56.270 --> 00:48:03.180
know, it, if you were to take the archetypes,
you know the big, the broad strokes and kind

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:08.779
of twist them around you got to be really
careful how you do it. The George Martin does

00:48:08.779 --> 00:48:13.910
that very well and he twists them around because
by killing everyone basically. Wait a minute

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:18.829
you just killed every character in the last
book and there's another book? Oh yeah. But

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:23.480
but you can't, if you started having dwarves
dancing under the stars and elves mining in

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:30.980
dark holes, it's just, it's become so familiar
to people now there's a comfort level of of

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:37.779
having a basic understanding of who these
character race types are. And that comfort

00:48:37.779 --> 00:48:42.910
level is very important. Even if it's, you
know, China Mieville writing about moth people,

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:50.539
right, in Perdido Street Station, they're
Orcs. They, he's changing the name and the

00:48:50.539 --> 00:48:57.410
description but he's using the same archetypes,
so you can get away with that. But there's

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:01.939
a familiarity level in fantasy now because
there's been so many books over so many years

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:06.299
I mean my book signings look like Fleetwood
Mac concerts, you've got a grandfather with

00:49:06.299 --> 00:49:10.799
his son and his granddaughter and they're
all reading the books, right? It's multigenerational

00:49:10.799 --> 00:49:16.819
now. And so there's comfort food in that.
There's an elf in a book people have a feeling

00:49:16.819 --> 00:49:22.289
of what that character is. And every now and
then something new will break out, I mean,

00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:26.730
I know that better than anyone, all of a sudden
dark elves became really popular, right? Right

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:30.730
after I started writing about Drizzt I got
letters from DM's all over the country cursing

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:35.069
me. Because every player in my group wants
to play a scimitar, wielding drow ranger and

00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:40.009
you've ruined them. I said "Do what I do;
we don't let drow in our groups. You can't

00:49:40.009 --> 00:49:44.000
play a drow in my D and D game." "Really?"
"Yeah, really." "Why?" "Because they're the

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.140
coolest monster in the game and I don't want
to ruin it, what's the matter with you?" but

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:55.519
every DM hated me for years on end. So every
now and then, something will break out, but

00:49:55.519 --> 00:50:01.839
you know, being different just for the sake
of being different can get you really no where.

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:06.119
So, I don't think, I don't think it's a big
deal.

00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:08.759
&gt;&gt; Male 1: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Bob: You're welcome.

00:50:08.759 --> 00:50:13.569
&gt;&gt; Announcer: I think we have the time for
one final question. I was personally wondering

00:50:13.569 --> 00:50:18.469
how you keep track of continuity in cannon
especially among, you know, your series of

00:50:18.469 --> 00:50:23.259
books and then as you said playing in other
peoples worlds. How do you make sure that

00:50:23.259 --> 00:50:27.660
everything is described properly and get those
allusions that harken back?

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:35.339
&gt;&gt; Bob: I don't. No, I'm only kidding. it's
hard. I mean, people come up to me and they

00:50:35.339 --> 00:50:40.799
start talking about like Streams of Silver,
right? And they start "Aw that part in this

00:50:40.799 --> 00:50:46.219
book when this happened" and I nod stupidly
and pretend I know what they're talking about.

00:50:46.219 --> 00:50:52.270
I wrote that book in 1988. I've done, you
know, 30 books since. I don't re-read them

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:59.180
every year. But you know, we do have a wiki,
the wiki is saving me. I'll go to Google,

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:10.209
I go to Google and I say, you know "Brunner,
scar" and the search comes up and brings me

00:51:10.209 --> 00:51:15.869
to a page that'll tell me where Brunner's
scar is and how he got it and when it happened.

00:51:15.869 --> 00:51:20.130
And so it's like the entire fan base is doing
your research for you and they're putting

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:24.890
it up on all these little forgotten realms
wiki all over the place. And this is a true

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:29.829
story, many years ago I was writing a book
called Servant of the Shard and what I thought

00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:34.619
was really cool is I have this character who
was just a lark, his name is Jarlaxle. And

00:51:34.619 --> 00:51:40.160
Jarlaxle is a, if you are familiar with the
literally term deus ex machina, right? A good

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:45.059
example of deus ex machina the dragon shows
up, it's killing everybody in the town; I've

00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:48.900
got a better one, actually, War of the Worlds,
right? The Martians show up, they're throwing

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:53.910
everything at them, they can't do anything
and then all of a sudden they all die of colds,

00:51:53.910 --> 00:52:00.319
right? The common cold wipes out the Martians.
Or the dragons ravaging the town and nothing

00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:04.789
can stop it and our hero falls down against
a rock, the rock moves and he finds a sword

00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:08.605
that was crafted by the elves 3000 years ago
to kill that dragon. So he stabs the dragon

00:52:08.605 --> 00:52:14.150
and it dies. So that's deus ex machina the
gods intervene essentially. Jarlaxle is my

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:18.549
walking deus ex machina and he would show
up in cameos in the books and no matter what

00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:23.759
was going on he had his little Jarlaxle Batman
utility belt and he had something, some weird

00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:28.410
magic item to counteract what was bad, what
bad was about to happen. It was a blast to

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:32.969
write. But he showed up in all weird places
in the books, the first books of the series

00:52:32.969 --> 00:52:37.560
and now I'm psyched because he's going to
be a main character in this book. And then

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:42.859
I'm terrified, because I've only got four
months to write the book and I have no idea

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:47.990
what this guy has for equipment. And I'm looking
at this pile of my previous books and I'm

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:54.829
like "Oh no, you know, where, which books
was he in, where am I going to find this stuff?"

00:52:54.829 --> 00:53:02.559
And, so I was about to call TSR and ask for
an extension, but instead I went online to

00:53:02.559 --> 00:53:08.630
a message board anonymously, right? And I
started a thread that said "Hey lets do an

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:15.529
inventory of Jarlaxle's cool items" and two
days later I went back and I downloaded this

00:53:15.529 --> 00:53:22.469
like ten page thread. And they were putting
in like, it was all footnoted, you know, in

00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:28.900
legacy, in the Legacy, page 227, they talk
about this item that Jarlaxle has and it does

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:33.209
this and I think it's hinted it might do.
So I grab the Legacy and I go to the page

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:39.979
and "Yeah, there it is" And there it was,
that's how I kept continuity. other than that,

00:53:39.979 --> 00:53:45.910
it's up to, that's like some poor soul at
Wizards of the Coast gets assigned or at Lucas

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:51.789
Film they hire some guy and say "You are the
continuity editor" "Oh you know I've got this

00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:57.630
great job" And then four truck loads of stuff
back ups to his house and dumps stacks of

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:03.620
books and DVDs and everything else on his
front porch and it's like "Here's the new

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:08.660
book check it for continuity". And he's got
this mountain of stuff, this poor guy. But

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:15.269
they, so it can get problematic and of course
the real secret to doing long term in the

00:54:15.269 --> 00:54:20.309
shared world is being able to retrofit things
seamlessly and make it look like you planned

00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:29.150
it all along. We cheat, not often, but because
we try hard to keep things straight. So, we'd

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:34.029
start anonymous threads on message boards.
&gt;&gt; Announcer: Alright well thank you very

00:54:34.029 --> 00:54:36.869
much, we'll have a book signing in the back
so thanks for speaking at Google.

00:54:36.869 --> 00:54:37.979
&gt;&gt; Bob: Thanks for having me here!
