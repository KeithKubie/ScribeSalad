on nuclear and when tsunami can simply

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
on nuclear and when tsunami can simply
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770

this is going to force every
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.970
this is going to force every
industrialized nation to reevaluate the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
of closing down reactors in that country
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.119
of closing down reactors in that country
in the United States we also have a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
in the United States we also have a
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.819
in the United States we also have a
crisis because we have old reactors just

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
crisis because we have old reactors just
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189
crisis because we have old reactors just
like in Japan in the United States we

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
like in Japan in the United States we
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.930
like in Japan in the United States we
haven't had a new order for a nuclear

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
haven't had a new order for a nuclear
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.569

Island 1979 we're dealing with really
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.020
Island 1979 we're dealing with really
old reactors and they have to be

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
old reactors and they have to be
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210
old reactors and they have to be
decommissioned this means that the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
decommissioned this means that the
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.580
decommissioned this means that the
United States is undergoing a sea change

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
United States is undergoing a sea change
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.700
United States is undergoing a sea change
with regards to a new generation of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
with regards to a new generation of
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.030
with regards to a new generation of
power plants what will replace all these

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
power plants what will replace all these
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640
power plants what will replace all these
aging nuclear power plants we may even

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
aging nuclear power plants we may even
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.560
aging nuclear power plants we may even
have to rethink whether or not nuclear

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
have to rethink whether or not nuclear
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.350
have to rethink whether or not nuclear
is the best option at all because the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
is the best option at all because the
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600
is the best option at all because the
question is let's say that the Fukushima

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
question is let's say that the Fukushima
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.200
question is let's say that the Fukushima
reactor was new could it withstand 9.0

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
reactor was new could it withstand 9.0
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.319
reactor was new could it withstand 9.0
and the answer is probably no so even if

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
and the answer is probably no so even if
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.660
and the answer is probably no so even if
you were to brace a reactor even if you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
you were to brace a reactor even if you
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249
you were to brace a reactor even if you
were to add more redundant safety

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
were to add more redundant safety
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920
were to add more redundant safety
systems I doubt that it could withstand

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
systems I doubt that it could withstand
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.490
systems I doubt that it could withstand
a one-two punch from a 9.0 earthquake

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
a one-two punch from a 9.0 earthquake
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.749
a one-two punch from a 9.0 earthquake
and tsunami think of driving a car

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759
and tsunami think of driving a car
 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.580
and tsunami think of driving a car
driving a car that's out of control what

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
driving a car that's out of control what
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020
driving a car that's out of control what
do you do you hit the brakes

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
do you do you hit the brakes
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.660
do you do you hit the brakes
well the brakes don't work it's still

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
well the brakes don't work it's still
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490
well the brakes don't work it's still
out of control and then the radiator

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
out of control and then the radiator
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.340
out of control and then the radiator
blows up and you say to yourself oh my

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
blows up and you say to yourself oh my
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.609
blows up and you say to yourself oh my
god next is the gas tank the gas tanks

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
god next is the gas tank the gas tanks
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.550
god next is the gas tank the gas tanks
gonna go what do you do you run it into

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
gonna go what do you do you run it into
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.370
gonna go what do you do you run it into
a river that's exactly what they did in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
a river that's exactly what they did in
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.980
a river that's exactly what they did in
Japan first the brakes didn't work

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
Japan first the brakes didn't work
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.229
Japan first the brakes didn't work
because the tsunami wiped out the backup

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
because the tsunami wiped out the backup
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.350
because the tsunami wiped out the backup
system then the core is heated up cause

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
system then the core is heated up cause
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.860
system then the core is heated up cause
a hydrogen gas explosion

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
a hydrogen gas explosion
 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.110
a hydrogen gas explosion
that's your radiator blowing up and then

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
that's your radiator blowing up and then
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.150
that's your radiator blowing up and then
when they do they ran it into the river

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160
when they do they ran it into the river
 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.949
when they do they ran it into the river
that's the same thing as dumping

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959
that's the same thing as dumping
 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.530
that's the same thing as dumping
seawater on these nuclear power plants

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
seawater on these nuclear power plants
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.750
seawater on these nuclear power plants
and of course to keep the seawater going

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
and of course to keep the seawater going
 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.059
and of course to keep the seawater going
you have to have power and they don't

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069
you have to have power and they don't
 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.820
you have to have power and they don't
have power and meanwhile radiation

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830
have power and meanwhile radiation
 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.400
have power and meanwhile radiation
levels rise to the point where it's near

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410
levels rise to the point where it's near
 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.920
levels rise to the point where it's near
lethal so you're caught in this bind

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
lethal so you're caught in this bind
 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.920
lethal so you're caught in this bind
even if that reactor was a new reactor

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930
even if that reactor was a new reactor
 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.080
even if that reactor was a new reactor
so some people are saying maybe we

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090
so some people are saying maybe we
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.030
so some people are saying maybe we
should rethink our commitment to nuclear

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
should rethink our commitment to nuclear
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.430
should rethink our commitment to nuclear
at all
