00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.260
So, here's one way to answer this question. We have

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.680
our two variable definitions. We can print out the distance

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.280
light travels in one cycle by dividing speed of light

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.680
by cycles per second using the variables, and when we

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.460
run that we see the result is 0.11. So, that's

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.490
0.11 meters, or 11 centimeters. Another way to solve this

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.600
that might be better would be to introduce another variable.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.490
So, instead of just printing the result, we can store

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.590
it in a variable. We'll call it cycle_distance. Now, when

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.910
we run it, there's no result. We haven't printed that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.180
out yet. But we've stored it in a variable. And

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.000
now, we can print out the result of cycle_distance. Which gives

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.810
us the 11, 0.11 meters. If we want the result

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.160
in centimeters, well since we've already stored the result in meters

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.990
in a variable, we can compute that by just multiplying

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.780
that by 100. And now we get the result in centimeters.
