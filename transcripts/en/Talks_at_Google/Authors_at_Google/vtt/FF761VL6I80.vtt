MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.930
We're very thrilled to welcome
Susan Middleton to Google

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.780
today.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.100
She was the chair of the
Department of Photography

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.610
at the California Academy of
Sciences from 1982 to 1995.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.190
She currently serves as a
research associate there

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.540
and has been on many very
interesting field trips

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.540
and field work, which she
will talk to us about today.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.180
And, of course, she did get
that always exciting and always

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.560
enviable Guggenheim Fellowship
as a result of her work.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.480
Her topic today is
Spineless, the Portraits

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.310
of Marine Invertebrates,
the Backbone of Life.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.030
It's the result of seven years
of field work in the Pacific

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.744
Ocean, and it's no wonder that
the physical space at Google

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:44.160
that we're
broadcasting from today

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.800
is also called
the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.990
She's been instrumental
in the protection

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.440
of marine conservation areas
off the Hawaiian Islands,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.110
resulting in the designation
of the National Marine Monument

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.630
that President Obama
put in a few years ago.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.360
Her work has earned
praise and endorsements

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.300
ranging all the way up to Her
Deepness herself, Sylvia Earle.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.510
And so please join me as Susan
discusses her photography

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.712
and her approach to capturing
these unique animals.

00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:14.670
So thank you very much.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.542
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:20.000
SUSAN MIDDLETON:
Thank you so much.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.510
It's a pleasure
for me to be here

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.430
at Google in the Pacific
Ocean part of Google.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.040
How appropriate is that?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.010
Because I'm going to
be showing you today--

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.280
I'm going to be taking
you on a little journey

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.210
into the marine
invertebrate realm.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.190
And I worked in three
different places,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.830
all in the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.190
So all of the creatures that
I'm going to show you today

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.040
are residents of
the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.000
Just by way of a
little background,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.760
I have been making portraits of
native flora and fauna, plants

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.380
and animals, for
over 30 years, and I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.070
started focusing on federally
listed endangered species.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.860
All of the creatures
I've photographed

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.430
are under the US flag.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.830
And that's intentional because
I want to bring awareness

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.060
to the native flora and
fauna that really share

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.960
our own habitat as US citizens.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.820
And I think oftentimes
we're unaware of them.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.350
So I started with
what's sometimes

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.470
characterized as
charismatic megafauna.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.530
So a lot of mammals,
birds, endangered species

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.870
that a lot of research
had been done on,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.630
so they were well known.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.630
And then over the
years, after six books,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.350
each time a new
project commenced,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.180
I was going a little bit more
for the less conspicuous, less

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.240
well known, understudied realm
of life, which I've learned

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.740
is equally important to sort
of how ecosystems function.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.220
And I attach myself to
scientists to do my projects,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.230
and my work really
bridges art and science.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.510
I've long been interested in the
nexus between art and science,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.600
and I feel that artists
and scientists share

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.110
a kind of motivation, which
is a quest for discovery.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.660
And there's a lot of creativity
in the minds of scientists

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.230
that I've worked with
and many artists that I

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.810
work with as well.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.960
And most of all, I
know myself, and am

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.030
very inspired by science.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.580
And I see a lot of the
same motivations working.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.270
So this last project
resulted in a book

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.990
that was just published called,
"Spineless, Portraits of Marine

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.120
Invertebrates, The
Backbone of Life."

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.940
And this is the
cover of the book,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.330
and the image you saw just
before is the cover image.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.250
And this is a juvenile
Pacific giant octopus,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.870
the most beautiful animal.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.787
And I've been doing
this for 30 years.

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:47.370
I think it's the most beautiful
animal I've ever photographed.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.480
And that's saying
something because I've

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.220
photographed a lot of animals.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.350
But this is a juvenile,
as I mentioned,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.590
and it would grow into an adult
Pacific giant octopus, which

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.640
is the largest octopus
species in the world.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.840
But it almost had, like, a big
attitude, even as a juvenile.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.551
And I worked with
it over three days.

00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.550
And I'll show you, as I
get a little bit further

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.320
on in my presentation,
how that happened,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.370
how I actually make
these photographs.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.829
This is a nudibranch,
a beautiful nudibranch

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.470
with very long
tendrils and tentacles.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.860
Opalescent nudibranch
is the name of it.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.400
And this looks very plant-like,
and in fact, part of it is.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.850
The eel grass that you see and
the red algae attached to it

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.700
is plant, but the
star-shaped creature

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.660
is actually a stock jellyfish.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.260
It's a jellyfish, and
those little pom-pom shapes

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.870
are feeding tentacles.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.380
And this is a favorite organism
where I did a lot of field work

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.650
on San Juan Island in the
Northwest Coast waters.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.120
They're kind of hard to find.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.600
They're exquisitely beautiful,
and unlike this photograph,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.200
they're constantly moving.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.480
And to get it with all of
its star-shaped projectiles

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.610
extended like this
took a lot of patience.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.700
I also worked on NOAA
research vessels,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.760
off the coast of French
Frigate Shoals, which

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.090
is one of the islands in the
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.010
There was a NOAA
vessel that went out

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.240
to that area
specifically looking

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.340
at marine
invertebrates, and also

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.900
in the Central Pacific around
Palmyra, Kingman, and Jarvis.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.501
And this looks almost like
an extraterrestrial animal,

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:34.000
I think.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.030
It's called a
white phantom crab,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.550
and it was pulled up in a
retrofitted lobster trap

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.290
from several feet deep.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.710
And the whole ship was staffed
with marine invertebrate

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.250
experts from around the world.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.240
So we had the
experts on the ship.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.070
This realm of life
tends not to be

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.400
funded as well, in
terms of the research.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.640
And also expeditions
that are specifically

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.430
focusing on marine invertebrates
are few and far between.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.500
So it was very exciting to
be able to be on this vessel,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.500
photographing things that were
being collected, some of which

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.440
had never been seen
before, and some of which

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.480
have since been described
as new species to science.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.850
And I'll get to that a
little bit more as I go on.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.820
This is called a
four-lined flatworm.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.250
I happen to love flatworms.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.510
It's one of my favorite
kinds of animals,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.230
and this is one of them.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.870
And what I've learned is that
flatworms are very important

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.680
evolutionarily because they were
the first kind of animal that

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.880
had bilateral symmetry and
a central nervous system.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.069
So we sort of stand
on the shoulders

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:41.860
of these humble creatures,
even though they

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.340
don't have shoulders.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.320
This is a giant
fleshy scale worm.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.360
I became very enamored
with the marine worms.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.060
And it took me awhile,
because I sort of

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.050
have an aversion to
terrestrial worms.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.340
I don't know why.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.940
But in the marine realm, and
I'll show you as we go along,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.350
the diversity of
shapes and colors.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.930
And they're just
phantasmagorical.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.340
Better than anything that Pixar
could come up with, I think.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.200
And perhaps Pixar is
deriving some inspiration

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.750
from this realm as well.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.160
This is a Taylor's sea
hare, and normally it

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.440
grazes on blades of eel grass.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.700
And it camouflages beautifully,
as you can imagine.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.000
And I'm sure you're noticing by
now that these images are not

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.330
typical nature photography.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.340
I'm visually
isolating my subject

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.320
against a white or
a black background,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.760
and I do that by
modifying aquariums.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.140
They're all live animals.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.700
They're in the water.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.050
I make them as happy as I can,
and I'll show you some images

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.040
as we go on that
kind of give you

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.600
a sense of how the
images are achieved.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.970
This is a lion's mane jellyfish.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.180
They get huge.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.040
This was, again, a juvenile.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.430
And this is a brittle star.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.300
It's interesting because
it's kind of a misnomer.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.040
Brittle stars are
not really brittle.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.154
There they're quite soft.

00:08:03.154 --> 00:08:05.070
They're quite fluid in
the way that they move.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.720
And that central disk
is not only soft,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.230
but it must be succulent
and delicious for fish

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.840
because these
animals always hide.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.250
They're never out in the open.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.610
If you're a snorkeler or
a diver and you pick up

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.370
a piece of coral rubble,
oftentimes you'll

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.330
see these brittle
stars scurrying away

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.870
to avoid getting eaten.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.880
This is a shrimp from
about 300 feet down

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.040
on one of those NOAA
research expeditions.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:36.070
The sort of bluish tinge that
you see are actually eggs.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.280
So this is a pregnant female.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.039
And this is one of my favorites.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.059
It's reproduced really
beautifully in the book,

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.990
and I can have really
beautiful prints made.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.580
But it's hard projecting.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.500
And the reason is because
it's a frosted nudibranch

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.870
and it's so delicate.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.490
It's translucent.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.950
It is a very, very
pale, lovely pink

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.690
and a very delicate,
lovely, beautiful animal.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.890
This is one of the
new species to science

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.830
that I was fortunate enough
to be able to photograph.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.660
And not only was
I fortunate enough

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.160
to be able photograph it, but
this is the only representative

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.220
of this species that
has ever been collected.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.330
This was on a NOAA research
trip to French Frigate Shoals.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.880
It was hauled up in
a baited lobster trap

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.714
from about 800 feet
down and collected.

00:09:27.714 --> 00:09:29.630
In other words it was
euthanized and collected

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.150
because the scientists
onboard the vessel were fairly

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.940
sure it was probably
a new species.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.410
The only they can
do the detective

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.370
work to determine
that is to actually

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.580
have the specimen, so they can
do the morphological research

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.520
but also so they can
do DNA sequencing.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.030
And it turned out it is
a new species to science

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:51.230
and has been named and described
based on this actual animal.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.960
I call it the stilt walker.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.000
This is a three-lined
nudibranch.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.580
And this is a black-eyed squid,
a beautiful, small animal

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.070
that I photographed at
Friday Harbor Marine Lab

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.250
off San Juan Island.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.380
And this is sometimes
called a devil angel.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.830
Usually it's called a sea angel.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.660
It's a tiny, little
creature, and you

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.690
can see the sort of wing shapes
that it uses for locomotion.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.130
But also, occasionally, it
protrudes these little things

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.690
that almost look like horns.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.330
So one of my mentors and
muses, Gustav Paulay,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.310
calls this a devil angel.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.350
This is a fragile file clam.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.500
Those are feeding
tentacles and also used

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.740
for locomotion, a really
spectacular animal.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.250
And this gives you an idea of
the NOAA vessels that I was on.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.250
This is the Hi'ialakai,
and it's dispatched

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.020
from Honolulu regularly,
usually annually or biannually,

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.090
to do coral reef
ecosystem surveys

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.430
up and down the Northwestern
Hawaiian Island Chain

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.820
and also throughout
the Central Pacific.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.700
And I went on two of these
research expeditions,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.170
as I mentioned earlier.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.750
So this is the main
ship, and then there

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.030
are Zodiacs that get
dispatched from that main ship.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.830
And you can see the
dive tanks here,

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.490
and that allows us
to get to places

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.530
that we couldn't get otherwise.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.186
Very fast, they're mobile.

00:11:17.186 --> 00:11:18.560
They're actually
call fast boats.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.130
There very, very spiffy boats.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.780
And then there's a crane
on the main vessel,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.550
and they get lowered
and raised as needed.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.240
This is inside the wet
lab on the NOAA vessel.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.700
It's kind of a
small space, and I

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.270
was sharing it with
10 other researchers.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.340
So we had blue tape, and
we'd each have, like,

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.860
maybe a foot and a half or two
feet maximum of counter space.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.580
And this is Scott Godwin, who's
one of the world's leading

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.790
experts on hermit crabs as well
as other marine invertebrates.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.070
And he was collecting
some wonderful specimens,

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.700
keeping them happy in
the lab, so that they

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.340
could be looked at by the
scientists and, in my case,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.340
photographed.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.210
And here we have fresh
water being pumped in

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.370
from outside the vessel
and some animals waiting

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.250
for their portraits.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.680
And these five-gallon
buckets were

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.660
kind of like little holding
areas, where animals would

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.620
wait for their
portraits to be made.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.231
And this is actually my
little area in the wet lab,

00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:17.730
and you can see a
little bit closer.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.730
There I am, with red hair,
but it is me a couple of years

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.610
ago photographing a tiger
cowrie, a live tiger cowrie.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.900
So you can see this
is an aquarium,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.210
and I've modified it
for the photography

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.790
so it has a white bottom.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.042
And then I actually have
a piece of white Plexiglas

00:12:34.042 --> 00:12:35.500
behind the aquarium,
that you can't

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.060
see in this picture, that
creates the white background.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.150
And I'm lighting
it from behind so

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.340
that I can eliminate the
shadows or at least control

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.030
the shadows.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.790
And then I'm hand
holding the key light.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.540
So I basically have
the camera in one hand

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.030
and a light on the other
and a lot of patience.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.330
And this is the final
photograph of the tiger cowrie.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.090
You know, most people have
seen these beautiful shells

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.365
because they are spectacular.

00:12:57.365 --> 00:12:58.990
But most people
haven't seen the animal

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.409
that lives inside the shell.

00:13:00.409 --> 00:13:02.200
And the animals that
live inside the shells

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.640
are, of course, even
more spectacular.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.140
And they make those homes.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:11.140
So this is the gray,
fleshy part of the animal--

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.950
is the animal that's
almost completely come out

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.180
of the shell.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.130
It's called a mantle.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.460
It can completely
cover its own shell.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.080
This is a hanging-stomach jelly
from around San Juan Island.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.210
And this is a smooth
brown peanut worm.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.280
Again, you know, it took me
awhile to warm up to the warms.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.430
But I decided after
looking at this for a while

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.220
and spending some time with
Mary Rice, who is 90 years old

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.780
and has spent her life becoming
an expert on these animals.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.710
They're called sipunculids.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.290
She kind of turned
me on to them.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.790
I said, well, how
long do they live?

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.873
She said, oh, I have pets
that have been in my lab

00:13:47.873 --> 00:13:48.880
for 30 years.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.840
I thought, 30 years, oh my God.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.970
So I gave them a
second look and decided

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.760
they looked like
Henry Moore sculptures

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.960
and they were beautiful
in their simplicity.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.030
And this is the picture
that I was able to make.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.070
This is a [? sub-auricular ?]
[? Kelly ?] clam.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.940
This particular one
spent its entire life

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.080
inside a beer bottle and
was protected in there.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.610
It got too big to get
out, but that's actually

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.936
fine with these
clams because they

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.810
get the protection of
being inside the bottle

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.430
and they can extend their siphon
out the neck of the bottle

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.870
to feed.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.500
This is another one of those
beautiful brittle stars.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.560
I photographed a lot
of these because I

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.340
loved their graphic shapes.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.420
And every single
one was different,

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.840
so there's lots of them.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.450
These are sea slugs, also a
startling variety of shapes,

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.910
forms, colors, textures.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.400
And that's what really drew
me to the marine invertebrate

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.330
realm as an artist,
was the inherent sort

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.130
of design and elegance
expressed in this realm of life.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:51.030
It's far more diverse
than terrestrial fauna.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.690
Though terrestrial
fauna is wonderful

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.970
and I spent many, many
years focusing on that,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:59.010
I was just kind of blown
away by the animals

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.440
in the invertebrate realm.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.940
And it's interesting
to note that 98%

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.270
of the described animals
in the sea, in the ocean,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.060
are in fact invertebrates.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.530
And as I've been
taught by scientists,

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.280
that number probably
is closer to 99.9%

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.210
because so many
animals in this realm

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.770
have yet to be
discovered and described.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.320
So we're vastly outnumbered.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.430
The marine mammals are
vastly outnumbered,

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.790
and even in the
terrestrial realm,

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.160
we're vastly outnumbered by
the marine invertebrates.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.050
And not only that.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.560
It's this invertebrate
realm that

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.980
really creates the foundation
for the marine ecosystem

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.640
and for the
terrestrial ecosystem.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.310
It really is responsible.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.800
These animals, collectively,
along with the plants,

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.700
are responsible for
the air we breathe

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.310
and the soil to grow our
food and the water we drink.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.340
All of it.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.160
So they're important,
and they're also

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.430
exquisitely beautiful.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.160
This is two nudibranchs
that are kind of

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.100
on top of each
other a little bit,

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.270
called the pustulus nudibranchs.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.910
And I think they look
like licorice candy.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.850
And this is a wonderful
animal called a

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.590
[? melobi, ?] and it
grazes on sea grass.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.700
It's just-- they're just beyond.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.260
This is a decorator crabs, and
you'll see several of these

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.020
as I go along.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.900
These crabs, they go round
and they just collect stuff.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.710
A lot of times it's
algae, sometimes

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.067
it's other marine
animals like hydroids.

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.150
And they kind of paste it.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.300
They have a little, like, glue
kind of stuff they can secrete,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.470
and they attach
it to themselves.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.040
And every one has
a different style.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.154
Some of them like algae.

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:35.320
Some of them like red algae.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.480
Some of them like brown algae.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.600
But the idea is that
they kind of blend in.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.470
It's camouflage.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.770
Here's another one
that's got some hydroids

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.235
attached to its head, like
a kind of a wild chapeau.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.720
They check it to make sure
that everything is in place.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.960
It's almost like
somebody who's fastidious

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.570
about their clothing.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.100
This is a wonderful anemone
from the Central Pacific

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.400
around Palmyra,
Kingman, and Jarvis.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.800
And one of the things that I
can achieve by doing photography

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.440
in this way is that
you get to see more.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.859
So even the scientists who
are very familiar with some

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.829
of these organisms would come
up and watch me photograph

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.627
because, in this
case, I was told,

00:17:16.627 --> 00:17:18.210
well, you know, when
you're underwater

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.630
you never see the stalk because
it's buried in the sand.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.440
And you may see
only just a portion

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.440
of this kind of radial
portion of the animal.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.090
So you can see a lot more this
way, by visually isolating.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.480
This is called the
strawberry drupe-- again,

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.460
a gorgeous shell, but a
beautiful green animal

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.800
that lives inside.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:43.050
So you see it kind of gradually
revealing itself here.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.570
One of the ways that I
achieved the photographs was

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.760
to piggyback on research done
at Friday Harbor Marine Lab

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.090
off San Juan Island.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.470
And this is one of the students.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.303
She had found-- this
is her favorite animal.

00:17:54.303 --> 00:17:56.760
It's called a nereis,
or a banner sea nymph.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.482
And she had found one
complete and whole,

00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:02.190
because they're very
difficult to collect

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.380
without breaking them.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.440
They're fragile.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.210
And so I was able
to photograph it.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.590
It had beautiful
iridescence and actually has

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.620
this proboscis that it can
push out when it either

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:19.750
wants to be scary or
perhaps assist in eating.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.575
But that's a
retractable part there.

00:18:22.575 --> 00:18:24.200
And I was told about
it, so of course I

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.530
had to wait and wait and
wait and wait until I saw it.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.080
So you see those black
mandibles in that picture.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.560
This is another
little nudibranch.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.550
Nudibranchs have these
interesting projectiles

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.340
which are called rhinophores,
and they're like sniffers.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.940
They're chemosensory perceivers.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.160
So that's what you're
seeing on the front end

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.630
of this little nudibranch.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.060
This is called a
treetop nudibranch.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.670
And this is an anemone that you
see in four stages of opening.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.450
That took about three
hours of waiting.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.970
That's called a
Christmas anemone

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.840
from around San Juan Island.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.959
And who knows, you
know, what was going on?

00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:04.750
I sort of assumed that,
well, maybe it just

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.310
took a while for it to feel
comfortable in the tank.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.910
Maybe it was hungry.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.360
Who knows?

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.810
A lot you don't get to know.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.920
This is an amazing
marine worm called

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.660
a ground-digger dumbbell worm.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.600
I think it looks kind of like
one of the Blues Brothers.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.010
But there again, an
interesting sort of wild

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.660
shape and character going on.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.650
This is another flatworm,
orange-rimmed flatworm.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.190
And this is another flatworm,
the Pacific spotted flatworm.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.430
They're very beautiful,
very delicate.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:46.040
And as I mentioned before,
they are the closest thing

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.980
that's living to the animal
that jumped from sponges, which

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.110
is a loose assemblage
of individual cells,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:59.020
into a huge advancement
evolutionarily

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.670
of bilateral symmetry and
a central nervous system

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:05.680
and one-end leads--
a lot of inventions

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.960
along with the emergence
of this animal.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.990
This is a hanging stomach
jelly that's blue.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.080
One of the things
I'm also trying to do

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.510
is actually make a portrait.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.500
I do consider myself a portrait
photographer, really, more

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.860
than a nature
photographer because I'm

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.330
trying to capture the character
of an individual organism.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.440
So not just
capturing a species--

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.460
it's not really scientific
documentation, per se,

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.460
though sometimes
it's used for that.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.970
So it takes a lot of
watching and paying attention

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.075
to an individual organism.

00:20:37.075 --> 00:20:40.260
And sometimes I go back and
photograph another individual

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.040
of the same species
because it's just

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.550
different enough to warrant it.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.080
So this is another jellyfish.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.590
And this is a very interesting
animal called a comb jelly.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:57.150
And recently I read, I believe
in "National Geographic," where

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.550
this animal is of particular
interest now to scientists

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.750
because the nerve cells
that exist in comb jellies

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.590
are thought to be the
earliest nerve cells,

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.205
evolutionarily, and
certainly the only ones that

00:21:11.205 --> 00:21:14.720
are extant now that represent
those first nerve cells.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.710
So they're being
watched very carefully.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.750
And they also are very
beautiful because they iridesce,

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.450
and the cilia,
little tiny fibers,

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.880
move constantly and create these
beautiful, shimmering color

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.250
patterns.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.440
And these are called sea
gooseberry, a similar thing

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.330
with these beautiful,
shimmering color

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.150
patterns that are
constantly moving.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.770
And this is called a
curly-headed spaghetti worm.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.130
A lot of these animals
have terrific names.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:50.150
And normally this animal will
be completely covered with sand.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:51.590
It makes a stand tube.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.307
It lives under the
sand, and then it

00:21:53.307 --> 00:21:55.560
extends its tentacles
out to feed.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.130
So I spent hours sort
of cleaning it up,

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.420
getting rid of all the sand so
you could really see the animal

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.320
and how it's built,
how it's made.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.890
This is called a
broadbase tunicate.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.750
It's a sea squirt, and
evolutionarily it's

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.520
relatively-- relatively, I
say-- close to human beings.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.260
It looks more like a vegetable.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:23.980
But scientists broadly divide
multi-celled animal life--

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.690
the metazoans, which includes
us-- into 34 categories.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.660
And those are called
phyla, P-H-Y-L-A.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.450
So of the 34 phyla,
33 are invertebrates.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.490
And the 34th, Chordata,
includes us as the vertebrates,

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:44.760
but it also includes
some invertebrates.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.660
And the sea squirt is very
closely related to Chordata.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.050
So what I've learned and what
I want to pursue in future work

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.140
is that a lot of times these
distinctions and categories

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.870
are based on anatomies
that can only

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.220
be seen in the early
developmental stages,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.930
the embryonic stages.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.070
Later, we change.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.030
We differentiate, and some
of those characteristics

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.520
are difficult if not
impossible to see

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.790
but quite clear in
the early stages.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.050
So the history
makes a difference.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.990
These are all nudibranchs,
different species,

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.940
different shapes, colors.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.830
I couldn't resist doing that.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.540
Sometimes-- I mean, usually,
I visually isolate one animal.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.600
But in this case this urchin was
cradling this beautiful little

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.550
[INAUDIBLE] crab, and I thought,
oh, they're wonderful together.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.230
I'll just photograph
them together.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.120
This is one of my favorites,
called a stubby squid.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.890
You never know what
an animal's going

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.350
to do when they're
put in the tank.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.650
And so I watch for
awhile, and usually I

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.800
watch before the animal
goes into the tank.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.080
And in this case, I
just couldn't believe it

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.080
when the animal kind of
propped itself up on its legs

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.100
and assumed this gesture.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.400
But it did.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.690
I can't get these
animals to do anything.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.050
They just do what
they do, and I try

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.600
to wait until they're
relatively at ease.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.090
Though I don't know if that's
quite accurate-- but relatively

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.511
relaxed in the tank.

00:24:09.511 --> 00:24:11.510
I don't want a picture
of a stressed out animal.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.718
So I try and keep the water
at the right temperature,

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:16.240
filter it for
clarity, and then I

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.780
take my cues from
the scientists,

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.480
who know these animals best.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.630
This is called the Tahitian
glass sausage, great name.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.340
It's a sea cucumber.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.800
And this also is a sea cucumber,
the black spotted sea cucumber.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.790
This is just the end, showing
the emergent feeding tentacles.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.010
And this was an
incredible experience,

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.450
photographing this
stiff-footed sea cucumber,

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.110
because Dr. Gustav
Paulay had collected

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.320
the animal right off
of San Juan Island.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.060
But all I could see--
those beautiful tree-like

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.450
extended tentacles
were not extended.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.940
They were all retracted when
the animal came in the lab.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.040
So it was kind of like
this white shag rug thing.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.490
And he said, you don't
see these very often.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:03.020
And even less often do you
see the emergent tentacles.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.420
But he said, maybe if
you wait long enough,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.330
you'll be able to see
that and photograph it.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.740
And it took days for the animal
to feel comfortable enough

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.040
to fully extend these
beautiful tree-like tentacles.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.400
So those are used for feeding
and sensing the environment,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.550
but can, in an instant,
be retracted for safety.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:28.030
This is another sea cucumber,
called a pedal sea cucumber.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.440
And, again, this red
sort of feathery form

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.310
can be retracted in an instant.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.450
Those are feeding tentacles,
and when they're retracted

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.700
it just looks kind
of like a pink lump.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.192
And it's very hard, kind of
a cuticle kind of material

00:25:43.192 --> 00:25:44.400
that the animals are made of.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.980
So it's quite hard to the touch.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.670
These, probably, most
of you have seen.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.510
They're, you know, the
classic gooseneck barnacles,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.590
but it was nice to be able
to look at them in a slightly

00:25:55.590 --> 00:26:00.930
different way and to visually
isolate them in the photograph.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.960
This was one of the
biggest surprises for me.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.300
I don't know how many of you
have seen beautiful white egg

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.360
cowries.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.970
Beautiful shells, they're
not endangered, fortunately.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.850
And a lot of people covet them.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.350
I have one on my
dashboard in my car.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.850
But a lot of people
collect them and

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.340
their beautiful,
white shell, high

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.670
gloss, the highest gloss you
can imagine, a pure white shell.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.290
And lo and behold, the animal
that lives inside the shell

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.450
is black like this.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.440
It looks like the
night sky, and I

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.400
had to wait a long time
for the animal to emerge.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.539
But it was such a
revelation, this black animal

00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:39.080
with these beautiful
white dots would

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.910
live inside this pristine,
beautiful white shell.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:48.340
This is another
type of sea urchin.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.640
And here we have the
airstrip nudibranch,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.820
tiny little pink nudibranchs.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.330
And this is an
interesting thing.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:56.230
This is a crab.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.010
I showed you earlier
some collector crabs

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.330
that collected algae
for camouflage.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.230
This is a crab
that actually hooks

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.630
on another organism, in this
case a sea pen, onto its back.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.130
So that from above it
probably looks like a sea pen,

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.090
or it could confuse a predator.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.710
Who knows?

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.760
And perhaps the sea pen gets
some mobility and table scraps

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.170
out of the arrangement.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.550
In this case, the same kind
of crab collects a fire sponge

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.080
and keeps it propped
up like that.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.220
And fire sponges, I've had
the unfortunate experience

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.320
of touching a fire
sponge, and they

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.890
have little spicules that
are extremely painful.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.450
And so this is a good
defense for this crab

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:39.160
to keep that fire sponge
up there like that.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.890
This is called a [? Columbia ?]
[? dodo. ?] It's the tiny,

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.150
tiny, little animal that almost
looks like a glass figurine--

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.330
lovely, delicate.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:53.570
And this is a Puget Sound king
crab, a really gorgeous animal.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.497
Everybody at the Friday Harbor
Marine Lab loves these animals.

00:27:56.497 --> 00:27:58.580
And so this particular one
was being kept as a pet

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.060
by one of the scientists there
in a tank for observation.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.570
I was able to photograph it,
and this is a close-up up

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:07.310
of the face of a
Puget Sound king crab.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.536
I mean, just spectacular colors.

00:28:10.536 --> 00:28:12.160
Somebody asked me
the other day, do you

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.980
enhance the colors
in your photographs?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.752
And I say, no.

00:28:14.752 --> 00:28:16.960
I mean, the real challenge
here is getting the colors

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.660
to be rendered anywhere near
as spectacular and as saturated

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.620
as they are.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.240
It's a whole other world.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.280
This is Friday
Harbor Marine Lab.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.910
This is their dock on San
Juan Island, Washington State,

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.600
where I did quite a bit of the
field work for this project.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.290
And this is Dr. Gustav Paulay,
who I worked with extensively

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.780
over the last seven years.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.940
And he's searching for
marine invertebrates

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.770
here on one of the
rubber tire bumpers

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.600
off the dock, which proved to
be a very, very fertile search.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.580
So they exist
sometimes in what one

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.640
might think of as
unlikely places.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.980
But this tire bumper
was a treasure trove

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.340
of marine invertebrates.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.570
It's a healthy
marine environment,

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.680
which of course helps.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.520
And this is on the research
vessel called the Centennial,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.950
and there's a variety
of collection techniques

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.760
that were employed.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.550
One of them, dredging, and
because it's not a coral reef

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.800
habitat, we could actually
drag this for short distances

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.840
on the bottom, collect
various things-- you never

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.440
know, it's like a surprise
package each time--

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.480
and then haul it
up and let it loose

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.710
in these big trays
on the vessel.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.390
And of course, there's all
kinds of algae and wonderful

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.200
marine invertebrates here
that have been collected.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.260
The students were very excited
about collecting things.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.988
And we were trying
to separate things,

00:29:34.988 --> 00:29:36.446
so that we didn't
have animals that

00:29:36.446 --> 00:29:39.200
would eat each other
in the same bucket.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.230
And these animals were
awaiting their portrait.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.100
You can see in the sort
of lower left here,

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.260
there's kind of this
pink, round-shaped thing.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.349
And that's the
pedal sea cucumber

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:50.140
that I showed you a
little bit earlier that

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.724
had this beautiful, red,
feathered protrusion.

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:53.890
But that's the way it looks.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.520
Like, if you were diving
or something or snorkeling,

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.520
you'd probably see it looking
like this, with surprise

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.420
yet to come.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.520
And these were selected
out for special treatment,

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.920
some very beautiful
mollusks, there.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.290
And this is the
actual lab environment

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.070
where the scientists
and students work.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.780
And these are called sea tables.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:18.950
And fresh seawater is pumped in
front the harbor just outside.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.760
And that marine lab has been
there for over 100 years,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.950
so it's a wonderful place,
kind of like a west-coast Woods

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.960
Hole where marine
research is done.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.271
And animals can be kept happy
here for observation and study.

00:30:32.271 --> 00:30:34.270
So it was a great environment
for me to work in.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.280
Here I am again in the corner
of that lab with a little area

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.880
set up for photography.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.190
And that's my little aquarium,
and I'm handholding, again,

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:46.100
the light and photographing
a hermit crab here.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.970
It's just emerging.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.290
So you can see I have a special
fondness for hermit crabs,

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.480
and so I photographed
a lot of them.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.050
This is a very interesting
nudibranch called a tritonia.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.470
A lot of neurological
research is

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.100
being done on these animals
because their brain cells are

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.270
big enough and there
are few enough of them

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:12.240
so that the relationship between
behavior and these brain cells

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.260
can be teased out more
easily than with a more

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.372
complex animal.

00:31:16.372 --> 00:31:17.830
So these have been
research animals

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.750
for a number of years there.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.030
They're shape shifters.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.450
This is what they look like,
or can look like, looking down

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.670
because they can
flatten themselves out.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:27.550
That's another thing.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.000
Because these
animals are spineless

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.100
and they have
hydrostatic skeletons,

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.960
in other words they depend on
the water for their support,

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.920
their shapes are
wonderfully diverse.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.210
And they truly are
shape shifters.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.930
These are [? pycnogonids, ?]
which are like water spiders,

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:43.960
sea spiders.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.360
In most of these pictures,
there are two of them

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.940
that are kind of in tandem.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.700
Some of these pictures,
they're on top of each other.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.660
This is two of
them, almost looking

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.700
like a snowflake superimposed.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.290
These are worm tubes.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.780
These worms builds
tubes out of sand,

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.320
and not any sand grain will do.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.000
They're very picky
about sand grains.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.190
Quite a bit of research
has been done on these.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.370
And this is the animal
that lives inside.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.550
It's called a phornoid.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.370
It's its own phyla.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.630
A lovely animal, but it can
retract inside this tube.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.210
And this is the tube built
by another tube-building worm

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.670
called an ice cream cone worm.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:26.637
And again, they are very
selective about sand grains.

00:32:26.637 --> 00:32:27.845
They're like little artisans.

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:30.520
You know, they're
like little masons.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.020
And they have a
kind of secretion

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.820
that will hold the sand
grains together, like a mortar

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.730
that they can build these
protective tubes from.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.270
This again is Dr. Gustav Paulay,
and he is reaching down, down,

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.610
down to try and
capture a diopatra,

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:53.035
a beautiful tubeworm that
lives deep in the sand.

00:32:53.035 --> 00:32:56.970
And this is low tide up on
San Juan Island, False Bay.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.156
And at this point he was
saying, I need an arm extension.

00:33:00.156 --> 00:33:02.530
It was like he could feel it,
but he needed to go deeper.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.790
The students were trying
to help by digging

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.220
the hole a little bit bigger.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.440
And fortunately he
was able to extract

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.429
this worm, complete and
whole, with its tube.

00:33:11.429 --> 00:33:12.970
And he's here showing
it to students.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:16.500
And it was pouring down rain,
which it oftentimes is there.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.280
But this is the worm that
lives inside this tube,

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.540
the diopatra-- just
absolutely fantastic

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.785
with iridescence and
marvelous projectiles.

00:33:25.785 --> 00:33:29.710
And, oh, it's just
beyond description.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.350
And this is a feather
duster worm, also

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.360
a tube-building worm.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.910
And it's got some
green algae that's

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.400
sort of festooning it's tube.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.640
But it can retract those
tentacles, just faster

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.680
than the eye can track.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.930
But of course here, it
almost looks like a flower.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:47.680
They're emerged for feeding.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.200
This is another one of
those crazy decorator crabs.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.890
This one was such a mess.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:57.470
It only liked this color,
this sort of, like,

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.400
very neutral kind of
beigey-brown color.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.820
And it had algae,
it had hydroids,

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.740
it had all kinds of stuff
on it as you can see.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.139
And I kept trying to kind
of clean up the tank,

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:10.210
and then I just gave up.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.699
I thought, well, part of
the character of this animal

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:13.830
is just to be a mess.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.409
So I'll just let it be a mess.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:16.800
And here is a close-up.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.280
If you look right in the
middle of this picture,

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.400
you can probably see
the eye, kind of.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.260
So yeah, it's wild, but probably
functions very effectively

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.020
for this animal in
terms of camouflage

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.730
and avoiding predators.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:35.469
This is a simple-- I mean, I say
simple because common-- mussel

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.460
that I saw in a tide pool.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.370
But I was really attracted to
the patterning on the shell.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.360
And I collected it
and looked up close

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.290
and realized that all
those little things are

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.250
in fact animals.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.830
They're little
tube-building worms,

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.429
and the largest animal
here you see is a scallop.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:57.750
There's bryozoans, all kinds
of wonderful things happening,

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.760
so it's like a little
living community.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.830
And my editor in New York
at Abrams, Andrea Danese,

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.950
said, oh, I want an evening
gown that looks like that.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:06.820
So who knows?

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.390
Maybe someone will be
inspired to do that.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:13.970
This is an ornate latirus,
a beautiful shell but even

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:18.010
more beautiful animal-- this
gorgeous, red carnelian animal

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.810
emerging from the shell
and another mollusk

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.140
with the animal just emerging.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.930
And this is a pom-pom crab,
really neat adaptation.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:32.230
The little pom-poms that you see
that the crab is holding onto

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.480
are in fact stinging anemones.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.210
And these kind of crabs,
this is their lifestyle.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.960
They find these anemones
and they keep them tight.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.140
And the anemones
are beneficiaries

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.490
of this arrangement because they
get mobility and table scraps.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.540
The crab gets the benefit
of having little boxing

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.160
gloves that will sting
a potential predator.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.400
Probably many of you have
seen these cone snails.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.710
Again, people love to
collect the shells.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.410
This is called a textile cone.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.330
But you see the animal
here coming out.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.190
These are very
dangerous, actually.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:09.310
You see a little kind
of spear right up there,

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:13.810
and that is filled
with a toxic venom.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.360
It has been known
to kill people.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.535
So when you handle
this animal, you

00:36:17.535 --> 00:36:21.160
must handle it from the other
end or not handle it at all.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.530
But they're quite
amazing, the cone snails,

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.200
whole group of animals.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.250
This is another
one of the animals

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.680
that I photographed
that has since

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.130
been described as a new species.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.470
This is called the
[? juana ?] [? juana ?] crab.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.455
You can kind of
pick out the eyes.

00:36:36.455 --> 00:36:39.620
It looks a little bit like
Jabba the Hutt, I think.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.860
But it was collected from
about 800 feet down on the NOAA

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.350
vessel around French
Frigate Shoals.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.480
So the two animals
that I've shown you

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.260
that are new species to science
all live below 800 feet.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.420
So there are amazing
realms of life

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.890
the deeper you go, too,
that are less known.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:04.730
These are called Venuses girdle.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.610
Dr. Gustav Paulay, when I
was on my first field trip

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:13.980
for this project-- which was
about seven years ago now--

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.300
he came up to me.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.370
He'd just met me.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.050
He saw my photographic setup.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.360
He came up to me on the
ship with a Mason jar

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.214
with the lid on that
was filled with water.

00:37:22.214 --> 00:37:23.880
And he said, if you
can photograph this,

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.660
you can photograph anything.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.410
And I said, I don't
see anything in there,

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.470
and he just smiled
and walked away.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.560
And I thought, hmm.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.860
So I went out on the deck.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.290
There was some sun.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.580
And I held it up to
the sun, and finally I

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.410
saw these little
shimmery things in there.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.950
And this is what they were.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.120
Probably the transparency
of these animals

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.502
served them well because
they can avoid predators.

00:37:48.502 --> 00:37:50.460
Because it was very
difficult to even see them,

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.020
but it was also very
difficult to photograph them.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.430
But I did it.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:38:01.580
Very interesting, these next two
pictures are of mantis shrimp.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:04.950
They distinguish themselves
in a couple of ways,

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.120
but the main way
is color receptors.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.350
We humans have three
sets of rods and cones,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.710
color receptors.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.300
Mantis shrimp have 16.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.480
They have the most
sophisticated visual acuity

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.350
of any animal known.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.470
They can see things that
we can't even imagine,

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:30.880
plus they can see 3D and
they can see 360 degrees

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.860
without turning their head.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.550
This one has the extra added
advantage of a tail end

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.740
that looks a lot like an urchin.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.990
So no one's going to
mess with this animal.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:46.480
This is another species
of green sea urchin.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.990
And these are
called ribbon worms.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.050
They're really long.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:54.112
They can stretch long,
long, long, long, long,

00:38:54.112 --> 00:38:57.510
you know, unimaginably long.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:02.940
And this is a sea cucumber,
called a leopard sea cucumber

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.470
from the mid Pacific, and I
love the patterning on the side.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.380
So I just kind of
did this close-up.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.000
It's very, very
inspirational, I think.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.570
The colors, designs,
and textures,

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.880
just from an aesthetic point
of view, they're wonderful.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.910
This is a pretty
cool little creature

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:26.630
with big sort of paddle thumbs
from surround San Juan Island.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.890
And this is a frilled dog welt.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:35.080
And again one of these
very diaphanous frosted

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.290
nudibranchs-- I think,
you know, Frank Gehry may

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:41.660
have been inspired
by this animal.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.280
I don't know.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.870
It's really hard to
see on the screen,

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.750
but it does render
beautifully in the book.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:51.260
It's just very
architectural and beautiful.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.050
This is a necklace
worm and a fuzzy crab

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.730
and another kind of anemone.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:03.900
And this is a
diamondback nudibranch.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.670
And this is a scallop.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.610
I asked another scientist
that I've learned a lot from,

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.420
[? Dr. Cohn ?] from
University of Washington.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.790
I said, well, why do
scallops have so many eyes?

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.802
And he said, because they
don't have necks, of course.

00:40:18.802 --> 00:40:20.630
Oh, OK.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.280
This is a conch.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.140
And again this is a shell that
a lot of people have seen,

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.890
but seeing the animal is
a much more rare thing.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:31.534
You can see the eye kind
of protruding up here.

00:40:31.534 --> 00:40:33.700
And this is the foot that's
coming out of the shell.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.770
It can move very quickly.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:41.465
And this is a beautiful
marbled shrimp,

00:40:41.465 --> 00:40:43.760
from around French
Frigate Shoals.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.120
And this is my favorite of
all the decorator crabs,

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.390
I guess probably because
it's just the most colorful.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.860
This crab collected a lot
of red and green algae

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:56.990
and some hydroids coming
out of its snout there.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.630
And this is a
giant spider conch.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:03.230
You can just see the eye,
just checking things out

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:08.080
to see if it's safe to come out
and make a run for it, which

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.250
is what he's doing here.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.260
This is another one of these
really, really beautiful

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.360
nudibranchs, and this is a very
old, evolutionarily, leaf foot

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.600
shrimp, kind of a living fossil
and a pregnant one at that.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.050
And this is an 18-scaled worm.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.720
And this is just beautiful to
see how this animal is actually

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.390
structured.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:36.050
These are, like, little plates
that it adorns itself with.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:38.340
And this is a sea cucumber
nudibranch that kind of

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.380
mimics a sea cucumber
in patterning,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.830
but it's in fact a nudibranch.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.960
And this is just
different shapes

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.010
that that animal can assume.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.520
This is a clown
nudibranch, and this

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.430
is the first time I ever tried
to do a portrait of an animal

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.770
still in the egg.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:42:00.350
So these are young
squid in the egg case.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.660
And then a little bit
of a close-up, you

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.370
can get a sense of
the animal developing.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:09.230
And here is just after hatching.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.510
This is a leaf flatworm.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.210
This drama unfolded
right under my lens.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.560
I was so surprised.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.440
The flatworm is
the animal that you

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.350
see at the top that
resembles a leaf.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.840
And then there's a nudibranch,
a dark, little animal

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.790
to the lower left.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:26.250
And then you see,
in the lower right,

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:30.420
this flatworm engulfed the
nudibranch and consumed it.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920
I ran to the scientists.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.940
I said, I don't know
what's happening.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.140
It seems like this flatworm
is eating the nudibranch.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.430
And they said, oh, well,
that's exactly what you're

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.992
seeing because flatworms
are carnivores.

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.950
So I'm really glad that
these flatworms are not

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:48.180
the size of double beds because
we'd be in trouble, I think.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.930
They-- sometimes I
have nightmares--

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:53.920
could just wrap around me
and consume me with enzymes.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.850
This is another
wonderful decorator crab,

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:58.950
different style,
different taste in what

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.510
it likes to attach to itself.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:06.600
Yet another one, this one
liked red kind of knee pads.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.070
And this was on the vessel
at Friday Harbor Lab.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.350
This was a plankton tow.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.010
So this apparatus
that you see is just

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.020
towed alongside the
vessel which moves,

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.350
and it collects the
animals that actually

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:20.000
live in the water column.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.130
And Sylvia Earle-- who
wrote a wonderful forward

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.060
for the book,
"Spineless," and with whom

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.700
I've been in the
field many times,

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.650
and I've known her
for many decades--

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.120
told me when we were walking
on the beach at Midway

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.390
a few years ago, she knew
I was working on this book,

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.690
and she said, well, what are you
thinking in terms of a title?

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.120
And I said "Spineless"
and then the subtitle

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.660
could be "Portraits of
Marine Invertebrates,

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.420
The Backbone of
Life in the Sea."

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.210
And she said, no, it's not just
backbone of life in the sea.

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:49.790
She said it's the
backbone of life

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.960
because this realm
of marine animals

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.890
is the foundation for all
of life on the planet.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.230
And she speaks beautifully
about the blue heart

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.490
of the planet being
the ocean itself.

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:04.410
And she talks about the
water literally being alive,

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.840
and it is.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.000
This is Dr.
[? Allan Cohn ?] looking

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.700
at some of the water that was
collected in that plankton tow.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.110
And this, you can't
even see, really,

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.720
but you get some
sort of impression

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.820
of all of the tiny
animals that live

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.790
in the water column
in healthy places.

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:27.780
The water is literally alive.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.920
And this is a lovely mollusk
that actually started

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.070
laying eggs as I
was photographing.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.570
You never know what's going to
happen in front of your lens,

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:38.230
and they carry on
with their lives,

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.670
which is of course what I want.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:44.120
It's a top snail, and these are
some of the eggs that it laid.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.240
This is at Friday
Harbor Marine Lab.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:52.080
We were out on a field trip,
and I heard a lot of excitement.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.680
These were students
and scientists, both.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.130
And people were gathering.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:58.650
I knew something great
had been discovered.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.376
And Gustav showed me.

00:45:02.376 --> 00:45:05.026
This is his hand
holding this flatworm.

00:45:05.026 --> 00:45:06.400
He said this is
a giant flatworm.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.024
It's the largest
flatworm in the world.

00:45:08.024 --> 00:45:08.530
It's rare.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:09.687
I've never seen one here.

00:45:09.687 --> 00:45:10.520
I've known about it.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.310
I've read about it.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.830
It's the first time
I've ever seen one.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:13.840
Do you want to photograph it?

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.010
And I looked at
it and I thought,

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.343
I don't think I'm going to
be able to do much with that.

00:45:17.343 --> 00:45:18.430
It's just a brown blob.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.420
Some of the other flatworms
have these beautiful patterns,

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.070
just stunning.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.850
But this one, it's big,
but in a photograph,

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.850
you can't tell how big it is.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.089
But I said, OK, I'll try.

00:45:28.089 --> 00:45:30.130
And he said, well, if we
take it back to the lab,

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.921
you have to promise me
that you'll bring it

00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:33.784
back to this exact
spot tomorrow morning

00:45:33.784 --> 00:45:35.450
because there aren't
that many of these.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:36.783
So I was like, OK, I'll do that.

00:45:36.783 --> 00:45:38.290
I'll take special care.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:43.160
And once in the lab, this
animal assumed the most amazing

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:43.860
gestures.

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.290
It was like a contortionist.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:48.400
It had an amazing
repertoire of things

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.490
that it could do with its body.

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.660
All the students
gathered around.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.240
The scientists gathered around.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.890
And we were pretty sure that
we were witnessing something

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:00.830
that humans had
never seen before.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:04.710
Because who would ever,
like, be able to see this?

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:06.990
You'd have to,
like, put in a tank

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.860
and be convinced to
do so, which I was.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.700
And then just let
it do its thing.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.940
And so I learned a lot
from this because it

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.030
was far from a brown blob
in front of the camera.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:20.980
It's one of my favorite
images, actually, now.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.527
This is a day octopus.

00:46:22.527 --> 00:46:24.860
Octopus are my favorite of
all the marine invertebrates.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.720
They are the smartest by far.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.080
You know when you
look at an octopus

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.810
that someone's home there.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:32.760
They look back at you.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.300
They're great escape artists.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.940
They can change their
color, patterns, textures,

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.800
faster than the eye can track.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.420
They are very successful,
evolutionarily, cephalopods.

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.600
And these are some pictures
of different octopus

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.350
in earlier stages.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:48.960
The last one-- this
one also is a juvenile.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.900
It's the cover octopus
but a different image

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.510
of that particular animal.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.640
And here is a close
up of the eye.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.700
These are chromatophores,
these little sacks of pigment,

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.640
that respond to
impulses from the brain.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.720
Octopus kind of wear their
heart in their sleeve.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.290
And they show and
can react vis-a-vis

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:11.600
their chromatophoric
expressions,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.360
quite beautiful to see.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.430
This is an octopus
with it's eye closed.

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:22.880
And this was out
also on a field trip.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.180
These are also a member
of the cephalopod family,

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:31.584
and they don't have much of
a repertoire of behavior.

00:47:31.584 --> 00:47:33.250
They're called
[? kitans, ?] and they're

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.820
quite primitive but
quite beautiful.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.890
They're like jewels that tend
to attach themselves to rocks.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:44.880
This is kind of a sample of
the different shapes and forms

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.480
that [? kitans ?] come in.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.650
The one in the lower
right is curled up.

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:49.390
They can do that.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.660
They can actually
roll themselves up

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.070
into a little ball if need be.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.040
And this is another photograph
of that beautiful stalked jelly

00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.140
that I showed you earlier.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.160
I photographed--
this is the same kind

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.330
of animal only on
a black background.

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:07.280
I was quite fascinated
with photographing them.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.510
And these are sea stars.

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.270
All of us are familiar
with sea stars,

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:15.000
and there are many, many
shapes and sizes of sea stars.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.300
They are top-line predators
in their marine environment,

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.840
so most of the other
animals are afraid of them.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.030
This is a little
series of hermit crabs.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:26.192
I'm going to wind up my
presentation with hermit crabs.

00:48:26.192 --> 00:48:27.900
And this is a hermit
crab that's actually

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.260
living inside a sponge.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.970
That big orange form is
a sponge, a live sponge,

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:38.380
that presumably gets
the benefit of mobility

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.380
out of that arrangement.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.890
It seems to work
for both parties.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.280
More hermit crabs, and
each of these images

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.990
is the same species
of hermit crab,

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:51.240
but different choice
of shell on the part

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.340
of each individual crab-- so
different homes, same species

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.550
of hermit crab,
pretty much based

00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:00.170
on shells that are available
to be had in their environment.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.240
Sometimes there is
not a lot of choice.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.770
This one on the
bottom, of course,

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:08.810
had the luxury of being able
to inhabit this beautiful cone

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:10.334
snail shell.

00:49:10.334 --> 00:49:11.750
But these are all
the same species

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:15.370
of crab, vastly,
wildly different homes.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:15.910
Same here.

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:18.576
The one on the bottom, you know,
that's kind of a damaged shell.

00:49:18.576 --> 00:49:23.390
But crab is making it work
until he finds a better one.

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.750
This is what I call the nudist.

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.060
So this is a hermit
crab, on the upper left,

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.170
without a shelf or any
protection whatsoever.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.536
So that's the abdomen,
and it has little hooks

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:33.910
on the end of the
abdomen that it

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.150
can grab onto the
inside of a shell.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:39.460
And of course, then once
I introduced this shell,

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.650
it was coveting that
shell and quickly

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:44.080
jumped inside for protection.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.010
Hermit crabs really don't like
to be without that protection

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:49.040
because they're so vulnerable.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.670
That abdomen area is really,
really soft and tasty,

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:53.710
I'm imagining.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:56.240
So this is the last image
of my presentation today.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.820
This is a hermit crab that is in
a shell that has two anemones.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.610
There's an anemone on each end
of the shell, that's not open

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:05.344
here, but can open.

00:50:05.344 --> 00:50:07.260
And then there's another
anemone on the front,

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.650
and then there's a
tube-building worm.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:10.233
And then there's
what turned out to be

00:50:10.233 --> 00:50:11.664
a very rare barnacle on the top.

00:50:11.664 --> 00:50:13.955
The scientists were way more
excited about the barnacle

00:50:13.955 --> 00:50:15.780
than they were about the crab.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.790
So it's kind of fun to
piggyback with these scientists

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:21.464
because they're like
kids, very enthusiastic.

00:50:21.464 --> 00:50:23.130
And of course, artists
are the same way.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.430
So there were a
lot of discoveries

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.430
to be made in this
realm of life.

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:29.220
And before I close
and open it up

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.820
to questions, which
is my favorite part,

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:35.849
I just would like to say that in
the process of doing this field

00:50:35.849 --> 00:50:38.140
work, I was working with a
lot of different scientists.

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.900
And some of them were
climate scientists.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.030
I shared some space
in the wet lab

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.760
with a NOAA scientist who
was collecting water samples

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.230
and monitoring for ocean
acidification levels.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.380
And he was pretty alarmed
at what he was seeing,

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.080
and that was several years ago.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.140
And I've kept up, somewhat,
with this research.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:02.680
I think that if these animals
could speak, all these animals

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:07.060
that I've showed you here today,
they would cry out for help.

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.390
Their habitats, which is
the marine environment,

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:14.020
that water is becoming
increasingly more acid.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:15.380
The pH is changing.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.300
This is well known.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.500
It's a simple
chemistry experiment.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.950
So much of the fossil
fuel emissions,

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:26.940
the carbon sink is what
it's oftentimes referred to,

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.810
have been absorbed
by the oceans.

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:32.810
And with that, the oceans
become more acidified.

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.610
Most of these animals
depend on calcium carbonate

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.820
for their life.

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.750
They need the calcium
to build their shells,

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:43.340
and they extract
it from the water.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.210
And if there's less
of it in the water,

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:47.780
they have a harder time
laying down their shells.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:50.800
And also once their
shells are laid down,

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.530
there's the risk of the
acidified waters dissolving

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:56.220
their shells.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.060
So particularly, corals
and mollusks are at risk.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.410
But all these marine
invertebrates, virtually

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:05.920
all of them, depend on
calcium carbonate to live.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.260
And without a healthy
marine environment

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:14.170
with these animals thriving,
we don't thrive well, either.

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:17.970
So they can't cry out
for help, literally,

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:22.360
but I'm kind of, like,
being their vehicle here.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.500
So with that, are there
any questions or comments

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.230
that anybody would
like to offer?

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:32.390
AUDIENCE: Now, my one question
I had during all your pictures

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:35.530
was I had no idea of
the scale of anything.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:38.520
SUSAN MIDDLETON:
That's intentional.

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.446
So his comment, question,
which is a good one-- and I

00:52:41.446 --> 00:52:43.070
saw your hand up
earlier, but I thought

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:46.610
I just have to wait until
later for questions--

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:49.610
was a good one, which is, I
have no idea when I'm looking

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.390
at these images how
big anything is.

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:53.260
What's the scale?

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.690
In the book, it's the same.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:53:00.130
And that is one of the magic
things about photography,

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:02.770
is that you don't get to
know how big something is

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.820
unless the photographer wants
you to by including something

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.100
that is a scale reference.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.360
In the book, in the back, there
are wonderful profiles written

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.530
by [? Dr. Bernadette Holtus ?]
about each animal.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:17.330
And included with that
is scale information.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.740
And I collected that
in my field notes,

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.050
but it isn't the first
thing I want people

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:24.899
to know because many of
these animals are tiny.

00:53:24.899 --> 00:53:26.690
They're not all tiny,
but many of them are.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:30.170
And I kind of want to present
them as heroic and monumental.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:34.880
And so I don't want people to
know, first off, how big it is,

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.510
but I want people to be able
to find out how big it is.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.344
In a presentation like this,
I just sort of elect not to.

00:53:40.344 --> 00:53:42.010
Sometimes I would say
the [? dodo ?] was

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:46.960
only 0.2 millimeters long, tiny,
like a little glass figurine.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.460
And then sometimes
I would say, this

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.780
is a juvenile of a Pacific
giant octopus, which

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.302
gets very, very big,
hundreds and hundreds

00:53:53.302 --> 00:53:54.260
and hundreds of pounds.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.940
AUDIENCE: Octopus can be
anywhere from tiny to huge.

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.920
SUSAN MIDDLETON:
Boy, can it ever.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.624
AUDIENCE: Nudibranch
can be from--

00:54:04.624 --> 00:54:06.540
SUSAN MIDDLETON: Yes,
nudibranchs really vary.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.570
They're bigger in
the Pacific Northwest

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:11.770
than they are in
the Central Pacific.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:14.459
So I don't want to hide
that information ultimately,

00:54:14.459 --> 00:54:16.250
but it's not the first
thing I want to see.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.850
I don't want to put a scale
reference in there for you.

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:21.630
I want this to be a kind of
other kind of experience.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:23.001
Yeah?

00:54:23.001 --> 00:54:24.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:24.980
I was just wondering
if you would

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.750
talk a little about
your photographic setup.

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.680
What type of camera and
lenses and any unique

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.304
challenges that you've
had to overcome?

00:54:30.304 --> 00:54:32.220
SUSAN MIDDLETON:
Yes, he's asking

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.890
about my photographic setup.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.290
I showed you the tanks
and that kind of thing,

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:39.060
sort of how I deal with
photographing marine animals

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.280
in filtered water, clear water.

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.080
Which, I filter it myself and
keep the temperature right

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:45.910
and all of that.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:49.150
The camera that I used for
this project, and for 30 years

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:50.565
I've been making
these portraits,

00:54:50.565 --> 00:54:54.330
and I always used cameras and
film, usually a Hasselblad

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:58.230
or even sometimes
an 8 by 10 camera.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.900
When I started this project in
2006, I switched to digital.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.480
So I'm using a Cannon
DS Mark III for this.

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.530
All of these pictures were
have taken with that camera

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:12.310
and BRAUN color lighting.

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:15.300
Which, I got about halfway
through this project

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.290
and I love it.

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:19.440
So I'm hand holding
a BRAUN color strobe.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.110
And what you can't see
in most of the pictures

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:23.870
that I showed you
of kind of my setup,

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:25.370
is that I have a
light source that's

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:27.510
like a light box,
that has, like,

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:29.650
a translucent, white front.

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:33.290
And it's known for being even,
edge to edge, top to bottom.

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:35.880
So I'm placing that
behind the aquarium, maybe

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.270
six to eight inches behind
because I don't want the light

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:40.810
to flare around the
subject of the photograph.

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.180
But that's creating
that white background,

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:46.870
and then I make sure that-- I
do a lot of testing in advance.

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:50.210
I make sure that that's very
close to 255 on the histogram,

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.060
so that it will come out white.

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.360
I don't want it over because
then it's unnecessary

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.110
and it'll flare.

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:57.640
And it'll cut the contrast.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.956
But I also-- you probably saw
shadows in a lot of cases.

00:56:00.956 --> 00:56:02.580
These animals are
sitting on something.

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.860
They're sitting on a
piece of white Formica,

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.200
basically, that I kind of sand.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.010
I don't want it
to be super shiny.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:12.570
Because those are real shadows.

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:17.250
That guy's sitting on something,
so I want that to be seen.

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:22.240
The only thing that I do with
Photoshop-- I never knock out

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:25.240
a background with Photoshop
because it looks cut out.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.030
It just never--
I can always tell

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.600
if that's what's been done.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.630
I will clean up backgrounds.

00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:34.000
The crabs are notoriously messy.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.110
So you can start out with
perfectly clean water.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:38.400
And then the crab goes in,
and it's like, oh my God.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.210
So there's just
shmutz everywhere.

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.390
So I'll retouch that out.

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:44.000
Sometimes I'll
give them a little,

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.926
you know, styling, if
there's too much shmutz.

00:56:45.926 --> 00:56:47.800
But, you know, most of
these decorator crabs,

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.716
I don't want to remove
anything because that's

00:56:49.716 --> 00:56:51.940
part of their whole character.

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:53.164
So I don't do a lot.

00:56:53.164 --> 00:56:55.080
I don't do much with
Photoshop that I couldn't

00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:00.795
have done in a dark room or in a
kind of more, what, analog way,

00:57:00.795 --> 00:57:02.460
if that's a correct term.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:10.230
Lenses-- the lenses that
I use most often here.

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:16.620
There is a 1X to 5X Canon
close-up lens that's marvelous.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.800
And I used that a lot, and
then I used a macro lens a lot,

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.760
100 macro.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.950
Those were the ones
I used the most.

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:26.217
Sometimes I stretched out
in other places, but yeah.

00:57:26.217 --> 00:57:28.050
AUDIENCE: I had one
final question, I guess.

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:30.150
What is the impact
of water pressure

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:32.890
on the specimens that
you're collecting?

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:35.590
It seems most of them are
fairly close to the surface.

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:36.734
Have you done deeper?

00:57:36.734 --> 00:57:38.150
SUSAN MIDDLETON:
Yeah, well that's

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:40.920
a good question, which is,
what about the water pressure

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.760
on some of these animals that
are coming from deeper places?

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.640
Most of the animals I showed you
are kind of near-shore or coral

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.740
reef creatures, but
not all of them.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.370
Because at the French
Frigate Shoals expedition

00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:54.620
that we went on, we
were collecting animals

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.560
from beyond 800 feet deep.

00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.800
The two animals that are
new species to science

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.550
were both collected in
baited lobster traps

00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:05.430
that were set to over 100 feet.

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:09.130
So I've worked with fish,
not in this project,

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.610
and with collectors
and scientists who

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.180
have popped the swim bladders
when they bring up fish

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.390
from quite deep because
the pressure is really

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:20.630
an issue for keeping
those animals alive.

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:24.241
These are spineless creatures.

00:58:24.241 --> 00:58:25.740
And I'm not an
expert in this, but I

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.750
think they're not as
vulnerable to pressure changes

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:30.910
because both of those
animals were kept alive

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:34.915
on the ship that came up along
with many others that deep.

00:58:34.915 --> 00:58:37.290
I can't imagine that there
aren't certain considerations,

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:39.470
but I don't know the details.

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:41.780
AUDIENCE: And you mentioned
one project of what's next.

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:44.120
Anything else on your
mind artistically?

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.400
SUSAN MIDDLETON: You know,
I got very interested

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.816
when I was doing-- I could
photograph marine invertebrates

00:58:47.816 --> 00:58:50.745
for the rest of my
life and six lifetimes.

00:58:50.745 --> 00:58:55.000
I mean, there's just so much out
there and yet to be discovered.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.610
but what I became
really interested in

00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:59.580
were the developmental stages
of a lot of these animals, which

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:02.900
you see in their
embryological stages.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.990
So for example, that broad
based tunicat that I said

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:08.890
was kind of, like, relatively
closely related to chordates,

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:10.860
or us, you would never know.

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.700
It looks like an
orange vegetable.

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.590
But in its embryological
stages, and

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:18.060
in our embryological
stages, we each have

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:21.000
evidence of something called
a notocord and pharyngeal gill

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:21.500
slits.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.940
Those are two early
evolutionary features

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.520
that defined chordates.

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.590
But you can't see
it unless you go

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:31.469
into that developmental
stage and look

00:59:31.469 --> 00:59:33.010
at it, which is
through a microscope.

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:35.410
So I'm really interested
in kind of diving

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:38.249
into inner space a little
bit in a next project.

00:59:38.249 --> 00:59:39.790
AUDIENCE: Awesome,
well, Susan, thank

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:40.660
you very much for
speaking with us.

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:40.975
SUSAN MIDDLETON: Thank you.

00:59:40.975 --> 00:59:43.410
AUDIENCE: The book is available
wherever books are sold.

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:45.660
So thanks for
speaking at Google.
