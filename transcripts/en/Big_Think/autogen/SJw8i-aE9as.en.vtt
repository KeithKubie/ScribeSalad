needed someone else's bone marrow and

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199
needed someone else's bone marrow and
 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.230
needed someone else's bone marrow and
someone else's lungs in order to stay

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
someone else's lungs in order to stay
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.650
someone else's lungs in order to stay
alive so quite literally people

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
alive so quite literally people
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.020
alive so quite literally people
connected are like in my body and that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
connected are like in my body and that
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.850
connected are like in my body and that
was a pretty major thing for me I'm

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860
was a pretty major thing for me I'm
 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.959
was a pretty major thing for me I'm
trying to understand what that meant

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969
trying to understand what that meant
 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.740
trying to understand what that meant
understanding what that what that meant

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
understanding what that what that meant
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.680
understanding what that what that meant
for my faith and my and my spirituality

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
for my faith and my and my spirituality
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.290
for my faith and my and my spirituality
around it so I would I started a whole

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
around it so I would I started a whole
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.049
around it so I would I started a whole
inquiry of what does this mean for my

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
inquiry of what does this mean for my
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.790
inquiry of what does this mean for my
life like what is possible when all of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
life like what is possible when all of
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.010
life like what is possible when all of
humanity is connected what does it mean

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
humanity is connected what does it mean
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.299
humanity is connected what does it mean
for what I'm supposed to do while I'm

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
for what I'm supposed to do while I'm
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.580
for what I'm supposed to do while I'm
here on all the things that religion

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
here on all the things that religion
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250
here on all the things that religion
traditionally provides for folks I found

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260
traditionally provides for folks I found
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.959
traditionally provides for folks I found
that I had this new faith a new faith in

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
that I had this new faith a new faith in
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.399
that I had this new faith a new faith in
the connected humanity but didn't know

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
the connected humanity but didn't know
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.820
the connected humanity but didn't know
what that necessarily meant for what the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
what that necessarily meant for what the
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.760
what that necessarily meant for what the
purpose of my life was and what I came

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
purpose of my life was and what I came
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.719
purpose of my life was and what I came
to understand is that there is something

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729
to understand is that there is something
 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.490
to understand is that there is something
unique and special about every single

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
unique and special about every single
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.679
unique and special about every single
person there's something inside of them

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
person there's something inside of them
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.520
person there's something inside of them
that they are meant to create and it can

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
that they are meant to create and it can
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.640
that they are meant to create and it can
be really hard to figure out what that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
be really hard to figure out what that
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.050
be really hard to figure out what that
is but when you do and you have the guts

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
is but when you do and you have the guts
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.230
is but when you do and you have the guts
and determination to actually make it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
and determination to actually make it
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.730
and determination to actually make it
happen it's the most extraordinary thing

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
happen it's the most extraordinary thing
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.969
happen it's the most extraordinary thing
any human can do and if everyone is

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
any human can do and if everyone is
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.789
any human can do and if everyone is
doing that everyone is sort of fully

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
doing that everyone is sort of fully
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859
doing that everyone is sort of fully
unlocking all that potential inside of

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
unlocking all that potential inside of
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.649
unlocking all that potential inside of
them then that becomes God that is how

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
them then that becomes God that is how
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.899
them then that becomes God that is how
we can be the greatest God we can be and

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909
we can be the greatest God we can be and
 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.330
we can be the greatest God we can be and
that I sort of guided my life since then

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
that I sort of guided my life since then
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.280
that I sort of guided my life since then
and I wanted to share it with folks I

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290
and I wanted to share it with folks I
 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.350
and I wanted to share it with folks I
think one of the big challenges that we

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
think one of the big challenges that we
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.010
think one of the big challenges that we
face as humans is how to make connected

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
face as humans is how to make connected
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.690
face as humans is how to make connected
humans be greater than the sum of their

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
humans be greater than the sum of their
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.980
humans be greater than the sum of their
parts

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990
parts
 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.850
parts
it's it's you can see it in like the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
it's it's you can see it in like the
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.980
it's it's you can see it in like the
inefficiencies that emerge even in sort

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990
inefficiencies that emerge even in sort
 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.680

of large organizations bureaucracy

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690
of large organizations bureaucracy

government like as people come together

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460
government like as people come together
 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.910
government like as people come together
it frequently leads to less things

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
it frequently leads to less things
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.580
it frequently leads to less things
getting done rather than more things

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
getting done rather than more things
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.010
getting done rather than more things
getting done and so we haven't figured

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
getting done and so we haven't figured
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.750
getting done and so we haven't figured
out how all of that works but that is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
out how all of that works but that is
 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.660
out how all of that works but that is
the great challenge that is what we

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670
the great challenge that is what we
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.220
the great challenge that is what we
should all strive for and we're starting

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
should all strive for and we're starting
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.540
should all strive for and we're starting
to see new models emerge online where

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550
to see new models emerge online where
 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.310
to see new models emerge online where
they operate where where groups of

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
they operate where where groups of
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.180
they operate where where groups of
people operate in a more collaborative

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
people operate in a more collaborative
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.020
people operate in a more collaborative
but also competitive kind of way open

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030
but also competitive kind of way open
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.880
but also competitive kind of way open
source software is a great example of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890
source software is a great example of
 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.170
source software is a great example of
this where the coordination costs have

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
this where the coordination costs have
 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.600
this where the coordination costs have
come down dramatically like I don't have

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610
come down dramatically like I don't have
 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.940
come down dramatically like I don't have
to ask for somebody's permission to be

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950
to ask for somebody's permission to be
 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.730
to ask for somebody's permission to be
able to fork somebody's code and and and

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740
able to fork somebody's code and and and
 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.340
able to fork somebody's code and and and
make my own version of it whereas

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350
make my own version of it whereas

make my own version of it whereas
traditionally collaboration requires a

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
traditionally collaboration requires a
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.510
traditionally collaboration requires a
bunch of people to get into a room and

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520
bunch of people to get into a room and
 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.240
bunch of people to get into a room and
to sort of all work things out and that

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
to sort of all work things out and that
 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.550
to sort of all work things out and that
doesn't work when it's a thousand or a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560
doesn't work when it's a thousand or a
 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.040
doesn't work when it's a thousand or a
million or ten million people so the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050
million or ten million people so the
 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.260
million or ten million people so the
great a great challenge for us is to

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270
great a great challenge for us is to
 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.490
great a great challenge for us is to
figure out what are the ways in which

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
figure out what are the ways in which
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.620
figure out what are the ways in which
very very large groups of people can

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630
very very large groups of people can
 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.520
very very large groups of people can
accomplish things that were never

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
accomplish things that were never
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.280
accomplish things that were never
possible before much of what we call the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290
possible before much of what we call the
 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.810
possible before much of what we call the
sharing economy or even to on-demand

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820
sharing economy or even to on-demand
 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.080
sharing economy or even to on-demand
economy it's really just like you know

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090
economy it's really just like you know
 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.570
economy it's really just like you know
Airbnb and and you know Kickstarter and

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580
Airbnb and and you know Kickstarter and
 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.820
Airbnb and and you know Kickstarter and
these things really what that is is that

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830
these things really what that is is that
 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.460
these things really what that is is that
is that's communities accomplishing

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470
is that's communities accomplishing
 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.540
is that's communities accomplishing
things that was just weren't possible

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550
things that was just weren't possible
 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.320
things that was just weren't possible
before and the more that we can figure

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330
before and the more that we can figure
 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.860
before and the more that we can figure
that out the more that we can scale that

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870
that out the more that we can scale that
 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.810
that out the more that we can scale that
the more successful the more impact that

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820
the more successful the more impact that
 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.540
the more successful the more impact that
will have as individuals as leaders but

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550
will have as individuals as leaders but
 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.180
will have as individuals as leaders but
also as humans what's different and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190
also as humans what's different and
 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.960
also as humans what's different and
unique about my faith is that all of us

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970
unique about my faith is that all of us
 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.280
unique about my faith is that all of us
have the opportunity to impact the kind

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
have the opportunity to impact the kind
 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.699
have the opportunity to impact the kind
of God we are God is not something

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709
of God we are God is not something
 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.980
of God we are God is not something
that's out there that just is it is all

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990
that's out there that just is it is all
 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.900
that's out there that just is it is all
of us together and so what we do and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910
of us together and so what we do and
 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.849
