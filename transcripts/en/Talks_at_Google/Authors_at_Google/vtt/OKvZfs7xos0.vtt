JULIE WESTKIRCHEN: OK.

00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.420
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm Julie Westkirchen from
the Talks at Google team

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.900
here at Google LA.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.560
And today is Take
Your Dogs to Work Day.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.800
And we see a lot of dogs here
in the crowd which is great.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.930
And we are excited to
welcome Seth Casteel.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.490
Just a little
background on Seth.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.950
In 2007, he began volunteering
to photograph homeless pets

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.050
to help them find
loving families.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.590
And, since then, has developed
a career as a lifestyle pet

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.570
photographer
accepting commissions

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.380
and commercial
assignments, collaborating

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.990
with dozens of publishers,
and exhibiting his artwork

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.557
in galleries around the world.

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:35.140
His work has been published in
"National Geographic" magazine,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.680
"The New York Times",
and in hundreds

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.596
of other magazines,
newspapers, and calendars.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.770
His non-profit campaign,
One Picture Saves a Life,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.410
inspires, empowers, and
educates Animal Ambassadors

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.987
around the world to improve the
image of rescue and adoption

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:49.195
through positive photography.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.040
His book, "Underwater Dogs",
was the bestselling photography

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.700
book of 2012.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.200
And today, he's going to
talk about his new book which

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.260
is called "Underwater Puppies".

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.366
So please join me in
welcoming Seth Casteel.

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.209
SETH CASTEEL: Thank you.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.980
It's good to be here.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.313
I actually live down the street.

00:01:06.313 --> 00:01:08.670
I never had an opportunity
to come here to the campus.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.810
So kind of exciting.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.090
I was also up in the
Mountain View area yesterday

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.500
riding around on a Google bike.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.890
So I've had two days of Google.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.975
Pretty cool.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.630
So my name's Seth.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.230
My last name's Casteel.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.075
I am an author sort of.

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:26.700
OK, I always tell
people I'm an author.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.825
And they're like, well,
what are you writing about?

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:29.622
Nothing.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:30.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:33.280
SETH CASTEEL: So I'm
technically an author.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.880
But also a photographer.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.440
But more than
anything else, I just

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.730
love dogs, and then cats, and
lots of other animals too.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.405
So that's just kind of my thing.

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:44.155
A little fun fact about
me, I don't really

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:46.200
even love photography that much.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.500
I'm not the crazy photography
guy a lot of people

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.130
think that I would be.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.100
Years ago, I think I
just got real excited

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.712
about learning
about photography,

00:01:54.712 --> 00:01:56.045
and the cameras, and the lenses.

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:58.761
And I used to bring my gear
everywhere, travel around

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.010
the country, around the world.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.384
I'd take pictures
of everything--

00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:05.180
my friends, myself, landscapes.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.290
Anything I could just take
a picture of, I would.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.680
And then, I think
I just realized

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.470
I was missing out on the moment
which I should be enjoying.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.995
So it was all about the picture.

00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:17.800
And I just missed out on
a lot of moments there.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.050
So I stopped taking pictures.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.860
Really, I don't take
pictures of anything

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.401
unless it's something
that I'm really

00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.580
passionate about like
this project here.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.680
I have hundreds of thousands of
pictures sitting on hard drive

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.071
from years ago some of
which might be pretty cool.

00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:32.320
I haven't even looked at them.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.440
Haven't even looked at them.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.420
In terms of my
career, I might be

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.060
a photographer for
another few years.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.460
I might.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.180
I might not.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.310
I have no idea.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.030
I just like to use
photography to tell my story

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.860
and tell the story
of my subject matter.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.237
And that's why I use photography
because it works out for me.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.820
Before we get into
this, first of all,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.006
how many dog people out there?

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:55.957
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:57.290
SETH CASTEEL: That's surprising.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.290
OK, how many cat
people out there?

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.790
All righty.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.071
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:02.320
SETH CASTEEL: I like cats too.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.494
But I'm more of a dog guy.

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:06.493
Actually, I'm working on
the new book right now,

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:07.522
"Underwater Cats".

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:08.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.960
SETH CASTEEL: If you
go to the website,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.300
Underwater Cats.com--
which I own-- you'll

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.150
find approximately
zero pictures.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.585
SETH CASTEEL: That book
is on hold indefinitely.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.760
But in case the world
turns upside down,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.077
and dogs become cats,
and cats become dogs,

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:25.410
I will be ready for that moment.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.930
Speaking of cats, this
is how I got started.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.590
And I'd like to
speak to you guys

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.500
for maybe about 30 minutes-ish.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.990
If people are disappearing
or throwing tomatoes at me,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.310
I'll try to cut it off sooner.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.880
But you give me a
microphone, and you give me

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.520
a huge screen like this,
I'm going to ramble on.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.300
So also, at any
point during this,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.746
if anybody has any
questions, feel

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:50.120
free to just raise your hand,
run over to the microphone,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.810
and ask me.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.550
And I'll do my
best to answer you.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.141
So this is how it
all started for me.

00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:56.890
I'm originally from
the state of Illinois.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.890
I moved out to
California in 1999,

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.600
went to Chapman University
down in Orange County.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.065
Studied film production.

00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:06.190
Thought I was going to be
a movie director, a movie

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.550
producer, a movie writer.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.150
Got a job at Sony Pictures,
right out of college,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.850
as an assistant.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.410
And then, moved into finance.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.368
And actually, had quite
a bit of responsibility

00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:17.500
in finance having no
experience in finance.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.040
And people are
wondering why Sony

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.459
wasn't doing so well for awhile.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.360
But made the transition over
to motion pictures where

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.510
I was working on
advertising campaigns,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.390
movie posters, trailers, TV
spots for all of Columbia

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.955
Pictures movies-- "James Bond",
"Spiderman", "Angels &amp; Demons",

00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:35.770
"Da Vinci Code",
that kind of thing.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.170
Pretty cool.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.850
And that's where I met these
little cats, these baby cats.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.100
I had a friend of
mine, wonderful lady,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.780
all about animal welfare,
all about helping cats.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.530
She's the kind of
person who can't say no.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.870
You ask her if she can
help, hey, I found a cat.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.830
Hey, can you just watch
my cat for awhile?

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.330
Can you take this
litter of kittens?

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.310
It's always a yes.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.020
So I think maybe her heart,
sometimes, is a little bigger

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.040
than the logic of her mind.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.890
For that, you can
applaud her, but also can

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.250
get someone in trouble.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.340
When I first met her, she was
also working at Sony with me.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.930
She had five cats.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.540
And then, within a period of
time, she had about 60 cats.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.634
And I said, "You
know, I don't know--"

00:05:14.634 --> 00:05:16.800
I'm not going to mention
her name here just in case.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.930
But sweet lady.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.464
But I said, "I don't
know a lot about cats.

00:05:20.464 --> 00:05:22.630
But I feel like that's at
least five too many cats."

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.011
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.010
SETH CASTEEL: So anyways,
we found these kittens

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.729
on the Sony picture studio lot.

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.145
Basically, what
was going on there

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:30.728
was a bunch of cats
living on the lot.

00:05:30.728 --> 00:05:32.244
There was a feral cat colony.

00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:34.410
And then, my friend and
some other people there Sony

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.110
would take care
of the feral cats,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.600
make sure they're well-fed,
their health is all right.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.180
Any new additions, they
would trap, spay or neuter,

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.162
and release them back
into the studio wild.

00:05:43.162 --> 00:05:45.370
The cat's had it pretty good
there in the lot though.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.950
I mean, things were going well,
hanging out with movie stars,

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.440
unlimited food options.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.017
And they called
all their friends.

00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:53.475
I mean, they just
got on the phone.

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:54.990
They called everybody.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.129
So cats were just coming
into Sony left and right.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.420
What happens when that happens?

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.600
Baby cats.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.662
So they found these guys.

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.245
And my friend was
like, "Oh, no, Seth.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.390
More cats, the babies, you
know I have to keep them.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.750
What are we going to do?"

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.840
So I had just got a Rebel XT,
from Canon, and a Sigma 24-70

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.760
lens, was experimenting with
photography a little bit.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.380
So I said, "Hey, let's take
some pictures of these clowns

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.790
and use the Sony email
network, blast out the shots,

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.060
and see if we can get some
attention right away."

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.660
Because I just knew that
the kittens needed help.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.444
And my friend was
way in over her head.

00:06:31.444 --> 00:06:32.360
So that's what we did.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.450
We snuck into an
executive's office, actually

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.390
John Calley's
office at the time.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.670
He was out for lunch.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.990
And the kittens were
just climbing around

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.000
on the furniture.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.870
Didn't know much
about photography.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.270
Didn't know a lot about cats.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.519
Just did these snapshots.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:47.935
I like the claw
here on the couch.

00:06:47.935 --> 00:06:48.670
It's my favorite.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.630
So did these shots.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.440
Used the Sony network,
which you're not

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.257
supposed to use the
Sony network for that.

00:06:54.257 --> 00:06:56.090
But I was saying, "What
is Sony going to do?

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.964
Fire us for trying to
help homeless kittens?"

00:06:57.964 --> 00:06:59.580
It's a great PR line.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.710
Sony fires employees for
helping homeless kittens.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.070
So anyways, blast out the shots.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.345
All the kittens got
adopted in about 24 hours

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:08.220
which is pretty cool.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.060
Here's another little fun shot.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.390
Two weeks later, we
found some more kittens.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.535
Did the same thing again.

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.660
The power of the photograph,
power of the internet.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.004
Just really an exciting thing.

00:07:19.004 --> 00:07:20.420
And this is just
a volunteer deal.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.340
So I started volunteering at
the West LA Animal Shelter,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.522
taking pictures of dogs and
cats to help increase adoptions.

00:07:26.522 --> 00:07:28.980
I just wandered in there, and
said, "You guys need a hand?"

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.180
They said sure.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.140
So that's what I did.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.723
I'll do a little slide show here
of before and after pictures.

00:07:33.723 --> 00:07:35.807
You guys get a sense
of what I was up to.

00:07:35.807 --> 00:07:37.390
And this is how it
all started for me.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.030
First with cats.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.490
These are typical
intake shots you

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.430
might find at an animal shelter
as of several years ago.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.240
Still today, if you hop onto a
public animal shelter website,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.860
you might see a lot of
very negative images.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.320
I'm not a fan of that.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.936
Anybody out there has seen
the commercials, on TV,

00:07:52.936 --> 00:07:54.435
with the sad music,
Sarah McLachlan?

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.572
And so raise your hand if
you've seen the commercials.

00:07:58.572 --> 00:08:00.030
How many people
change the channel?

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.911
Let me see that.

00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:01.410
OK.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.780
Quite a few.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.950
So I love the SPCA.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.180
Terrific organization,
they're friends of mine.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.544
But I have to challenge
their campaign.

00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:10.960
So when you see
those commercials,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.090
it's a fundraising campaign
and not an adoption campaign.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.680
The money is a big part of it.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.620
It does take money to run
such an extensive operation.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.960
But I have to ask the
SPCA at what cost?

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.310
What kind of damage are you
doing to people out there?

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.650
The perception of the animal
shelter is so important.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.984
And you're really not doing
any favors for traffic

00:08:31.984 --> 00:08:32.900
to the animal shelter.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.888
Because people see images, like
this, and the videos on TV.

00:08:35.888 --> 00:08:37.429
And they don't want
to go down there.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.330
They don't want
to go down there.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.150
They don't want to bring
their kids down there.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:40.780
And it's tough.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.409
So we do this instead.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.940
I think it's just
more uplifting.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.290
It shows people that
the animals are great.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.200
They can be your best friend.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.330
They're not broken.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.474
They're not dangerous.

00:08:51.474 --> 00:08:52.390
They're just terrific.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.510
And they just need a
little help from us.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.540
That's all it is.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.060
So we're doing
these kind of shots.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.790
So I was traveling
around to-- here's Olive.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.300
And when these dogs and cats
come into the animal shelter,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.425
they're coming in from of
variety of circumstances,

00:09:04.425 --> 00:09:06.650
most of which probably
aren't very positive.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.130
They have no idea
what's going on.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.940
They're not looking their best
or feeling the best at all.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.730
And it's not the ideal time
to take their glamour shot,

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.082
basically, that's going
get them a new home.

00:09:16.082 --> 00:09:17.540
Unfortunately,
that's what happens.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.817
These are called ID shots.

00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:20.275
So dogs and cats
enter the shelter.

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:23.750
Basically, they get all
the information down.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.560
They take an ID
shot or an intake

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.770
shot mostly just to
keep track of who's who.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.280
But an image, like
this, will go up

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.940
on the internet
and other places.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.560
And this is the
only thing that's

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.740
going to, maybe, draw
attention to Olive here.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.660
So not exactly doing
Olive any favors.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.550
You do this instead.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.060
And what we're finding
is people are actually

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.590
printing out these better
images and bringing them in.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.020
And they're having a reaction
that's really positive.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.939
And they weren't afraid
to come in anymore.

00:09:48.939 --> 00:09:50.980
When they see these
pictures, it's like we're try

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.120
to use elements
of nature, better

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.060
lighting, personality
of the dogs and cats.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.580
And we just saw a
huge difference.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.751
Chubbs.

00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:01.194
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:01.194 --> 00:10:04.132
SETH CASTEEL: He's a
funny little guy, huh?

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.650
I like the bandana.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.540
But of everything
else-- this is probably

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.890
the middle the night
sometime in September,

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.520
2011-- ominous boots, legs.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.500
I mean this is not doing
this dog any favors at all.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.304
Do this instead.

00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:18.095
This is in Chicago.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.790
So basically, I
started volunteering

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.430
at West LA, South LA.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.190
Then, I was traveling around
to different animal shelters

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.010
all around the country,
just volunteering.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.700
And then, I started teaching
workshops, on my own,

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.470
also to people who
were interested in how

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.180
to take better adoption photos.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.220
Also traveled to Europe.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.220
Did a bunch of workshops
in Europe and Australia

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.220
which was pretty cool.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.280
But through the course
of doing all that,

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.780
I learned a lot
about the marketing

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.417
of rescue and adoption,
and how the image of it

00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:45.500
is so important that it
needs to be more positive.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.660
Little Min Pin
guy, kind of funny.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.511
[CHUCKLES] Bailey, I
mean you wouldn't even

00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:52.760
know what this dog looks like.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:54.910
Also in Chicago.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.350
When I started volunteering
in Chicago-- Chicago's

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.940
the third largest
city, by population,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.395
in the United States.

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.270
They have one of the
largest animal shelters,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.896
also in the United States, with
25,000 pets intake per year.

00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:08.270
At the time, when
I came in, they

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.950
had really nobody
taking pictures

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.100
at all other than
the intake shots.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.646
The shelter's in a
bad part of town.

00:11:13.646 --> 00:11:15.270
It's more in the
South Side of Chicago.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.310
Not a lot of people
even know about it.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.795
And I'm thinking--
there's really

00:11:18.795 --> 00:11:20.170
nobody volunteering
there at all.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.860
I'm thinking how could this be?

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.110
Since Chicago's a good city.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.580
I'm originally from Illinois.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.054
Good city, good-hearted
people, animal lovers.

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:27.970
What's the disconnect?

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.780
People just didn't
know about the shelter.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.750
Or if they did, they
were just so terrified

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.875
that they just didn't think
they could go in there.

00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:35.920
So fortunately today,
things are improving

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.990
with Chicago and
many animal shelters.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.510
And that people are learning
that it's not a bad place.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.170
Also in Chicago, Wilma.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.650
And this is really a standard
Chicago Animal Care Control

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.610
photo as of a few years ago.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.317
This is going to be the ticket.

00:11:50.317 --> 00:11:51.150
So we're doing that.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.090
And I did all these, probably,
60 seconds for Wilma,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.210
meet the next dog, take
a couple of minutes.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.220
Here's Blake.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.052
Couldn't really see what
Blake looks like right here.

00:12:01.052 --> 00:12:02.024
And you have that.

00:12:02.024 --> 00:12:03.482
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:06.760
SETH CASTEEL: That's
one of my favorites.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.400
Now, there's a little
smoke and mirrors going on

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.130
because, sometimes, I'll offer
the dog a treat-- if they're

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.950
allowed to have a treat-- and
they're behaving a little bit.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.560
And so as they're
chewing treats-- yeah,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.930
you want a treat, don't you?

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.300
SETH CASTEEL: As they're chewing
treats, I'll take pictures.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.550
It also works good for people.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.008
If you give your friend a treat,
you take pictures of them,

00:12:28.008 --> 00:12:29.470
get some funny shots.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.720
So now, we'll get to this guy.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.770
So while I was volunteering,
somebody asked me,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.887
"Hey, could I hire you
to photograph my dog?"

00:12:36.887 --> 00:12:37.970
It was actually a Mastiff.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.500
And this is back in 2007.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.420
I said, "Sure."

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.080
So I started a part-time gig as
a lifestyle pet photographer,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.657
back in 2007, and just continued
to do that as I, basically,

00:12:48.657 --> 00:12:49.490
received commission.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.406
So I was volunteering.

00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:53.000
I had a part-time gig,
was working at Sony.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.260
I got recruited, went
over to Disney for awhile.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.250
Had a quick six
months over there.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.970
Came in, worked
pretty hard, ended up

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.090
getting fired mostly
for embezzling.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.954
No, just kidding.

00:13:02.954 --> 00:13:03.642
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.642 --> 00:13:05.850
SETH CASTEEL: Just the wrong
place at the wrong time.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.430
Always loved Disney Studios.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.040
Big fan of the
movies growing up.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.060
Still a big fan of Disney.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.760
But I wasn't drinking
enough Kool-Aid.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.980
And I think I just
walked into a situation

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.990
where I really just
couldn't figure it out.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.054
But I was putting in
about 100 hours a week.

00:13:20.054 --> 00:13:20.720
Came in one day.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.440
And they said, you
know, you're out.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.740
And didn't really give
me any good reasons why.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.704
But didn't cry about it.

00:13:27.704 --> 00:13:28.870
Maybe, I cried for a second.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.820
Said, you know what?

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.711
No hard feelings.

00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:33.710
Didn't burn any bridges.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.830
And I've actually
been hired back

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.470
on, by Disney, to
work on some projects

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.844
since then which
is kind of cool.

00:13:37.844 --> 00:13:40.210
But I decided I'm
at a crossroads.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.320
Do I stay in advertising?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.070
Or do I pursue my
photography full-time?

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.750
I decided on the latter.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.620
And things weren't
going that well at first

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.370
because I just didn't
have enough business

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.300
to pay for the rent, pay
for the car insurance,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.662
pay for the health
insurance, pay for a hot date

00:13:55.662 --> 00:13:56.495
every now and again.

00:13:57.299 --> 00:13:59.840
So I wasn't able to go out on
too many hot dates for a while.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.547
But a company called
Groupon approached me.

00:14:03.547 --> 00:14:04.880
Everybody familiar with Groupon?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.692
Groupon approached me about
doing a deal together.

00:14:08.692 --> 00:14:09.650
And I was so flattered.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.775
And then, it occurred to
me Groupon was pretty much

00:14:11.775 --> 00:14:13.280
approaching everybody
to do a deal.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.061
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.310
SETH CASTEEL: I took the bait.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.240
For $59, you could hire me.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.100
I would come out to photograph
your pet, or you and your pet,

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.830
at your home or a
location of your choosing.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.200
And there was supposed to be
a 10 mile radius of my home

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.910
which was here in
the West LA area.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.185
It turned out to be
about 150 mile radius.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.035
Because people were booking me
in Orange County, in Riverside,

00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:37.650
at San Diego, Santa Barbara.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.359
So out of the $59, I made a
whopping $29 per photo shoot.

00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:42.400
Split it down the middle.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.640
I thought I was pretty good
on negotiating that deal.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.970
As it turned out, it
wasn't such a good deal.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.930
When you factor in
all the driving,

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.130
the fuel costs, and then
you factor in my time,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.993
I mean, I was losing
quite a bit of money.

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:57.993
First, I was like, wait.

00:14:57.993 --> 00:14:59.580
How much-- I'm not
making any money.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.890
How much am I actually losing?

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.930
But we did book about
30 Groupon shoots.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.030
I did most of those.

00:15:07.349 --> 00:15:08.890
Lost quite a bit of
money doing that.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.450
And I was already in debt.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.350
I think I had about, maybe, 45--
$50,000 in debt at the time.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.310
Things we're looking
that optimistic in terms

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.228
of having a career.

00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:20.600
[BARKING]

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.641
SETH CASTEEL: Hey, guys,
keep it down back there.

00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:24.084
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:24.084 --> 00:15:28.049
[BARKING]

00:15:28.049 --> 00:15:29.590
SETH CASTEEL: Who
would have thought?

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.195
Dogs barking.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.890
But here's my little knight
in shining armor right here.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.770
Buster, the Cavalier
King Charles Spaniel,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.640
show up at this
Groupon photo shoot.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:41.720
All right.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.630
SETH CASTEEL: Now,
just get settled.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.130
Settle.

00:15:46.394 --> 00:15:48.560
Fortunately, I'm very patient
when it comes to dogs.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.170
This is a Groupon photo shoot.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.890
I show up at Buster's house
in Orange County, California.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.390
Show up.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.040
Supposed to be an on-land shoot.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.650
Buster, obviously,
had other ideas.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.700
I did an interview
with "NBC Nightly News"

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.219
a couple weeks ago
with Brian Williams.

00:16:03.219 --> 00:16:05.510
And they asked me if I had
any original shots of Buster

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.860
from back in 2010.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.339
And I'm like, surely, I do.

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:09.880
So I went through
the old hard drive.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.977
And I found some of these.

00:16:10.977 --> 00:16:12.060
And it just made me laugh.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.295
Because I haven't
seen these since 2010.

00:16:14.295 --> 00:16:15.920
But this is the very
first photo shoot.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.545
And that's the first
time I met Buster.

00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:19.120
He's obviously already wet here.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.190
He's already been in.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.750
In the background is
Buster's human named Jane.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.985
And Jane is saying, "You'd
better not do that."

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:28.130
And Buster's saying, you
know I'm going in there.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.720
So basically, he
just kept jumping in.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.840
I like he's looking
straight at the camera too.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.631
It's kind of funny.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.190
So she was kind
of upset about it

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.480
because she wanted some
nice dry land shots.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.950
I thought it was hysterical.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.570
And I just loved to see how
much he loved the water.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.150
So I left.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.983
Bought the little
point-and-shoot underwater

00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:44.990
camera by Sony.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.610
Came back.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.650
Did a couple experimental
shots like this.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.769
Didn't even know if I was
taking pictures or not.

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:50.810
It was kind of confusing.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.870
But I was just pressing the
button and see what happens.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.771
So then, you have here he
is coming in a little bit.

00:16:58.771 --> 00:16:59.770
And then, you have that.

00:17:01.547 --> 00:17:03.130
And that's the
original underwater dog

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.140
shot that I took in 2010.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.859
I got home.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:06.420
I saw that.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.000
I said, "Holy smokes."

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.619
SETH CASTEEL: "What
is going on here?"

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.160
So, of course, I was so excited.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.050
I sent it to Jane.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.061
Oh, my God, Jane.

00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:15.144
You're going to love this.

00:17:15.144 --> 00:17:16.450
This is just unbelievable.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.020
She's like, yeah,
yeah, that's fine.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.824
But you didn't
get the dry shots.

00:17:20.824 --> 00:17:21.324
So--

00:17:21.324 --> 00:17:21.824
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:23.530
SETH CASTEEL:--I went back down.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.750
I drove back down there.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.965
Did some dry shots of Buster.

00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:28.569
And she was very
happy about that.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.729
And then, I just got
more curious about dogs

00:17:31.729 --> 00:17:32.270
in the water.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.936
What's going on?

00:17:32.936 --> 00:17:34.830
What's going on
with the connection?

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.930
So I kept driving
down there more times

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.600
just to see this little guy.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.950
Did some more shots of him.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.600
Tried different
types of camera gear,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.310
underwater camera bags,
different types of housings.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.040
You name it, I
pretty much tried it.

00:17:47.444 --> 00:17:48.610
Experimenting with lighting.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.840
And, really, just trying
to understand what

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.830
was going on with this.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.280
Here's this which
is now, actually,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.820
it's a giant tattoo on my arm.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.195
This is one of my
favorite shots.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.410
People are like, wait a minute.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.717
You have a tattoo of somebody
else's dog on your arm?

00:18:02.986 --> 00:18:03.610
I'm like, yeah.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.810
But it's only almost
my entire arm.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.810
It's not my entire back.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.210
But actually, I took this
with an underwater camera bag.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.230
And you put your
camera in there.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.147
And you seal it up.

00:18:16.147 --> 00:18:18.230
Then, you're just thinking,
is this going to work?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.940
But we ended up with this shot.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.148
Didn't even know about this
until about a year later.

00:18:23.148 --> 00:18:24.660
I was taking so many photos.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.270
I didn't know what to look for.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.940
And I went back through
my images and I ended up.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.856
But I found this shot.

00:18:28.856 --> 00:18:30.950
Now, it's become one
of my favorite pictures

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.400
which is why I put it on my arm.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.050
But this little dog surely
changed my life the moment

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.390
he jumped in the pool.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.327
And if I could buy
him a beer, I would.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:41.785
But he has unlimited treats on
me for the rest of eternity.

00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:44.340
Here we are in the
water together.

00:18:46.155 --> 00:18:48.632
I don't know who ended up
getting the tennis ball here.

00:18:48.632 --> 00:18:50.340
Looks like it's going
to be a close call.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.260
Here we are.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.860
I think he looks
very noble here.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.800
But you can see the tattoo
and his little face.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.569
But I still get to see
him from time to time.

00:18:59.569 --> 00:19:00.860
He lives down in Orange County.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.380
And whenever I see him,
it's just so much fun.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.249
So got curious after Buster.

00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:07.290
Who else likes the water?

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.560
Started photographing some other
dogs just around the LA area.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.329
I bought a surf
housing by a company

00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:13.370
called SPL Waterhousings.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.740
And basically, they're
a shop out of San Diego.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.780
They make a case
for your camera,

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.100
mostly for surfers, waves,
surfing, body boarding,

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.510
that kind of thing.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.250
For me, it was a more
affordable option

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.410
than a full scuba housing.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.451
So I bought that for a
few thousand dollars using

00:19:28.451 --> 00:19:31.280
the last available credit
I had on my credit card.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.640
So that was the end.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.360
I couldn't afford
rent at the time.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.612
And it's, obviously,
a clear choice.

00:19:36.612 --> 00:19:38.070
When you don't have
any money left,

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.466
and you have 50 or
$55,000 in debt,

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:42.965
you have to go buy an underwater
camera housing immediately.

00:19:42.965 --> 00:19:43.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:43.552 --> 00:19:45.010
SETH CASTEEL: So
that's what I did.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.218
A lot of my friends thought
I was taking crazy pills.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.470
Maybe I was.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.720
They kept telling me,
you got do weddings.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.210
I'm like, weddings?

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.147
I'm not doing
weddings unless it's

00:19:55.147 --> 00:19:56.730
two golden retrievers
getting married.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:02.341
So made these pictures for
fun, all around the country.

00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:04.340
This ended up in "National
Geographic" magazine,

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.690
Visions of Earth
in August, 2012.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.260
That's kind of a
fun thing for me.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.740
Always a dream to be a part
of "National Geographic",

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.735
in the actual magazine.

00:20:12.735 --> 00:20:15.070
And it was the opening shot
for the Vision section.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.120
So about 40 million
people saw that shot.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:18.670
Pretty cool.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.253
Just from "National
Geographic" alone.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.650
This is a picture that ended
up changing my life in terms

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.710
of how the pictures
became popular.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.830
So I made the series for fun
with that camera housing.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.240
Put them on my website.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.570
February 9, 2012 this image
becomes popular on reddit

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.480
and Google+.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.190
Thanks, Google.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.180
Start making the rounds.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.180
And then, it went on other
social media outlets.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.020
You name it, it was on there.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.055
In the course of 24
hours, it's estimated

00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:48.930
that around 100 million
people saw the shots.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.880
That's quite a few
people I guess.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.355
I didn't really know
what that all meant.

00:20:54.355 --> 00:20:55.230
It was just a frenzy.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.200
My website crashed.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.910
I had to deal with Go Daddy.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.190
But I was on a shared
server, limited bandwidth.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.590
So we could only
track however many.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.190
We had, I think, 175,000
to 200,000 hits a day.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.900
And that all we
could really get.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.900
So we don't really know.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.149
But I like to think people
tried to get on my website.

00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:13.550
They couldn't get on.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.010
So what you can't
have, you want more.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.320
So I think people, maybe,
got more curious about it.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.870
Woke up to phone calls from
the media and everybody else

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.460
asking about the pictures.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.860
And my life has never
been the same since then.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.130
On the phone with "CNN World
Report" with Anna Coren,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.380
on the other line
"Good Morning America",

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.536
and trying to figure out
who's more important.

00:21:32.536 --> 00:21:33.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.808
SETH CASTEEL: Good
problem to have.

00:21:34.808 --> 00:21:37.510
But as somebody who was a
struggling photographer,

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.860
and who had zero
dollars left, I'm like,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.107
I got to seize the moment.

00:21:42.107 --> 00:21:43.190
I got to seize the moment.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.222
This is an opportunity
here I think.

00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:45.930
Seize the moment.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.700
So we did.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.370
I did every interview I could.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.710
I just worked my tail off.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:54.709
And made a book called
"Underwater Dogs".

00:21:54.709 --> 00:21:56.250
Got a book deal with
a company called

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.990
Little, Brown and Company.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.872
Chose an agent first.

00:21:58.872 --> 00:22:01.080
Didn't know how anything
worked with book publishing.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.827
Had no idea about the process.

00:22:03.827 --> 00:22:05.410
Didn't even know all
the major players

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:06.700
in the world of publishing.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.460
But I selected a lady
named Michelle Tessler,

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.490
out of New York, to be my agent.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.720
She liked dogs.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.670
I like dogs.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.240
Seemed like a pretty good fit.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240
We made a proposal.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.859
The book went auction.

00:22:17.859 --> 00:22:19.650
And every major publisher
bid on the rights

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.250
to sell the book which
was kind of crazy.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.560
And we ended up
choosing Little, Brown

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.290
and turning down Random House.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.970
Again, kind of a
good problem to have.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.465
But all this was
happening so fast,

00:22:30.465 --> 00:22:31.590
I just didn't even realize.

00:22:32.682 --> 00:22:35.630
I thought we were going to
get an advance of like $500

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:36.530
to make the book.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.790
And I'm like, wow.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.240
And then, we got a
little more than that.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.018
So we threw a
party in Las Vegas.

00:22:42.018 --> 00:22:43.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:43.512 --> 00:22:44.970
SETH CASTEEL: That
was kind of fun.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.300
The book came out
in October of 2012

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.900
with a very limited print run.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.042
I was a first-time author.

00:22:52.042 --> 00:22:54.000
Even though Little, Brown
was very enthusiastic

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.469
about the book, they didn't
print very many copies.

00:22:56.469 --> 00:22:57.260
I didn't know that.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:22:59.910
So basically, the book came out.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.970
It was one of Oprah's
favorite books of the year.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.370
We had a ton of media
around the book, of course.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.340
And you couldn't buy
it, really, anywhere.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.677
So-- I know.

00:23:10.677 --> 00:23:12.260
I was like, I couldn't
buy my own book

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.144
for three weeks anywhere.

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:14.810
Couldn't buy it.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.330
Couldn't buy it.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:16.530
It was sold out everywhere.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.446
I mean, I guess that's
a good problem to have.

00:23:18.446 --> 00:23:20.419
But we were trying
to sell books.

00:23:20.419 --> 00:23:21.835
So if you're trying
to sell books,

00:23:21.835 --> 00:23:23.530
I guess you have to have books.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.780
Regardless, it was still a
"New York Times" bestseller

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.210
for 11 weeks on the
hardcover non-fiction list.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.880
It even beat out Bill O'Reilly.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.510
Sorry, Bill.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.220
SETH CASTEEL: [CHUCKLES] It was
the best selling photography

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.080
book of the year and one of the
best-selling photography books,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.850
in history, with over a half
a million copies in print,

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.500
13 additions around the world.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.680
And it's just dogs jumping
into swimming pools.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.430
I don't know.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.800
The craziest thing.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.570
So anyways, it's a lot of fun.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.400
Some of the adults thought
the images were, maybe,

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.710
too fierce, too
primal, too many teeth.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.610
But all the kids,
that I was talking to,

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.230
just thought they
were hilarious.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.450
So anyways, we made a
kids' book for adults.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.825
So you can pick that
up if you're an adult.

00:24:04.825 --> 00:24:06.400
If you're a kid, you
probably don't like it.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.441
But if you're an adult,
you might really like it.

00:24:08.441 --> 00:24:10.370
And you get a free poster.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.130
So this came out
about a year ago.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.220
And it's done well.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.960
Scholastic picked up a lot of
copies for all the book fairs

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.230
around at the schools.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.584
I remember going up as a
kid, you had the book fair.

00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:21.500
And it was so exciting
to go to the book fair.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.666
And you get to pick out
your book or a couple books.

00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:26.880
So that's been fun that this
has been in all the book fairs.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.670
And I wrote this.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.750
Actually, I did do a
little writing here.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.660
There's some fun
rhymes going on,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.789
in the pages, if you
flip through this book.

00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:36.330
And the publisher's like, oh,
we'll hire somebody to do that.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.860
And I'm like, what
I can't do it?

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.089
So I wrote it.

00:24:39.089 --> 00:24:40.130
I think it's kind of fun.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.213
I don't know if it's good.

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:42.090
But it works.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.320
We also made some
board books for kids.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.382
Some kids were
ripping the pages out.

00:24:46.382 --> 00:24:48.340
They didn't like the
kids' book because there's

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.010
no teethy images.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.350
So they were ripping the
pages there were so upset.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.700
So we made two board books,
"Colors" and "Numbers".

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.674
I recommend, if you're
learning to count to 10,

00:24:56.674 --> 00:24:57.590
the book on the right.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.366
It's a good one for you.

00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:00.990
So that was kind of
cool to have those.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.310
And then, of course,
the next project.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.020
What do you do?

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.490
I've worked with dogs.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:07.290
It's been great.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:08.980
We made the kids books.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.180
Obviously, the cat's thing
about underwater cats,

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.030
explored that for a second.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.490
Shut the window on that one.

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:16.780
Although.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.810
I have been swimming with
quite a few cats surprisingly.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.780
So most cat breeds,
as we know, do not

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.990
have a history with the water or
an appreciation for the water.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.490
It just doesn't exist
with some exceptions.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.570
Turkish Vans, and Maine
Coons, as well as Bengals,

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.860
and some exotic mixes do
have history with water

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.390
and, actually, get in and swim.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:36.200
Pretty cool.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.440
And then, you talk about
exotic cats, wild cats.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.500
You have tigers.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.440
You have fishing cats
in Southeast Asia.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.136
Even bobcats, you have
that kind of stuff.

00:25:44.136 --> 00:25:45.260
That's definitely possible.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.530
I've been in the
pool with tigers.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.988
I've been in the
pool with bobcats.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.729
Pretty interesting stuff.

00:25:50.729 --> 00:25:52.770
But could you really make
a whole book out of it?

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.130
Questionable.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.500
So we put that on hold.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.187
Puppies.

00:25:58.187 --> 00:25:59.520
So I'm like, well, I don't know.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.103
Can I make a whole
book about puppies?

00:26:01.103 --> 00:26:03.120
We have two puppies
in "Underwater Dogs",

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.990
the original book.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.980
One is 12 weeks.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.590
One is six months.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.700
And I'm thinking, well,
these guys were into it.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.280
Maybe we can do a book.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.480
So started meeting up with
some puppies at the pool.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.100
And figured out that not
only could I make it,

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.020
but it really needed to
be made for two reasons.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.080
Number one, water
safety for pets--

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.700
this is the big message about
this project right here.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.370
People don't realize that's a
huge problem here in the United

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.870
States.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.876
Especially, swimming
pools are on the rise.

00:26:30.876 --> 00:26:32.000
Global warming's happening.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.435
It's getting hotter and hotter.

00:26:33.435 --> 00:26:35.060
Swimming pools are
going up, especially

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.300
states like California,
Arizona, Texas, and Florida.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.100
It's ridiculous.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.820
Between-- and this is
a really sour stat.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.380
But I'll tell you.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.240
Because most people
don't think about this.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.920
Between seven and 10,000
dogs drown in swimming pools

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.810
every year in the United States.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.040
That's a lot of dogs.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.270
And I feel like that
shouldn't be that.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.930
It shouldn't be
one dog drowning.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.402
And it's mostly
because the dogs don't

00:26:58.402 --> 00:27:00.110
know how to get out
of the swimming pool.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.420
That's it.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.730
It's not because the
people hate their dog's.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.313
It's not because the
people are trying

00:27:05.313 --> 00:27:06.850
to set up their
dog for disaster.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.435
They just don't think about it.

00:27:08.435 --> 00:27:11.830
And I ask people, would you let
your 18-month-old human child

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.432
stay outside, in your backyard,
with your pool, unattended

00:27:15.432 --> 00:27:17.140
while you're off to
work for eight hours?

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.360
And they were like, no.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.830
Well, a lot of people let their
dogs do that or have access

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.210
to the backyard, where their
pool is, during the day

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.376
and thinking, oh, they're
not going to get in there.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:30.166
But it happens between seven
and 10,000 times every year.

00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:32.040
And I think it's just
absolutely unnecessary.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.123
All puppies know how to
swim from the time they're

00:27:34.123 --> 00:27:35.570
three or four weeks old.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:36.950
You put them over the water.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.890
And they will just do this.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.110
And then, they will do this.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.040
And then, they'll go faster.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.873
And you put them in.

00:27:41.873 --> 00:27:43.526
And they will swim around.

00:27:43.526 --> 00:27:44.650
And they'll do a great job.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:45.670
But they need to practice.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.000
They need to understand their
physicality in the water.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.702
And they need to
understand buoyancy.

00:27:49.702 --> 00:27:51.410
Most importantly, they
need to understand

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.960
how to get out of
the swimming pool.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.190
Not a natural body of
water, it's not a lake,

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.290
not a stream, not the ocean.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.370
So dogs know how to swim.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.850
But they don't understand the
concept of the swimming pool.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.127
I do meet a lot of dogs who
like natural bodies of water.

00:28:05.127 --> 00:28:06.210
And they look at the pool.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.310
And they're like, what is that?

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.520
But once they figure it
out, it's all good then.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.949
But you have to make sure
these little guys know

00:28:13.949 --> 00:28:14.990
how to get out of a pool.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.505
That's the big message with
this is preparing them in case

00:28:17.505 --> 00:28:19.880
there's some sort of situation
where they find themselves

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.670
in the water.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.820
So if a dog falls in, a
lot of times their instinct

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.510
is to try to get out
where they got in.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.436
Dogs are not great
climbers, most of them.

00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:28.810
Some Jack Russell
Terriers maybe.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.200
But, in general,
they can't climb out.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.480
So they will just swim
around, swim around.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.880
Most dogs drown two feet
away from the stairs

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.530
or from the ladder.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.700
And that's not cool.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.490
So I'm trying to fight that
is what I'm trying to do.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.140
I'm trying to let people know
that let's be safe about this.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.360
Let's try to stop these
accidents from happening.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.590
They're unnecessary.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.200
It's just about education.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.139
Be responsible.

00:28:51.139 --> 00:28:52.680
In addition to
teaching your pets how

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.210
to get out of the pool,
it's also important

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.285
all the classic safety
precautions including--

00:28:58.285 --> 00:29:00.408
look at this guy on
his back down here.

00:29:00.408 --> 00:29:01.356
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.890
SETH CASTEEL: Limited access
to the pool, alarms, fences,

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.417
all that stuff also
really, really important.

00:29:08.417 --> 00:29:09.250
I went on a mission.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.776
I, basically, taught
1,500 puppies how to swim,

00:29:12.776 --> 00:29:13.900
how to get out of the pool.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.840
We practiced.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.290
Travelled around the country.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.930
And most of the puppies
who came out and just got

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.220
swimming lessons A to B,
start to condition them

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.710
on what are we doing here?

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:25.440
What is this?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.490
And you, basically, teach
them where the exit is.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.210
Now, once they start
with that state of mind,

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.310
they're like, oh, OK.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.007
There is only one
way to get out here.

00:29:34.007 --> 00:29:34.840
That's a good start.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.550
But for sure, all the
humans that I met, I said,

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.510
"If your dog's ever going
to be around a pool,

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.767
you need to apply this
to that situation too."

00:29:41.767 --> 00:29:44.100
But even still, as long as
the dog starts to understand,

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.308
I'm in a body of water, and
there's only one way out,

00:29:46.308 --> 00:29:47.900
that's a huge
advantage for them.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.930
Otherwise, they
just wouldn't know.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.200
They just swim around in a
circle or stay in the same spot

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:51.880
the whole time.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.060
They would have no clue.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.720
So zooming around, mostly
didn't even take pictures.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.420
I was mostly just a swim
teacher for about four months.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.270
Zooming around, working with
all these puppies from six weeks

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.770
to six months.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.570
Out of 1,500 puppies
that I worked with,

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.910
there's 72 in the
book and 105 photos.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.700
So there's a lot of disappointed
puppy parents out there

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.610
who didn't get a great picture.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.810
But at least the puppies
are going to be safer.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.360
I also worked with,
mostly, rescue puppies

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.600
for this project.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.980
I love dogs of all types.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.870
I support dogs of all types,
all sorts, all backgrounds.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.270
But I'm also a big fan
of rescue and adoption,

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:31.290
and always encourage people,
if they can, consider adoption.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.330
Because it's terrific.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.640
So most of these guys are
going to be rescue puppies

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.890
from different organizations
across the country.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.530
Some tiny little rescue groups
and some major animal shelters.

00:30:40.594 --> 00:30:42.760
And I decide this could be
a good reminder for folks

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.400
that adoption is a
great option for sure.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.219
This is Popsicle.

00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:47.010
This is in Chicago.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.187
This is Ginger.

00:30:51.187 --> 00:30:53.020
This was, maybe, going
to be the book cover.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.410
But we thought, maybe it's
a little bit too sassy.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.990
SETH CASTEEL: But one
of my favorite shots--

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.680
for any photography
buffs out there?

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.670
Anybody do photography?

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.770
Couple folks.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.330
So if anybody's curious
about this, so this is I'm

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.145
shooting with a dive housing now
by Ikelite Underwater Systems.

00:31:11.145 --> 00:31:13.362
It's a Canon 5D Mark III.

00:31:13.362 --> 00:31:15.320
And this is probably the
least interesting part

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.660
of this, the technical stuff.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.805
It's like, I just like the dogs.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.675
But it's a 5D Mark III by Canon.

00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:24.030
It's a fisheye lens, 8-15.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.280
I'm using, yeah, the casing,
the underwater housing.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.590
I'm using two DS161 strobes.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.200
One here.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:31.830
One here.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.663
And the background,
that's not a pool light.

00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:36.270
That's actually an off
board strobe or slave light

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.410
if you do any studio stuff.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:39.320
So it's really cool.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.028
It's a little gizmo
that you can't really

00:31:41.028 --> 00:31:42.830
buy anymore because
it's off the market.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.194
But I have some.

00:31:44.194 --> 00:31:46.610
Always got to be one step ahead
with photography, I guess.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.880
But these are pretty cool.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.254
So I can drop them
into the pool.

00:31:49.254 --> 00:31:51.400
It's, basically, a
strobe like this.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.990
I attach a little
funny gadget to it

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.610
called an EV Manual Controller.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.872
It's, basically, an eyeball.

00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:57.330
You guys are
technical people here.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.390
It's a little eyeball.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.380
And it's got an optic
sensor in there.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.250
So what it looks for
is a significant change

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.540
in ambient light.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.310
When that little sensor
sees my strobes off,

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:09.669
it'll go ahead and fire
off that strobe down there.

00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:11.210
It would be impossible
to try to wire

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.660
10 strobes in that pool and,
also, a little bit dangerous,

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.160
I think.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.284
The puppies are jumping in.

00:32:15.284 --> 00:32:16.660
I'm all over the place.

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.535
So I, basically, just
drop these in the pool.

00:32:18.535 --> 00:32:21.600
And it helps to create better
lighting, and catch lights,

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.662
and it's just fun.

00:32:22.662 --> 00:32:24.370
So when you're flipping
through the book,

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:25.869
you might think
they're pool lights.

00:32:25.869 --> 00:32:28.060
But they're actually
called off board strobes.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.100
And they're about
$1,700 a piece.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.100
Sometimes, I'd have 10
of them in the water.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.420
And you're looking at 17,000.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.910
Plus, my camera's about 14,000.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.177
So you got $31,000 in the pool.

00:32:39.177 --> 00:32:40.510
And I don't even have insurance.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.490
But I need to get some.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:42.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.110
SETH CASTEEL: This is Raleigh.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.960
This is in Tucson, Arizona.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.780
Quick note about
this one, it was

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.820
important to work with the
puppies in really warm water.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.000
Just like our human children,
teaching them to swim,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.374
I don't think we're going to
put them in 40 degree water.

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:57.824
It might be a little chilly.

00:32:57.824 --> 00:32:59.990
So we want to make sure the
puppies are comfortable,

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.110
have a really
positive experience.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.270
And between 80 and 92 is kind
of a sweet spot for these guys.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:10.190
This pool was in Tucson,
Arizona last September.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:12.330
And I knew it was getting
kind of late, or kind

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.339
of cold at night,
like 40 degrees.

00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:15.380
So I call the pool owner.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.512
And I'm thinking,
I don't know what

00:33:17.512 --> 00:33:18.720
the water's going to be like.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.330
So I ask him.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.695
And he's like, "It's cold."

00:33:20.695 --> 00:33:23.860
"Do you have a heater?"
"Yep." "Can you turn it on?"

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.440
Turns it on.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.356
I arrive the next day.

00:33:25.356 --> 00:33:27.692
It's 100 degrees outside.

00:33:27.692 --> 00:33:28.775
And the heater's still on.

00:33:28.775 --> 00:33:29.550
I'm like, oh.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.187
And the bubble tarp is on.

00:33:32.187 --> 00:33:33.520
So it's locking all the heat in.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.900
So we peel that back, 107.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.667
Oh, too hot.

00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:39.250
And so these little
puppies, you don't

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.802
want to put them in
107 degree water.

00:33:40.802 --> 00:33:42.760
They can only be in there
for a couple minutes.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.639
Went to the freezer, grabbed
some ice cubes, tossed them in,

00:33:45.639 --> 00:33:47.055
didn't make a lot
of a difference.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.920
Got to try something.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.132
But the air temperature
started going down.

00:33:52.132 --> 00:33:54.340
And then, the puppies arrived
later in the afternoon.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.390
We got the water
down to about 102.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.330
And we were able to
have, maybe, five minutes

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.627
of each puppy in the water.

00:33:59.627 --> 00:34:01.460
Most of them, again,
just got their lessons.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.000
And that was it.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.410
But a couple of them jumped in.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.400
So kind of a fun note.

00:34:07.484 --> 00:34:08.859
These are my little
Terrier guys.

00:34:08.859 --> 00:34:10.570
And this is also in Chicago.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:13.620
Had a good, really good day
at Chicago for this shoot.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.400
My first Chicago shoot,
we had 30 puppies.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.260
I flew in.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.889
I brought all my gear.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:20.900
My gear didn't arrive.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.024
Who knows where it went.

00:34:22.024 --> 00:34:23.229
It just disappeared.

00:34:23.229 --> 00:34:24.770
So I called a friend
of mine, shipped

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.888
in the back up gear
for another $400.

00:34:26.888 --> 00:34:28.179
Planned this all out for weeks.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.595
Went to the photo shoot, didn't
get a single book picture.

00:34:31.412 --> 00:34:33.620
And that happened quite a
few times making this book.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.739
I mean, if you think
about 1,500 puppies,

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.787
there's only 72
that are in here.

00:34:37.787 --> 00:34:39.870
Most of them just didn't
even get pictures at all.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.760
But then, we had another shoot
in Chicago at an indoor pool.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.880
And we probably have 10
pictures from that shoot.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.780
So we just never really know.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.010
But these guys are cool.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.460
We were going to make
it a two-page spread.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.760
But then, we thought,
no, you know,

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.429
people are going to
think it's either

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:55.730
two different pictures
or the same dog.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.440
And it's, actually, two
separate dogs that are siblings.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.810
And I just think for
them to jump in together

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.010
like that, at the same
time, it's a rare thing.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:08.040
So as we're doing our swimming
lessons, I have to gauge

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.050
are these puppies really
starting to be playful

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.394
or are they just
getting their lesson?

00:35:12.394 --> 00:35:14.560
I don't want to push it too
much with these puppies.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.976
It's important
that it's positive.

00:35:15.976 --> 00:35:16.929
And that's it.

00:35:16.929 --> 00:35:18.720
Some of these puppies
start playing around,

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.109
I grab my camera off the
side and wait for the moment

00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:22.150
where they're jumping in.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:25.026
Some of them are jump in
just because it's fun.

00:35:25.026 --> 00:35:26.150
Or they'll jump in with me.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.840
If you look at some
videos on my website,

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.820
you'll see me jumping in
together with the puppies.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.300
And they'll come
in too, with me.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.230
Some are chasing
toys underwater.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.640
And some are diving as deep as
five feet, even at 11 weeks.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.190
This is little Ava.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:41.520
Ava's was a Beagle
mix also in Chicago.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.450
And at six weeks, just really
impressive form and cute little

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.580
face with that
little white stripe.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.120
And there's Ava all grown up.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.726
The owners of Ava sent me
this picture the other day.

00:35:53.726 --> 00:35:54.580
There's six weeks.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.038
There's about a
year and six weeks.

00:35:56.038 --> 00:35:57.890
But they grow up so fast.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:59.090
They grow up so fast.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.830
And just so proud to see them.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.536
I've been traveling
around the country.

00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:04.910
And I'd see a lot of these
puppy's now that are grown up.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.430
And give them a big hug.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.390
But it's funny to see
how they've turned out.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.870
This is Cory.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.430
This is also in Tucson
in an 80 degree pool.

00:36:14.624 --> 00:36:15.540
Just really like this.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.706
Love the color of the water.

00:36:16.706 --> 00:36:20.130
Cory was terrific and one of
six Cattle Dog mix puppies

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.220
in Tucson-- all rescue puppies.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.320
You also have Zelda.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.430
This is my favorite
picture in the book.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.180
It's not the most impressive.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.340
It's not even underwater.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.070
It's what you would
call an over under shot.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:35.840
The reason why I like this
picture is this picture

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.220
embodies the entire spirit and
message of why I made the book.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.390
And that's because little Zelda
here, at about seven weeks,

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.590
special needs puppy.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.540
Needed some additional TLC.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.790
And the human
caretakers for Zelda

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:51.910
said, she is not ready
to go swimming yet.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.210
She's too little.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.122
We're too worried about her.

00:36:55.122 --> 00:36:57.455
And I was saying, well, I
think it's even more important

00:36:57.455 --> 00:36:58.450
that she starts to learn.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:59.760
Because she's around
a swimming pool.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.720
You guys let her around the
swimming pool every day.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.120
She's just running around here.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.703
And she's probably
going to be adopted

00:37:04.703 --> 00:37:06.220
by somebody who
has a swimming pool

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.060
or has access to
a swimming pool.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.810
They said, no, no.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:09.872
She's too little.

00:37:09.872 --> 00:37:10.580
She's too little.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.630
So she sat there.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.497
And she watched her brother
and her other siblings

00:37:16.497 --> 00:37:17.330
do swimming lessons.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:20.514
For about a half hour, she
just watched, just watched,

00:37:20.514 --> 00:37:21.680
just sitting there, watched.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.120
Then all of a sudden, splash.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.720
She jumped in on her own.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.300
Jumped in.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.440
I was on the other
side of the pool.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.180
But she had been watching
us for a half hour.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.680
And she watched
where the exit was,

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.840
watched where the stairs were.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.790
She didn't swim to me.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.240
She swam to the exit.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.600
And she got out on her own.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.690
This little tiny thing,
jumped in, swam over there,

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:38.740
and got out on her own.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.407
And I was so proud
of that little puppy.

00:37:40.407 --> 00:37:41.948
That was my proudest
moment of making

00:37:41.948 --> 00:37:44.220
the entire book is this
little character right here.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.724
Because that's what
it's all about.

00:37:45.724 --> 00:37:47.390
And her humans didn't
want her to do it.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.760
And she said, I'm
going to do it anyways.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.990
So pretty cool.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.250
Here she is on her little
surfboard. [CHUCKLES]

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.120
This is Monty.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.260
This is sort of
reminds me of the movie

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.420
"The Ring" a little bit.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.270
SETH CASTEEL: This
is at a dog pool

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.115
in New York called
Water for Dogs.

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:04.990
People don't know it.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:07.490
But there is a swimming
pool for dogs in New York.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.170
It's a hydrotherapy pool.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.240
So this pool is mostly
working with dogs

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.020
that are restoring
quality of life

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.620
to dogs through
swimming, rehabilitating

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.750
from injury, and also as
alternative to surgery.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.320
But hydrotherapy,
amazing thing for dogs.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.480
And it really does
improve their quality

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.220
of life, when they have
certain situations come along,

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.940
and also extend their lives
sometimes by many years.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.330
So if your dog's ever have
some troubles, some health

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.230
troubles-- depending
on what that

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.690
is-- look into hydrotherapy.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:37.420
Because it can really
make a huge difference

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.510
for your family.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.380
So they also, at
this pool, apparently

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.160
do underwater
puppy photo shoots.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.170
So we did that.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.892
And this is Monty at six months.

00:38:44.892 --> 00:38:46.600
Doesn't really look
like a puppy anymore.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.425
Still puppy mentality.

00:38:48.425 --> 00:38:50.300
But I just think this
picture is fascinating.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.260
I like to have different
types of images in the books

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:54.930
that I'm making.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.580
And I think that my
whole thing with dogs

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.260
is I love their
range of emotion.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.170
I think it's very
similar to human beings.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:03.646
I think that's why we connect
with them in so many ways.

00:39:03.646 --> 00:39:06.020
And I think that's why we
identify with the pictures too.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.600
Because, I think, when we see a
picture like this, or smiling,

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.330
or doing whatever, we sort
of see a little piece of us

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.920
in that picture too.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.840
But I love this shot.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.320
Chinese and hairy, hairless.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.647
A lot of people argue with me,
oh, only Labs and Golden's like

00:39:20.647 --> 00:39:22.230
the water, in
Newfoundlands sometimes.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.620
And I say that's just not true.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.680
I've met quite a few Labs
and Golden Retrievers

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.670
that just don't like to swim.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.754
Or they do get in, and
they're terrible swimmers.

00:39:31.754 --> 00:39:33.670
Because they haven't had
the right experience.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.920
So it's fun to be able to
profile some different types

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.940
of dogs, like the
Chinese Crested here.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.672
At 10 weeks, little scooters
jumping in and having a blast.

00:39:41.672 --> 00:39:43.410
Kind of weird looking dogs.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.200
But, yeah, their fun.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.700
This is Prince,
also excellent form.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.650
This is in Portland, Maine.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.660
Did an outdoor shoot that
day in about 82 degree water.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.447
And at eight weeks, I mean,
this is just a natural.

00:39:56.447 --> 00:39:57.530
This is a natural swimmer.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.630
These are my Labs.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.720
These are my stars.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.680
This is down in
Fort Myers, Florida.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.314
There's three of
them down there.

00:40:05.314 --> 00:40:07.730
Reason, Grits, and Jack, they're
all from the same litter.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.585
They're all being
groomed to be dockdogs.

00:40:09.585 --> 00:40:11.250
Anybody familiar with dockdogs?

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.910
It's basically a
competition for dogs.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.340
The idea is you have a
huge ramp, giant pool.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.750
Which dog can jump the farthest?

00:40:19.815 --> 00:40:21.190
And they also have
a new contest,

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.250
which dog can jump the highest?

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.720
So you have both of those.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.030
The dogs go crazy for it.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.500
The people doing dockdogs are
a little strange, I think.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.006
SETH CASTEEL: They're
stage moms a little bit.

00:40:32.006 --> 00:40:35.350
And they're all like-- But
it is a very positive thing.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.610
And the dogs just,
they go crazy for it.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.432
So at six weeks, they'd
started swimming.

00:40:39.432 --> 00:40:41.390
By nine weeks, they were
showing up at the pool

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:42.617
and whining to get in.

00:40:42.617 --> 00:40:44.950
And when I met them at 10
weeks, it was just a home run.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.324
They were ready
to rock and roll.

00:40:46.324 --> 00:40:48.430
They hadn't really
been underwater yet.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.810
But it was just a no-brainer.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.235
So they were just
happy to participate.

00:40:53.157 --> 00:40:54.615
There they are,
little puppy teeth.

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:59.020
These guys, so I wanted to
try to have all three of them

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.270
in the same picture.

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.380
It was impossible
because of the hierarchy.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.730
So how many of you guys have
more than one dog at home?

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:06.230
OK.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.470
So you could tell
me that somebody's

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:10.610
going to be the
boss, somebody's not.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:11.800
It's called alpha omega.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.935
So dogs are pack animals.

00:41:13.935 --> 00:41:15.560
Somebody's always
going to be the boss.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.900
It may be very extreme.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.250
Or it may be more subtle.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.600
But there's always going to
be somebody who's in charge.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.974
Even with these guys, even
though their living with three

00:41:22.974 --> 00:41:24.670
separate people, they
spent enough time

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.532
together where they
developed a hierarchy.

00:41:26.532 --> 00:41:28.240
So even if these guys,
who had never met,

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.740
they hang out for enough hours,
they're going to figure out.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.200
It might even happen right away.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.330
Who's the boss?

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.620
It might take a few hours,
or a few days, or a few weeks

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.430
to figure it out.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.230
And they may challenge
each other for it.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.896
These guys were trying
to figure it out.

00:41:40.896 --> 00:41:42.870
Little Jack, who you
don't see in this picture,

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.780
Jack is somewhere
in the background

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.240
looking for another toy.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.356
He decided, I'm not the boss.

00:41:48.356 --> 00:41:49.730
So he's just doing
his own thing.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.456
He wouldn't compete
with these two.

00:41:51.456 --> 00:41:52.777
These two would compete.

00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:54.860
And they were trying to
figure out who's the boss.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.526
And that's why I could
get this picture.

00:41:57.316 --> 00:41:58.690
I don't know who
the boss is now.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.580
But I'm going to see
them in a couple weeks.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.300
I'll be curious to
see who's number one.

00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:06.370
But pretty unbelievable
to see these little guys.

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.090
If you hop on my
website, you'll see

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.930
some behind-the-scenes
video of them

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.140
swimming underwater
in slow motion.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.810
And it's spectacular to
see what they're doing.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.730
Here's a behind-the-scenes
still of me.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.600
And this is either
Reason or Grits.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.780
I can't tell by the collar.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.930
But this is to show you
this is taken with a GoPro.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.060
GoPro, this is a
HERO Black Edition.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.500
I think this is
the 3, the model 3.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.020
And did some behind-the-scenes
stills and videos.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.790
You don't quite have the
illumination on me or the dog

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.040
that you'd might want to have.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.420
But it's cool to see
the positioning here.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.010
I'm holding my breath
and going under.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.180
A lot of people think I'm
wearing scuba diving gear.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.380
I said, "If the dogs
wear scuba diving gear,

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.180
then I'll wear
scuba diving gear.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.860
But if the dogs
aren't then I'm not."

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.751
So we, basically, just go
down, come back up together.

00:42:53.751 --> 00:42:56.000
"Underwater Dogs", I'd hold
my breath up to 90 seconds

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.875
to do multiple takes.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.260
This book right
here with puppies,

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.350
I'm mostly underwater for
a few seconds at a time.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:03.360
And that's about it.

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.960
The Labs, maybe up to
10 seconds, 15 seconds.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.420
But there's really no reason
for me to have diving gear.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.560
I do wear a wetsuit because
of the water temperature,

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.470
even in 80 degrees.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.810
Anybody a scuba diver out there?

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:16.425
Maybe.

00:43:16.425 --> 00:43:17.720
Scuba divers?

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.869
So if we're 98.6 degrees
unless you have a fever,

00:43:21.869 --> 00:43:23.410
or you're an alien--
and then, you're

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.201
going to be I don't
know what temperature--

00:43:25.201 --> 00:43:28.150
but if you're in water that's
80 degrees for a long period

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.212
of time, your core
temperature will drop down.

00:43:30.212 --> 00:43:31.420
And you will get hypothermia.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.990
And you don't want hypothermia.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.040
It's no fun.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.560
So even in 80 degrees,
you can get hypothermia.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.520
I spend, sometimes, 14
hours in the pool in a day.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.153
And if I didn't have
that wetsuit on,

00:43:42.153 --> 00:43:44.120
I'm in 80 degree water,
and then sometimes I'm

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.730
just not moving
around that much,

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:46.980
my core temperature will drop.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.111
And I will get hypothermia.

00:43:48.111 --> 00:43:49.360
And then, it's just dangerous.

00:43:50.405 --> 00:43:52.280
Never really a
life-threatening thing for me.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.620
But it is something you
got to look out for.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.040
So that's why I
wear the wetsuit.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.339
And then, I also wear the
wetsuit because the dogs,

00:43:58.339 --> 00:43:59.255
they have their claws.

00:43:59.255 --> 00:44:00.990
They're trying to give me a hug.

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.100
They're really close
to me, sometimes

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.395
inches away from the camera.

00:44:04.395 --> 00:44:07.770
And so, over time, you
get pretty scratched up,

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:08.600
pretty dinged up.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.260
So I wear the
wetsuit for that too.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.100
Here's about the same moment,
maybe taken a couple seconds

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.140
after this.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:14.880
So here's this.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.360
The tennis ball dropped
out of the frame.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.250
In the book, you'll
see some tennis balls.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.440
And also you'll see no tennis
balls in other pictures.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.240
It just depends.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.990
Sometimes the puppies
were just jumping in

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.300
because they thought it's fun.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.883
Sometimes they're chasing a toy
like they're doing right here.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.900
I try to sync to tennis
ball so that it's not always

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.470
in the picture.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.761
I just don't like having a
tennis ball always in there.

00:44:34.761 --> 00:44:36.240
I think it gets-- it's fun.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.794
But it gets, also, a
little bit old too.

00:44:38.794 --> 00:44:40.960
But you can see the
illumination in the puppy teeth.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.270
That's not a dog or cat.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.530
That's baby Kiera.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.070
So this is my most
recent project

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.140
which'll be published in April.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.160
I'm not baby guy.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.600
I am a dog guy, and
then cats, and then

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.400
a hundred other creatures,
and then, maybe, babies.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.745
SETH CASTEEL: No
offense to any parents

00:44:58.745 --> 00:45:00.310
out there of human children.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.660
But through the course of
working with the puppies,

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:08.620
I was just shocked at the stats
on the water safety for pets.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.220
Same applies for human babies.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.070
Drowning is the number one
cause of accidental death

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:15.890
in children, under five,
in the United States.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.490
Between 500 and 700 children,
under the age of five,

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.989
drown mostly in swimming
pools every year.

00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:22.280
And there's no reason for that.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.190
Mostly, it's because people just
haven't taken the precautions.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.540
They don't understand the
dangers of a swimming pool.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.540
And the babies are not prepared
for any type of situation

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.527
that involves the water at all.

00:45:32.527 --> 00:45:34.610
These guys are all going
through swimming lessons,

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.590
infant swimming lessons,
safety and survival

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.090
all around the country.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.406
I tagged along, at first,
just to explore the idea,

00:45:40.406 --> 00:45:42.030
to see if I could do
something with it.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.446
I shot a story for
"New York Times

00:45:43.446 --> 00:45:45.570
Magazine" called "Little Nemos".

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:46.680
That was fun.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.265
And then, we decided,
let's make a book about it.

00:45:49.265 --> 00:45:50.640
Don't know if the
book will sell.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.734
Don't really care.

00:45:51.734 --> 00:45:53.400
But if we can get the
message out there.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.900
Some of the media
outlets we've been

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.919
working with for
water safety for pets,

00:45:56.919 --> 00:45:58.210
they're also onboard with this.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:59.793
So we can at least
get the message out

00:45:59.793 --> 00:46:02.440
there about the dangers of
swimming pools and preparing

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.410
our human children also for
potential situations like this.

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:07.480
But these guys are fun.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.021
I had a lot of fun
with these babies.

00:46:09.021 --> 00:46:12.530
Photographed 750, between
four months and 13 months,

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:13.550
all around the country.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.912
Emphasis on California,
Arizona, Texas, and Florida

00:46:16.912 --> 00:46:18.120
with the most swimming pools.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:20.542
And just had a really good time.

00:46:20.542 --> 00:46:22.000
But at the end of
the day, I wasn't

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.210
trying to bring any
of them home with me.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.026
Nope.

00:46:24.026 --> 00:46:24.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.450
SETH CASTEEL: Maybe
one day I'll be a dad.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:27.505
I really have no idea.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.610
But I'm really proud
of this project.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.510
It will be published
in a few months.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:34.510
And I hope that it makes
a difference, at least,

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.950
a little bit for the situation
right now with children.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:40.620
And then, we have not
a lot going on here.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.190
Who can tell me what that is?

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:43.860
SETH CASTEEL: Yeah.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.110
Somebody said a dog yesterday.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:49.760
I'm like, that's the longest
dog nails I've ever seen.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.595
So I have done some work with
some exotic animals underwater.

00:46:53.836 --> 00:46:55.646
This little clown right here.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.947
Who can tell me what that is?

00:46:58.947 --> 00:47:00.320
AUDIENCE: Otter.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.986
SETH CASTEEL: Wait,
somebody said otter.

00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:02.920
Somebody said seal.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.660
Anybody else?

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.649
AUDIENCE: Walrus?

00:47:04.649 --> 00:47:05.440
AUDIENCE: Sea lion.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.390
SETH CASTEEL: Sea
lion, there it is.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.890
Otter?

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.920
Who said that's an otter?

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.316
That's way off.

00:47:11.316 --> 00:47:12.248
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:12.248 --> 00:47:14.170
SETH CASTEEL: [LAUGHS]
That's way off.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.970
That's a California
sea lion named Kai.

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.110
And, real quick, I
am working on a book

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:21.359
called "Underwater Creatures".

00:47:22.404 --> 00:47:24.070
Whether it becomes a
book, I don't know.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.440
I might have to self-publish it.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.810
It's expensive to make it.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.190
My publisher may or may
not actually want to do it.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.990
But it would be to create some
really interesting and joyful

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:35.200
images of different types
of animals underwater, some

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.440
of which were not used to
seeing like orangutans, parrots,

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.500
foxes, all kinds of stuff
you wouldn't normally

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.594
see underwater.

00:47:41.594 --> 00:47:42.760
Would love to make the book.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.218
I think we can also
bring awareness

00:47:44.218 --> 00:47:46.320
about all the other
species of animals.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.010
I mean, hey, we got to be
responsible for dogs, and cats,

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.030
and human children.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:53.090
But what about all
the other animals too.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:53.716
I love animals.

00:47:53.716 --> 00:47:55.673
Would love to try to make
a difference for some

00:47:55.673 --> 00:47:56.840
of these different species.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.530
A lot of important issues
around each species.

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.040
And would love to make the book.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.710
It's a tough challenge, though,
working with wild animals

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:05.980
either in captivity
or in the wild.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.810
It's a very passionate topic.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.940
And without getting
into too much,

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.490
as a photographer working
with an animal in the wild,

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.530
some people are going
to be upset about that.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.192
If you work with
them in captivity,

00:48:16.192 --> 00:48:17.900
some people are going
to upset about too.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.540
I worked with bears in Alaska
for the "New York Times".

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.300
They sent me in to
Cooper Landing, Alaska

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.690
to document the migration and
spawning of sockeye salmon.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:29.120
Really cool assignment.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.869
Jumped in the 37 degree
river so excited.

00:48:31.869 --> 00:48:32.910
Didn't bring my dry suit.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.320
That would have a good idea.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.410
But did document the salmon.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:37.719
Along came some bears.

00:48:37.719 --> 00:48:38.635
They strolled through.

00:48:38.635 --> 00:48:40.020
Did some pictures.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.410
Ended up being reasonably close
to the bears, not by choice.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:44.745
It just happened.

00:48:44.745 --> 00:48:45.620
They wanted the fish.

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:46.870
I was near the fish.

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.060
So some people got
upset with me for that.

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.210
Because I was just there.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.840
And the bears came along.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.600
I mean, it happens
every day in Alaska.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.660
I mean, it's like we're
on their territory.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.244
And it just happened.

00:48:57.244 --> 00:48:58.660
And it's for "The
New York Times".

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.065
It's a great piece
about sockeye salmon,

00:49:01.065 --> 00:49:03.190
about the conditions that
they're facing right now,

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.540
and all the issues.

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.984
But people were
upset about that.

00:49:05.984 --> 00:49:07.400
I got some death
threats for that.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.140
Oh, yeah.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.181
And that's not everybody.

00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:11.820
But it is a hot topic.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.810
It's enough where it bothers me.

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.180
And I'm like, did I
do something wrong?

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:21.447
Alternatively, this sea lion
was actually injured by humans

00:49:21.447 --> 00:49:24.030
to the point where it could not
live, in the wild, on its own.

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:26.480
So it lives in a
sanctuary in California.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.650
It has the best quality
of life it possibly can.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:29.850
His name is Kai.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.320
And now he's sort of an
ambassador for sea lions

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.410
which is terrific.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:35.570
I did a photo shoot, for
Kai, to raise awareness

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:38.710
about this sea lion
situation in California

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:40.150
with stranded sea lion pups.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.060
Really, really a big
deal to raise money.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.310
I thought, it's a home run idea.

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:45.310
Posted some shots.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:46.787
People wanted to kill me.

00:49:46.787 --> 00:49:47.370
Death threats.

00:49:47.974 --> 00:49:49.140
And I'm like, don't kill me.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.550
I'm trying to do
something good here.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.250
So it's a very tough thing.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.880
I'd like to be able
to make the book,

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.110
feature 70 or 80 different
types of animals.

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:00.300
But as you can tell,
I'd like to live.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.284
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:01.284 --> 00:50:04.080
SETH CASTEEL: Life
is pretty good.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:04.830
So I don't know.

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:05.330
We'll see.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.440
But domestic dogs,
domestic cats, people

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.480
aren't, I could take
pictures of them.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.140
And it's OK.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.473
But when you start photographing
other types of animals,

00:50:13.473 --> 00:50:16.170
in any situation, people
start to ask the question,

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:18.024
should you be doing that?

00:50:18.024 --> 00:50:18.690
So I don't know.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:20.814
But I do look forward to
making that book if I can.

00:50:21.502 --> 00:50:22.960
I would be very
excited to make it.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.430
I think it would be fantastic.

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:26.270
And I think it
would be a book that

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:28.800
will make a difference for a
lot of animals out there too.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.018
Anybody have any questions?

00:50:30.018 --> 00:50:31.226
MARTHA BISHOP: Martha Bishop.

00:50:31.226 --> 00:50:34.118
And are you looking to do
more things than just books?

00:50:34.118 --> 00:50:36.474
I see this like being
a TV show or something.

00:50:36.474 --> 00:50:37.974
Maybe like going
to people's houses,

00:50:37.974 --> 00:50:41.830
and filming that, the
people and their dog.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.222
It's always ends up about
the people and their stories

00:50:44.222 --> 00:50:45.096
rather than the dogs.

00:50:45.096 --> 00:50:48.340
But to be totally fair, you'd be
brilliant for it, like the "E!

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.250
Entertainment" show.

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:52.384
And then, one celebrity
person or something like that.

00:50:53.854 --> 00:50:55.520
SETH CASTEEL: Over
the last couple years

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.240
there's been some possibilities.

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.240
I appeared on a couple of TV
shows, reality TV shows, some

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.050
of which were good, Some
of which were questionable.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:06.460
I appeared on a show
called "Duck Dynasty".

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.030
And I didn't know what
it was at the time.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.910
I went on the show.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.670
It turned out to
be this big show.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.040
And overall, it was possible.

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.080
But I don't know.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.380
Weird people.

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:21.044
I've had to move away from
"Duck Dynasty" for a while.

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.960
Because of all the
controversy and everything,

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:23.626
I just stay out.

00:51:23.626 --> 00:51:26.240
But I don't know.

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.800
Maybe one day I do a TV show.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.160
I probably rather not do it.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.050
I like my privacy.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:32.790
People know about my pictures.

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.500
Something like a billion people
saw "Underwater Puppies" images

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.500
in the last three weeks.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.840
A billion people.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.320
One sixth of the
world population

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.560
looking at my images.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.204
That's crazy.

00:51:41.204 --> 00:51:43.120
I could walk down the
street, nobody knows me.

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:43.915
I can go shopping.

00:51:43.915 --> 00:51:45.784
I can do whatever and
I don't get bothered.

00:51:45.784 --> 00:51:47.575
I don't have people
showing up at my house.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.470
And, I guess, if
you had a TV show,

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.640
I don't know what it's like
to be famous person, an actor,

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.723
or a singer, or something.

00:51:54.723 --> 00:51:57.030
But it's got to be
a hassle, I think.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.260
So I think my life is
pretty fun right now.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.630
And I get to just do my thing.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:01.870
My images can be popular.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:05.430
I can just be the guy on the
sidelines or behind-the-scenes.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:08.100
But there are some other
plans, potentially,

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.570
for "Underwater
Dogs" in the future.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:13.654
And I think that I'll make
as many books as I can.

00:52:13.654 --> 00:52:15.320
But there's some other
things that we're

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.190
working on that may
come to fruition.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.320
So, yeah.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.050
Anybody else?

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:22.300
All righty.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.800
Well, I will be
signing some books

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.590
if you'd like me
to sign your book.

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:26.400
It's an extra $100.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.340
SETH CASTEEL:
Accepting cash only.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.320
Just kidding.

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.311
But happy to answer anymore
questions or sign your book.

00:52:33.311 --> 00:52:34.060
Thanks for coming.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.240
And thanks for loving dogs
as much as they love us.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.390
[APPLAUSE]
