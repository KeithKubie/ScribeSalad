00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.110
The first issue is configuration.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.256
It may not be apparent from the discussion so

00:00:05.256 --> 00:00:07.750
far that components are typically configurable.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.644
What this means is that the component vendor provides a means,

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.555
such as a configuration file,

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:18.419
by which the client using a component can tailor it to a particular situation.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.101
This gives to the designer a powerful means for managing design trade-offs.

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:24.098
For example, space versus time.

00:00:24.098 --> 00:00:28.334
This flexibility that configuration gives comes at a cost, however.

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:32.531
Because configuration is a form of late binding, it becomes difficult to

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:36.580
unit test the components in the actual usage environment.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.180
It is also more expensive to document and to deploy them.
