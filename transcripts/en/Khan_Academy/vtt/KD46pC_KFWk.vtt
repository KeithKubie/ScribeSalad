00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.140
The members of a
distinguished committee

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.790
were choosing a
president, and each member

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.355
gave one vote to one
of the 27 candidates.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.610
So it looks like they all
got at least one vote.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.640
For each candidate,
the exact percentage

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.680
of votes the candidate got
was smaller by at least one

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.920
than the number of votes
for that candidate.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.980
Let me underline this
again and read it again.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.438
It's kind of a
confusing statement.

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:34.140
For each candidate,
the exact percentage

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.000
of votes the candidate got
was smaller by at least one

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.520
than the number of votes
for that candidate.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.070
What is the smallest
possible number

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.006
of members of the committee?

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.005
So let's define some
variables here and maybe we

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:57.860
can get our heads around this.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.497
So let's just say that m is
equal to the number of members

00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:02.205
of the committee.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.780
That's equal to the
number of members.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.530
And let's just think
about each candidate.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.820
Let's say that we
have 27 candidates,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.805
but let's just pick some
arbitrary candidate i,

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:19.204
so that i could be any number
from one to 27, any integer.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.120
This sentence right here,
let me write in blue

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.046
since I underlined it in blue.

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:23.920
Let me write it here.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.200
Candidate c sub i is
equal to the number

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.470
of votes for the ith candidate.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.970
Now let's see if
we can do something

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.261
with what I underlined in blue.

00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:42.090
The exact percentage of
votes the candidate got

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.010
was smaller-- OK.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.260
So the exact percentage
of votes the candidate got

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.550
would be the votes he
got or she got divided

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.060
by the total number of members.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.250
Now this will give
you a decimal.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.300
If you want it as a
percentage, you're

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.660
going to want to
multiply it by 100.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.030
So times 100.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.050
So that's this part.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.050
The exact percentage of
votes the candidate got,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.080
so that's this right here,
was smaller by at least one

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.200
than the number of votes
for that candidate.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.290
So smaller by at least one.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.680
So the number of votes of
the candidate is c sub i,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.930
and it's not less than or
equal to the number of votes

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.740
they got.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.440
It's less than or equal to 1
less than the number of votes

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.330
they got, at least 1 less.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.197
So we're going to
put a minus 1 here.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:38.280
So this is telling us that
the percentage of votes

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.580
that any candidate got is
less than the number of votes

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.382
they got minus 1,
which is really

00:02:43.382 --> 00:02:44.590
what that sentence is saying.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.320
And frankly, that's the hardest
part about this problem,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.550
is understanding what that
sentence is even saying.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.070
Now what is the
smallest possible number

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.839
of members of the committee?

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.630
Now think about it.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.540
We want to minimize
the number of members.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.690
So we really want to
minimize the number of votes

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.440
that each candidate gets.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:09.250
So let's just think about
the minimum number of votes

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.505
for each candidate,
per candidate.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.920
So can we have 0
votes for a candidate?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.920
Well, they tell us here.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.780
They say each
member gave one vote

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.310
to one of the 27 candidates.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.420
So everyone got
at least one vote.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.920
So no.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.490
We cannot have 0 votes.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.100
Can we have one
vote per candidate?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.860
It seems fair that they
each got at least one vote.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.070
But if we look over
here, their percentage

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.092
having to be 1 less than the
number of votes they have,

00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:42.550
and that's what we
wrote over here,

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.180
that makes 1 pretty difficult.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.190
Let's think about
this a little bit.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.280
Let's think about it.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.800
If the minimum
number of votes is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.584
1, that means for
that candidate who

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:52.750
got the minimum number of
votes, the right-hand side

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.280
of this equation right
here, this right-hand side

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.849
of the equation
would be-- sorry.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:58.890
My cell phone is ringing.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.927
My apologies.

00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:01.510
So where I left off,
we were thinking,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.480
can we have one
vote for a candidate

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.060
or can there be a candidate
that only has one vote?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.051
Can the minimum votes
per candidate be one?

00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:09.800
And we were looking
at the right-hand side

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.841
of this equation we set
up from the word problem.

00:04:11.841 --> 00:04:15.520
And if it was 1, this
right here would be 0.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.589
And this, on the left hand
side, if it's at least 1--

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.029
we know that we have a
positive number of members.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.630
And we know that this is
going to be at least 1.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.430
So this is going to be
some positive fraction

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.280
that we're going
to multiply by 100.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.060
So there's no way that that
can be less than or equal to 0.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.600
So even the guy or the gal
who got the fewest votes

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.640
has to get more than one vote.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.760
So this also can't be the case.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.160
This expression right
over here can never

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.410
be less than or equal to
0, which would be the case

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.240
if the minimum number
of votes was one.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.650
So let's think
about more of them.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.730
Let's see if we can
ever have two votes

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.950
for a candidate, a
minimum of two votes.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.990
And to do that, what I want to
do-- if we put 2 in here-- what

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.720
I want to do is I want to
see what repercussions that

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.331
has for our members.

00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:09.080
Does it put any threshold
for our members?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.570
And to do that,
let me solve for m.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.400
It actually simplifies
a little bit now

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.400
that we've put the constraint
that our minimum number

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.390
of votes can never
be equal to 1.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.900
So what I want to
do is, let's take

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.130
the inverse of both
sides of this equation.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.090
Let me do this in a new color.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.220
Let me do it in pink.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.490
Let's take the inverse of
both sides of this equation.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.740
The left hand side over here, we
essentially have 100 ci over m,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.512
so that will be m
over 100 c sub i.

00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:39.720
And since we're inverting
both sides of the equation,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.095
this less than or equal is
going to become a greater than

00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:42.980
or equal to.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.750
And then we're going to
have 1 over c sub i minus 1.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.030
So I just inverted both sides.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.480
You swap the inequality.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.920
Obviously, if you had 1 is less
than 2, now if you invert them,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.400
1 is greater than 1/2.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.730
So that's the logic behind
swapping the inequality.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.520
And now, if I want
to solve for m,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.850
I can multiply both
sides by 100ci,

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.390
and that's a
positive value, so it

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.390
won't do anything
to the inequality.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.720
So m is going to be greater than
or equal to 100 c i, the number

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.930
of votes the ith candidate
got over ci minus 1.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.520
So let's see.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.540
Can a candidate get 2 votes?

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.080
So if a candidate got 2
votes-- if the candidate

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.520
with the fewest votes
got 2, what repercussions

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.150
would that have based on
what we just solved for?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.370
Well, in that
situation, m would have

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.160
to be greater than or equal
to 100 times 2 over 2 minus 1.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.080
So m would have to
be greater than 200.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.860
Seems reasonable.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.280
Maybe our answer is 200, or
greater than or equal to 200.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.434
So maybe our answer's 200.

00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:48.850
But let's try it with some
larger minimum number of votes.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.890
Maybe that can bring
down our m a little bit.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.180
So what if we had 3?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.000
What does this
inequality tell us?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.160
Then m would have to be greater
than or equal to 300 divided

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.920
by 3 minus 1, 300 divided by 2.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.420
Yep.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.480
It did come down.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.670
So it looks like as we increase
our minimum number of votes

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.990
per candidate, we're
getting this threshold for m

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.660
to come down.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.240
So let's try higher numbers.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.750
If our minimum vote per
candidate is 4, then we have m

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.800
is greater than or
equal to 400 over 3.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:30.340
So m would have to be greater
than or equal to 133 1/3.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.660
And obviously, this has to
be an integer right here.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.030
So the smallest possible m in
this situation would be 134.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.420
Well, it seems like we're
making progress here.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.975
Let's try 5.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.640
If we have a minimum
number of votes of 5,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.000
then m has to be greater than
or equal to 500 divided by 4

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.490
is 125.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.900
Now this looks
tempting, but remember,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.050
this is the minimum number
of votes per candidate,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.010
and we have 27 candidates.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.409
So what does this tell
us about the minimum--

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:08.200
if this is the minimum
votes per candidate,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.847
what is the minimum
number of votes,

00:08:12.847 --> 00:08:14.680
not even thinking about
this threshold here.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.060
Well, it's going to be
this number times 27.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.140
In this case, if you had
two votes for candidate

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.980
you would have to have 54.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.370
That's 27 times 2.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.970
27 times 3 is 81.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.770
27 times 4 is what.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.195
That's 80, that's 108.

00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:38.919
27 times 5 is 135.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.400
So even though having
at least 5 votes

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.720
per candidate kind of
loosens your constraint on m,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.410
if you have 5 votes
per candidate,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.780
you're going to have 135 votes.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.820
You can't get down to 125 votes.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.970
If you have 4 votes
per candidate--

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.690
in order to have 4 times
27, you only need 108.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:00.950
So if you bump that
108 to 134-- Well,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.770
there's two ways you
could get 134 votes.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.540
You can give 26 people
5 votes, and then

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.860
give the last person
4 votes, and that

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.360
would meet the
constraint over here.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.180
It gets you 1 less than 135.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.450
Or you could give
26 people 4 votes

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.000
and give the last
person-- I think

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.090
it would come out
to be 30 votes.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.590
And either way, this would work.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.817
So our answer is if
we have 134 votes--

00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:27.400
or I guess another way to say
it is our answer to the question

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.040
is the minimum number
of committee members

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.980
we need is 134.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.840
Hopefully, you found
that interesting.
