PROFESSOR ANANT AGARWAL:
Welcome to MITx, MIT's

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.810
worldwide online learning
initiative.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.030
We are delighted to have you
join us for 6.002x: Circuits

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.420
and Electronics, the inaugural
course of MITx.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.690
OK, welcome to 6.002.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.880
6.002x is the same as Electronic
Circuits course

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.850
taken by MIT students as the
first course in an EE or EECS

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.409
major at MIT.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.430
This course will help you make
the transition from physics to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.550
electrical engineering.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.240
In this course, you will learn
about a lot of fun things,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.050
including the foundations behind
many cool devices, such

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.470
as the smartphone.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.910
The course will be hard and we
want you to stick with us.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.750
It is our hope that you
will have a lot

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.340
of fun in this course.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.870
Let me start by introducing
you to our team.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.920
I am Anant Agarwal.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.450
I am the director of MIT's
Computer Science and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.320
Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory or CSAIL.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.470
Like most MIT faculty, I have
a wide range of interests,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.100
including a fascination
around chainsaws.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.820
GERRY SUSSMAN: Hello, I'm Gerry
Sussman, professor of

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.550
electrical engineering at MIT.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.890
Been a faculty member
here since 1973.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.560
I build electronics, optics,
computer software, and I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.810
repair watches as a hobby.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.040
PIOTR MITROS: I'm
Piotr Mitros.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.740
I'm a research scientist at MIT,
and I was in charge of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.880
developing the software
infrastructure for MITx.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.470
As a graduate student, I spent a
lot of time traveling around

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.550
India, Nigeria, and China,
mostly as part of educational

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.830
technology projects.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.190
So I'm very excited to be
helping out with this course.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.410
PROFESSOR ANANT AGARWAL: Whether
we like chainsaws or

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.620
watches, we are all passionate
educators.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.310
This course is free.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.810
You will have the opportunity
to earn an MITx pilot

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.720
certificate with your grade
at the end of this course.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.900
In this experimental first
course of MITx, the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.170
certificates are also free.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.020
Now, this is a prototype course
and we welcome your

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.350
participation and any feedback
you might have to improving

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.230
the learning experience.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.480
Let's get started.
