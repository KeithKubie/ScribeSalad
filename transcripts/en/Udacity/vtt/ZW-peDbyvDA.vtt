00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.616
As anybody who's gone through adolescence knows, the body undergoes great

00:00:03.616 --> 00:00:08.870
changes during that time. In fact, during puberty our bodies and brains change

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.966
more than at any other time in development except for early childhood. Puberty

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:20.388
is the onset of sexual maturity. We experience a growth spurt. Both sexes begin

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:24.553
to grow hair around their genitals and underarms. And men will begin to grow

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:30.567
facial hair. Women also start to develop breasts, and begin menstruating. The

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:34.750
technical term for the onset of menstruation is menart. Whereas the term for

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.539
the development of sperm through ejaculation is termed sperm mark. The

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.095
pituatary gland is critcial in the onset of puberty because it release hormones

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:49.164
including our sex hormones. For women the main sex hormone is estrogen where as

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:54.490
for men it's testosterone. It's important to note that both men and women have

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.845
estrogen and testosterone but women have more estrogen and men have more

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:03.580
testosterone. As we'll see when we get to the section on motivation, our sex

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.052
drive, both men and women's, is largely a function of testosterone. Now let's

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:12.184
go back to Lauren, and see the last part of our psychological domain in

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:13.710
adolescence.
