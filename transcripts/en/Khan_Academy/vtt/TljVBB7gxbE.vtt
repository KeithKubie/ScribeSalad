00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.610
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.710
we had somewhat simplified our
polynomial p of x from the way

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.600
that it was originally
described in the problem,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.100
but it still doesn't
seem like we're

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.540
any closer to finding the roots.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.540
At least we were able to reduce
the degree from 47th degree

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.760
polynomial to the product of a
first degree and a 23rd degree

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.410
polynomial.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.785
But it still
doesn't seem like we

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:26.630
are any closer to finding
the roots, especially

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.799
the roots that matter.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:31.340
And here, we're going to have
to-- there's another little bit

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.870
of an aha moment here-- that
this part in a blue, which

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.080
is really just the sum of all
of the degrees of x from x

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.437
to the 0 all the way to x to 23.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:42.520
This actually looks a lot.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.630
It is actually, if you
view the common ratio

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.190
as x as a finite
geometric series.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.050
And I've done it
in other videos,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.767
there is a way to find the sum
of a finite geometric series.

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:55.600
And we'll use a similar
technique right here

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.030
to simplify this a little
bit-- to help us find the root.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.550
So let's just call
this whole thing S. So

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.170
let's just call this S is
equal to x to the 23 plus x

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.770
to the 22nd plus all the
way down to x plus 1.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.570
So that's this thing over here.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.800
Now let's multiply S times x.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.779
So x times S is going
to be equal to--

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.320
and actually, let
me do it like this,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.610
because this will
help us a little bit.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.390
I'm going to write
it up here, and it's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.940
going to look a little
bit messy. x times S

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.470
is going to be-- actually, let
me-- I'll just write it over

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.610
here. x times S is equal
to-- let me save some space,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.560
actually.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.780
x times S is equal to-- x times
x to 23 is x to the 24th power,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.640
x times x to the 22nd is going
to be x to the 23rd power,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030
and then there's going
to be an x to the 21st.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.450
When you multiply by x, you're
going to get x to the 22nd.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.100
All the way down to when
you multiply x times x,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.550
you're going to
get plus x squared.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.460
And then when you multiply the 1
times x, you're going to get x.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.729
Now, what I want to do, let's
subtract this from that.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.450
Let's subtract it.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.250
I won't put the
negative sign out there.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.916
So on the left hand
side of the equation

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:22.510
you have S minus xS
is equal to-- what

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.270
happens on the right hand
side of the equation?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.811
Well, you're going to have
this guy minus this guy.

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:29.060
These are going to cancel out.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.310
These are going to cancel out.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.160
Everything is going
to cancel out,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.260
except you're going to have
a 1 minus x to the 24th.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.911
So you're going to have
1 minus x to the 24th.

00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:41.035
Now let's just multiply
both sides by a negative 1,

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:44.760
because this will just get it in
a slightly easier form for us.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.180
So this is the same thing.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.940
If we multiply both
sides times negative 1

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.610
it's xS minus S is equal
to x to the 24th minus 1.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.485
We can factor out an S here.

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:56.360
I'll do it over here.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.401
So if we factor out an S
from the left hand side,

00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:05.390
we get S times x minus 1 is
equal to x to the 24th minus 1.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.130
Or we could say that the sum is
equal to x to the 24th minus 1

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.400
over x minus 1.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.650
So this whole thing
in the blue over here

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.770
can be rewritten as
this right over here--

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.400
as x to the 24th minus
1 over x minus 1.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.780
Now let's be clear here.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.720
What we really care
about for this problem

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.870
is to figure out the
roots that have--

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.190
the roots whose squares
have complex parts.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.810
We already know
that one of the root

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.944
is 0, because if you
set this equal to 0,

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:44.860
x could be equal to 0.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.520
0 squared is still 0-- it
does not have a complex part.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.020
So it really doesn't matter.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.210
So for our problem--
and the other thing

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.615
that we want to keep
in mind is that we

00:03:56.615 --> 00:03:57.990
don't want to
double count roots.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.987
Let's re-read the
problem a little bit.

00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:02.070
Because what we're going
to have is a bunch of-- I

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.760
guess you could view
them as double roots.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.370
You're only going to
have 23 distinct roots

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.660
from this part of
the polynomial.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.910
And they say, let
z1, z2, and zr be

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.800
the distinct zeroes of p sub x.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.560
So what we only care about
right now are these 23 zeroes.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.950
We don't have to think
about those 23 zeroes twice.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.390
We're not going to add
their imaginary parts twice.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.790
So we can kind of substitute
p of x with-- let's call it

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.220
q of x.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.720
We really just care
about the zeroes

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.030
of q of x, which is just x to
the 23 plus x to the 22nd plus

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.090
all the way down to x
squared plus x plus 1.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.177
That's this inside part.

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:49.510
The fact that it's squared,
that just doubles the roots,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.218
but we just care about
the distinct root.

00:04:51.218 --> 00:04:55.012
So we really just care about
the sum of the imaginary part--

00:04:55.012 --> 00:04:57.470
of the absolute value of the
imaginary parts of the squares

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.010
of the roots of this
guy, right over here.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.910
Now we just figured
out that this guy

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.980
can be rewritten
as this over here.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.400
Or even better, let's define--
instead of our defining q

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:19.500
of x like this, let's define
q of x as this times x--

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.320
let me write it a little
bit-- as this times x minus 1.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.290
Let's just define q of x here.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.980
So this q of x is going to have
all of the same distinct roots,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.260
that matter as this
p of x, but it's also

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.214
going to have the root x is
equal to 1, which is clearly

00:05:36.214 --> 00:05:36.880
not a root here.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.620
If you put x equals
1 here, you're

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.640
actually going to get 24.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.040
So it's not going
to be equal to 0.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.530
But what makes this better,
easier to find the roots of,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.090
is that this thing
right over here

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:55.740
is equivalent to-- this part in
yellow is x to the 24th minus 1

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.700
over x minus 1 times
x minus 1, which

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.320
is equal to x to
the 24th minus 1.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.800
So we've simplified the
problem a huge amount.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.110
What we've said is the roots
that we care about are actually

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.180
the roots of this
polynomial right

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.690
here, except for
x is equal to 1--

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.120
we just kind of added that
there to simplify it--

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.610
which is equal to the roots
of this polynomial here,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.190
except for 1, because
we added 1 as a root.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.700
So we just care about the
roots of this polynomial,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.490
except for 1.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.670
And the roots of this polynomial
are-- well, I won't say easy,

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.760
but it's much more
straightforward to calculate.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.980
If we set this
polynomial to equal to 0,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.440
to figure out the roots,
we just get x to the 24th

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.340
add 1 to both sides,
is equal to 1.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.029
So we're going to
have-- remember,

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:54.320
this is going to have 24 roots.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.240
One of them is going to be 1.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.550
We want to ignore the 1, so we
care about the 23 non-1 roots.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.550
And we care about squaring
them, and then taking

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.740
the absolute value of
the imaginary parts.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.410
So we essentially need
to think about all

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.400
of the 24th root of
1, and then ignore 1.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.690
So let's think about how
to do that a little bit.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.720
And this is going to
delve a little bit

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.450
into the complex plane.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.470
So just as a refresher, how do
we find all of the roots of 1?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.730
The 24th roots of 1?

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.340
And just remember,
we can rewrite 1.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.430
So let's draw a little
complex plane over here.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.450
So this is the real axis, and
this is the imaginary axis.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.100
1 is sitting right over here.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.000
It only has a real
part-- it is 1.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.290
But we know that we
can rewrite this.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:56.140
We can rewrite 1 as--
let me write it this way.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.280
It could be e to the i times 0.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.790
Actually, so this is e to
the 0, obviously equal to 1.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.640
Or we can add 2 pi to it, if
we're dealing with radians.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.190
So 1 is equal to e to i0, which
is also equal to e to the 2 pi

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.440
i, but you could keep
adding, because if you

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.780
add 2 pi goes around
the complex plane once.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.340
If you add another 2 pi,
it goes around again.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.880
It also equals e to the 4 pi i.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.730
It also equals e to the 6 pi i.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.450
It also equals e to the 8 pi i.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.159
I think you get
the general idea.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.820
So if you want to
find the 24th roots,

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.554
you want to just raise all of
these things to the 1 over 24.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.730
So essentially, you're going
to take this divide by 24,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.850
divide by 24, divide by 24,
divide by 24, divided by 24,

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.197
and then keep going.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.530
You can actually go all the way.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.330
Well, I'll depict it over here.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.480
So what is this first root?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.622
The first root is
e to the 0 over 24.

00:08:57.622 --> 00:08:58.580
That's just e to the 0.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.750
That's just 1.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.810
That's the root that
we can ignore, right?

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.190
Because we added that root
to q of x to simplify it

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.120
a little bit.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.880
Now what's this root over here?

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.880
This is e to the pi over
12i, which remember,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.690
is the same thing as
cosine of pi over 12--

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.335
that's the real part--
plus i sine of pi over 12.

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:27.810
And if we were to
draw that, we would

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.990
have an angle of pi over 12.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.730
And if you wanted
to think in degrees,

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.310
that would be 15 degrees.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:39.050
So it would look something
like this right over here.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.330
So we do care about that
root right over here.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.790
Now what would this root be?

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.900
Well this root is
going to be pi over 6.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.400
It's going to have
twice the angles.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.570
So it's going to look like this.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.620
So this root right here is
going to look like this.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.750
This root over here-- and
notice, they're pi over 12

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.930
apart.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:03.180
This root over here,
this is pi over 4.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.770
So it's going to look
like this-- pi over 4.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.070
That's 45 degrees.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.990
So it's going to look like this.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.220
So notice, each of the
roots we're just adding

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.290
are just multiples
of this-- I shouldn't

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.180
say multiples-- are powers
of this first root over here.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.680
We're just increasing
the degree by pi over 12.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.870
And remember, we just care
about the imaginary parts

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.501
of their squares.

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.750
So let's just first of all,
just think about the roots

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.904
that matter.

00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:32.320
So one way to think
about it is we

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.940
could literally just
draw a unit circle here

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.790
and divide it into 24 sections.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.120
So let me draw that.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.232
Let me draw it a little bit.

00:10:41.232 --> 00:10:42.690
Let me redraw it
a little bit, so I

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.666
don't overload this
graph over here.

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:46.040
Actually, I'm
running out of time

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.240
in this video-- I might
continue it in the next.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.060
So we could draw a
unit circle here.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.290
They're all going to
have magnitude one.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.970
We could draw the
unit circle over here.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.570
One of the roots is
1, but we're going

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:04.360
to have 24 roots, so we can
divide it into 24 sections.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.310
So we have four
sections right here.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.660
We're going to have six
roots in each section.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.780
So we're going to have 1,
pi over 12, 2pi over 12,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.900
pi over 4, and then you have
the one symmetric to that,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.240
then you have the one
symmetric to that--

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.410
let me make sure I'm
doing this right.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.219
And then you're going
to have pi over 2.

00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:27.510
So these are the roots that
are-- actually, let me just

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.690
continue this in the next video.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.160
I don't want to-- when
I start rushing this--

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.951
this is kind of a new
concept to everybody.

00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:33.950
I'll continue this
in the next video.
