00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.590
Obviously animals can talk if they couldn't,

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.580
would we named social chat services after them?

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.430
When we say animals, we're not usually talking about humans.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.570
We have this intuition that humans are very different from the rest of nature,

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.580
but if we are so special, the searches on for what makes us special,

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.410
the first thing to reach for is often human language. We can talk to each other.

7
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:27.770
Sure, but the rest of the animal kingdom, blank stares.

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.190
What about animals that can communicate Ansley pheromone trails that other ants

9
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.270
can sniff out with their antenna.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.120
These dads to tell the high where to find flowers.

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.420
Birds learn to sing and their songs can communicate various details to other

12
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:48.440
birds, but as any of this really language to sort this matter out,

13
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.120
linguists ethologists and biologists came up with lists of things that make a

14
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:54.350
language a language.

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.950
It's actually not an easy thing to do before you look at these,

16
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.150
go try making your own. Take one of the items that ends up on these lists.

17
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.260
Displacement,

18
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.840
animals adopt postures or vocalizations to signal an opportunity or warn of

19
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:09.860
immediate danger,

20
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.210
but displacement signaling about something removed from our surroundings,

21
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.740
something far away,

22
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.660
something in the past or the future that seems legitimately rare but not for

23
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:23.780
humans. You'll catch this languaging. Displacement all over the place.

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.670
We're not the only ones though.

25
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.200
Enter the honeybee who performs a waggling rotating dance that contains

26
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:33.470
information about the direction and distance of a point of interest.

27
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.220
This waggle dance definitely has this placement,

28
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.130
but it doesn't have double articulation.

29
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.920
Also known as duality of patterning.

30
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.360
Double articulation gives humans a layer of meaningless sounds that we can put

31
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:51.410
together and switch around like building blocks to create a meaningful layer of

32
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:55.310
words and sentences. Linguists argue that these two levels,

33
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.350
meaningless pieces we use to build up meaning makes us more flexible talkers

34
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.650
than we'd be if our smallest communication units were already packed with

35
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:07.670
meaning. Like if we communicated by pointing to pictures of real world objects.

36
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.010
Wait, you hear that there's a low rumble building up in the audience?

37
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.380
Hold on. What about apes?

38
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.630
Didn't coco the gorilla cry when she was told that Robin Williams died? I mean,

39
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:25.631
that sounds like displacement and it sounds like sadness and doesn't she use

40
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:29.570
sign language to build meaning out of simple gestures? I mean,

41
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:33.530
that's double articulation right there. Okay,

42
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.730
let's come back to that.

43
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.230
But what do you think languages and I do other animals have it set a straight in

44
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:41.630
the comments and subscribe for language.
