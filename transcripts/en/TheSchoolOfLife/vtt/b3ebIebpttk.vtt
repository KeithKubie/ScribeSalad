00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.590
We reserve some of our deepest scorn for couples
who stay together out of compromise; those

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.000
who are making a show of unanimity, but whom
we know are, deep down, not fully happy. Maybe

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.090
they’re primarily together because of the
children; maybe they’re sticking around

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.279
because they’re scared of being lonely or
maybe they’re just worried that anyone else

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.279
they found wouldn’t be much better. These
seem like disgraceful motives to be with anyone

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.020
– disgraceful on account of a background
belief that circulates powerfully through

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.500
the collective modern psyche: the idea that
anyone who puts their mind and will sufficiently

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.680
to it doesn’t have to compromise in love;
that there are pain-free, profoundly fulfilling

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.790
options available for all of us – and the
only things that could stand in the way of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.030
discovering them would be laziness and cowardice,
flaws of character that deserve no particular

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.230
sympathy or forgiveness. Our high romantic
expectations have made us notably impatient

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.149
around, and censorious about, those who can’t
attain them. But imagine if we were to tweak

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.960
the premise of the argument a little and for
a moment probe at the notion that there really

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.930
might be a pain-free and entirely fulfilling
option available for all of us at all times.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.590
What if our choices were, in many contexts,
in fact often rather more limited than Romanticism

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.719
proposes? Maybe there aren’t as many admirable
unattached people in our vicinity as there

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:38.270
might be. Maybe we lack the charm, the personality,
the career, the confidence or the looks ever

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.380
to attract the ones that do exist. Maybe time
is running out. Or maybe our children really

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.509
would take it extremely badly if we dynamited
the family for the sake of better sex and

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.539
greater cheer elsewhere. At the same time,
maybe the current situation – while clearly

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.719
a compromise – is not without its virtues.
A partner may be only half-right, quite often

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.990
maddening and properly disappointing in certain
areas, but – humblingly – still more satisfying

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.850
than being alone. Having children to bring
up together may be worth it even with a co-parent

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.350
about whom one has a long, only semi-private
list of reservations. A few cuddles and occasional

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.390
moments of cosiness may retain a small but
decisive edge over conclusive abandonment

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.070
interspersed with humiliating dates. The capacity
to compromise is not always the weakness it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.450
is described as being. It can involve a mature,
realistic admission that there may – in

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.760
certain situations – simply be no ideal
options. And, conversely, an inability to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.590
compromise does not always have to be the
courageous and visionary position it is held

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.720
to be by our impatient and perfectionist ideology:
it may just be a slightly rigid, proud and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.390
cruel delusion. Mocking people who compromise
is – of course – emotionally very handy.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.490
It localises a problem that it’s normal
to want to disavow. It pins to a few scapegoat

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:18.070
couples what we are all terrified of: that
a degree of sadness may just be an intrinsic,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.240
unavoidable part of our love lives. Wiser
societies would be careful never to stigmatise

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.540
the act of compromise. It is painful enough
to have to compromise; it is even more painful

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.460
to have to hate oneself for having done so.
We should rehabilitate and occasionally honour

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.810
the ability to put up with a flawed fellow
human being, to nurse our sadness without

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.890
falling into rage or despair, to reconcile
ourselves to our damaged appearance and character

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.540
and to accept that there may be no better
way for us to live but partly in pain and

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.910
longing, given who we are and what the world
can provide. Couples who compromise may in

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.600
reality not be the enemies of love: they may
be at the vanguard of understanding what lasting

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.360
relationships truly demand.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.120
Did you know that the school of life is actually a place?  Ten places in fact,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.600
campuses all over the world from Melbourne to London, Taipei to Istanbul

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.680
