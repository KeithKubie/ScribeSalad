00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:03.672
 The following two equations form a linear system. 

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:05.818
 This is one equation; it contains x and y, 

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:07.418
 hence will determine rights. 

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:09.584
 Then I have another equation that includes x and y, 

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:11.251
 so it will determine other rights. 

00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.151
 It is said: "Draw the system of equations 

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:14.551
 and found her decision. " 

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.284
 We'll try to find it visually. 

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:18.191
 Let's draw the first one. 

00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:21.018
 For this right I will use the small drawing tool here. 

00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:23.118
 If I find two points, 

00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:24.251
 I'll be able to move them around 

00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:27.398
 and they will determine the rights. 

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:29.385
 I will choose two values ​​of x and I will find 

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:33.251
 the corresponding y values, and then draw the rights. 

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.618
 Let's see how I can do it. 

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.084
 An easy point to find is to see what's going on, 

00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:38.951
 when x is zero? 

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:41.451
 If x is equal to 0, all that I have marked, 

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:45.618
 disappears and remains minus 3 is equal to 9. 

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:50.184
 Then u will be minus 3. 

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:54.584
 When x is equal to 0, y will be minus 3. 

00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:55.552
 Let me draw it. 

00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:58.508
 When x is equal to 0, 

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:01.918
 y is minus 3. 

00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:03.652
 Another easy-to-find point will get if instead 

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:06.851
 to try with another value of x, think what happens when y = 0, 

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:08.984
 because these equations are normal, 

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:10.218
 we just have to try. 

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:12.418
 What are the intersections with the axes x and y? 

00:01:12.418 --> 00:01:16.882
 When y is equal to 0, 

00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:20.375
 this member disappears and you have minus x 

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:25.375
 is equal to 9 or x will be equal to minus 9. 

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:29.181
 When 

00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:32.458
 y is 0, 

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.568
 x is minus 9, 

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:37.718
 or when x is minus 9, y is zero. 

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:42.517
 Here I introduced the first equation. 

00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:45.084
 Now let's put the second one. We will do the same thing. 

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.551
 What happens when 

00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:49.851
 x is equal to 0, 

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:53.818
 this will now be intersected with the y axis. 

00:01:53.818 --> 00:01:57.584
 When x is equal to 0, minus 6 is equal to minus 6. 

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.118
 So, y is equal to 1. 

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:04.718
 Therefore 

00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:07.985
 when x is 0, 

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:10.052
 y is equal to 1. 

00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:11.051
 Let's find another point here. 

00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:14.618
 When y is 0, when this member is 0, 

00:02:14.618 --> 00:02:17.018
 0 equal to 0 will make this whole article 0, 

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:19.584
 then 6x is equal to minus 6 

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:22.018
 or x is equal to minus 1. 

00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:24.218
 When y is 0, x is minus 1, 

00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:27.118
 or when 

00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:30.798
 x is minus 1, 

00:02:30.798 --> 00:02:33.258
 y is 0. 

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:36.028
 So I did both. 

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:39.818
 And the solution of the system is x and y values, 

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:43.819
 which satisfy the two equations, and if they satisfy 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.285
 both equations, that means they are on both lines. 

00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:48.585
 To be on both lines, 

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.319
 they must be at the point of intersection. 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.218
 This intersection point is here 

00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:54.984
 it is very clear - this is the point x is equal 

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:59.485
 to minus 3; y is equal to minus 2. 

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:02.252
 The point minus 3; minus 2. 

00:03:02.252 --> 00:03:03.884
 Let me write it down. 

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:08.484
 Minus 3; minus 2. 

00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:11.685
 Then I can check my answer; he is faithful. 

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:13.584
 Let's solve another problem. 

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:16.151
 Perhaps a different type. 

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.485
 Here is said: "A system of two linear equations 

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:19.788
 is outlined below. 

00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:23.150
 Find the approximate solution of the system. " 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.285
 Okay, I have to look carefully here 

00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:28.551
 and to think where this point is. 

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:30.251
 Let's first think 

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.035
 for its x value. 

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:34.585
 It is here over x. 

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:38.599
 It looks like this is minus 1. 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.752
 This is minus 2, so minus 1.5 

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:42.652
 will be right here. 

00:03:42.652 --> 00:03:46.585
 The point is a bit left of minus 1.5, 

00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:50.898
 so it's even more negative, I would say at minus 1.6. 

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:53.218
 I rounded it down, minus 1.6. 

00:03:53.218 --> 00:03:54.884
 I hope there is some tolerance 

00:03:54.884 --> 00:03:56.918
 when checking the response. 

00:03:56.918 --> 00:03:58.384
 What about the value? 

00:03:58.384 --> 00:04:00.751
 If I look at the value here, 

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.650
 it looks like it's a little less than half past one. 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.751
 1 and a half will be half between 1 and 2. 

00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:08.484
 It looks like it's a little less than half the distance between 

00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:12.218
 1 and 2 so I'll give her 1.4, 

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.451
 plus 1.4. 

00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:18.521
 And let's check the answer, see how we did. 

00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.184
 Yes, it is true. 

00:04:20.184 --> 00:04:23.784
 Let's actually solve one more one. 

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:25.217
 This is another system. 

00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:27.652
 The equations are written 

00:04:27.652 --> 00:04:29.717
 in the type of tilt-intersection point. 

00:04:29.717 --> 00:04:32.650
 y is equal to minus 7x plus 3. 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.018
 When x is equal to 0, we have the intersection with y. 

00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:36.818
 y is equal to 3. 

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:40.851
 When x is equal to 0, y is equal to 3. 

00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:43.385
 Then we see that the slope is minus 7. 

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:47.818
 When we increase x by 1, we decrease y by 7. 

00:04:47.818 --> 00:04:51.611
 Here we increase x by 1, decreasing y 

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:56.017
 with 1, 2, 3, 4, 

00:04:56.017 --> 00:04:58.884
 5, 6 and 7. 

00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:00.618
 When x goes from 0 to 1, 

00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:02.785
 y ranges from 3 to minus 4, 

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:05.818
 goes down with seven, that's the first point. 

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:07.685
 Now the second: the intersection with y. 

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:09.985
 When x is equal to 0, y is minus 3, 

00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:11.551
 let's draw it. 

00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:15.185
 When x is 0, y is equal to minus 3. 

00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:18.518
 And the slope is minus 1. 

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:22.717
 When x is increased by 1, y decreases by 1. 

00:05:22.717 --> 00:05:25.418
 The slope here is minus 1. 

00:05:25.418 --> 00:05:29.318
 When x is increased by 1, y decreases by 1. 

00:05:29.318 --> 00:05:31.851
 And we got it. We found the crossing point. 

00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:35.385
 You have the pair x; y that satisfies both equations. 

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:37.117
 This is the point of intersection. 

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:38.685
 It will lie on both lines, 

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:40.318
 therefore it is the point of intersection. 

00:05:40.318 --> 00:05:42.485
 And this is the point x is equal to 1, 

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:45.051
 y is equal to minus 4. 

00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:48.118
 Here, x is equal to 1 

00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:51.484
 and equal to minus 4. 

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:55.135
 I can check my answer. It is true.
