00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.140
Neither of these explosions 
are actually real.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.940
This one, known as a physical, or special effect,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.180
happened on set,
 and is much more colorful than in reality.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.280
And this one, a computer animation, is
created using an algorithm.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.340
So what are we technically seeing onscreen?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.140
We have to create these effects that
people have come to think of as explosions

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.220
that really aren't explosions at all;
they're fire reactions.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.960
The real explosion takes place very quickly,
because you have energy moving

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.200
over 20,000 feet per second, so one minute the car is there, then the next minute there's nothing.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.100
The movie version of the explosion
happens thousands of times slower,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.660
always involves fire, always involves smoke.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.240
Steve Wolf has developed and executed stunts like these and hundreds more for over 30 years

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.800
on film and television sets.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.760
There are two ways explosions release energy:
by deflagration and detonation.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.360
The explosions Steve usually creates are deflagrations.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.200
They produce pressure waves that travel slower than the speed of sound, which makes them subsonic.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.660
They are easier to control, like these chemical
reactions with powder.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.780
Supersonic explosions release by detonation.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.200
These pressure waves, which travel faster than the speed of sound, are created by high explosives like C4.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.700
So, sometimes I want a lot of flame, sometimes I want something to physically move,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.040
so we have to choose the materials that we're going to use to create that effect.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.720
Most of the time, high explosives are
not going to be the answer.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.020
To control the fire and the effect, Steve removes everything from the site of the explosion,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.900
in this case, the interior of a test car.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.020
The only thing that's burning 
are the fuels that we put in there

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.520
so we can control exactly the
quantity of the fuel, the nature of the fuel,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.240
what reactions are going to take
place inside the vehicle,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.100
and make sure that there's nothing else involved.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.180
We want to use the least amount 
of kinetic energy that's necessary

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.360
to create the effect,
so we pre-cut the car.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.840
We cut the hinges on the doors and just hot meld
them back on, and the same thing with the hood,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.500
so that just a small amount of
energy will make the car fall apart.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.800
This method of special effects is still
popular with filmmakers

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.100
because it is relatively inexpensive
and easily repeatable.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.080
Now compare it to this: 
a computer animation.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.320
Traditionally, effects like these 
have been complex and costly,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.740
taking days or weeks to render over multiple machines.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.800
By researching complex natural phenomena,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.120
Dr. Theodore Kim has been able to drastically improve this process over the last few decades.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.620
Complex natural phenomena is nonlinear phenomena.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.137
Basically, almost all of what you see
in the natural world is nonlinear

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.480
because most things don't just 
travel in a straight line.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.120
And if it doesn't travel in a straight line then the math that you learned in high school,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.860
it doesn't quite get the job done.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.400
So you're gonna have to
start using something a little bit more advanced

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.760
and that's where we come in.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.260
A big breakthrough in fluid simulation was by a Canadian researcher named Jos Stam back in 1999.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.360
It enabled artists to manipulate 
a fluid simulation in real time,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.760
so something like smoke rising from a cigarette,
 or steam from a coffee cup

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.040
something like that.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.500
One of the limitations of this method, though, was
that the fluid that it produced looked very viscous

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.900
so you could get very large
very broad swirls out of it,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.940
but the thing that makes, for example, large
explosions look like large explosions,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.740
is that there's lots of tiny little curls
that then spin off from the main explosion.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.240
It didn't quite excel at
generating those specific details.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.840
Theodore answers this in his paper called
'Wavelet Turbulence'.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.540
He combines Stam's algorithm with a
modified version of a pre-existing formula

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.140
that quickly generated those
tiny swirls.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.740
But the details weren't quite moving
with the laws of physics.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.900
So, any fluid simulation, you have to use velocity and you have to use pressure, in some form.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.900
What we did is we added small-scale noise 
or high-frequency noise.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.340
Theodore used a tool called wavelet transform, 
which could detect

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.040
when and where tiny details appeared off.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.840
It uses something called a Texture Advection.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.060
First, we detect where would some small swirl have actually appeared?

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.440
So we go ahead and inject the swirl, and have it move along with existing flow.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.800
Advection just means the velocity is pulling something along, so a leaf for example is advected in a streamâ€”

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.420
it's just being pulled along by the stream. We then have to analyze the Jacobian of the

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.160
texture coordinate, because what can
happen, as with any flow, it can try to

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.000
pull something apart or it can try to
push it back together. So we detect when

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.860
that happens and then we delete that
vortex so it's not allowed to exist anymore.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.120
By building and perfecting this algorithm, 
Theodore could synthesize all these details quickly

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.440
so that artists could get the look they wanted for explosions in fast enough time.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.880
The tool was so effective and featured in so many movies that it earned Theodore an Academy Award.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.400
My favorite one was probably 'Super 8.'
there's a big train sequence at the beginning and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.460
it was used for a lot of the fire effects
for the train crash.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.560
Mechanical engineering is usually not concerned with artistic purposes

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.860
so while we use much of the similar underlying math,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.380
we do tweak it in our own way to make it 
so that it's artistically controllable.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.700
There's really just a handful of laws of physics that control how everything works.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.820
Whether we do something amazing with it or not

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.080
is just by how we take those simple
concepts and how we put them together.
