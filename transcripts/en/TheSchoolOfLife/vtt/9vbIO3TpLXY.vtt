00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.100
Sometimes, we are not only left in love; we
are left for someone else – a rival who

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.940
comes to assume a large, indeed monstrous
position in our imaginations. The torture

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.420
comes down to one essential question which
pursues us into the early hours: What do they

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.570
have that we do not? Part of the agony rests
on a basic feature of human psychology; we

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.140
know ourselves from the inside, in great and
dispiriting detail, whereas we can know others

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.190
only from the outside, from what they choose
to reveal, which may be almost nothing, aside

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.730
from an attractive face and a charming manner.
As a result, we may feel that the person we

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.040
have been left for – and whom we know only
on the basis of having briefly met them at

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.190
a party or stalked their online profile – is
wonderful in every way. Where we are shy,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.570
they will be confident; where we are chaotic
they will be well-organised; where our sexuality

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.200
is complex, theirs will be simple; where we’re
too domestic, they will be exciting… Well-meaning

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.290
friends may try to bring us back into contact
with our good sides: they will speak of our

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.740
kindness, intelligence or sense of fun. But
this may not be the best way forward; the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.550
point isn’t to rehearse how decent we are.
Properly to get over the pain of a love-rival,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.570
we need to realise how mediocre pretty much
every human who has ever existed tends to

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.270
be. There is not, in fact, ever any such thing
as a ‘perfect person’, there are merely

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.220
differently tricky ones, as time will inevitably
reveal to our idealising ex. Our failings

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.370
or defects may well be real but the picture
we’ve got of ourselves as compared with

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.441
our love rival is skewed by undue ignorance.
Recovery does not involve the denial of our

00:01:56.441 --> 00:02:03.200
less admirable sides: it requires a more nihilistic,
and therefore more balanced sense of what

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.060
people in general are like. Of course the
rival has qualities we lack. It is true that

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.470
they have better hair, or a more impressive
salary. But at the same time they have an

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.020
enormous number of very serious problems which
we can be assured exist, not because we know

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.120
them, but because we know human beings in
general. No one examined from up close is

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.360
ever anything other than disappointing – and
every person one has to share a life with

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.820
will prove so maddening over time, one will
at points wish they had never been born. Whatever

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.210
attraction a new lover can offer our ex, they
will also supply them with a whole a new set

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.070
of irritants, which will end up frustrating
them as much we ever did, indeed more so,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.660
because they so sincerely hoped – as they
packed their bags – that such flaws would

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.430
not exist in their next partner. Our ex-lover
has not entered the gates of paradise, they

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.560
have merely exchanged one imperfect relationship
for another. We should never compound our

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.410
grief with the thought that our ex will be
uncomplicatedly happy. The deep lesson of

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.600
being supplanted is not that we are so bad.
It’s that we have been left because of a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.980
common delusion: the belief that if only one
was in a different relationship, one would

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.650
be substantially happier. And yet, the truth
is that more or less every human relationship

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.370
has its own special and beautifully distinct
forms of acute unhappiness. That there is

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.470
much wrong with us is, of course, true; but
this dark fact invariably sits within a far

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.350
larger, grimmer and yet strangely consoling
truth: that every person has much wrong with

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.540
them. In future relationships, once we get
over abandonment, the person we need to find

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.690
is not the one who thinks we are perfect (and
will never leave us on this basis) but rather

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.480
one who can quite clearly see our failings
and yet – the key advantage – knows how

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.730
calmly to make their peace with them. The
lover we need is not someone who stays with

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.760
us because they think we are irreplaceably
marvellous but because they’ve wisely realised

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.410
that no-one is as attractive as they seem
at first – and that to smash up a relationship

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.240
generally involves nothing much finer than
a prelude to novel encounters with frustration

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.160
and disappointment.
