Stella astronomy so the work with stars
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.860
Stella astronomy so the work with stars
has actually a strong tradition of of

just thought our stories are not so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
just thought our stories are not so
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.330

interesting let's study galaxies that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
interesting let's study galaxies that

was the big thing because that was the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
was the big thing because that was the
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429
was the big thing because that was the
time and when people found out that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
time and when people found out that
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.400
time and when people found out that
universe is expanding and that was of

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
universe is expanding and that was of
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.950
universe is expanding and that was of
course found out by studying galaxies so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
course found out by studying galaxies so
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.590
course found out by studying galaxies so
that was a hot topic women were hired to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
that was a hot topic women were hired to
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.510
that was a hot topic women were hired to
do stellar work so Stella in both ways

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
do stellar work so Stella in both ways
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.340
do stellar work so Stella in both ways
working with stars but it also actually

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350
working with stars but it also actually
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.350
working with stars but it also actually
turned out that their work was Stella

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
turned out that their work was Stella
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.410
turned out that their work was Stella
because they did so much they classified

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
because they did so much they classified
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.990
because they did so much they classified
stars they're calculated positions and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
stars they're calculated positions and
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.630
stars they're calculated positions and
and other things about about all these

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
and other things about about all these
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.720
and other things about about all these
objects for example Annie jump cannon

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730

classified in her lifetime I think half

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
classified in her lifetime I think half
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359
classified in her lifetime I think half
a million stars or something and her

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
a million stars or something and her
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.520
a million stars or something and her
classification scheme is still used and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
classification scheme is still used and
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800

lady Cecilia Payne Capuchin she found
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.910
lady Cecilia Payne Capuchin she found
out that stars are made mostly from

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
out that stars are made mostly from
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.429
out that stars are made mostly from
hydrogen and helium stars are made

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
hydrogen and helium stars are made
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.700
hydrogen and helium stars are made
seventy-five percent hydrogen 25 percent

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
seventy-five percent hydrogen 25 percent
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550
seventy-five percent hydrogen 25 percent
helium but at that time that was maybe

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
helium but at that time that was maybe
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.149
helium but at that time that was maybe
around 1914 1915 it was thought that

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
around 1914 1915 it was thought that
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.240
around 1914 1915 it was thought that
stars are made of the same material as

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
stars are made of the same material as
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.270
stars are made of the same material as
the earth and so this was absolutely

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
the earth and so this was absolutely
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.969
the earth and so this was absolutely
brilliant because she applied quantum

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
brilliant because she applied quantum
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.210
brilliant because she applied quantum
mechanical knowledge to stars for the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
mechanical knowledge to stars for the
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.800
mechanical knowledge to stars for the
very first time and at first people

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
very first time and at first people
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660
very first time and at first people
laughed at it and they wouldn't believe

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
laughed at it and they wouldn't believe
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.469
laughed at it and they wouldn't believe
her but this is such a fundamental

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
her but this is such a fundamental
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050
her but this is such a fundamental
result I cannot stress this enough I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
result I cannot stress this enough I
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850
result I cannot stress this enough I
mean everything we know about the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
mean everything we know about the
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.190
mean everything we know about the
universe rests now on the assumption and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
universe rests now on the assumption and
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.740
universe rests now on the assumption and
the knowledge that what stars are made

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
the knowledge that what stars are made
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.690
the knowledge that what stars are made
of namely mostly hydrogen helium because

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
of namely mostly hydrogen helium because
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.520
of namely mostly hydrogen helium because
the universe is mostly made of hydrogen

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
the universe is mostly made of hydrogen
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.249
the universe is mostly made of hydrogen
and helium and so these are just two

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
and helium and so these are just two
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.559
and helium and so these are just two
examples of these early works

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
examples of these early works
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.649
examples of these early works
by these women who were called the

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659
by these women who were called the
 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.229
by these women who were called the
computers the Harvard computers because

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239
computers the Harvard computers because
 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.569
computers the Harvard computers because
they all worked up there and and they

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579
they all worked up there and and they
 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.500
they all worked up there and and they
painstakingly did all these these

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
painstakingly did all these these
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.399
painstakingly did all these these
classifications and calculations that

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409
classifications and calculations that
 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.539
classifications and calculations that
today indeed computers do but without

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549
today indeed computers do but without
 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.309

their contributions

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319
their contributions
 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.550
their contributions
I think our overall knowledge of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
I think our overall knowledge of
 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.270
I think our overall knowledge of
astronomy would not or for a long time

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280
astronomy would not or for a long time
 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.750
astronomy would not or for a long time
would not have been what it was
