00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.740
&gt;&gt; Hey Charles, how you doing?

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.740
&gt;&gt; I'm doing just fine Michael, how are you doing?

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.678
&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty well, thanks. I'm happy to

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:07.610
get a chance to tell you about something today.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.490
&gt;&gt; Excellent, and what is it you're going to tell me about?

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.530
&gt;&gt; We're going to talk about regression.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.520
&gt;&gt; Like, progression? [LAUGH].

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.290
&gt;&gt; No, regression. So, let me tell you

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.660
about regression. So we are, in this section of

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.240
the class, talking about supervised learning. And Supervised

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.970
learning, in supervised learning we can take examples of

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.280
inputs and outputs and based on that we are going to be

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.690
able to take a new input and predict the corresponding output for

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.400
that input, right. So this, this covers all of this, this the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.965
things we are talking about in the context of supervised learning, right.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:40.270
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.780
&gt;&gt; Now, what makes regression special subtopic.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.250
We are going to be talking about mapping

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.030
continuous inputs to outputs. As opposed to, what

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.920
was the other thing that we were mapping,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.910
what other kinds of outputs did we think about?

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.450
&gt;&gt; Well, we had discrete outputs and continuous outputs.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.590
&gt;&gt; Right, and so this is going to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.130
be the focus on continuous. So regression seems

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.780
like sort of an odd word. It doesn't really kind of fit for this. So often

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.750
I think about regression as. So this is, this is me being all sad and sort

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.970
of reverting back to a childhood state. And

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.990
that's, you know, that's in the psychological sense,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.480
that's what regression refers to. But it turns out that, that's not

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.920
what it means in this setting. But the story by which those

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.630
things became linked, I think, is kind of interesting. So let me

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.800
tell you about that. Okay. So, this is a picture of you Charles.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.230
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay. I'll accept that.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.000
&gt;&gt; You can tell it's you because he's really tall.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.090
And you're, you're a fairly tall man. I know you

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.670
don't think of yourself that way, but you think of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.720
everyone else as being short which is really the same thing.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.640
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.800
&gt;&gt; Alright, so let's say that this is Charles. Let's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.940
say that this is someone of average height. Just someone at random.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.330
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.790
&gt;&gt; So now, let's pretend, Charles, that you have children.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.370
&gt;&gt; I do have children.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.200
&gt;&gt; All right. So let's, that's okay but we can just pretend, and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.030
we want to ask the question what would you expect the average height

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.180
of your children to be? Would you expect it to be sort of,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.100
you know, sort of Charles' height? Or

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.220
average height or may be somewhere between.

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:10.430
So let's let's actually ask this as a quiz.
