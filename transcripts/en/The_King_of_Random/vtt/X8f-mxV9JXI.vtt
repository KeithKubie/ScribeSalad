00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.230
You can look, but don't touch.  These arcs of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.280
plasma are lethal enough to kill on contact!  In 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.040
this project we're using an old microwave oven 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.210
transformer to extract these traveling electric arcs.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.100
In a previous video, I found a microwave in my 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.090
neighbors garbage can, and salvaged this iron core 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.000
high voltage transformer.  This is heavy metal.  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.070
The primary winding is around 100 turns of 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.070
insulated wire, and there's somewhere around a 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.160
thousand on the secondary.  I'll pull these clips 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.000
off the primary to expose its 2 terminals, and 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.260
pull this middle wire out of the way because I 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.220
won't be using that.  I've got the secondary 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.060
winding connected to some 14 gauge wire and then 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.140
taped to a nail on the end of this wooden stick.  

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.120
This setup should insulate my body from the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.170
circuit.  The other end of the secondary winding 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.240
is grounded to the iron directly and when I put 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.230
power to it, I can draw out some high voltage 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.040
electrical arcs.  In order to get these arcs to 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.220
travel upward like this, I'll need to form a "V" 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.030
shaped spark gap.  I don't have any metal coat 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.140
hangers, but I have some un-insulated 14 gauge 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.190
copper wire that should work.  I'm cutting these 2 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.020
pieces roughly 2 feet long, and using this piece 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.220
of glass I salvaged from the door of the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.010
microwave.  Adding pressure and rolling the glass 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.030
back and forth seems to be an effective way to get 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.000
the kinks out.  3 inches of the wire is bent 90ยบ, 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.180
then folded back in half, and using pliers to bend 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.240
the tips over, it looks like this.  Holding 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.250
everything flat, I'll trim the tips, and curve 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.010
them over, and that's pretty much it.  This small 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.250
piece of wood should work well as a base for the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.100
spark gap, so two holes are drilled, and screws 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.130
added to hold the copper electrodes in place.  

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.250
This wire is soft, so I can easily form it into a 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.060
"V" shape, so that the closest contact points are 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.160
3/8" apart.  The top is just over 20 inches high 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.230
and about an inch wide.  To make this insulated 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.040
safety stick, I simply hammered a nail into the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.240
end of a wood 2x2, and proceed to cut the head off 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.040
using a hacksaw.  The MOT voltage isn't high 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.170
enough to jump a gap this wide, so the nail body 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290
will help it get started.  To add power, I'll use 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.000
the cord I scavenged from the microwave.  I've 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.040
added alligator clips to the wires, and made sure 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.060
the green wire is out of the way.  The black and 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.130
white get clipped onto the primary coil, and these 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.090
separate clips connect to the secondary winding 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.290
and the outside of the transformer body.  Now I 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.160
can plug the cord in, flip on the power, and with 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.190
one hand behind my back, aim this nail right 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.290
between the gap.  And there it goes!  This is 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.150
lethally high voltage, but not quite enough to 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.200
start on its own.  The electrode wires diverge at 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.080
a very slight angle, slowly stretching the arc as 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.110
it travels upward.  It's impressive how much it 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.260
grows at the top before it breaks.  Shaky wires 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.060
make the arc less stable, and cut out before 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.070
reaching the top.  I'm inside the house now to get 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.110
out of the wind, and when this one sparks, it 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.200
takes off like a rocket.  The unballasted arc 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.030
behaves almost like a short circuit, drawing power 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.220
until the arc snaps, or the circuit breaker pops.  

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.080
I can't think of any practical use for this.  It's 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.210
simply quenching my curiosity.   This airborne 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.190
electricity is rocketing upward because it's 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.010
heating the air around it, and the hot air rises.  

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.140
They might look harmless enough, but don't touch 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.180
because contact with the exposed high-voltage 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.240
conductors can be lethal.  That's why I have 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.050
gloves, and a safety stick.  I've just narrowed 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.160
the spark gap, and now when it shorts out, I've 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.030
captured a glowing orb of electricity.  I have to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.220
look away because of all the UV radiation flying 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.230
out of this thing.  I still have this high voltage 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.290
capacitor from a previous video and i'm wondering 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.040
what would happen if I added it in parallel with 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.120
the spark gap?  Let's find out.  Yikes!  That's 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.020
one supercharged spark.  Because this is indoors 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.130
it's easy to make this into an ozone generator!  

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.100
Right now, this is ionizing oxygen and nitrogen 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.090
into ozone and nitrous oxide gasses.  At least 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.160
until the breaker pops.  And perhaps that's a good 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.040
thing since the gas is poisonous.  Well I'm still 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.070
alive, so this is probably a good time to power 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.130
off and disconnect the cord.  It's extremely 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.000
important to safely discharge the capacitor before 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.020
I remove these lead wires, and put everything 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.180
away.  I can tell this transformer took some abuse 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.110
because it's extremely hot, and hard to hold onto.  

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.100
