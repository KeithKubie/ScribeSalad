1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.760
Jamie will be you telling me the Conor McGregor was mad at me for something.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.430
What were you saying?
I can pull up the video.
I guess.
What was he doing?

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.820
Is that illegal?
Are we allowed to see it?
Fine?
What did he say?

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.670
Something like a script.
I talk off script,

5
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.460
talk on script or call fights on a script or something.

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.640
That is not really true because no one ever gives me a script.
That's a fact.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.120
I mean,
I don't know what exactly he said,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.070
but maybe just didn't like my commentary.
I bet he likes it when he wins.
Right.

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.940
You know,
when you guys picture in your,
uh,
right here in the,

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.890
what do you call this place in the studio?

11
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.080
The actual quote is I'd like him to call a fight.

12
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:37.970
Always sees it correctly instead of reading off a script though.
Uh,
well that's,

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.670
that's,
that's,
you know,
that's his perception.
I understand what he's saying.

14
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.850
You all,
sometimes people think that,
but you know,

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.670
it's very difficult when someone's calling your fight.

16
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.610
If he's talking about me calling someone's fight that's not his friend,

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.320
then that,
that makes much more sense.
It's fucking hard,
man.
I,
it's hard for me.

18
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.610
It's a,
I have a really hard time calling friends fights.
It's fucking hard.

19
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.740
I don't know him that well,
but I like him a lot.

20
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.150
I respected fun to watch him fight.
That's for sure.
Do me to play the clip.
Yeah,

21
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:09.990
sure.
Go ahead.
Play it

22
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.430
<v 1>right.
He's got a great photo when things got crazy insight.
Great guests.</v>

23
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.090
Maybe it's [inaudible] you the flight haven't seasoned.

24
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:21.500
Correct.

25
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.500
[inaudible] he was leading up the worst flight.

26
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.720
The phasers guys slept for Mcgregor

27
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.930
the same way is too close and [inaudible] talks maybe until today.

28
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.640
So he's talking about there.

29
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.600
<v 0>Must have asked him if you do the podcast.
Yeah,
I kid his position.
Uh,</v>

30
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.030
you know that Dee has fight was good fucking fight,
man.
It's a hard fight.

31
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.740
I wasn't calling it like the last fight,

32
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.170
but I had to call it with the knowledge of the last fight.

33
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.470
I had to know what happened in the last fight.
In the last fight,

34
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.770
Diaz survived the storm,
tagged him,

35
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.810
hadn't Brockton then finished him on the ground.

36
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.860
It doesn't mean that he didn't win the second fight.
It was close fucking fight.

37
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.270
The second fight was a very close fight.

38
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:14.790
But you have to acknowledge that that of the fight took place.

39
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.120
So he also said it like with a smile.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You could tell the man.

40
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.520
I think that guy is one of the most dynamic individuals to ever compete in the

41
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.970
sport.
He's a special person.
Very special person.
Very unusual guy.

42
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:30.390
Even if he doesn't beat Khabib ever again,
or you know,

43
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:33.840
he loses to this guy loses to the Floyd Mayweather.
Lou,
who cares?

44
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.370
He's still one of a fucking billion human being.

45
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.680
He's an unusual guy.
The amount of electricity,
it's fucking good,

46
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:48.620
man.
He starched Josie Aldo was one of the greatest featherweights,

47
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.750
if not the greatest,
next to Max Holloway of all times.

48
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.760
Starched him with one punch.
When Aldo was Aldo,

49
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:57.480
Aldo was the fucking man.
I mean,
he was the man.

50
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.680
He was smashing everybody for years and Connor talks so much shit to him.

51
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.520
He climbed so deep inside his head and infuriated him to the point where we're

52
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.930
so emotional and he came charging at Connor and Connor just slipped back and

53
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.020
bank drop like the best one punch knockout in the history of the sport.

54
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.840
Oh no shit.
Oh,
100% because it was so significant.

55
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.230
There was so much hype behind it.
It,
it was a a guy.
We were like,

56
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.650
how good is this guy's this guy really the next big thing or is he going to fall

57
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.570
apart when he meets a real champion like Aldo?

58
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.610
And then he knocks him out with one fucking punch black.
It was crazy.

59
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:35.530
And then hammer fist annoys out when he's on the ground.

60
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:39.550
I mean it was definitive,
right?
14 seconds,

61
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.080
40 seconds to seconds of the first round.
He throws a hopping sidekick.

62
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.250
He's gaging the distance.

63
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:49.540
He's got like this karate stance and then he sees josé load up here.

64
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.374
You can watch it right here.

65
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.300
He sees Josie load up and when he sees Josie load up,
he,
he had this fight.

66
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:59.290
One Guy,
he had this fight one even before.
I mean,

67
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.980
he knew how it was going to go down.
He knew what all those going to do.

68
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:06.010
He was real emotional and angry,
so he knew he was going to come forward.

69
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.610
So he's gauging is distance.
Why pain?
See that Bam.

70
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.500
Oh,
the Friday one.
It's,
I mean,

71
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:18.640
that was like one of the most spectacular chaos in the history of the sport

72
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.610
because it had so much meaning to it.
It was so important.

73
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.400
It was for the featherweight champion of the world.

74
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.900
Conard already won the interim title him and although facing each other,

75
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:33.880
this big hype thing took her a year to put together crazy so that he's awesome.

76
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.110
Did you call that?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I think he's the only time I've ever yelled out.

77
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.530
He slept him when someone got cracked because it's just,

78
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.350
I don't even know why I said,
it's just like that's,
that's what came to my head.

79
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.720
I just,
I just yelled it out.
He said that's cause that's what he did.

80
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:47.320
He slept him.
