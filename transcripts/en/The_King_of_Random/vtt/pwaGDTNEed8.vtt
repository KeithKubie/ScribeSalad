00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.400
Most people know that metal coins won’t
float in water. But for this experiment I’m

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.540
going to show you a cool little trick, that’ll
make them look like they do.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.910
For this demonstration you’re going to need
a bowl water, and a handful of 1 yen coins.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.249
1 yen coins are kind of like Japanese pennies,
and there’s a good chance you can get some

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:22.070
if you’re really really nice, to your neighborhood,
Japanese exchange students.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.599
These common coins are around 2.5 times lighter
than our pennies, because they’re minted

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.009
from aluminum instead of zinc. But that doesn’t
mean they can float.

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.710
In fact if you try tossing a few into a bowl
of water, you’ll see they instantly sink

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.930
to the bottom, without hesitation.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.399
But to change all that, you just need one
small paperclip.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.879
Simply unfold the clip by bending the inner
part back until it makes an “L” shape,

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.289
then balance one of the coins on the larger
end, and use the other side as a handle to

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.519
slowly dip the coin into the water.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.820
Now pull the clip back out of the water, and
amazingly, the coin will be left floating

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.449
on top, almost like magic.

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.699
It’s kind of like the coin nestles itself
into some kind of invisible force field. Warping

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.960
the surface of the water, and denting it down.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.909
What’s really amazing is you can float as
many as you want all at the same time, as

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.950
long as they’ll fit in the bowl. But how
does this work?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.080
The answer, is surface tension.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.750
The attraction between the water molecules
at the surface, is just strong enough to support

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.360
the weight of an aluminum coin without letting
it break through. It’s kind of like a thin

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.340
elastic layer that covers the top.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.870
And it’s a very delicate balance. So as
you might imagine, adding just a touch more

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.910
pressure will break the layer for a second,
and let the coins drop back to the bottom again.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.250
Now let’s explore this phenomenon a little
further, and watch what happens if we sprinkle

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.240
pepper flakes on the water first.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.670
This time as the weight of the coin warps
the water, you can see the closest flakes

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.200
immediately begin attracting toward it, then
stick to the sides.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.680
The mass of the coin creates enough of a disturbance
that any flakes within range eventually get

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.280
sucked toward it, until they collide and become
part of the system. Which is the way some

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.430
people say gravity works.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.170
That could be the case, because if you try
placing a few coins in close proximity, the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.860
two masses immediately gravitate toward each
other, until they impact, and snap together like magnets.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.630
Now if you really want to try this trick but
can’t find any aluminum coins, don’t worry.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.830
You can still use things like paperclips,
pins, needles and even staples. They’ll

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.509
all work just as well, even though they’re
made of steel, and nearly 3 times heavier than aluminum.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.129
Use the same paperclip trick from before,
to quickly and easily set your metal bits floating on their own.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.730
And if you’re careful and have a large enough
dish, you might even be able to get the entire

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.290
box of paperclips, floating at once.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.950
Now the idea of floating paperclips isn’t
new, and some of your friends might think

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.040
they’re smart because they already know
how it works.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.150
So if you want to mess with their heads a
bit, just pour in a few drops of dish soap

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.710
when they’re not looking.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.000
Soap breaks up the surface tension of the
water, and weakens the hydrogen bonds, which

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.260
means your victim won’t be able to get a
single paperclip to float, no matter how many

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.160
times they try, or how slowly and carefully,
the paperclips are set into place.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.510
Well now you know a cool little trick you
can try at home, at school, or the office,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.650
to impress friends and co-workers, by making
random bits of metal, float on water.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.180
That’s it for now. If you liked this experiment,
perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
