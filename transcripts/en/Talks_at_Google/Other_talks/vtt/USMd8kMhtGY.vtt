00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:03.210
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
for coming out today

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.280
during this wonderful
[INAUDIBLE] week.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.109
Both part of this fall's
lineup at the NYU Skirball

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.020
Center for the Performing
Arts, the Heidi Latsky Dance

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.250
and Pilobolus, are here
to perform for you today.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.300
And to start us off we have
two performers from Pilobolus

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.230
who are doing an excerpt
from their show Shadowland.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.640
Pilobolus will be performing
the full North American

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.220
premiere of the full event for
three weeks from November 20

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.730
to December 6.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.450
And they're actually
going to perform it twice

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.440
today because they want you
all to sit in the center

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.780
section for the beginning
so you can see the shadows,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.822
and then we're going to
shift everybody to the sides

00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:45.030
so you can then see how they
do it behind the scenes.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.571
And they'll do the
whole thing again.

00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:49.460
It's only a few
minutes, so it's not

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.230
going to be doing a great long
performance for you twice.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260
It is great, though.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.180
So yes, please welcome
Heather and Nate.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.152
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:13.160
MALE SPEAKER: All right, now
everybody move to the sides

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.020
and you'll get to see this from
a completely different angle,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.968
which I think is
really interesting.

00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:22.459
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:23.662 --> 00:09:27.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.150
MALE SPEAKER: Next up, in
honor of the 25th anniversary

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.630
of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, Heidi Latsky

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.500
dance will perform
an evening of dance

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.200
featuring diverse
unconventional performers

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.160
on Sunday, November 15.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.250
Now please welcome
Alexandria, Saki, Jillian,

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.430
Jerron, and Meredith.

00:10:03.762 --> 00:10:05.754
[MUSIC  PLAYING]

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:24.814
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:24.814 --> 00:20:26.480
MALE SPEAKER: Another
round of applause.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:26.980
Yay.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.536
All right.

00:20:29.536 --> 00:20:33.070
So both of your dance troupes
are part of the NYU Skirball

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.120
Center for the Performing Arts.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.410
The season for 2015 here.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.050
So the Center for
the Performing Arts

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.910
is a premier venue
for the presentation

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.530
of cultural and
performing arts events

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.567
down at New York University
in lower Manhattan.

00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:51.650
So the Skirball mission
is to showcase and support

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.170
diverse and eclectic talent
from around the world, which

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.010
both of you guys and your
dance troupes obviously do.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.020
And it cultivates audiences
for live performance

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.330
through deeper
engagement opportunities.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:07.130
So the Skirball lineup
has theatre, film, dance,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.940
and dialogue.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.180
First of all, you two
introduce yourselves, but then

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.580
tell us how your various
troupes became involved

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.860
with the Skirball Center.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.824
HEIDI LATSKY: I'm Heidi Latsky.

00:21:19.824 --> 00:21:21.740
I've been talking to
Michael Harrington, who's

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.380
the producer there,
and we were going

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.440
to do something this season.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.107
And then he actually wanted to
push the company back a year,

00:21:32.107 --> 00:21:33.690
so we were going to
do it next season.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.980
And I called him up,
and I said, you know,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.520
it's the 25th
anniversary of the ADA,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.490
so 2015 would be
such a good year

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.671
to celebrate diversity
and inclusion.

00:21:46.671 --> 00:21:48.170
MALE SPEAKER: ADA
is the Americans--

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.310
HEIDI LATSKY: The Americans
with Disabilities Act,

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.360
which you talked about before.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.082
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:54.082 --> 00:21:55.540
HEIDI LATSKY: What's
interesting is

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.250
there's a beautiful dance
company out west called Axis,

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.120
and they've been around
a really long time doing

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.600
physically integrated work.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.130
And so he put the two companies
together for this program.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.975
So I think it's really
remarkable, actually.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.150
ITAMAR KUBOVY: Hi,
I'm Itamar Kubovy.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:19.680
I'm the executive
producer of Pilobolus.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.400
Our relationship
with Skirball really

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.670
had to do initially with
looking to bring the show

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.550
Shadowland to New
York, and wanting

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.540
to find the perfect place
to do it, which we did.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.540
And Michael, and the rest
of the team at Skirball,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.830
and we got together about
six, eight months ago

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.750
and talked about
what we might do,

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.870
and decided that this
was the right way

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.940
to bring the show into New York.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.810
It's been performing for the
last chunk of time in Europe

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.400
and in Asia, and has never been
done in North America before.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.830
So it's super exciting for
us to bring the show home

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.856
after having it seen by
so many people that are

00:22:59.856 --> 00:23:04.747
our same sort of home audience.

00:23:04.747 --> 00:23:06.330
MALE SPEAKER: So was
it developed here

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.055
or was it developed
overseas, Shadowland?

00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:09.930
ITAMAR KUBOVY: Shadowland
was developed here.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.620
It had a sort of
funny beginning.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.480
We were asked to make a
commercial-- a television

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.780
commercial-- for a Hyundai car.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.880
And the request
came in that said,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.420
could you guys make a car
commercial with no car in it?

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.340
And we thought, OK, we'll try
to put a light behind a shower

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.680
curtain and see what happens.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.980
And it turned out that
we were able to create

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.260
a convincing sort
of transformation

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.177
of this car in this commercial.

00:23:37.177 --> 00:23:38.760
And then we got a
call from the Oscars

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.260
shortly after that
saying, could you

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.600
do the same for the movies
that were nominated this year?

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.460
And suddenly we realized that
this weird advertising inquiry

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.300
turned into an enormously
intense creative project.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.980
MALE SPEAKER: How
long ago was this?

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.813
ITAMAR KUBOVY: This was
about six years ago,

00:23:53.813 --> 00:23:55.207
the first commercial.

00:23:55.207 --> 00:23:57.290
And that was the time that
we sort of rediscovered

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:59.730
this kind of modern form
of shadow theater, which

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.820
of course has existed forever.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.420
But this was a way of combining
full bodies and this kind

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.490
of mixture of graphic and very
plastic work, where you're

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.000
seeing the bodies,
but you're also

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.330
seeing the images that these
bodies can merge to create.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.460
It's like that very
rare moment where

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.360
you stumble into something
and you, go wait a minute.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.790
This is not just a piece,
this is not just an idea,

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.490
it's actually sort
of a form that you

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.730
can work in for a long time.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.730
And so it doesn't happen
very often that you

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:34.980
bump into something like that.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.580
It's been very
exciting to work in.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.366
MALE SPEAKER: So is
this kind of something

00:24:39.366 --> 00:24:40.740
that has just
fallen in your lap,

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.680
as you said, but taken you to
a new level of recognition?

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.360
Because performing
on the Oscars, right?

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.580
And you've done a collaboration
with Penn and Teller,

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.410
I believe, and
some other people.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:57.960
So is this, sort of, breathed
new life into the program,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.799
or is this something--

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.590
ITAMAR KUBOVY: Yes.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.350
The answer is yes.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.570
MALE SPEAKER: My question
is, how does this

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.330
compare to your
traditional dance theater

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.220
that you've always
been doing ongoing?

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.900
ITAMAR KUBOVY: You
know, it's interesting,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.858
because in some sense
it's completely different

00:25:09.858 --> 00:25:12.540
because it's obviously making
shadows behind a screen

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.870
and doing some of the
stuff that you saw.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.550
But in other ways, the
company for 44 years

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.940
has been committed to mixing
bodies together and move

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.920
from inanimate to
animate-type objects that are

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.210
sort of merged and separated.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.910
So you see something
that looks suddenly

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.110
like a creature that exists,
that's made out of five people.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.920
And then they all come
apart, and now you

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.750
see each individuated
form as a human being.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.900
And so in some sense,
the big theme--

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.480
the big idea-- has stayed
consistent all along,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.450
but the manifestation,
or the application,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:48.190
of the idea to a medium, or
a form, that's brand new.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.580
And certainly has been
accessible to a brand

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.480
new audience around
the world in a way

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.920
that modern dance isn't
always necessarily accessible

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920
to as broad an audience.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.600
So its brought a lot of
new people to see us.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.710
MALE SPEAKER: So Heidi, you
and your wonderful dancers

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.505
as well, you guys are still
more of the traditional--

00:26:08.505 --> 00:26:11.420
I say "traditional"
modern dance,

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.920
but yet you've
incorporated-- obviously

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.080
there is Alexandria at
the end who is deaf.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.520
We have a dancer who
is deaf, and then

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.240
other people in your
troupe have disabilities.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.194
Is that bringing the
future into the present,

00:26:25.194 --> 00:26:27.610
or would you call that bringing
the past into the present?

00:26:29.499 --> 00:26:31.040
HEIDI LATSKY: That's
a hard question.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.590
We were just talking about this.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.390
I would say we're very
nontraditional, even

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.045
in the traditional mode, like
what you're talking about.

00:26:42.045 --> 00:26:44.530
And actually, we've
been exploring

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.550
less traditional ways of opening
this company to the public.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.370
Like we're doing these movement
installations, one of which

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.380
we're going to do at Skirball.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:58.420
We just did one in the
atrium at Lincoln Center.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.520
Also I made a film last year.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.760
I was commissioned by
Montclair State University,

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.680
and so we're trying
to expand out.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:11.160
Because in our case anyway,
that's our initiative.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:16.500
Because we are a nontraditional
cast, and our mission

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.680
is to redefine beauty, and
virtuosity, and also dance.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.937
We just keep trying to find
those venues to promote

00:27:25.937 --> 00:27:27.020
the work that we're doing.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.660
Because oftentimes,
especially in the dance world,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.300
you tell people you
have an integrated cast,

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.200
or some people
with disabilities,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.510
nontraditional,
unconventional dancers,

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.146
and they shy away from it.

00:27:41.146 --> 00:27:42.020
MALE SPEAKER: Really?

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.092
HEIDI LATSKY: Yes.

00:27:43.092 --> 00:27:43.800
Wouldn't you say?

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.944
MALE SPEAKER: So what
are the critics--

00:27:49.944 --> 00:27:51.360
HEIDI LATSKY: If
you tell somebody

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.160
you're a physically
integrated company,

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.060
most people call it
"mixed ability" company,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.310
which we can't stand,
because it infers

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.690
that there are
different abilities,

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.880
which we know that's not true.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.680
But normally, people
would associate a company

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.480
like this with people
who are wheelchair users.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.550
That's an automatic assumption,
which as you can see,

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.856
that's not the case.

00:28:17.856 --> 00:28:19.730
Not that we don't work
with wheelchair users,

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.727
we do, but it's not
always the case.

00:28:22.727 --> 00:28:24.060
You were going to say something.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.810
MALE SPEAKER: I don't remember
what I was going to say.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:25.540
HEIDI LATSKY: Did I cut you off?

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.810
MALE SPEAKER: No, no.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.550
We're here to hear you talk.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.800
HEIDI LATSKY: I will say
it's been a great year for us

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:36.980
because we have these
presenters now like Skirball.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.670
Like Michael Harrington
inviting us to do Skirball.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:43.290
Or being at Montclair State, or
at the American Dance Festival,

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.350
which are more
traditional venues.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:51.652
And so it feels like
we're breaking through.

00:28:51.652 --> 00:28:53.860
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so I want
to actually get over here

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.126
to the dancers and let
some of you folks talk.

00:28:56.126 --> 00:28:57.500
Will you mind
going down the line

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.170
and introducing
yourselves as well?

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.500
NATE BUCHSBAUM: I'm Nate.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.890
HEATHER FAVRETTO:
I'm Heather Favretto.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.719
JERRON HERMAN: Herman.

00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:08.760
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER:
I'm Alexandria Wailes.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.360
JILLIAN HOLLIS:
I'm Jillian Hollis.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.080
MEREDITH FAGES: Meredith Fages.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.770
SAKI MASUDA: Saki Masuda.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.170
XIMENA BORGES:
I'm Ximena Borges,

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.490
and I'm the composer for
Heidi Latsky's piece.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:21.447
And music director.

00:29:21.447 --> 00:29:23.030
MALE SPEAKER: And
music director, yes.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.397
So the collaborative process.

00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:26.980
I want to talk about
the collaboration

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.150
between the dancers and
the executive directors

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.270
and the choreographers.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.350
When you guys are coming
up with new material,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:40.680
especially the both of you
have such unique, I guess, set

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.870
of skills is not
what I want to say.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.570
It's like the shadow
theatre is so unique,

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:50.340
and having individuals living
with disabilities is unique

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:54.580
in itself, that you've got
a very popular dance troupe.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.470
So when it comes to
the collaboration,

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.960
coming up with new pieces, do
both of you start with an idea

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.260
and fit into the dancers,
or work with the dancers

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.405
and fit it to the idea?

00:30:09.194 --> 00:30:10.610
ITAMAR KUBOVY: I
think when people

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.370
make things, they-- my
experience has been we

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.360
collaborate with a lot of
people in diverse disciplines

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.230
that aren't dance.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.850
We worked a lot with MIT in
their robotics department,

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.300
and we worked a lot with
puppeteers and magicians.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.424
We did a piece with Penn
and Teller recently.

00:30:29.424 --> 00:30:30.840
And what you realize
by seeing how

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.400
all people from all sorts
of disciplines create,

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.220
you realize that whether
they're engineers,

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.680
or whether they're dancers,
the process of making something

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.050
is reasonably similar
across the board.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.420
And it has to do with a
process that's iterative.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.350
And that you start with
where you know, and you

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.540
keep chipping away at what you
don't know until you realize

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.240
that you've gotten somewhere.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.830
So in a way, we're
constantly working both

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.030
of those ends of that question.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.170
You can't tell a story that you
can't make interesting images

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.150
for in shadow.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.560
You can't do that.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.100
And at the same
time, you don't know

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.900
what images to make until
you've got a story in mind

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.270
or an idea in mind.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.830
And so we're always telling
each other the same story over,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.280
and over, and over again
as we chip it forward

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.800
until we finally have something
that starts making sense

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.910
to everybody.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.580
I don't know if
that explains it,

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.740
but it really does go
from both directions.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.323
MALE SPEAKER: In an
artistic way, yes,

00:31:28.323 --> 00:31:31.350
I think it perfectly
explains it.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:36.930
ITAMAR KUBOVY: In my case, when
I started my company in 2001,

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.830
I was the material.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.600
So that all the material,
all the choreography,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.590
started from my body.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.440
And sometimes it still does.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.090
And actually in Somewhere we
did take a phrase of mine.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.220
But when I started
in 2006 working

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.790
with people with disabilities,
it became clear to me

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.690
that that was just
not going to work.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.400
And it wasn't even
interesting to go that way.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.500
And so even though
with the material might

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.240
start with my body, it always
evolved with every dancer

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:08.980
I've worked with.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.520
And my interest has always been
in seeing where they take it,

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.690
and then making it
better because it's

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:21.450
somebody else's interpretation.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.810
My process really
changed a lot in 2006

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.460
because I couldn't
do that anymore.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:32.000
And then I'm just not interested
in that anymore, to be honest.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.340
In Somewhere we used
a phrase of mine,

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.860
but then it just went
all over the place.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.960
And I do want to
talk about the score

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.350
because this was a really
intense collaboration

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.760
between me and Ximena.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.540
And I actually think you
should talk about it.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.248
You OK with that?

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.380
XIMENA BORGES: Well this piece
had a difference score, which

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.490
is what made it even harder.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.430
Because we were
starting with a piece

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.680
that had already been
created for different music,

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.690
and everybody, the dancers, were
used to the different music.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.510
So already starting
to change that

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:13.420
was very difficult to
adjust for everyone.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.320
Right?

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.460
And also because the mood
that Heidi wanted to create

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.980
was so opposite what
the other score was.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.460
The other score was about
eight or 10 versions

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.390
of the song Somewhere
Over the Rainbow.

00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:31.960
HEIDI LATSKY: That's
quite the task, right?

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.890
Taking Somewhere
Over the Rainbow

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.630
and then creating something.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.060
XIMENA BORGES: And then
also I compose music

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.100
with only my voice,
and Heidi kept

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.480
wanting for it to not
sound like anything.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.750
So anything that I did
that was percussive,

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.950
that was like
[PERCUSSIVE NOISES] she's like,

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.390
it sounds like you're saying
this, or you're saying that.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.931
So I was totally stuck because
I'm like, well, it's my voice,

00:33:54.931 --> 00:33:58.250
so it's always going to sound
like I'm saying something.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.120
So I had to transform
my voice with effects

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.392
to such degree where you
couldn't recognize it,

00:34:03.392 --> 00:34:04.850
except for maybe
one part where you

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.225
recognize me saying ha ha ha.

00:34:06.225 --> 00:34:07.850
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, so
what we just heard

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.649
was all coming out
of your throat?

00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:10.440
XIMENA BORGES: Yes.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.327
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:34:11.327 --> 00:34:12.281
HEIDI LATSKY: Incredible, right?

00:34:12.281 --> 00:34:13.364
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, right?

00:34:13.364 --> 00:34:17.060
AUDIENCE: Can you do it again?

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.469
MALE SPEAKER: Can you
do it again, he asked.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.909
XIMENA BORGES: I can't do
it all at the same time.

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:25.330
There's a million
layers in there.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.239
So the processes
was very difficult

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:30.330
because we are all so
used to this other score.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.909
And it just took a
long time for all of us

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:34.699
to get used to it
because we realized

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.030
that even if the
music on its own

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.560
worked, if the dancers weren't
really comfortable with it,

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.469
and settled into this new
music, and into this new feel

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.870
for the piece, the
music didn't work.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.699
So it had to come
from both sides, where

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:54.050
the music had to be something
and then the dancers had

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.100
to be part of that too
so that together it would

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.820
be what Heidi wanted it to be.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.760
MALE SPEAKER: Huh.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.500
So are any of you guys dancers
for these troupes full-time,

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.600
or do you all have-- yes?

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.462
Yeah?

00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:09.170
You're full time?

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.760
OK.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.360
So for the Pilobolus,
Nate and Heather,

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.170
you guys have traveled all over
the world with the show, yeah?

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:16.525
HEATHER FAVRETTO: Yeah.

00:35:16.525 --> 00:35:17.316
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:35:17.316 --> 00:35:18.330
NATE BUCHSBAUM: Yeah.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.240
MALE SPEAKER: I mean, what
kind of life is that like?

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.320
Do you guys enjoy this?

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.950
Do you go home at the end
of the day, you're like,

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.330
I love my shadow performing.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.250
It's so great.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.730
HEATHER FAVRETTO: Yes.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.670
Oh my gosh, we have the
best job in the world.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.950
No, we've spent a lot of time
in Germany, and in Europe.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.880
And we've been lucky enough, we
had a great tour in Australia

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.320
last summer, and been
down in Brazil and Chile.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.670
And it's really cool to see how
audiences respond to this work

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.760
everywhere.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.090
Some places the audience
is filled with children,

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:50.160
some places it's mostly adults.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.720
And just the way that we can
animate ourselves to be larger

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.070
than life in shadow, and
how impactful that is,

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:02.080
and how people can relate
to this weird animal girl

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.460
character.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.820
MALE SPEAKER: How long have
you been doing the animal?

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.070
HEATHER FAVRETTO: 3 1/2 years.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:07.945
MALE SPEAKER: Oh wow.

00:36:07.945 --> 00:36:10.010
HEATHER FAVRETTO: Yeah.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.880
But it's cool.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.500
It's great.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.458
I mean, we miss our
families, but we've kind of

00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:17.740
created a family on the road.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.010
Christmases together,
Thanksgivings.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.910
MALE SPEAKER: How big
is the whole troupe?

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.910
HEATHER FAVRETTO: The
cast is nine dancers.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:29.410
And when we go a long
tour we travel with 12.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:32.180
And uniquely, all of us
know two or three roles,

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.080
so we rotate in case
people get injured.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.500
Since we're
traveling, people want

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.980
a day off to see Munich, or
London, or wherever we are.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.560
So it works out
really cool that way.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.810
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, that's neat.

00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:47.620
The rest of you haven't
introduced yourselves yet.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.180
Come on, let's hear it.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.550
JILLIAN HOLLIS: So I've been
dancing with Heidi since 2002,

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.200
a year after the
company started.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.490
So a very long time.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:00.790
And I've been able to see
the company grow and expand

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.480
to where it is now
is kind of amazing.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.065
And we've had a really
great year of steady work.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.790
Most of us dance
for other groups,

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.750
but this is my priority.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:22.400
But I do, like, Cabaret Life,
and I'm a Pilates teacher,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.620
so I'm full-time
committed to Heidi

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:30.080
and we rehearse three times a
week when we are in session,

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.580
I guess.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.692
When we have something
that we're working towards.

00:37:33.692 --> 00:37:35.400
MALE SPEAKER: How
often does that happen?

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.287
Do you go into rehearsals
on a set schedule

00:37:37.287 --> 00:37:38.120
every couple months?

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.745
JILLIAN HOLLIS: We
have a set schedule.

00:37:39.745 --> 00:37:42.390
So usually we have a time
frame, Monday, Wednesday,

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.540
Friday, that we
are committed to.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.740
MALE SPEAKER: Cool
So we actually

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.540
have two microphones in
the aisles if any of you

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.210
have questions for
anybody up here.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:38:04.970
To Alexandria
specifically here, I

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.640
guess what made you decide
to want to start dancing

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.450
in the first place?

00:38:09.971 --> 00:38:11.470
SIGN LANGUAGE
INTERPRETER: I started

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.300
dancing when I was around two.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.960
It was just in my
lifeblood growing up.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.940
I went to college at
University of the Arts.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.090
I have a bachelor's
degree in dance.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:25.120
And then after college I
was trying to find myself,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.120
and then I got more
involved with acting,

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:33.290
and really immersed in acting
on Broadway, and TV, and film.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.356
But dance was always in
my soul and something

00:38:35.356 --> 00:38:36.980
I really wanted to
pursue, but I didn't

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.140
have as many opportunities
until I met Heidi and I started

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.630
working with them in 2013.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.720
And I was one of the new
members at that time.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.280
I was really enjoying being
involved with that company.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.220
The constant
exploration of stillness

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.800
at the same time
exploring virtuosity

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.270
and whatever that might mean.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.530
But I'm always feeling
that I'm being challenged

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.230
in the best sense possible.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.020
You see something and Heidi
really pushes us to keep going

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.270
and explore that even further.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.010
So that's something I really
enjoy, that stimulation.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.300
And when I'm not dancing,
and when I'm not in a show,

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.110
if I'm not rehearsing, I'm
actually a museum educator.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:19.160
And I work for four different
museums here around the city.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:19.827
Doing freelance.

00:39:19.827 --> 00:39:21.784
HEIDI LATSKY: Tell what's
she doing now though.

00:39:21.784 --> 00:39:23.830
MALE SPEAKER: And so what
else are you doing now?

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.369
You're an understudy, correct?

00:39:25.369 --> 00:39:26.660
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.390
So I'm actually involved as
the associate choreographer

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.800
for the Broadway
show Spring Awakening

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.290
that's on Broadway right now.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:37.110
And I'm also an understudy
for Marlee Matlin

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.768
in that performance.

00:39:38.768 --> 00:39:40.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.410
MALE SPEAKER: So what are
the biggest challenges

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:46.618
for you learning a new piece?

00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:50.830
If you can't hear the music
like the rest of the cast,

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.530
how do you keep the time,
and what cues do you use?

00:39:55.641 --> 00:39:57.640
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER:
Well, with rehearsal.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.530
You know, that's what
rehearsals are for.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:03.390
Generally it's not just
for learning the movements.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.060
You have muscle memory that
can really help with that.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.490
And I think that musicality,
anyone has musicality.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:12.770
We all have that.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:17.370
It really depends on how much
musicality one might have,

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.710
is regardless of whether or
not you're deaf or hearing.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.790
I have a lot of hearing
friends who can't move,

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.082
who can't dance, who can't sing.

00:40:24.082 --> 00:40:27.680
I'm thinking, gee, you
know, you're hearing,

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.580
you must automatically
be able to do

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.390
certain things that rely
on your hearing, which

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:33.730
isn't really true.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:37.210
And so in terms of music,
it's very strong vibrations,

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:38.160
frequency.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.427
You can feel these elements
in the environment.

00:40:41.427 --> 00:40:43.260
And I think I just
happened to be maybe more

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.920
aware on a whole body level.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.420
There are some notes that are
higher I might not necessarily

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.380
be able to feel them, but I
rely on visual cues as well.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.110
I memorize the pieces, I
memorized the movement,

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.770
so I know it's my turn.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.950
I am attuned to the lighting,
how that lighting changes,

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:02.530
and that's also a cue.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:03.910
And the other dancers around me.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:04.630
And rehearsal.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.340
I mean, really that's
a strong element of it.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.440
It's part of that
process for any of us.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.740
MALE SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.840
Question over here?

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.780
AUDIENCE: Hi, this is
[INAUDIBLE] performance.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.930
I'm an attest to your comment.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.890
As much as I enjoy music,
I'm zero talent singing.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.140
It just doesn't work that way.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.280
But I have question for the
performers with disabilities.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.510
This is going to be a
very Google-y question.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.610
We have a lot of conversations
about, for example,

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.080
women at tech.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.435
Since they're minorities,
how are they going to evolve?

00:41:35.435 --> 00:41:36.560
How are they going to lead?

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.700
How are they going to overcome
the problems for other women

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.210
to come up?

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.290
So you as professional
performers,

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.350
do you feel that you
have that obligation

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:48.190
to not only bring
yourself up, but also

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:52.040
pave the way for other talented
performers such as yourself

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.390
to have a chance to be
able to show what they have

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:56.430
and what they can bring?

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.632
Like the beautiful pieces
you guys performed.

00:41:58.632 --> 00:42:00.090
I've never seen
anything like that.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:01.920
And I'm a better person
just seeing that.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.290
So do you feel that
obligation, or do you feel just

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:08.130
you have to focus on
being a success story,

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.242
and then everything
else falls in place?

00:42:10.242 --> 00:42:11.950
JERRON HERMAN: I think
I have a response,

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.150
because I was invited to dance.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:23.360
I came to the city to write the
next great American musical,

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.660
which is still going to happen.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.930
I hadn't thought of dance.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.560
It was on my radar.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.720
And so when I was
invited to meet Heidi

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.580
from another
choreographer, and just

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.356
to kind of serendipitous
path that I was on,

00:42:41.356 --> 00:42:45.670
I saw an opportunity that
wasn't first given to me.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.020
I think a lot of
my creative outlet

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.320
was because it wasn't in
the vanguard for me to dance

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.790
or for me you have
a visible performer,

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:57.860
so I relegated myself
to the background.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.630
However, now I do feel a
great sense of pride first,

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:09.550
and ability first, and
then a sense of obligation.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:14.125
My goal now is for my
type to be saturated

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:18.120
in the airwaves
and the atmosphere

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.490
because it's so underdeveloped,
or underrepresented.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:23.490
So I do feel that sense.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.031
And as a person of
color too, I think

00:43:25.031 --> 00:43:30.370
there's this compounded view of
that because I know that there

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:34.620
aren't a lot of African American
people with disabilities on TV

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.120
as well.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.130
So there's, like,
this other thing.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.770
But that is all
to say that I find

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.910
the company to be a
great playground for all

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.450
of my questions.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.820
I grew up not really
in my community.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.540
And so it's really
great that I'm

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.160
now in the disability
community and taking

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.230
a really active role.

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.470
Because it is part of me.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.730
SIGN LANGUAGE
INTERPRETER: And I also, I

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.720
don't think that it's
an obligation, per se.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.580
Not even a duty, necessarily.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.550
But I just still feel
it's part of the journey.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:12.760
I do feel that it is
important to prove

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.020
that not only to yourself,
but also to society,

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.400
and increase the visibility
and encourage opening

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.102
the door for other people.

00:44:21.102 --> 00:44:22.560
There is definitely
a lot of talent

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.480
that's not being recognized
and being encouraged.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.370
It's not just one
person who's obligated.

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.190
It does take everyone
to be involved.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.730
So I feel like all
of these people

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:36.720
here, when people witness
and watch our show,

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:42.100
they're seeing both disability
and non-disabled people working

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.710
together.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.070
And there's a
bigger vision here.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:50.610
And that really shows
what's possible.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.296
Flexibility.

00:44:51.296 --> 00:44:54.030
A lot people sometimes are
not sure what to do with you.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.030
What to do with me.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.220
They'll think that's
a disabled person.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.350
But there's so many different
ways to make it work.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:00.790
And it's not that big of a deal.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.790
So you just have to honor
what needs to happen

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:03.998
as being part of the process.

00:45:03.998 --> 00:45:05.770
But other than that,
you just go with it.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.150
And I've noticed that
has been really powerful.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.400
People really respond to
that process, the visibility.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.350
And I agree with
Jerron is saying

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:17.080
in terms of artists
of color as well,

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.690
to increase that visibility.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:21.710
And as a woman as well.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.840
So that's sort of a
triple whammy there.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.144
So yes, we do feel sometimes
like we want to just sort of,

00:45:29.144 --> 00:45:31.310
why bother, you know, and
give up and throw our arms

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.300
up in the air sometimes, because
it can be really frustrating.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.900
But to recognize
that we are making

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.350
strides in increasing
visibility,

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:40.150
and it's a moment
by moment change.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:43.070
Like Heidi said, for the
company it's been a great year,

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.350
and also for me too, it's
been an excellent year.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:49.080
I've just been very,
very busy as an artist.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.320
I've gone through some long
dry spells of lots of auditions

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.210
and not having very much
going on for myself,

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.870
so you just have to
kind of roll with it.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.494
That's part of the
business in general,

00:45:57.494 --> 00:45:59.067
and that's applicable to anyone.

00:45:59.067 --> 00:45:59.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.304
Thank you so much.

00:46:01.304 --> 00:46:02.970
MALE SPEAKER: So how
would you recommend

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.594
that we spread the word?

00:46:04.594 --> 00:46:06.510
I mean, do you have
educational opportunities?

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.110
Do you have volunteer
opportunities?

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:08.795
How do we get involved?

00:46:08.795 --> 00:46:10.128
How do we let other people know?

00:46:14.083 --> 00:46:15.249
HEIDI LATSKY: More specific?

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.200
MALE SPEAKER: If I wanted to
get involved and help raise

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.610
awareness for either
of your troupes, or do

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.810
you have classes that you
teach when people want

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.560
to get involved in dancing.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.950
If someone may
have disabilities,

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.116
if they don't know where
to start, where do they go?

00:46:36.402 --> 00:46:38.360
HEIDI LATSKY: I don't
teach on a regular basis,

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.370
although we are starting--
the DOE is very interested now

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:46.972
in getting us into the schools.

00:46:46.972 --> 00:46:48.180
MALE SPEAKER: Public schools?

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.340
HEIDI LATSKY:
Public schools, yes.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.340
So Jerron is teaching
there right now, actually,

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.300
in one school.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:56.170
And we're working
on a whole workshop

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:59.340
to maybe be an
annual thing, or just

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.820
to get this work into
the schools, which

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.160
I think is desperately needed.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:09.300
We have a website, people
can contact us at any time.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.810
We don't have a school but
we're always rehearsal,

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.290
and we're actually
always looking

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:18.390
for performers and for people
to support our movement,

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.280
because I do feel
like it's a movement.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.660
When you're asking the
people with disabilities

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:29.010
I feel like this company, and
me specifically, since 2006

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.250
I've become more and
more of an advocate.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:36.300
And I wouldn't say it's as
an advocate for disability,

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:40.761
but it's really for-- we coined
it-- the beauty of difference,

00:47:40.761 --> 00:47:41.260
right?

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.070
The beauty of the individual.

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:46.460
And that's really become
very important to us all.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.730
So we encourage
people, we welcome

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:52.440
people to become
part of the process,

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.257
support us in this mission.

00:47:55.257 --> 00:47:56.840
MALE SPEAKER: Does
Pilobolus, you guys

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.530
have-- you guys teach
workshops, right?

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:00.279
ITAMAR KUBOVY: We teach
quite a bit, yeah.

00:48:00.279 --> 00:48:04.860
And I think we actually have a
program on the road as we tour,

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:08.090
and in Connecticut,
where our studio is

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:11.680
during the summers,
where we essentially

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.920
look for non-dancers and put
them together with dancers

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.690
in a creative process workshop.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.660
And we work with
multi-generational groups,

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.340
and people who have
very little ability

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.440
to do acrobatics, but
then have a huge ability

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.130
to do all sorts of other
things that mixed together

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:35.184
with difference allows for
great things to happen.

00:48:35.184 --> 00:48:36.350
So we do that in the summer.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:39.320
And all the information
there is also on our website.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.860
And the Ford Foundation
has been supporting us

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.530
over the last couple of years
to bring that programming

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:47.380
to different cities where
we're going to perform.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.710
And around the country in the
US, we show up in a week early

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:54.660
and then reach out to a whole
bunch of different groups,

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:58.110
and sort of introduce them
to give them a, sort of,

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:02.500
an immersive sense in what
it is that we do and we do a.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.035
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:49:04.035 --> 00:49:06.185
Question over here.

00:49:06.185 --> 00:49:08.044
AUDIENCE: That was
really fascinating.

00:49:08.044 --> 00:49:10.085
I didn't read the fine
print of the announcement,

00:49:10.085 --> 00:49:12.210
and so I didn't realize
until you got up here

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:16.790
that it was troupe
with disabilities.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.910
That was a really
interesting experience.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:25.400
And I guess also
my wife is deaf,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.610
I know a tiny, tiny
bit of sign language.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:31.250
Not very good about that.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.890
But I did pick up
some of that, and I

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:37.105
was curious what was being
said there in the performance.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:45.440
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER:
So I'm talking to Garret

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.870
and I was wondering if he
understood what I was saying.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.440
And I was actually
signing the lyrics

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.689
to Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:55.860
Yeah, but actually
understand the process

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.910
was that when Heidi and I
collaborate, and we were

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.920
discussing it,
she asked me to do

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.030
an ASL translation of the song.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:07.120
And then I went back to
the beginning of the lyrics

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:13.530
and I was creating, an
accumulation of the vocabulary.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:16.940
So this is first, and then
second, and then third.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.140
And so I was sort of
accumulating the vocabulary,

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.510
and then I was just
turning up to speed.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:24.010
So from the beginning
to the very end

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:25.930
I was signing the
lyrics of the song.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.964
And I was incorporating
the movement as well.

00:50:28.964 --> 00:50:29.880
MALE SPEAKER: OK good.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.379
I don't feel bad about
not recognizing it.

00:50:32.379 --> 00:50:34.420
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER:
No, it's totally fine.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.124
It's totally fine.

00:50:37.124 --> 00:50:39.040
HEIDI LATSKY: Another
reason that you probably

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.810
didn't get it is that
I took her face away.

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:45.830
And I didn't know that.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.280
So at the first rehearsal
when I said to Alexandria,

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.710
can you sign it?

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.400
Just be neutral in your face.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.950
And that's like taking a
whole chunk of the language

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:56.840
out of the language, right?

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.080
Which I didn't realize
until that experience,

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:03.920
but I didn't want this
section of dancing

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.130
to just be her signing.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:10.080
I really wanted it to be a lot
more internal and evocative.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.167
Now I know how challenging
that was for Alexandria.

00:51:19.167 --> 00:51:20.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.572
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:51:21.572 --> 00:51:22.280
That's wonderful.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.160
So we're actually
running short on time

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.860
here, so I want to thank you
guys again for coming out.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:28.260
And give the final plug here.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.410
