Hi, I'm Ankur, the head of
developer education at Amazon.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.416
&gt;&gt; And I am Cezanne and
I'm a course developer at Udacity.

00:00:07.416 --> 00:00:11.630
In this course we'll look at different
ways to monetize your game app.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.920
&gt;&gt; We'll show you how to
make money from your game,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.510
which is a subject a lot of
developers leave as an afterthought

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.160
rather weaving into the fabric
of the game from the very start.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.820
&gt;&gt; So far you've been learning about
how to program your own mobile game but

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.170
it's also important to be able
to share it and make money.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.150
Ankur, what are some examples
of monetization in action?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.670
&gt;&gt; Well,
if you have played any mobile games,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.260
I'm sure you've already
seen a bunch of examples.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.670
It goes into everything from what
a game looks like to ads and

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.240
items that you can buy in the game.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.940
&gt;&gt; And remember,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
that there's no guidebook to tell
you the perfect ways to monetize.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.780
There are lots of different ways.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.300
After this course, you'll be able to
choose what works best for your game.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.960
Let's take a look at the different
strategies we'll be learning about

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.600
in this course.
