very transformational time in the field
 

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.370
very transformational time in the field
of healthcare and we should take

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:36.380
of healthcare and we should take
 

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.830
of healthcare and we should take
advantage of it and I have happened to

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:38.840

some risk but I think the opportunity is

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:05.960
some risk but I think the opportunity is
 

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.390
some risk but I think the opportunity is
over the next number of years despite

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:07.400
over the next number of years despite

as I said and in my regard to some

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:11.690
as I said and in my regard to some
 

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.540
as I said and in my regard to some
extent the over micromanagement by

currently occurring in healthcare that
 

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.250
currently occurring in healthcare that
in many circumstances we suffer from the

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:45.260
in many circumstances we suffer from the
 

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.250
in many circumstances we suffer from the

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.660
also has to understand that reform and
especially in the environment that we're

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:34.670
especially in the environment that we're
 

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.880
especially in the environment that we're
currently in that reform is a lot lot

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:36.890
currently in that reform is a lot lot
 

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.350

more than passing a piece of legislation

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360
more than passing a piece of legislation
 

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.820
more than passing a piece of legislation
however good the legislation may be and

however good the legislation may be and
by the way there's no perfect

by the way there's no perfect
 

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.370
by the way there's no perfect
legislation because it's impossible to

create it because of the political

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.270
create it because of the political
 

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.940
create it because of the political
dynamics and even if you didn't have

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:48.950
dynamics and even if you didn't have
 

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.140

those it would be probably impossible

those it would be probably impossible
 

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.620
those it would be probably impossible
anyway but reform is much more than
