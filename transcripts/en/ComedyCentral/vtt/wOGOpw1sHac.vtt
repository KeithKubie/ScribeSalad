 - Ben Coleman, you
 are the vice president

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:04.203 align:start size:88% position:13%
 of the Los Angles Log
 Cabin Republicans.

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:06.606 size:84% position:42%
  Gay Republican,
  how do you exist?

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.375 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Here I am, I'm a
republican and I'm gay.

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.245
 You know, being gay is
 only one part of me.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.580 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Log Cabin Republicans
 exist actually

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:18.518 align:start position:0%
 to bring the Republican Party
 closer on the gay issues

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:22.922 size:84% position:42%
  and kind of change hearts
  and minds from within.

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.357 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - The republicans
 have come a long way.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.591
 - I think so.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:26.526 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I think there's
  been an evolution.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.027
- I actually can come a long way

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.529
 but that's because I've been
 eating a lot of potassium.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.030
(laughs)

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:33.433 size:88% position:44%
 Was it difficult for you to
 come out, as a republican?

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.169 align:start position:0%
 - You don't really mention
 that you're a republican, too.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.637
But eventually--

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.405 align:start position:0%
 - Because they might reject
 you and not love you?

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:40.373
- Well--

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.340
- And I'd say that's unnatural.

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:42.909
 - They might make fun of you.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.212 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, no friend of mine
  is gonna be a republican.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.347 align:start position:0%
 You get out and I don't
 ever want to see you again.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.615 size:84% position:42%
  So that must be
  kinda hot, right,

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.084
 you get one of these
 libtards you know,

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.685 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and you can just pound
 it out, you know?

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:53.786
(laughs)

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.288 size:84% position:42%
  You know what I'm saying?

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.489
 Do you feel that the
 gay rights movement

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.491 size:88% position:44%
  has gone a little too far?

00:00:58.524 --> 00:00:59.459
 - I do, yeah.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.393
 - [Interviewer] In which ways?

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.028
 - Well I think that they're--

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.696 size:88% position:44%
 - Are the shorts too short?

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.901
 - (laughs) I think that the
 gay rights movement over all,

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.604
has been pushing people

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.806
 who are not yet ready

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:16.342
 to understand what it even is.

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:18.945 align:start position:0%
  There's a lot of people
  who just don't understand,

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.413 align:start size:88% position:13%
 two men together, they
 just don't get it.

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.815 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Or two women
 together, et cetera.

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.517 align:start position:0%
  - I get two women
  together, but not two men.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
 It's like when it's two
 girls though, it's like hot,

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.821 align:start size:88% position:13%
 but when it's two
 dudes I'm kinda like,

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:29.989 size:84% position:42%
  "I don't get it."

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:30.923 align:start size:88% position:13%
But when it's two
girls though, I'm like,

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.425
"I do get this."

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.494
You know, and I'll like,
crack open a Mickey's.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.130
Is homophobia okay if it
serves the free market?

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.398
 - If you walk into a
 place as a gay person

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:42.135
 and you're like, "I
 want a birthday cake."

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:45.371 align:start position:0%
 And someone says, "Well, I
 don't serve gay people here."

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:48.674
I mean, I think that's a
pretty dick thing to do.

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:49.509
- Yeah.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.776
 - It's not very cool.

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.346
Should they be allowed
to do it under the law?

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.114
I tend to err on the side of no,

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:57.049
the law shouldn't force
them to have to serve

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.751
 anybody they really
 don't want to serve.

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.253
 At the same time why
 would this gay person

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.922 size:88% position:44%
 want to get a cake
 from a nasty person

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.158
 who hates them just
 because they're gay?

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.193
 - Hey, what if they
 make a good ass cake?

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.830 align:start position:0%
 You're not a believer in
 climate change being manmade?

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:12.298 size:88% position:44%
  - Correct.

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.799 size:84% position:42%
  - So what's the agenda
  of the climate scientist?

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.602
 - Well if you're the scientist
 that comes up with the idea,

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:19.172 align:start position:0%
  that then changes the
  way that people do things

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.740
across the entire globe,

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.975 align:start position:0%
 doesn't that make you feel
 like you're a powerful person,

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:25.278 align:start size:88% position:13%
 you get accolades and
 you're called upon

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.046
 in congress to speak.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.015
 - It's for accolades?

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.283
- Yeah.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.019
 - If a politician is
 actively campaigning

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.254 align:start position:0%
 against gay rights and you
 find out that that politician

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.823 align:start size:88% position:13%
is gay, is it now moral
to out that person?

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:40.293 align:start position:0%
 - No, that's something they'll
 just have to live with.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.495 align:start size:88% position:13%
First of all it doesn't
make them anti-gay

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:45.731
 to say I don't believe
 in same sex marriage,

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:47.867 align:start size:88% position:13%
 because there's a
 lot of nuances there.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.870
 There's religion, there's all
 kinds of things to consider.

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:52.572
 - It seems to me like
 the difference between

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.507 align:start position:0%
  a person saying gay people
  shouldn't be allowed

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.242 size:88% position:44%
 to get married and
 interracial couples

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:58.578 align:start position:0%
  shouldn't be allowed to
  get married is negligible.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.146 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Seems like the same
 kind of bigotry.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.614
- Well, it's really not.

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:05.318
 Saying that marriage,
 which historically was

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.054 size:84% position:42%
  intended for procreation,

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.324
so a black man and a white woman

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.192
 can get married and procreate.

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:15.928 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Two men can not
  do that naturally,

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:17.463 size:88% position:44%
  two women can not
  do that naturally.

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:19.131 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - If that is in
 fact the litmus test

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:21.867
 then we aught not to allow
 barren women to get married.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.403
- Well, and that's a good point.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:27.740
 - I think I've just
 become a conservative.

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:29.141 size:88% position:44%
  Checkmate.

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:30.510
- No, checkmate.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:32.912 align:start position:0%
  - That's not how it works,
  'cause I said it first,

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.447 size:88% position:44%
 so I checkmate you.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.415
 - Yeah, but if I say it last
 before the SD card runs out.

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:38.151
- That's a good point,
but actually, checkma--
