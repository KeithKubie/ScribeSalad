00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.130
We've all heard the buzz surrounding 3D printing
- some call it the 3rd or '3D Industrial Revolution'.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.330
But what exactly is 3D printing?

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.660
And how big of an impact will it have on our
future?

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.010
The concept is quite simple: much your like
printer prints ink on a page, 3D printers

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.730
spit out material - whether it be plastic,
metal, or even concrete- to form a 3 dimensional

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.730
object.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.430
But instead of printing one layer, as ink
from a normal printer does, multiple layers

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.590
are stacked upon each other to create complex
3D structures.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.840
Think of it like making sliced bread, but
in reverse!

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.210
After putting one layer down, another is built
on top of that, and so on, until the whole

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.949
loaf of bread is put together!

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.230
Lost or broke something that you can no longer
buy?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.859
Simple - create or download the design online,
and 3D-print it out!

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.130
Have a specific or personal holiday present
idea and can't find it?

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.130
Print it!

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.539
In fact, GE's tumblr '3Dprintmygift.tumblr.com'
is doing exactly this for the holiday season

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.359
- we'll put a link in the description.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.769
And if you require moving parts in your design,
the printer simply leave gaps in the right

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.920
spots, or uses a special gel that can be dissolved
or rinsed off afterwards.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
Speaking of design, 3D printing paves the
wave for incredibly customized objects, made

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.140
on demand to fit your requirements.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.549
Not only does this mean furniture, shoes and
appliances built to fit your lifestyle, but

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.560
things like prosthetic limbs can have completely
customized user designs, as opposed to generic

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.289
mass produced products.

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.170
Need something small and intricate?

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.039
Typical 3D printers create layers approximately
100 micrometers thick, but some high-end machines

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.560
can print as small as 16 micrometers.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.820
To put this in perspective, a typical bacteria
cell has a width of between 1-10 micrometers.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.130
This has opened the doors to using molecules
for ink, and has lead to successful 3D-printed

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.799
pharmaceutical drugs, such as Ibuprofen (CHECK).

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.869
The tiny molecules are organized perfectly
to create the desired drug effect.

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:45.869
Hungry?

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.229
In the future, you might be able to ask Siri
to 3D-print a meal, perfected for your palette.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.090
But, perhaps the most significant application
is creating 3D structures out of living cells

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.810
- or bio-ink.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.620
Instead of using plastic or metal, imagine
3D printing tissue to replace damaged skin,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.570
or to reproduce entire organs from scratch.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.119
Instead of needing an organ donor, you just
print one based off of your genetics.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.070
Amazingly, this technology is already being
developed.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.290
For burns or scrapes, a scanner is used on
a patient's wound, and a personalized skin

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.590
map is created.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.690
After this, the printer lays down cells one
layer at a time, until the area is covered.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.610
Organs are much more complex due to their
large size, vascular networks, and interactions

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.610
with the body.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.700
A scanner takes X-ray images of, say, a patient's
kidney, as cross sections with incredibly

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.190
intricate detail.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.800
And just like any other object, these organs
are reproduced layer by layer, specifically

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.640
designed for each individual.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.790
Though these are years away from being functional,
it will certainly have a huge impact on the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.010
medical community.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.590
So while it may be a while before you end
up with a 3D printer in your home, you can

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.470
be sure that by the time it happens, the world
will be a different place.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.950
But if you can't wait that long, GE is giving
3D Printing it's own holiday this December

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.930
3rd - it's 'D3 for 3D'!

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.530
To celebrate, they're 3D-printing and giving
away customized gifts for their fans all day.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.200
All you have to do is visit 3dprintmygift.tumblr.com
to choose one of the prototypes and tweet

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.680
for a chance to get one printed and shipped
to your home in time for the holidays!

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
Go check it out!

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.870
