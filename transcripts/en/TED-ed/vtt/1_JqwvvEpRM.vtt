00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:15.723
Mysteries of Vernacular

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:17.754
Miniature,

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:19.754
something distinctively smaller

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:23.112
than other members of its type or class.

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:27.222
Miniature traces its roots to the Latin, &lt;i&gt;minium&lt;/i&gt;,

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:30.016
which meant, "red lead".

00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:33.353
Minium referred, in particular, to a compound of lead

00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:36.839
used as a pigment in Medieval times.

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:40.087
In those days, because there were no printing presses,

00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:42.172
groups of scribes were tasked with

00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:46.012
painstakingly copying all books by hand.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.878
Whenever they needed to denote a chapter break

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:50.667
or a division of text,

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.623
scribes would switch from standard black

00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:57.008
to the red pigment, minium.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:00.255
Another important visual device used to increase

00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:03.082
the prominence of certain portions of text

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:04.151
was to set them off

00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:07.762
with large, ornate, and colorful capital letters,

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:12.065
often surrounded by tiny, detailed paintings.

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:14.082
The Italians began to refer

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:16.604
to these elaborate and diminutive paintings

00:01:16.604 --> 00:01:20.753
as &lt;i&gt;miniatura&lt;/i&gt;, illuminations.

00:01:20.753 --> 00:01:24.362
Because of the necessarily small size of the paintings,

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:28.783
miniatura began to be associated with all things wee

00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:31.954
and spawned to other words with the same base,

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:36.203
like the Latin &lt;i&gt;minimum&lt;/i&gt;, for least.

00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:38.441
Miniatura was transmuted into English

00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:42.580
in the 16th century as the word, &lt;i&gt;miniature&lt;/i&gt;,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.055
and since that time,

00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:47.779
it has had the exact same meaning we use today.
