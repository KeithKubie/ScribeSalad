00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.370
Bacteria are fascinating little creatures.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.910
Some make us sick, some make us well, some
keep us happy or healthy.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.221
So how do program them to do our bidding?

00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:18.590
*make evil scheming face*

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.740
Inside of your gut trillions of bacteria are
helping you digest food and keeping our gut

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.220
in tip-top shape.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.939
Millions of years of evolution have molded
these tiny organisms into specific jobs and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.470
now science is taking it from here.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.020
Because gut bacteria live inside all humans,
the ability to program them could be a cornerstone

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.220
of a whole new kind of medicine.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.480
You have problems with lactose?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.260
We've got a bacteria for that.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.400
Worried about obesity?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.870
We've got a bacteria to help.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.880
These little organisms already do so much
that we don't completely understand, and now

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.660
by altering some of them we DO understand,
scientists are hoping to develop new kinds

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.660
of therapy.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.700
The hospital-acquired infection P. aeruginosa
is a doozy of a bug that infects the lungs,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.330
gut and bladder and creates a film of proteins,
DNA,and sugars; called a biofilm.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.740
That biofilm makes P. aeruginosa difficult
to attack with traditional medicines, like

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740
drugs.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.810
But, in an ACS Synthetic Biology study from
2013, researchers found a new solution: recruit

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.900
a fellow infectious agent to side of light.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.560
Some strains of E. coli cause dangerous infections
and some don't, but because it's found in

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.341
nearly everyone's lower intestine, medical
researchers took it and reprogrammed the bacteria

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.400
to fight P. aeruginosa!

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.990
This new synthetic E. coli is like a hunting
dog, tracking down P. aeruginosa, and attacking

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.310
it's biofilm with enzymes and an antimicrobial
peptide!

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.310
Boom!

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.310
Double agent!

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.440
And that's just the beginning, since they
proved the efficacy of this new treatment,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.090
another set of researchers want to create
a toolkit for using gut bacteria moving forward.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.229
Programming a bacteria isn't as easy as typing
commands into a computer, though.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.740
Scientists are basically inventing a whole
new system of tools to make sure ONE, the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.350
bacteria are even present in the gut, and
TWO if they're doing what they're supposed

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.610
to do once all up inside you.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.099
Using the retroviral DNA editing technique
CRISPR -- we've talked about it on DNews before

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.989
-- researchers at MIT modified the DNA of
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; adding light-emitting

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.530
genes and instructions to glow if they come
in contact with a certain diet.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.700
46 percent of humans have bac-teroidees theta-iotao-micron
in their bodies.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.400
This gut microbe normally uses water to help
our intestines break down non-digestible polysaccharides.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.549
But this new synthetic form could be used
to indicate when problems are starting in

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.239
our gut, or to treat those problems before
they even happen!

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.629
Next steps are to see if these synthetic bacteria
can live alongside their natural brethren

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.200
without causing trouble; and then test if
they can survive in the wild -- in a real

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200
gut.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.689
Let's imagine a patient had inflammatory bowel
syndrome, or c. diff; the researchers say,

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.029
using this toolkit, a synthetic gut bacteria
might allow doctors to treat the problems

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.650
before they even show symptoms!

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.219
How would you know something was up?

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.709
Your poop would glow.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.909
Weird, but AWESOME.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.849
Programming bacteria is the future, so figuring
out how it works is a real focus of science

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.849
right now.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.969
But medical researchers aren't the only ones
doing cool stuff.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.989
Intel creates the breakthrough technologies
that make amazing experiences possible.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.299
Having Intel inside makes for better experiences
outside.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.099
Intel drives innovation with products like
processors, wearables, devices for the internet

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.559
of things, and within data centersâ€¦

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:37.319
In the PC and beyond.
