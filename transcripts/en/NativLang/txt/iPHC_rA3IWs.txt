Speaker 2:          00:09          we've gone through the basics of morphemes and covered a few word classes. Now we move on to a part of speech known as the adjective. You're probably aware that adjectives describe nouns, but you might not have considered their function from a morphological perspective. Sometimes they work more like nouns and sometimes they're more like verbs. Let's start with some examples. In ancient Greek adjectives declined exactly like nouns do. In fact, they routinely take the same endings for number, gender and case. Since that's true, we can see examples like [inaudible] the just person or the fair person versus [inaudible], which would mean the just woman or the fair woman. And in that case we have an opposition between decos which is masculine, singular and nominative as well. And [inaudible], which is feminine, singular and nominated. In both situations we have an adjective describing a noun, but they're working like a now declining like a noun.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Now I'll draw a counter example from Japanese. In Japanese, many adjectives work a lot more like verbs. In fact, they're specifically what we would call state of verbs, which are verbs that indicate a state instead of an action. So a description like is happy or is hot would indicate a state, for example, a to means is hot in Japanese. Those can act as true adjectives in front of a now. Or they can instead take the place of a verb in languages that treat adjectives more like nouns. Don't be surprised to find them used as a noun. Take the ancient Greek example I gave you just a moment ago. I can instead say [inaudible], which means literally the just or the fare in English that would translate to the just one or the fair one. And in that case, we have decos working exactly like what we would expect the noun to work like in Greek. On the other hand, in Japanese, the words I used in those sentences work exactly as we would expect, a verb to work and they're conjugated like a Japanese Ferb. There's a good deal more to be said for adjectives beyond these basics, but it's worth reviewing the lessons on nouns and verbs to dig into their properties and come around next time when we meet the very versatile grammatical particle
