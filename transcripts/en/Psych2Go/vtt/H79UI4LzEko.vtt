We hope you enjoy this video.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.279
Many teenagers often feel as though their parents are being too overprotective and suffocating.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.162
Helicopter parenting is a term used to describe how some parents

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.579
pay extremely close attention to their child's life,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.239
To the point of controlling many of the child's experiences and knowledge.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.469
Some may argue that doing this will allow the child to grow up safely,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.090
But there are adverse consequences to not letting children experience life for themselves.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.160
Here are five ways that helicopter parenting can affect you.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.639
1. you're incredibly dependent on your parents to make decisions.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.589
Helicopter parents tend to make important decisions for you,

00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:11.129
instead of allowing you to try it.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.740
They're afraid of letting you do something wrong.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.180
They think that if they can prevent disasters from the beginning,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.389
then they should.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.400
If they continue to do this until you grow older,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.220
Then you won't have any opportunities to learn how to be independent and take on responsibilities.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.060
Everything you do as an adult will need your parents approval first.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.420
This dependency will stunt your growth as a person

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.440
And therefore reduce your ability to function in society.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.929
2. You have underdeveloped life skills.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.780
Since helicopter parents are controlling,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.140
You may not have the chance to develop life skills that are important.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.480
Such as effective communication with others.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.929
This is a direct result from being too dependent on others.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.000
Without the ability to explore the world on your own,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.169
You miss out on many lessons and experiences that life offers.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:59.790
For example,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.220
If your mother decides that you should stop hanging out with a group of friends

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.829
And you agree without asking why,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.500
Then you've missed the chance to learn how to judge

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.840
what makes a good friend

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.759
and how to recognise bad influences around you.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.880
3. You experience high levels of anxiety and depression.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.680
Several studies in anecdotal data from college counselors suggest

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.580
That college students with parents overly involved in their academic lives are more likely

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.740
to experience anxiety and depression.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.790
The younger generation is also being exposed to the same stress today.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.400
There are many possible reasons that students are experiencing more anxiety in the academic setting.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.800
For instance, kids most likely fear disappointing their parents and think that

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.960
Satisfying their parents is more important than maintaining their health.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.320
Helicopter parenting doesn't support children.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.870
Instead, it makes them uncomfortable.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.720

10 signs school may not be for you.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.130
4. You have a low sense of self and self-esteem.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.763
Helicopter parents will try to do all the problem-solving for you.

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:06.270
Without the ability to figure things out by yourself,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.699
You don't develop a healthy sense of identity.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.640
Combined with helicopter parents' tendency to restrict your social life,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.600
This would only increase your isolation and loneliness.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.180
This often leads to low self-esteem,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.320
Especially during your teenage years.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.860
You can start to doubt every decision you made,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.129
Including casual ones such as daily choice of clothes and food.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.000
This lack of self confidence can damage your future because you don't know who you are.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.840
As a result, your life goals and career path will become blurry and you won't be able to live a satisfying life.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.675
5. You begin to resent your parents.

00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:43.769
As children,

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.740
You're curious and want to explore the world on your own terms.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.399
When parents take away that opportunity because of their overprotectiveness,

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.798
You can grow up to resent your parents.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.769
As a result, you may start to act out and lead rebellious teenage years, which can be dangerous.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.590
You may stop listening to your parents and begin to associate with people that can negatively influence you.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.179
Because helicopter parents often don't teach their kids how to use good judgment,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.890
You may have a hard time differentiating between a bad crowd and a good crowd.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.900
In the end, both parties suffer.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.749
Your parents are hurt because of your rejection and you feel suffocated under their watchful eyes.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.520
It's an unhealthy relationship that will only get worse if neither act or change.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.729
There are many solutions to help improve this relationship.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.590
Affection and communication are key to a healthy relationship between parents and children,

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.919
Especially once boundaries and expectations are set.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.000
It is also recommended that parents teach their children to be confident,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.389
While allowing some freedom for individual exploration.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.140
Parents must find a middle ground between a hands-off and hands-on approach.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.780
If they completely neglect you,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.320
Thinking that life will teach you everything you need,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.069
Then they're not providing enough guidance.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.119
But smothering you with rules and guidelines isn't the best method either.

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.480
Talk to your helicopter parents about your frustrations,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.859
And work out a solution together.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.979
