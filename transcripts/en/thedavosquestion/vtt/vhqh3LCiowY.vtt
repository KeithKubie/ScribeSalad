to one's problems, the
energy or whatever, things affecting the whole

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:50.640

the [unintelligible] energy and other things.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.149
And, uh, regarding to our fair honor rule
my country that world is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:11.200

trying -- trying to have

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:20.280
a fair amount of price of oil, you know, and
that the whole world

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:31.090
