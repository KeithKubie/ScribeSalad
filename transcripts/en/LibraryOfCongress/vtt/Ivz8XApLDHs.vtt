00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.290
My name is Betsy Peterson,
and I'm the Director

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.840
of the American Folk Life Center.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.300
And on behalf of the staff
at the center, the librarian

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.100
and everyone here, we're so
thrilled that you're here today.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.860
This is a very special
event, and I'm really excited

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.920
about the panel coming up.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.650
This is part of an event called
Dancing Ireni, Reimaging,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.300
Reimagining, Alan Lomax's
choreometrics project.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.210
We're delighted to be
cosponsoring today's symposium

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.410
with the University of
Maryland School of Theater,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.600
Dance and Performance Studies.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.840
And today's conversation
is the first part

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.950
of a very important landmark
three day conference that's coming

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.930
up on choreometrics.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.960
The remaining two days are going to
be held free of charge to anyone,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.820
the public, everyone, at
the University of Maryland.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.190 position:56%
So please talk to Karen Kohn Bradley
if you're interested in attending

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.060
and finding out more about it,
but please join everyone there

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.380
if you don't have any plans.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.580
I'm certainly going to be there.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.550 position:56%
The event today is also part of an
ongoing lecture series that we have,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.630
the Benjamin A. Botkin
lecture series.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.580
And this is a series that allows
the American Folk Life Center

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.600
to present the latest and
best scholarship in folklore

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.030
at the musicology, cultural
studies and the like.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.110
And it accomplishes two purchases.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.890
The first, sharing all of this
great research and information,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.930
but it also allows us to
enrich our own collections.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.240
And in fact, the conversation
that we're going to be privvy

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.210
to over the next couple
of hours will be recorded

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.230
and put online eventually available
to people throughout the world

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.310 position:56%
and to people in future generations.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.460
So with that said, let me ask you
if you have any electronic devices

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.060
at the moment, any
phones and the like,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.370
if you could please turn them off
or you will be part of our archive.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:47.070
And finally, this is like a perfect
trifecta of activity going on.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.480
But today's event is not only one
of the Benjamin Botkin lectures,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.840
it's also part of a year-long
celebration of Alan Lomax

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.800
on the occasion of the
centennial of his birth.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.660
So happy birthday.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.370
The Alan Lomax collection is one
of ASC's largest most prestigious

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.880
and most celebrated collections.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.990
And although Lomax is -- most
of his work is well known,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.790
certainly particularly
the Anglo-American

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.500
and African-American work, there
are other aspects of his collecting

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.290
and his scholarship that
is not as well known.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.480
And this is particularly true of
his work on dance and dance theory,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.700
to which he devoted a significant
portion of his later career.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.380
The study of dance is formalized
culturally, conditioned,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.070
communicative behavior based on
researching the diversity of dance

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.760
and it's relationship to different
cultures throughout the world,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.870
a field which he christened
choreometrics has been

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.960
unduly neglected.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.520 position:56%
As was true with so many important
researchers, Alan Lomax did not work

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.940
in isolation and indeed throughout
his entire career he worked

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.330
with a range of collaborators
and colleagues.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.230
And choreometrics is no different.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.600
Lomax launched the enormous
choreometrics project in 1965

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.660
with collaborators Irmgard
Bartenieff and Forrestine Paulay.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.390 position:56%
We are delighted to have
Forrestine Paulay here with us today

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.560
for today's discussion as well

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.770
as choreometrics project
researcher, Meriam Lobel.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.690
But before I turn the proceedings
over to Karen Kohn Bradley

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.110
who is the Director of
Graduate Studies and Dance --

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.890 position:56%
I'm sorry, Chair of Graduate
Studies and Dance School of Theater,

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.340
Dance and Performance Studies
at the University of Maryland

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.000
and lead organizer
of this conference,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.100
I just want to thank you again for
all coming and invite you to join

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.270
in on the conversation after,
when we open things to the public

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.060
and to please stay for
the reception afterwards.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.480
So without further
adieu, I will turn things

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.510
over to Karen Kohn
Bradley who is right there.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.340
&gt;&gt; Welcome everybody.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.810 position:56%
It's thrilling for me to see these
faces here, coming from so far away.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.880
I am here to do the thank you.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.050
I have so many people to thank.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.200
I made a list.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.910
First of all, of course, the
American Folk Life Center,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.790
the Library of Congress,
particularly Betsy Peterson,

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.500
Todd Harvey, Nancy Gross [assumed
spelling], Thea [assumed spelling],

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.310
everybody whose been
so helpful here.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.560
The School of Theater, Dance
and Performance Studies,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.520
who for whatever reason awarded me
the Dorothy G. Madden Professorship

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.260
of Dance, which allowed
me to play in a sandbox

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.910
that I never could
have afforded otherwise

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.350
and to bring everybody
together for this conference.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.650
I'm so grateful for
the opportunities.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.970 position:56%
The Association for Cultural Equity,
particularly Anna Lomax Floyd

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.510 position:56%
who we've been having a conversation
for some years now about how

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.380
to get this collection out there
digitized, etc. So grateful

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.520
to your partnership -- for
your partnership and your help.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.080
And [inaudible] studies in New
York, which I also hang out at.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.300
And I just wanted to do a
shout out to my students

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.320
who have been working
on this project.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.140
Du [assumed spelling] Barker,
can you raise your hand?

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.420
Christina [inaudible], Megan
Boden [assumed spelling], Sinclair

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.720
and [inaudible], Kate Spanos.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.280
These are some of the graduate
students from the University

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.120
of Maryland who've become engaged
with this work so deeply and fully

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.020
and made it their own,
and I feel grateful

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.100
for the future of it
because of them.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.870
And finally, my colleague,
Miriam Phillips.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.880
When she first came to the
University of Maryland,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.480
we decided one day
on a lark to go down

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.140
and find the choreometrics
materials.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.600
We didn't really know
where they were,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.720
but we came on a subway,
and we came on down.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.610
We went to the Smithsonian first.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.720
And they said, no, no, it's
over at the Library of Congress.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.920
And we walked in, and there was
Todd Harvey and so began this --

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.710
I don't know -- six, seven
years of conversation

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.120
about how we could do
something with this material.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.310
And today is a launch
of a new stage of that.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.480
So welcome everybody.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.250
Thank you, Miriam.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.510
And I turn it over to you.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:35.430
[ Inaudible ]

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.390
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
And last by not least,

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.950 position:56%
I would like to thank Karen
Bradley whose been the extraordinary

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:52.760
visionary behind this project
and incredibly perseverant

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.370
to make even getting
this far happen.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.090
And we have a lot of work to
do, and she's been incredible.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:07.180
So thank you, Karen, and again
thanks to all of you, Forrestine,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.390
Mary, and everyone because I know
people have been coming from near

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:17.150
and far so we really
appreciate that.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.840
Karen left out one
tidbit of a story.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.220
Along with the time where
we came down here on a whim,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:32.200
it seemed that it correlated
with the time when the --

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:39.400
at the Lavon Institute,
some of the original files

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.700
of Irmgard were also discovered
in a storage unit -- where?

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.240
In Brooklyn.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.890
And so it was this kind
of synchronistic timing.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:59.600
And so it just kind of lit the
fire to progress with this project.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.050
So, I thought that we
would spend half the time.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.310
I have some questions
I thought about before.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:14.330
Discussing with you and then
open it up to our esteemed guests

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.280
for comments, questions, ideas.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:28.430
Could you each start with telling
us briefly how you got involved

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.030
in the choreometrics project?

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.330
How did you meet Alan Lomax?

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.500
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: I think
I'll start since I started.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:46.970
Oh, wow. Alan Lomax was a
student of Ray Birdwhistell.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:57.640
And when Alan had already developed
the countermetric study, he --

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.130
there were certain
questions that he had

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.560
that he felt he wasn't
finding the answers

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.470
for in the countermetric study.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.970
So he spoke with Birdwhistell,
Ray Birdwhistell, about this --

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.490
Ray Birdwhistell was
the founder of kinesics.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.810
And Birdwhistell said, "Well,
dance is a more fundamental,

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.100
more primary relative
expression than song.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.140
And if you're going to find out
the answers to the questions

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.710
that you're interested in, you're
going to need to look at dance.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:37.720
And Birdwhistell recommended
[inaudible] analysis

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:45.960
as probably the most appropriate
analysis for discovering the kinds

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.730
of answers to the questions
that Alan had.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.040
So Alan called up -- I guess

00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.490
at that point it was the Dance
Notation Bureau and invited Irmgard

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:07.220
and as a dancer, Irmgard asked
me to come along with her

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.520 position:56%
in this interview with Alan to begin

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:18.070
to discuss whether we thought we
could help him develop a system

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.850
for looking at movement
cross culturally.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:28.750
It turned out to be an extremely
interesting experience at that time

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.230
because we were looking from
the [inaudible] analysis point

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.610
of view pretty much at individuals.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.510
And this was not going
to answer the questions

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.690
that Alan was interested in.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.510
And I can remember that one of the
very first films that we looked

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.290
at with the Georgia
Sea Island Dancers,

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.140
and Irmgard and I just had a ball.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.500
We had such fun getting the
individual differences of everyone

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.350
of the performers, and we
were very excited about this.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.140
And we bring it in to conference
with Alan, and we start talking

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.060
about all these differences,
and Alan sort of sits back,

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:14.090
and he said something like, "Well,
that doesn't tell us anything."

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:20.220
And we were just totally
off the mark.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:30.920
And that began a whole education
for both Irmgard and me in looking

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.090
at movement in terms
of dfiferent levels.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.120 position:56%
And that if we're going to look
cross culturally, we are not looking

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.860
at individual differences.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.290
We are not looking at individual --
God, I was just reading something

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.880
out there which was
showing the effort shape --

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.480
well, not the shape because
that wasn't in there yet,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:58.640
the effort graph and
changes from free flow

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.900
into bound flow light,
back to free flow.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.650
Well, this is not going to make --

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.080
give you any information
that's going

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.850
to enlighten you about cultures.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.170
All right?

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:16.450
So that began this whole
education of looking

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.300
at the whole world of dance.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:24.020
And one of the first things we
did was collect together reels

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:30.170
that had all of the areas
represented, and looking at that

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.350
and beginning to find patterns.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:39.600
And so the early coding system
came out of that work of looking

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.430
across all the different
areas and finding a way

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:52.330
of adapting the Lavon work
to the cultural level.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.650
That was work that preceded
probably up until 1970.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.010
So it was very based
in Lavon's work.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.330
1970, Irmgard went back to
the Dance Notation Bureau

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.480
and began teaching there, and Alan

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.620
and I continued working
on the coding system.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.680
And that was when we began
looking at and brought

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:18.960
into the system patterns of
social organization and also

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:25.990
such parameters as palm
presentation, use of foot.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.500
So we began to look at how
the body was used generally.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.210
So not specifically oriented
to the Lavon background.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.690
But clearly influenced
by the sensitivity

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:46.840 position:56%
that a trained person develops by
going through that kind of training.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.670
So that's the beginning.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:51.970
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Thank you.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.760
Answers bring up more questions.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.710
But let's here from Mary.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.720
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: Well, I started
out as an anthropology student

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.530
in college, and I took a year
abroad, and I went to Greece,

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.010
and I was planning to write
something about my experience

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.920 position:56%
in Greece, which was transformative.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.780
But when I was there, I realized

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.640
that I couldn't possibly
capture what I wanted to say

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.590
about Greek culture and
Greek life in writing

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.580
and so I decided I should try
to pursue ethnographic film.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.190 position:56%
So I came back to New York, and I
wanted to work in ethnographic film,

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.750
and I called the only
person I had heard

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.100
of whom I thought could help me.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.990
I called Margaret Meade
[assumed spelling].

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.190
I said, "I would like to
volunteer as an intern and work

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.620
with someone who's doing
ethnographic film."

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.220
And she said, "Well, you
should really call Alan Lomax

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.460
because he is doing an amazing
project about world dance."

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.750
And I was so excited because dance
was also very important to me.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.490
I had been studying modern dance my
whole life as well as in college.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.480
And I called Alan and I said I
was interested in being an intern.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.780
He said, "Okay.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.080
Come on up."

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.280
So I went there, and I guess
in the beginning I was working

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.330
to help procure the film
from all over the world

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.950
and to just keep an organized
catalog of the films from all

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.980
over the world and gradually
began working on the coding system

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.250
and learning with Forrestine
how to look

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.420
at films from all over the world.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.410
And I thought I would show
you just a very short --

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.910
it's a six minute film -- that
gives an idea of the influence

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:40.130
that choremetrics played out in my
life since the time I was there.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:46.930 position:56%
I was there from 1971 to 1994 on and
off because I -- like many of you --

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.210
I was always torn between
researching dance

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.200
and being a dance practitioner.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.100
So there were times when
I went back more full time

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.110
to studying and performing dance.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.300
And I will just bring
up a few highlights

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.270
of the choreometric system
when I show you this material.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:09.880 position:56%
I didn't shoot any of it, but these
are all performances that I've seen.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:17.770
So it starts out -- the first is a
performance that I -- [inaudible].

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:42.130
[ Music ]

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.600
One of the things that we looked
at in choreometrics [inaudible].

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.900
This is [inaudible].

00:17:46.900 --> 00:18:01.450
After I was working with Alan's
project for a couple of years,

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:16.350
and I fell in love with dance all
over the world, I was so excited

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:20.090
to see people dancing
in any culture.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:30.190
And I went back to finish my
degree at University of Wisconsin,

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:47.160
and I heard that [inaudible] mother
[inaudible] was coming to teach

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:56.580 position:56%
in Seattle that summer, and I just
couldn't believe that she was coming

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:04.860
to teach, and we would have an
opportunity to study with her.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.240
So I began studying and working
with them for many years.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.540
But again, [inaudible] dancing
illustrates so many things

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.840
that are characteristic
of that region,

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.140
her use of facial expression,
her eyes, her use of hands,

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.440
her interpretive [inaudible].

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.740 position:56%
You don't see it here, but there are
live musicians sitting right next

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.040
to her in the room.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.340
Fast forward.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.140
From time to time, my daughter
says, "Oh, mom, [inaudible]."

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:49.730
[ Music ]

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.890
What I found is having been
a choreometrics [inaudible].

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:41.560
[ Music ]

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:47.870
For a number of years, [inaudible].

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.660
The community there
is largely Latino

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.460
so I worked [inaudible]
American musicians and dancers.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:04.160
And this is [inaudible]
so much African influence

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:16.510
in the way he moved, [inaudible],
his forward posture, [inaudible].

00:21:16.510 --> 00:22:06.040
[ Music ]

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.980
Most of them -- well, I'll
go back to that later.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.570
But this is the last
piece [inaudible].

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.900
This is the Greek parade
in New York City.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:33.500
Every year around March 25, we
have a parade and [inaudible]

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:44.550 position:56%
who are marching, emphasizing their
synchrony and the use of their feet,

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.850
the complex stepping [inaudible].

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.150
They're lifting their legs.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.840
And last but not least, this
is the [inaudible] Greece.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:57.150
Again, this is what got me to
Alan's office in the first place.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:03.080
My enchantment, I guess, with
Greek culture and [inaudible] was

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.620
such a part of life there.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.000
I think almost every single
night that I was there

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.700
in the evening you would see people
in the [inaudible] just getting

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.660
up to dance spontaneously.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.960
They enjoyed it so much,
and everybody enjoyed it.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.260
I guess [inaudible].

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.560 position:56%
Again, a wonderful approach to
dance that is such an important part

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.860
of people's social lives and
choreometrics [inaudible] synchrony

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.660
and the stepping, foot
crossing [inaudible].

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.050
[ Music ]

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.370
Dancing [inaudible] I'm not
sure where that is going,

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.630
but I'm [inaudible] for thinking
of the idea that dance could help

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.600
to work to help foster
more peaceful interactions.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.210
[Inaudible] means peace in Greek.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.350
Thank you.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.680
[ Applause ]

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.210
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Continue
to reflect on the early days,

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:57.460
when you both met Alan, how did
he describe the project to you?

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.260
I mean, what did you understand
this project to be about?

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.470
Did he describe it to you?

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.880
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: What I was
going to say is Alan lived

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.190
and breathed the project.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:15.120
He was so excited about every
single bit of the research

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.400
and every finding and every can
of film that came in from far

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.350
and wide across the world.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:26.050
His enthusiasm was so contagious
and infectious, and he just --

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.750 position:56%
he talked about it all the time so
he didn't really have to describe it

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.820
because he was enthusing
about it constantly.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:39.460 position:56%
And he was determined and committed,
and he never let anything interfere

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.830
with him pursuing it and
trying to fill it out to be

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.650
as representative as possible.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.900
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: I'm trying

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.400
to remember how he first
described it to Irmgard and me.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:25:05.950
Alan had a passionate love
for what he called the good

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.430
and the beautiful.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.760
And I don't really
remember his description.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:27.170
But what comes to me was the sense
of his love for the performances

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.130
of different cultures
around the whole world.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:42.100
He had such a deep respect for the
integrity of the different cultures

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.680
that he was viewing, that
he had been listening to.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:54.470
And I think what really stayed with
me and what interested me so much

00:25:54.470 --> 00:26:02.620
as I began to view the material was
the -- well, from him certainly,

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:11.340
his valuing of each style of
not having a say preference

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:17.500
for the western European
style of which he came.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:24.650 position:56%
But that kind of broad appreciation,
and I think that's what's part

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:29.390
of what captured me and made
me want to do the study.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.680
It touched something
very deep in me.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:39.770
As I watched the dancers
and the dances going by,

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:49.540
I experienced such a sense of
the presence of real humanity

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:56.990
and the expression of the
whole life way of a people

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.750
through their performance
style through their dance,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:09.660 position:56%
and I could remember being caught by
seeing -- driving down, what was it?

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:15.150 position:56%
First Avenue or something and seeing
up in a window a group of children

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:20.220
who were studying dance,
and they had scarves.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.240
They were swniging
the scarves like this.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.610
And it was like I saw that, and
then it took me all the way back

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:33.170
into looking at some of the
early English dances and such

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.250
where they were swirling scarves.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:40.170
And it was like the
feeling of continuity

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:49.170 position:56%
that what we're doing today is so
related to years and years and years

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:55.710
of people living together
that it's not just "dance,"

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:02.450
but it really epitomizes those
things that were important

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:07.600
for the lives of those people
way back, and that's what's part

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.590
of my heritage I thought.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.820
It's like here I had
been studying this

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.880
and I had no sense of the history.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:21.580
And this gave me not only a sense
of my own history, but my history

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.790
in perspective of the whole world.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:32.230
And so that's the best answer I
can give to that question of --

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:40.890
that's what I -- it exuded from
Alan, this deep respect and love

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.880
of the beauty, the esthetic beauty

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.170
of all performances,
of all cultures.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:52.750
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: It's
bringing up for me a little bit

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:57.200
of what was Alan searching for?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.500
I don't know.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.940
Maybe Anna you can also talk
about this a little bit later.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.270
What was he looking for?

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:10.830
And that he brought
you on just with --

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.820
I mean, was there always some
kind of inkling of a theory

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.660
or cultural patterns or it
was more just like looking.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.960
Let's see?

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.270
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: He had
done the whole cantometric study.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.330
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Cantometrics
before, so there was already that?

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.980
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: He had
that model, and he had questions

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.290
that he had not yet
been able to answer.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.790
So it was Birdwhitsell saying
no, you've got to look at dance.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:41.000
And some of those questions had to
do with energy, that he was not --

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.860
he wasn't seeing the distributions
that he was curious about,

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.050
and the song style
wasn't bringing those up.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.550
So he had -- he had
the whole experience

00:29:53.550 --> 00:30:03.750 position:56%
of using the George Murdock area
files and so he was able to organize

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.610
as we got materials --
he had a very clear idea.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:15.040
He wanted a full world sample
of dance style in order for us

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.560
to develop a system that
would be comprehensive

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.500
and that would be a
level of observation

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.370
that would be applicable a
the cross cultural level.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.740
So there were a lot of
things like when we started

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.550
and just wasn't appropriate,
the individual differences.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:38.400
But it was also true that
there were cultural definers

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.020
that also would not be
applicable cross culturally.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.470
So he had a very clear idea as we
were looking, and we were looking

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:53.720
for patterns, that Irmgard and I
immersed ourselves really in all

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.290
of the areas and began to get
to know something about them

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:00.710
so that we could begin
to see patterns

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.720
that characterized a certain group.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:12.500
But was that of a particular kind
of phenomena that made some sense

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:17.420 position:56%
if you used that particular -- those
parameters on different cultures?

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.520
On all the different areas?

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.820
Was it going to provide some kind
of an interesting distinction?

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:31.210
His guidance was, I mean, essential
in the development of the system

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.650
to keep it at the cross
cultural level.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:39.370
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: I think he
wanted to look at the beauty

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:43.210
of human expression, which we've
all been saying that he loves

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:47.410
and appreciated so much,
and not to have any kind

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.620
of hierarchical analysis, and
that was really the beauty

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.780
of choremetrics also that
it was just a way of looking

00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:01.620 position:56%
at all different forms of dance with
some parameters that you could use

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.600
to hang onto, but there
was no one style,

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.580
certainly ballet was not considered
to be the ultimate aspiration

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.470
of every dancer in the world.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.950
And that was also what made it so
appealing, that it was very open

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:20.750
and accepting of every dance style.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.340
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
Great, thank you.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.610
Could you speak a little bit
about what some of the --

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.440
your working conditions were?

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.550
Take us back to you
showed up at work.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.080
What did you do.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:41.150
How did these -- how did
these coding sheets develop

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.340
and get altered?

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.550
I mean, take us through what --

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.680
it sounds like probably
there wasn't a typical day,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.190
but I think maybe there was.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.490
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: Well, it
was a great day when Mary came on.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.490
We needed help.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.310
Or I did certainly at that point.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.220
98th and Broadway.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.950
That was the very first
-- 12th floor --

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:18.650
and it was an apartment that
had been turned into offices,

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:21.120
and one room was for
the cantometric --

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:31.200 position:56%
all of the materials for
cantometrics for the song materials.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.580
Alan had a large office where he
spent I don't know how many hours,

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:43.840
at least 28 hours every day
of going through all of the --

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.660
oh well, the grant writing.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.670
I mean, Alan did all
the grant writing.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.130
He interviewed people.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:34:01.280
He made contacts with
people in order to get films

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.560
and to get -- to increase
the sample.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.360
He was the person who
was responsible

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:13.560
for determining the whole sample
and was it going to be adequate.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.720
And so he worked in conjunction

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.220
with Connie Arensberg [assumed
spelling], would come frequently.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.760
He had a statistician.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.430
Do we have statisticians here?

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:27.030
Well, there was another one, too.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.340
Ed Erickson [assumed
spelling] was there.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.640
Yes.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.940
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.240
Statistician, Ed Ericson was there.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.830
Norman Berkowitz [assumed
spelling] was there.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:41.440
Roswell Rudd [assumed spelling]
was there doing the coding

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.310
for the cantometrics.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:50.310
And Irmgard -- well, these
people -- they came later.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.870
They were not apart of this
initial -- was Irmgard and me,

00:34:53.870 --> 00:35:00.480
and we had marathons
of looking at footage.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.980
I used to at night I would
dream seeing these dances,

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:10.300
and I would enter into
them and dance with them.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.050
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: I'm sorry.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:17.210
Did you watch the films
together with Irmgard and then --

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:18.510
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay:
Later Mary came.

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.810
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Right.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.110
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay:
This was the first --

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.410
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
Did you watch together?

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:23.710
Did you watch separately?

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.010
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: Oh no.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.310
We watched together.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.610
And Alan too.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:28.910
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
And were you filling

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.210
out coding sheets as you went?

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.510
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: Oh no because
we didn't have coding sheets yet.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.810
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: So this was --

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:34.110
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay:
This was pre-coding.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.410
We were just observing and looking
and looking and making notes

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:44.300 position:56%
and then educating ourselves about
the different levels of observation.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.600
All right?

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.480
That was a big part
of the early process.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.670
And we spent hours observing.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:56.320
I mean, I had at home -- I
would even take things at home,

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.910
and I had a machine so I could
run things backward and forward.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.210
And I started dreaming.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.200
I'd watch cars going
across the street

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.630
and then I'd watch them backing up
and then I'd watch them go again.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:12.100
It was like the whole process
-- it felt like pregnancy.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:18.780
Like I was stretching to take
in this whole world of dance.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.910
It was an amazing experience.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:25.190
And it was out of that that
gradually we developed a

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.490
coding system.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.860
And the coding system
developed by increments.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:36.490
In the early years, it was more
organized by Lavon's principles.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:40.690
So we were looking at
dimensionality, right?

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.890
We did look at one and
two units of the body.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:50.730
We looked at various qualities
of say transition in space,

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.350
things which were more
related to the Lavon work.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:56.950
And that was like the
first coding system,

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.270
and we went through that and coded.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:03.840
So It was a gradual development.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.290
Normal Berkowitz would then
take the coding sheets,

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.840
and they were transcribed
onto cards,

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.700
which Todd was showing me
the cards are even here.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.340 position:56%
Then they were taken to the Columbia
computer room, big, big, room.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.940 position:56%
Then we would get back these sheets,

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.850
and Alan would spend hours
looking through these numbers.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:25.920
So excited when one of these things
-- I would look at it -- God.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.020
It was just piles of numbers.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:33.950
And he was so good at
determining pattern

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.270
because he had the whole
ethnography in his head

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:40.750
and so he could immediately
see if pattern was coming

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.320
out of particular parameters,

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.330
and that helped shape the
development of the coding system.

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.450
That was one of the
important pieces.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:53.750
After Irmgard left, then we
began developing other aspects

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.920
of the coding system,
social organization

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.490
and body presentation and such.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:02.580
And at that point I was
handling all of getting the films

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.170
and bringing them in and
selecting the sections,

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.830
and this is finally
when Mary arrived.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:16.600
It was marvelous to have another
person there to begin training

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.480
to do some of the coding and to
handle because he was starting

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:27.590
to handle this -- because it was
one enormous job was collecting all

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.280
the material.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.990
And that was when I was in
the archive just earlier

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:40.550
and saw my hand notes on have
we called so and so and ask Alan

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:45.030
if we can spend $150 on this
particular film from so and so.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:50.400
And it was a massive job
collecting this footage.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.700
It really was.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.530
And we had to go through it,
and then we had to select

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.100
out sections that were
most relevant.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.330
And the other thing that shaped
the coding system that was

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:07.440
so fascinating was it was to find
characteristics which you look

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.110
at a small piece of
it, and you've got it.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.490
In other words, so you're not
having to look and detail this

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:16.380
and then come up with a code.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.070
But it has to be conveyed
immediately

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.670
because what we're looking

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:26.450
at basically is how cultures
represent themselves.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.330
We're looking at cultural identity.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.790
And cultural identity has
got to be there right away.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:38.500
You come up to a person and you
recognize am I of this culture?

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.410
That takes care of a lot of
things and then you can go

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.170
on with other kind of
detailed interaction.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:48.160
So we had to shape
our way of looking

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.020
to capture cultural identity.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.870
So it's an interesting thing.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.530
One of the things that I've noticed
that certain people have talked

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.710
about is -- oh, because we were
also looking at every day movement

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.530
because we wanted to
see the correlations

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:05.070
between the dance style
and movement.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:12.000 position:56%
And there's a real one aspect of the
relationship between the dance style

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
and the work is that the --

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.750
basically this is what
people are doing.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:21.840
The neurological patterns are
developed from very early on.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.280
And those are brought
forward in the dance.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.800
But there's another aspect
to it and this is identity.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.970
And it's cultural identity.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.020
And that sets the motion
for interaction

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.660
and patterns of interaction.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.120
So we were looking.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.070
Can you grasp those things?

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:46.600
So immediately and in ways
that can be taught easily

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.680
because we did consensus studies.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.070
Did we do those -- did you cover or
have we already done some of the --

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.370
we had already done those.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.560
Okay. We were doing
consensus studies.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.490
So we would bring in students
and teach them some of the lines

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:07.460
and see worthy parameters
that we had developed.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:12.960
Not only did they provide
interesting information in terms

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.150
of the distribution of cultures

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:18.700
but were these lines
teachable and easily teachable.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.520
Could other people besides
trained people see them?

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:27.500
And that also determined
what we kept in the system.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.800
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Great.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.910
Ask you more of my
questions another time,

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.340
but I'm going to keep
the conversation moving.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:42.290
Mary, tell us a little bit
about when you came on board.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.710
You -- my understanding --
were not formally trained

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:52.570 position:56%
like certified Lavon movement
system but Forrestine and Irmgard --

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:53.870
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: No.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.170
I wasn't trained.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.150
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Sort of
trained you in that sense.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:01.920
Tell us a little bit about
that and what was your role.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.230
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: I think when
I first came in I was helping

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.800
in a big way with the films.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.670
I remember some of
the films came in.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:13.290
We got film from Prince
Peter of Greece and Denmark

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:14.590
and a big [inaudible] wrapped

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:18.270
in his pajamas all [inaudible]
stitched together by hand.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:22.870
This was a time when we couldn't
send things over the internet.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:26.580
We got film from India that was
in burlap and also in a container

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.380
that was stitched by hand.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.810
So whatever we got, we
were very careful to log,

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.980
and we had a pretty
complicated system.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.630
We made notes about
what was on the film.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.500 position:56%
A lot of times, there was dance, but
there was other material as well,

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.990
and we had all kinds of notebooks
where we made notes about that.

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:47.450 position:56%
We had file cards where we also put
that information and then took a lot

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:51.820
of the film down to a lab in
midtown and had copies made,

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.810
work copies of the dance
sections that we knew

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.530
that we were going to be coding.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:00.840
So there was a lot of
processing in that way,

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.260
and then when we started putting
together the choreometric films,

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.860
I also spent a lot of time -- I
was the assistant editor on those

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.390
with trying to figure out what
clips we were going to use

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.280
and using [inaudible]
to cut it frame by frame

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.010
and syncing up the music.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.260
So there was quite a
bit of film work going

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.590
on in conjunction with
the dance coding.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.560
As I was there, Forrestine
taught me the coding system,

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.560
and we worked together a lot
for long hours every day,

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.190
and it was just fascinating.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.900
And we would discuss
what we saw and whether

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.860
or not we were both
seeing the same thing

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:42.220
and then what the findings were
that were coming out of it.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:46.590
But Alan also was doing
his own larger analysis

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.470
of the findings cross culturally.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:53.430
I think based on his
cantometrics findings.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:59.880
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Tell us a
little bit about the findings.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.030
I mean, I'm really curious.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:07.100
Did you have -- can you
recall like an aha moment?

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.540
I'm sure you had many aha moments.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:18.710
Or, well, I'll let you
[inaudible] that one.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.560
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:38.970
There were -- I mean -- it was
such an education in anthropology.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:45.880
I mean, coming out from
the perspective of a dance,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:45:02.060
choreographer, it was a constant
source of almost like wonder

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:11.030
that the use of the body
or the use of space related

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:15.760
in say some instances
to technology so that --

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.120
I mean, the one dimensionality
being related to a particular kind

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.230
of tool used that if you're
using say a wooden tool,

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:32.410
if you were to use it with a
curve, you would probably break it.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:40.080
And so watching Australian
aborigines working on say a tree

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.780
with a wooden tool, and the kind of
patience and the kind of repetition

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:51.470 position:56%
that was required with those
reversing one dimensional movements,

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:58.420
right, in contrast to where they
had metal and seeing the sweep

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.430
of the metal blade
cutting the harvest

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:07.370
and seeing how this
really did shape the dance.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:12.550
I think it's just really seeing
the significance of that that was

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:22.790
so impressive and I mean, the fact
that would be one level of aha.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:28.120
But another level of aha would
be to see the distribution

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.430
of a particular pattern
-- say the one unit torso,

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:35.140 position:56%
and to see that across the whole
pacific and see it going all the way

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:40.260
down right into the
tip of South America.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:45.430
Or to see that in the use of
horses, it's not only in the use

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:49.940
of the stirrup but where
there's no stirrups,

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.140
where it's basically at
the tip of Patagonia.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.910
I think it's the [inaudible].

00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:00.510
Interesting how things
start coming back.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:05.520
I think it's the [inaudible]
indians who dance on [inaudible].

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.840
They are a horse culture
that was so indomitable

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.160
that I think they were
maybe the one cultures

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:19.080
that was never taken over,
was never by Europeans.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.780
And they danced on [inaudible].

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.080
American indians.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.380
Not the [inaudible].

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.180
The importance of horses, and
you take that and you think

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:31.620
of the Georgian dancers
who are dancing on toe.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:38.680
So there's something besides
the actual movement patterns

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.260
that are being conveyed
through the dance.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:50.030
But there is an identity with
horses and meaningfulness of horses

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:55.580
where the use of the foot
is like the use of a hoof.

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.910
So it shows something more about
the complexity that we're looking

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:03.250
at when we're looking at a dance

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.920
because it isn't just these
are the movement patterns

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:12.470
that the culture survived on,
but these are the identifications

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:16.940
that these people made with
those things that are important

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:21.250
in their lives which adds
another level of richness.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:25.010
And it adds another level of
richness for dance teachers

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:30.090
to understand when you're working
what's the cultural identity

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:34.830
like for the person you're
teaching and you're working with?

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:38.560
And how do you -- how do you teach?

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.180
How do you use this choreometrics?

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:50.140
In order to help people really
experience a shift in identity,

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:54.290
a shift in cultural identity,
what can you do through movement

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.780
which means drawing on your other
kinds of backgrounds in movement,

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:04.430
to bring to the dancers so they
can actually experience oh,

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:07.920
if you start working through the
feet, you're going to get something

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.710
in the upper body that
if you go directly

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:13.950
to the upper body you're not
going to get because so often

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:17.700
and what we see, say why
it looks so different

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:26.460
to see the early Caucasians doing
multiunit style and why it looks

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:30.070
so stiff, look at their feet.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.330 position:56%
You've got to work through the feet.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:36.710
You have the whole barefootness,
all right, that goes along

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:38.200
with the multiunit style.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:42.420
And it's because the flow comes
from the foot all the way up.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:46.510
And if you put a shoe on that foot,
and you don't teach that person,

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:48.570
you know, you can't go
even if you're barefoot

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:52.560
as if you have shoes on, you're
not going to get the fluidity

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.330
in the multiunitness of the body.

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:58.890 position:56%
I think I may have went off a little
bit from that, but the question --

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:00.190
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Interesting.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:04.370
Let me ask Mary something
about the work process,

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:08.130
and then I have two more
questions and I want to open it up.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:16.690
So you're observing, you're doing
-- when the coding sheets came on,

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.170
you're doing the coding sheets.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:21.010
You're giving them back to Alan.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:24.150
They're going in the mainframe.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:28.460
These numbers get spitted out.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:36.780
Well, just that process.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:42.950
How you were sort of feeding things
into Alan, what he was getting

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:47.970
and then the interpretations
that started coming back to you.

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:52.930
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: We were
all in the same small office

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.500
so we would code a few things.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.390
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
Would he code with you?

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:58.690
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: No.

00:50:58.690 --> 00:50:59.990
Well, sometimes he sat there.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:04.060
Then we would go and discuss with
him something or give him a stack

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.100
of coding sheets that we had just
done, and we would talk about it

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.230
and then he was really
giving it to --

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:14.470
after we got a certain amount
done and then feeding it

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:17.580
to whoever was analyzing
it through the computer,

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.350
through the global jukebox.

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:22.420
The last time that
I was working there,

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:27.330
he was trying to accumulate a
certain number of codings and also

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:32.600
to reduce the number of
parameters on the coding sheet

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:38.130 position:56%
so maybe there could be 40 different
parameters instead of the four pages

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:41.550
of codes that we were
putting in for awhile.

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:44.570
He was trying to -- working
with you also, Forrestine --

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.360
trying to find what were the
most essential characteristics

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.990
that could speak to the essence of
the dance of the use of the body,

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:57.690
the social organization or the
relationship to the audience,

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:59.520
the dynamics of the movement.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.550
What could be the minimum number
of variables that you could look at

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:05.550
and still get something
meaningful from it?

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.850
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay:

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.560
He was actually doing factor
analysis work on that.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.180
So it would not -- it
wasn't just by looking

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.940
and saying well let's
put this together.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:20.490
He would do factor analysis and
that would bring pieces together

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:24.620
and sometimes what would then
happen is then we would take

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.060
that factor analysis
and actually out of

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:32.440
that sharpen the coding parameter.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:38.070
So that became the part of the
progression of the coding sheet

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:41.820
so that there was a
constant interplay of the --

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:47.650
sort of the statistics
and the technology

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:54.470
with the observations
shaping the coding system.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:57.900
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
Now, at some point,

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:04.410
there was some interpretations of
all the patterns that were started

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:12.520
to be made and once the -- I guess
it was the film started coming out

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:16.720
and publications, there
was some controversies

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.940
that came up with the project.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.850
Were you -- did they come
into your conversations?

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:27.060
And that will be coming
up over the next few days,

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.050
I think, in some conversations.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:34.940
But did those come back to
you in the conversations?

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.610
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: I could say
something because at the time

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:42.340
that I started working there, the
field of anthropology was changing

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:45.690
and anthropologists felt
that they really needed

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:50.370
to specialize very much in one
specific culture and perhaps

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:53.330
in one specific village
within one country.

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:58.200
And so I always felt there
was a lot of resentment.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.380
I don't know if that's the
right word, but people didn't

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:06.370
like the fact that Alan thought
that he could look an objective way

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:08.520
at a bigger global picture.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.950
And it really didn't
-- from what I heard,

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.880
it really didn't even have
anything to do with knowledge

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.860
of what the project
was actually doing.

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:20.460
It was the fact that he was saying
that it was possible to look

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.130
at the world of dance
in a global way.

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:28.130
And I disagreed with the people
who felt that it was not possible.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:32.930
I think his intellectual
capacity and his vision

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:39.160
and his thoroughness -- it was just
so huge that he could do something

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.130
and I think he gave all of
us tools that we can utilize

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:48.000
to help us all understand
each other and the ways

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.360
that we organize socially
in different types of groups

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.800
and the way that we move and
the way we use our bodies.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.380
But I think it was very
much a trend of othe times.

00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:02.200
In all kinds of science, of
course, there were people --

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:07.620
there was a time when
feminism was going full force.

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:12.000
So if there was any comment in
any of the choreometric material

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.910 position:56%
that I don't know, reflected any
kind of male attitude towards women,

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.940
people always just made a
bee line toward that comment

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.340
and completely ignored the
rest of the information

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.920
that was being presented.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:31.340
But so I'm not sure if that's
what you mean by controversy,

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:34.960
but I think those were the two
biggest areas that I was aware of,

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.350
and I felt that the
project was so valuable,

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:42.240
and I respected people's
criticisms what they were saying,

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.600
especially the first one that
I mentioned where anthropology

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:50.310
as a field was the whole
time of being so embarrassed

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:53.490
about American colonialism and
how dare we presume to be able

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:56.630
to say anything about anybody else
in the world, and who are we go

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:57.930
to somewhere and tell people

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.220
that this is what you're
thinking and feeling.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.490
So everybody was just trying
to work on a very micro level

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:05.460
and report every little
thing that was going

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.050
on in a specific cultural
environment,

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:12.560
and Alan was in the midst of
working in a more global way.

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.860
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Right.

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.840
I mean, some of the commentary
was about the decontextualization

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:22.330
or some of the interpretation sort

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:27.610
of that was aboutp a particular
group representing a whole culture.

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:34.730
So yeah, did those -- did that come
into your conversations at all?

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:37.440
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: Well
it did certainly with Alan.

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.720
I mean, we did discuss that.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:46.130
But the thing is, any
dance performance --

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.990
you can look at it from
so many different levels.

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:55.310
There's such richness there,
and I think people felt

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:58.250
that richness was getting slighted.

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:07.770 position:56%
I remember talking with someone, and
it was about -- what group was it?

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:10.980
But it was east European dance.

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.280
I don't know.

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.580
They were talking about --

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.320
this is an exaggeration because
I don't remember the number --

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.780
but anyway, something like well,
there are 600 different steps,

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:23.510
and you're calling this
step style and stepping.

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:26.280
And -- but there are
600 different ones.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.740
They have -- they're done

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:32.190
in different occasions
and by different people.

00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:37.970 position:56%
And to explain that, that is
beautiful and it's very interesting.

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:41.000
But that's not the level
that we're observing on.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.110
We're looking at the
difference between this kind

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:47.500
of stepping pattern that crosses
like this and a stepping pattern

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:52.860
which maybe just walks
forward and never crosses.

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:58.130
And that makes it an important
distinction at this broad level.

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:05.400
But it certainly leaves out a
wealth of beautiful information

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.230
and important information
about the culture.

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:10.800
It's just that wasn't the
level we were looking at.

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:17.040
So there was not an understanding
frequently, I think, about that.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.160 position:56%
And possibly, it wasn't presented --

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:26.140
I could see that it could be really
interesting to show the simplicity

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:31.350
of what the choreometrics level
was getting at then have someone

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:36.710
from the culture show the
amount of diversity within that

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:41.750
so that both could be
shown to people at the --

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:45.960
in continuity so that it's like --

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:50.010
it's not for lack of
appreciation of that.

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:52.300
But if you get caught in
that, it was like when Irmgard

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.140
and I first got caught in
individual differences.

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.550
They're very interesting
if you're going

00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:58.780
to do a psychological
study of those people.

00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.810
But it's not going
to tell you anything

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:05.120
about where they are in the world.

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.420
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
Well, it kind of gets

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:12.060 position:56%
into my last question before opening
it up, which is what are your hopes

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.490
and dreams for this project?

00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:19.760
What would you love to see happen?

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:27.130
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: I'm just so
thrilled that Karen and you

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:29.720
and the University of
Maryland are really interested

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:35.130
in bringing this material back
to the attention of students

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:39.650
and young people and also thrilled
that the material is housed

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:42.310
so beautifully at the
Library of Congress.

00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:46.480
Your archive is mind blowing really

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:51.770
to see how well everything has
been organized and contained.

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:56.310
So my hope is always that
more people would benefit

00:59:56.310 --> 00:59:59.330
from choreometrics and would
appreciate it and have a chance

00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:04.140 position:56%
to look at all of that amazing film
footage of dance all over the world.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:09.680
My fear in the 70's was always
that all of the individuality

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.990 position:56%
and different cultures was going to
get eradicated, and we would all end

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:16.990
up moving in similar way
and maybe we'll all end

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:19.520
up just thumbing on our phones.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:25.230
But I think that choreometrics can
really open up the horizon again

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:30.150
to everybody, to dancers and
nondancers about what the range

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:34.590
of possibility is and that
exists in human movement.

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:41.960
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: I too really
appreciate what's being done here

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.270
and what's being done by Karen

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.820
and what's being done
by the archivists here.

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.940
I was extremely touched by
going down to the archive

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:54.890
and seeing the incredibly
sensitive, intelligent,

01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:58.380
loving kind of work
that's been done here.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:06.510
I think what's touching me
now is these young students

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:13.150
that I'm starting to
meet, and I'm really --

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:17.880
I'm eager to talk to
them about what their --

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.510
what's catching them at this time.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.560
What's interesting them?

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.450
Why are they doing this?

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:29.100 position:56%
What does it capture in them that
they're devoting themselves to this?

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.760
What have they discovered here?

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:42.760
There's something about the
enthusiasm that touches me.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:53.520
I feel it's bringing this
work -- it's bringing --

01:01:53.520 --> 01:02:00.870 position:56%
they're bringing the aliveness to
this work that is touching something

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:02.170
in me in terms of vision.

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:06.770
Where are they going to go with it?

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:08.140
And what are they going to do?

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.340
And how is it going to spread?

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.830
What is the personal
meaning in their lives?

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:19.530
And how can they -- how
are they going to share

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:23.470
that and touch other people?

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:30.020
There's -- Alan's vision of the
good and the beautiful is something

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:35.470 position:56%
that hold dear because of the beauty

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:38.090
of this performance is not
just the beauty of performance,

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:40.480
but it's the beauty of
different life ways.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.250
It's about appreciation
of how people live

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:46.390
and how they communicate.

01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:47.690
How do they interact?

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:49.630
How do they make contact?

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:56.420
I think there's something
here in how they make contact

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:06.220
and how they relate that can be
an experiential lession for more

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:13.350
and more people, that there are
different ways of being with others

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:17.490
and to begin to look at that,
there's something about that

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:21.610
when we see this whole world
movement, we can also begin

01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:23.800
to see ourselves more clearly.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:28.640
We can begin to maybe make
more choices about ourselves

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.750
when we see ourselves
in perspective.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:36.830
Because we assume so
much because we just --

01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:39.010
that's just the way
things are for us.

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:44.310
Well, we don't recognize
what has shaped that.

01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:46.110
And I think recognizing
what shaped that

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:52.460
and what has shaped others gives
us more respect for other people.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.040
So I think there's
a whole thing here

01:03:54.040 --> 01:04:01.140
about spreading respect
throughout the world that can come

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:06.110
through the arts through song,
through dance when one sees it

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:10.280
as these are living patterns.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.210
These are patterns that
shape the lives of people.

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:15.770
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Thank you.

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.240
Thank you.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:21.020
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: One little
[inaudible] what you said --

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.760
we look at all this footage that
we have in the global jukebox,

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.000
and it's from such a
far and wide places

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.920
but I remember Alan really took
advantage of wherever he was

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.050
to appreciate the different ways
that people express themselves

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:41.740
in song and in speaking, and
he once said to me, "You know,

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.820
I do my best research right
now when I take a cab ride."

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.620 position:56%
He said, "You can't believe I spend
the entire ride interviewing the cab

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.530
driver and asking him what kind
of music he likes to listen to

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:53.960
and having him sing a song
for me and having him tell me

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.210
about his community here
in the United States."

01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:02.060
So he was constantly aware and
alert of who was around him

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.500
and what they had to
offer artistically,

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.110
and I think that's something
that also we can all appreciate

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:12.940
in our own lives by
being more open to that.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.510
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Absolutely.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:19.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.520
&gt;&gt; Which is following upon what
Forrestine and Meriam just said

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:29.540
that I think the dances
that they studied represent,

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.350
and they're not the only
examples, of course,

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:39.560
but kind of the classical
cannon of the world.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:45.110 position:56%
And in this era of mixing everything
and taking a little bit from here

01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:47.810
and a little bit from there and
saying oh, isn't it wonderful,

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:53.670
we can put it all together,
often times we're doing it

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:58.050
without understanding what
the originalism is about.

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:06.550
When we study art, fine arts, the
visual arts and classical music

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:12.690
and so on, do we not have to go
through years of training for this

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:16.560
and years of study
[inaudible] and so on?

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:24.690
But somehow this sort of
"traditional" forms of music

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:27.240
and dance don't get that.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.090
I think they are now more and more.

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:33.480
There are people who actually
are learning these styles.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.580
But that's not mainly
what's happening,

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.140
and I think that it should be part

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.430
of our consciousness
and thinking about them.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:45.750
At least they deserve to
be respected very much

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:50.240
in their own right
first and foremost

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.500
because that's the only way we can
really understand and inspect all

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.320
of the elements of what they are
and the totality of what they are

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.750
and where they come from.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:03.010
Otherwise, we're just sort
of grazing superficially

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:05.020
and picking off little
pieces of things,

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.700
and we don't want to do that.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:14.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Anna Lomax Wood.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:20.120
What questions, comments
do you have, Paul?

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.560
There's a microphone coming.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.060
&gt;&gt; Hi, thank you.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.860
I had a question or a series of
questions actually all related

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.320
to the procuring of the films
themselves because it seemed

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.170
like there's a great difference
completely understandably

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:36.550
in the type of films that were
used that you were analyzing.

01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:37.850
Some seemed ethnographic.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:39.150
Some were documentaries.

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:41.950
Some seemed like they
were folk performances

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.730
where others might have been
part of a festival or tradition.

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:48.870
So how did you identify the films?

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:53.720
Did you rely on people overseas
to make selections of those films?

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.050
I loved hearing how some
came, how they arrived.

01:07:57.050 --> 01:07:59.980
But how did the conditions
of their production figure

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.230
into the way you analyze them

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:06.170
or into the way Alan actually
interpreted them afterwards?

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:09.220
In other words, because
there's a disparity in the films

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.810
which I actually think makes for
richer interpretation actually,

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:16.550
but how did that actually
play into the way that --

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:19.930
or did it -- into the
interpretation?

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:24.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: The
interpretation was not of the films.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:27.570
The interpretation
came out of the data.

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:32.780
And out of the having
the full sample.

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:36.230
That's where the interpretation
came from.

01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:40.050
And much of that was not -- I
wouldn't call interpretation.

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:46.880
That was relying the coming
together of the different lines,

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.050
what they did in terms
of distributions.

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:53.010
So I can't think what the
right word is at the moment,

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:54.310
but it's not interpretation.

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:58.210
It was really more exposition

01:08:58.210 --> 01:09:02.460
of the findings rather
then "interpretation."

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:07.700
In other words, this particular
quality of movement is found

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.650
in this particular
distribution around the world.

01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:14.250
And that's the first film that
we did which was the Dance

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:20.350
in Human History shows
that graphically.

01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:29.410
We -- I tried to minimize
interpretation and stick

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:33.450
with what is the distribution
and the potential significance

01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:37.740
of that distribution in
relationship to the Murdock sample

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:41.180
and other things in anthropology
that had been looked at

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:46.240
and where the distribution
had been studied.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.390
As far as the search for films,

01:09:49.390 --> 01:10:00.950
the criteria was what geographic
region did they illustrate?

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:08.220
Was there enough footage that
we could get a coding from it?

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:13.700
Did the camera person stick
with some of the European stuff

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:18.470 position:56%
so that we only had head shots and
couldn't tell much of anything else?

01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:22.670
Did they go beyond the
traditional eight second shot

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:25.090
so that we could see
what was happening

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:28.200 position:56%
without cuts constantly, constantly.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:33.810
So we looked for anything we could
find from the different cultures

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:36.630
and sometimes that
would be raw footage.

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:38.680
Sometimes it would
be completed films.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.750
Sometimes it would
be at the festival.

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:44.330 position:56%
But when you're looking at the
cross cultural level, you're looking

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:49.540
at something which we were trying
to develop where you can capture

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:55.930
that identity in a fairly short
period of time so that we had

01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:59.540
to rule out a lot of
interesting measures

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.700
that would have required
looking at a whole dance.

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:08.170
So we couldn't look at
choreographic structure usually

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:10.000
because we didn't have it.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.880
So we were limited to those
things that we could discover

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.750
within a few minutes of footage,
and we would get that footage

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:27.930
from anywhere, from whether
it was a folk performance.

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:34.500
We would try to find examples
that were done by ethnographers,

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.240
anthropologists, etc. so that
there was a certain integrity

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:44.760
in the footage that
we chose to work from.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:53.460 position:56%
If something was highly westernized,
we would tend not to use it.

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.890
So does that answer your question?

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:57.190
&gt;&gt; It does.

01:11:57.190 --> 01:11:59.540
But can I -- even more specifically
when you were looking --

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:02.350
it's usual to see that the
vetting process had more to do

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:05.160
with the quality of the
film, not necessarily

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.940
where it came from or what --

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.240
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: Well, no.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.540
It's very much where it came

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.970
from because Alan was
working to get a full sample.

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:17.180
So where it came from, yes.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:23.800
And we had to search far and
wide sometimes to find material

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.980
to illustrate certain cultures.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.540
So that was there very much too.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:33.690
&gt;&gt; So you weren't necessarily
seeking specific samples

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:36.110
of particular dances, but you
were reaching out to people

01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:38.350
who might have access
to footage of --

01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:42.500
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay:
Representing that region.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.870
Yeah. Rather then a specific dance.

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:48.020
Because if we were
working at the right level,

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:52.670
it should pertain pretty
much across dances.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.920
That style should be
visible to enough

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.980
of an extent across
different dances.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:05.100 position:56%
That's what I was talking about when
one person was saying there's 600

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.420
different dances or different
steps, how can you possibly be --

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.800
well, because it's going to be
very different from what's done

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:18.570
in southeast Asia and what's
done in South America or etc.

01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:19.870
&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.

01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:24.710
&gt;&gt; Meriam Lobel: We did have an
ethnographic film specialist,

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:26.960
Emily Dibogard [assumed
spelling] came in at one point.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.030
This was after we had already
collected a lot of film.

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.770
But she was very familiar with a
lot of anthropologists who were

01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:34.460
out in the field at that time.

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.780
And so we wrote letters to
people wherever they were working

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.880
and very often they
were very willing

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.710
to bring their material
in and share it.

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:45.010
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: I mean,
they're major collections.

01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:47.320
I mean, Penn State had
an incredible collection

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.920
and so we really researched the
different archives that existed.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.360
And we traveled.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.530
I mean, I spent hours
and days in the basement

01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:02.340
of the [inaudible] cranking out
footage and looking at a little --

01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.470
this size -- making selections.

01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:08.100
So, we went all over
looking for stuff

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:12.230 position:56%
and found wonderful treasure troves.

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.300
I mean, I did something at
the University of Phoenix

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.990
and just talking to somebody

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:22.780
in the audience discovered
this whole garage full

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:25.390
of I think it was Central American,

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:29.250
South American footage,
just by luck.

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.420
;

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:34.070
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Other
questions or comments?

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.370
Yes?

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.720
&gt;&gt; I was really interested when
you were saying the findings

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.580
about how the tools and technology

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:50.040
that they used really
influenced the dance.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.950
And so it sounded to me like
that you maybe researched a lot.

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:57.580 position:56%
You weren't just looking at the
dance, but there's a lot of research

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:03.260 position:56%
that maybe went on about the culture
separately from the dance in order

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.590 position:56%
to understand and analyze the dance.

01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:08.310
So I was wondering if you
could just talk a little bit

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:13.120
about how you prepared
yourself to observe?

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.860 position:56%
Did you try the dances or
physically attempt them or just ways

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:26.310
that you were preparing yourself to
analyze what you were looking at?

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:32.450
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: Well,
in terms of the technology,

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:39.250
what we did is wherever possible,
we got examples of the major sort

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:44.770 position:56%
of work patterns in the culture so
that we not only observed the dance,

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:50.840
but we observed work patterns
and also social interactions.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.750
So we would look at every day life.

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:57.270
Whatever footage we could
get hold of for the culture.

01:15:57.270 --> 01:16:06.760
So that that was helpful in
finding sort of key body uses

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:14.050
because you'd see, oh, I can
remember it was a Spanish dance,

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:22.030
I think, where we saw them in the
caves with the caskets of wine,

01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:25.740
and the barrels have to be turned.

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.910
And so you'd see the
women go turn, turn,

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:34.230
walking down this long
line turning the barrels.

01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:36.970
Well, what's this?

01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:38.270
Above the head?

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:40.290
There you have in the dance.

01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:41.760
So it would be that kind of thing.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:47.010
So the preparation was simply
staying open, seeing what you see

01:16:47.010 --> 01:16:51.060
and looking at patterns and
having the patterns work

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:55.840
on you basically rather
then we work on that.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.140
When we worked on that,
it didn't work.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.440
When we opened up and
let it work on us,

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.810
then we began to see the patterns.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.460
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Adair
[assumed spelling], did you -- ?

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.170
&gt;&gt; This is, I guess, a followup
question on that in a way.

01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:16.080
In terms of -- I'm just curious
about the quantity of films

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:22.630 position:56%
that are part of this collection and
what would you say the percentage is

01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:25.720 position:56%
that deals with those work patterns,

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.380
social interactions,
looking at the cultures?

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:33.310
If you're focused on dance, I'm
assuming that that was the bulk

01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:34.610
of what you were looking at.

01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:38.870
But how much would you
say is the rest of that?

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:42.890
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: I
haven't got the foggiest idea.

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:45.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, okay.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.300
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay:
I think maybe --

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.770
maybe Todd would have
a better answer.

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:51.070
I just don't remember .

01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:55.620
but whenever we could get a
hold of it, we would look at it.

01:17:55.620 --> 01:18:00.080
But it's not necessarily in the
collection because we brought stuff

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:05.040
in that we looked at that we
didn't -- we couldn't collect.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.030
I mean, we were limited in what
we could afford to collect.

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:12.490
And I looked through
collections in Europe.

01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:14.180
I mean, film upon film.

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:18.500
My developer side is cranking that
machinery and looking at footage.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:26.120 position:56%
So I looked at so much, and I
looked at raw footage, so much work,

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.640
so much social interaction that
we never copied and brought in.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.710
So it was just sort
of like a memory bank.

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:35.830
What we have, what we don't.

01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:37.130
50 years worth.

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:38.440
I can't believe it.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.740
&gt;&gt; Thank you, yes.

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:41.240
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
We have time just

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.350
for one more comment or question.

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:52.680
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if studying the
oral transmission of these dances

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.310
and how the people actually
transmitted from a generation

01:18:56.310 --> 01:19:02.170
to another could have helped inform
the choreometrics coding system

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.300
and if that has been something

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:08.230
that Alan Lomax was
interested in himself?

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:13.300 position:56%
Interviewing people maybe
understanding what's their emphasis?

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.600
What they're looking at?

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.580
Or what they're trying when
they're performing themselves?

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:21.400
&gt;&gt; Forrestine Paulay: This would
be a very interesting question

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:25.380
for someone who's looking
within the culture.

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:30.110
Cross culturally what we
did see and what we did look

01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:38.440
at was again every day movement,
how are babies held during the day?

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.970
Are they on their backs in
certain African villages

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:45.000
when the women are working?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.170
And you see this and you
see the babies doing this.

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:52.750
In contrast, in certain American
Indian tribes where they're

01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:55.460
in the -- what do they call the --

01:19:55.460 --> 01:20:02.310
yes, the swaddling in actual wooden
frame so that the baby's like that

01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:08.930
or the Eskimo children where
the mother holds the child

01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:11.310
and bounces them up
and down like this.

01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.870
And you see that child
collecting their energy

01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:24.230
into a very clear strong
one unit gravity position,

01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:28.100 position:56%
which is what the men have to do
when they go out and wait on the ice

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:32.150
in order to get a seal, right?

01:20:32.150 --> 01:20:38.110
So there's a definite relationship
between how children learn.

01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:42.770
We also did look at some
teaching situations generally

01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:45.990
in more advanced cultures.

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:50.320 position:56%
But those we would be looking at the
patterns and see how those relate

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.630
to the dance rather then the
interesting question you're asking

01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:57.060 position:56%
about which is how they think about.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.500
That's at the cultural level.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:06.890
Yeah. I think Anna had
something to say too.

01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:12.270
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
Well, let's -- yes and --

01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:19.440
[ Inaudible ]

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:27.640
&gt;&gt; If you go into research,
ethographic research,

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.940
you can use this knowledge.

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:35.410
And I often tested it out by
asking people about things like --

01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:37.880
I don't remember any
specific examples.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:43.200
But it's very fascinating
when they confirm

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:49.450
from inside the culture what you're
observing from the choreometric

01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:53.310
or cantometric point of view.

01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:56.210
It's a way of sort of
testing out these ideas

01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:59.140
that actually you can do.

01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:01.440
So --

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.670
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips:
Allegra -- I mean --

01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:15.790
&gt;&gt; Particularly interested
in the question.

01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:24.510
I don't know what it was that
because what's so exciting here

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:32.270
with this is that it -- the
verbal level doesn't interfere

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:33.700
with the process.

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:40.860
It's the body and the movement
level and you see it carry through.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:44.360
In today, with a little
bit of watching,

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:50.770
and seeing the fisherman walking
through the water and then seeing

01:22:50.770 --> 01:22:54.190
that movement in the
[inaudible] was so exciting

01:22:54.190 --> 01:22:59.470
to just see the continuity
that correspondence

01:22:59.470 --> 01:23:01.810 position:56%
that [inaudible] a really important.

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.340
&gt;&gt; Miriam Phillips: Thank you.

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:09.500
This is just the beginning.

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.940
I'm sorry.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:18.760
Maybe you can come up after
to ask some questions.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.330
I hope you'll -- first of all,

01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:24.380
a lovely reception here
so we do have some time.

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:27.910
And second of all, over the
next couple of days we're going

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:31.300
to be moving over to the
University of Maryland,

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:36.080
and we have both structured
sessions, but also there's plenty

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:43.010
of time to have more discussions
and share ideas and just

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:46.400
to again picking up again
on the last question.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:52.180
I think part of the -- remember,
this is called Reimagining,

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:56.060
Revisioning and Reimagining.

01:23:56.060 --> 01:24:02.860
There's also the level of
bringing back in what do the voices

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:08.220
of the people who are
representing the movement think

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:12.290
about what they're doing
and what they have to say

01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:15.720
and to bring some more
context back in.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:23.050 position:56%
So I think it's a very exciting time
of mapping a lot of ideas together

01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:28.010
and possibilities that we
have now in this 21st century.

01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:34.200
So I hope you'll be able to
join us over the next few days.

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.440
Thank you so much for
your wonderful memories
