(dramatic music)

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:06.439
- Welcome to This
Is Not Happening.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.774
I'm your host Roy Wood Jr.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:10.876

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.614
- Just listen to

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.249
- Whoa is this crazy?

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.518 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I have no idea but it's
fucking fun man, I know that.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.019
(cheers and applause)

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.520
- Your man Ari Shafir was
kind enough to hand over

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.689
the reins to me, what
you will see tonight

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.591 align:start size:81% position:19%
is fucking good
ass story telling.

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.428
- And she starts to go
like a fucking horse

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:29.929
in to my face.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.865
- Tonight we are telling
true stories about shame,

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start size:94% position:6%
moms, wasted, filth,
dads, romance, nightmares,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.869
strange lands, famous, combat.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.371
(shouts)

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.038 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I don't know if you guys
have ever cock blocked

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.306
a rapist before.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.941
- Fuck that I own
self insurance.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.577
- Well that's, just you
know, pretty bullshit.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.546
(audience laughs)

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.581 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The next 18
messages on my phone

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.383 align:start size:88% position:13%
were dudes really
trying hard to fuck me.

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:52.885 align:start size:84% position:16%
- All the signs were
there, you know,

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.621
she was distant, she wasn't
returning my phone calls

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.224
as quickly as she used to,
her pussy tasted like dick.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.993
- You think you've
hit rock bottom.

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:04.964 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I just stared into the
eye of my boyfriend's

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.066
ex-girlfriend's butt hole.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.634
- (imitates gun) Alright.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.004
- So I got a 45 pointed right
in the middle of my chest.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.806
- And I'm like oh fuck, I'm
gonna get shot in Arizona.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.676
- You can hear jokes anywhere,
motherfuckers coming up here

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:19.178
to tell you stuff that's
gonna get them uninvited

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:20.246
from thanksgiving.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.747
(groans)

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:23.115 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So in that moment I made
the decision, I'm like,

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:24.984
that's it, I'm gonna
fucking kill my dad.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:27.420 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's terrible that someone's
laughing at that part.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.688
(laughs)

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:29.956
- You're brilliant.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.758 align:start size:81% position:19%
- If I snorkeled on molly
with Donald Trump,

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.794
I would be up here right now
being like you don't know him

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.028
like I do.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.596
- Oh by the way,
I fucked a midget.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:38.831
- I guess the president figured

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.466
that would be a good
business competition.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.303
(audience laughs)

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.273 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh shit, crackers
are dead to me.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.008
- What do they put
in it, cigarettes?

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.677
(roars)

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:54.480
- So now this dudes on top of
me trying to bite my face off.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.349
- Ah you god damned baby.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.717
- When you hit somebody
that's trying to kill you

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:00.286
oh it feels great.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.622
- Hey for old times sake,
let's just drive to Mexico

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:05.291
and commit a federal crime.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.028 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh hey guys, this
ain't enough to show you

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.464 align:start size:84% position:16%
that there's
something very wrong.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.465
(intense music)

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:15.802
- And that's how I became
the host of the new season

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.536
of This Is Not Happening.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:22.742
(cheers and applause)
