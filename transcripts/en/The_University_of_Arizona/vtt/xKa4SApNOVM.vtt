00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.740
 Everything you learn is
interesting about honey bees,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.140
and I'm also very
interested in behavior.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.210
And especially like
social complexity

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.540
of a lot of the animals
really fascinates me.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.750
And honeybees have one
of the most complicated

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.802
social structures.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:24.760
Every day is different.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.135
Sometimes I'm in
here doing this,

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:29.130
sometimes I'm outside for
five hours with the bees

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.500
or doing molecular
stuff or anything.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.959
Every day is
completely different.

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:39.000
DUAN COPELAND: Everybody
knows how important bees

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.320
are to our environment.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.440
So I almost feel like
I'm able to contribute

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.950
to science helping us
understand honeybees

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.510
and how their microbes influence
their health and behavior.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.060
I was interested in
microbes since my time

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.700
as a medical laboratory
tech in the Army.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.530
Being able to contribute to
the growing body of knowledge

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.610
on honeybees has just been awe
inspiring and life changing.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.360
