00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.510
According to the Oxford English Dictionary,
the first recorded instance of dressing to

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.590
the nines was in the 1859 Dictionary of Slang,
by John Camden Hotten where it states: “‘dressed

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.970
up to the nines’, in a showy or recherché
manner.”

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.590
However, there is at least one earlier documented
instance, which seems to imply the expression

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.950
was common several decades before 1859.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.710
This can be found in The Progressive Dictionary
of the English Language published in 1835.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.440
Under the definition for “Nine” it states:

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.890
To the nines, to perfection; generally applied
to dress, and sometimes implying excess in

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.030
dressing… he or she was dressed up to the
nines.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:54.300
As you might have gathered from this, it appears
“to the nines” was around before it was

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.300
associated with clothing.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:04.170
For instance, over a century before the first
documented reference of “dressed to the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.830
nines,” we have the Epistle to Ramsay by
William Hamilton (1719), where he stated,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.170
The bonny Lines therin thou sent me, How to
the nines they did content me.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.170
From this, we can see how one would come up
with the expression “dressed to the nines”

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.810
from the existing expression more or less
meaning “perfect.”

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.390
Further, we can safely discount such often
put forth conjectures that the expression

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.500
“dressed to the nines” came from tailors
using nine yards of material to make a finely

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.150
crafted suit of clothing (which is also often
put forth as the origin of “the whole nine

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.393
yards,” which we cover the origin of in
full here.)

00:01:24.393 --> 00:01:25.393
That’s not to mention the fact that that
is an insane amount of material for just one

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:26.393
suit.

00:01:26.393 --> 00:01:27.393
Yet another commonly put forth explanation
we can then safely ignore is that it came

00:01:27.393 --> 00:01:29.530
from the 99th Wiltshire Regiment.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.600
Around the mid-19th century, this regiment
became known as “The Nines” and were particularly

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.900
noted for their perfect uniform and dress.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.240
In this case, both “dressed to the nines”
and “to the nines” were around long before

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.640
this regiment earned this reputation.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.799
So it’s likely they got this nickname because
of the already existing expression, rather

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:43.799
than inspiring it.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.970
So the real question is where did “to the
nines” come from?

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.640
We know from various documented references
that this goes back to at least the early

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.710
18th century, with most of the earliest uses
being in Scottish works such as the above

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.939
quoted Epistle to Ramsay by William Hamilton,
and several decades later in Poem on Pastoral

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.980
Poetry by Robert Burns (who is also partially
responsible for “Auld Lang Syne“):

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.760
Thou paints auld nature to the nines,
In thy sweet Caledonian lines…

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.210
Note he is describing how perfectly one illustrates
in writing.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.870
It’s possible that “to the nines” is
referencing the Nine Muses of Arts and Learning

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.470
(Clio, Erato, Calliope, Melpomene, Euterpe,
Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Urania, and Thalia).

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.269
There are several documented instances of
“those old nine which rhymers invocate”

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.269
(1600 Shakes.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.430
Sonn. xxxviii), or “the sacred wealth of
all the Nine” (1635 F. Quarles Emblemes

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.940
v. iii.), or in the 1687 work The Poetick
Miscellenies of Mr. John Rawlett (among others):

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.120
The learned tribe whose works the World do
bless,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.060
Finish those works in some recess;
Both the Philosopher and Divine,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.080
And Poets most who still make their address
In private to the Nine.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.080
Thus, in this origin theory “to the nines”
is so perfect it would be worthy of, or directly

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.080
inspired by, the Nine Muses.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.530
Besides Robert Burns using “to the nines”
referencing writing, in the aforementioned

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.330
1719 work, the Epistle to Ramsay by William
Hamilton, this also has “Nine Muses” connotations,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.960
again referencing someone’s well-crafted
writing: “The bonny Lines therin thou sent

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.310
me, How to the nines they did content me.”

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:14.190
The Nine Muses had been for some time commonly
referenced by poets with regards to writing.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.459
So perhaps these two earliest documented references
of “to the nines,” in both cases referring

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.140
to artful writing, hints that the expression
originally did indeed derive from referencing

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.140
the Nine Muses.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.490
In yet another theory proposed by etymologists,
“to the nines” is thought to be originally

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.680
simply a slurred way of saying “to then
anes,” meaning “for the one (occasion)”

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:51.680
or “for the one (purpose),” and it simply
evolved

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.090
from there.
