00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
This may come as a bit of a shock to you,
but I'm not super into personal grooming.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.040
Like I understand soap and shampoo.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.940
But there's all this other stuff now, and
I keep seeing references to pH balance everywhere.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.869
pH balanced soaps, and shampoos, and deodorant,
and makeup abound in supermarkets and drugstores.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.539
And I've even seen pH balanced water?!

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.279
We've talked a lot about balance over the
last couple of weeks,

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.109
and pH balance is related to the equilibrium
state of a reversible reaction.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.460
You're probably also familiar with the pH scale, and you know that it has to do with acids and bases.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.720
But what is pH exactly?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.150
And why is it weirdly written with a lowercase
'p' and a capital 'H'?

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.640
And also, what about pH's alter ego pOH?

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.600
The capitalization thing is probably the easiest
to answer, 'cause there is no answer.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.890
No one really knows what the 'p' means.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.660
The Danish chemist who came up with the term,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.850
a guy with the absolutely amazing name, Søren
Sørensen, never explained his reasoning.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.660
Some people think that it comes from some
form of the word power,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.720
whether it's puissance in French, or maybe
Latin, pondus.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.549
But it probably just came from a common habit
chemist have of differentiating a test solution,

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.649
labeled 'p', from a reference solution, called
'q'.

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.270
But thinking of the 'p' as standing for power,
does help us remember the meaning more easily.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.130
The 'H' part is even easier, it stands for
hydrogen.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.780
Because hydrogen ions, or protons, are pivotal to the behavior of acids and bases, which is what pH describes.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.939
So you can think of pH as basically the power
of hydrogen in a solution.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.149
The strength of the acid or base character
of a substance.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.689
And it all revolves around one very important
point of focus, our old friend water.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:46.000
[Theme Music]

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.179
If you've been watching Crash Course Chemistry
from the beginning you've gotten the message

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.740
that water is special in more ways than I
can list, and pH is just one more of those ways.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.060
We normally think of water as a perfectly neutral substance, neither acidic nor basic, and that's true.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.400
But, as I've mentioned before, water can also
function as an acid --

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.549
releasing hydrogen ions, also known as protons,
and as a base -- consuming them.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.260
How on Earth is that possible?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.950
In order to explain, we first have to understand
what the pH of a substance really tells us.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.980
While chemically we say that pH represents the power of hydrogen in a solution, it's mathematically defined as:

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.940
"the negative of the base 10 logarithm of
the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution."

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540
OK, so now that you're terrified, I'm here
to help.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.420
So, yeah, logarithms can seem a little bit scary at first, but the ones that we're using here are super easy.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.120
And bonus, once you get familiar with them here, it'll be that much easier to understand them in math class.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.260
So now that we got the scary mathematical definition, let's do the simplest mathematical definition.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.780
At any given moment, there will be a certain number of hydrogen ions in solution -- a very small number --

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.750
the concentration will be a number like one
times 10 to the negative fifty moles per liter.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.510
That negative 5, is your base 10 logarithm.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.970
Take the negative of that, and you get the
pH. 5.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.700
Now let's get a bit more in to the weeds.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.160
The logarithm, or log, of a number is the exponent to which another number, called the base,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.020
must be raised to produce the target number.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.970
So for base 10 logs, the base is 10.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.260
They're what we use most in chemistry, and
they're really easy to understand,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.480
and also what we base scientific notation
on.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.070
So as an example, the base 10 logarithm of
one hundred is 2.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.460
Because 10 raised to the power of 2, or 10
squared, equals one hundred.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.710
Base 10 logs are so common that we often leave
the subscript 10 off when we write it.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.350
Like if your calculator has a 'log' button,
that's just for base 10 logs.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.850
So what in the name of Søren Sørensen does
this have to do with face melting acids?

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.490
Well I'm getting to that, and it all starts with waters crazy potential to act as both an acid and a base.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.060
Random changes in the tiny electrical fields
around the atoms in water

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.330
occasionally cause the molecules to break
apart.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.900
Specifically a hydrogen ion, or proton, will break off from one molecule and attach itself to another one,

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.780
forming a hydronium ion, H3O+, and a hydroxide
ion, OH-.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.970
This is why water can act as both an acid
and a base.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.980
It's molecules can both release and accept
protons.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.510
In this case, it's only interacting with itself.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.230
But water can interact in the same way with
other acids and bases.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.609
Some times you'll see the hydronium ion written
as a simple hydrogen ion, H+,

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.720
allowing the reaction to be written with only
one water molecule.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.200
It's not technically accurate, but it's close enough to reality that it can be used to simplify things.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.500
So when we say that the pH is the negative
log of the hydrogen ion concentration...

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.480
yeah, we actually mean hydronium ion concentration.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.389
Just another thing that early scientists got
a little wrong and now we have to live with.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.070
Anyway, this dissociation of water is a reversible
reaction.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.090
And in fact, the ions always reform in to
water within a tiny fraction of a second.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.460
But it's happening all the time constantly.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.050
In your bottled water, in the water inside
your cells, and in the ocean. Always.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.280
However, at any given instant only a tiny
number of molecules are dissociated ions.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.680
In fact, the exact number of these molecules
is well known to chemists.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.910
It's the equilibrium constant for this reaction.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.480
And because it's such a special reaction, it has it's own name -- the water dissociation constant, or Kw.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.300
Kw is equal to one point zero times 10 to
the negative fourteenth.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.590
The formula for Kw is set up like any equilibrium
constant,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.430
concentrations of products over concentrations
of reactants,

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.610
all raised to the exponents based on the coefficients
of the balance reaction.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.530
There is however one difference.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.880
Because the ions represent such a tiny proportion of the total mass, the water itself is essentially pure.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.020
And pure substances, because they don't have concentrations, aren't included in equilibrium calculations.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.880
So the formula for Kw becomes simply the hydronium
ion concentration times the hydroxide concentration.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.700
According to the balanced equation for the
dissociation of water,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.060
hydronium and hydroxide are formed at a 1:1 ratio,

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.199
so their equilibrium concentrations must be
equal.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.380
That means if we call the concentration of
H3O+, for example 'x',

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.000
then the concentration of OH- must equal 'x'
as well.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.720
So the formula for the dissociation constant 1.0 x 10^-14 simplifies even further to x times x, or x squared.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.860
Suddenly, it's crazy easy.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.280
The equilibrium concentration of each ion
is just the square root of 1.0 x 10^-14.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.020
Touch one key on the 'ol calculator, and hello
both concentrations equal

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.060
1.0 x 10^-7 moles per liter in equilibrium.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.880
The pH then, is simply the negative log of
that, which is 7.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.050
This my friends, is the basis of the pH scale.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.030
Water is neutral, so 7 is the center of the
scale.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.410
And I can prove it too.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.290
This is a strip of paper that's been infused
with a chemical called litmus.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.530
Litmus is a pH indicator, a chemical that
turns different colors at different pHs.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.460
There are many different indicators, with many different colors, but we'll talk more about those next week.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:57.520
For now, just know that litmus paper turns pink in acids, blue in bases, and a sorta light purple when it's neutral.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.060
But one thing you need to remember about the
pH scale,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.770
because pH is calculated from a negative logarithm,
it turns everything backward.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.540
When the hydrogen ion concentration goes up,
the pH gets lower.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.660
For instance, if a little acid, such as vinegar,
were added to the water,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.630
the concentration of hydronium ion might rise
to say, 1.0 x 10^-4 moles per liter.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.419
Which is a thousand times more than before.

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.120
That concentration would push the pH down
to 4.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.229
On the other hand, a base, such as ammonia,

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.500
would consume a lot of hydrogen ions if it
were added to the water.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.889
If the hydrogen ion concentration drops to
1.0 x 10^-11,

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:36.880
a thousandth of the equilibrium concentration,
the pH would be eleven.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.190
As you can see, the logs turn out to be a
mathematical shorthand,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.940
that saves us from dealing with very huge
or very tiny numbers.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.250
The pH scale then is normally written from
0 to 14.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.220
With numbers below 7 representing acids, and
numbers above 7 representing bases.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.300
It could also below zero or above 14, but
that only happens in super extreme cases,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.460
that you are very unlikely to encounter.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.420
At least I hope.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.880
As with like hydrochloric or nitric acid,
which ionize strongly, sometimes even completely.

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:08.660
Thus releasing a lot of protons, are called
strong acids.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.240
Because they raise the hydrogen concentration
a lot, they also generally have very low pHs.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.710
Weak acids, like citric acid, dissociation
incompletely,

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.730
releasing much smaller amounts of hydrogen ions, and therefore they usually have higher pHs.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.530
Generally considered in like the 4 to 6 range.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.979
Strong bases meanwhile, like sodium hydroxide,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:32.400
consume large amounts of hydrogen ions leaving the concentration very low, so they 10d to have very high pHs.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.680
Weak bases, like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), consume much less, and generally have pHs in the 8-11 range.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:45.440
Neutral pH is technically just 7.0, but in a more practical sense, it's usually considered to be between 6 and 8.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.760
So if pH is based on the concentration of
hydrogen, that is hydronium ions,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.149
what about the concentration of hydroxide
ions?

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:58.420
Just as we can calculate the pH of a substance from it's hydrogen ion concentration, we can calculate the pOH.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.910
The negative log of the hydroxide concentration.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.990
This is easy because Kw never changes.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:10.240
Although the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide are only equal in pure water, or perfectly neutral solutions,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:18.100
the product of the 2 concentrations always
equals 1.0 x 10^-14 in any aqueous solution.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.520
So like orange juice, which is really just an aqueous solution of sugar and citric acid and a few other things,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.520
say the hydrogen concentration in your OJ
is 3.2 x 10^-4 moles per liter.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.340
Just for the fun of it, let's go ahead and calculate what the pH is at that point, which turns out to be 3.5.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.940
But we can also use the Kw and the hydronium
ion concentration

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.080
to do a very simple division problem and find
the hydroxide concentration.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.660
It works out to 3.1 x 10^-11 moles per liter.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.910
Once we have the concentration we can take
another step,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:51.350
we can find the pOH of the solution which is similar to the pH, simply the negative log of the OH concentration.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.050
The pOH in this case is 10.5.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.710
And now for a tip that's just more awesome
and cooler than an ice cream corn dog,

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.450
the sum of the pH and the pOH is always 14.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:09.240
In the example we just did, the pH was 5.4 and the pOH was 8.6, and yeah you add those together: 14! Surprise!

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.459
OK, maybe that's only cool to me.

00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:14.029
But that's never stopped me before, I love
this stuff!

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:18.500
And next week, I hope to really bend your mind by showing you how to make the pH of a solution hold steady,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.220
even if you dump a strong acid or base in
it.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.230
In the meantime, thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.640
If you paid attention, you learned

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.160
how pure water ionizes to form hydronium and
hydroxide ions in reversible reactions.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.209
And you learned about the equilibrium constant
for that reaction,

00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:37.360
which has a special name: the water dissociation
constant.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.770
You learned some examples of acids and bases
and neutral substances,

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.330
as well as why some acids and bases are called
strong and others are called weak.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.810
You learned about logarithms and how you can
use them to calculate the pH of a substance.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:55.010
And a little bit about pOH, which can be calculated
with logarithms, also with subtraction.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.740
And finally, you learned about some cool mathematical
connections between pH and pOH.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.570
