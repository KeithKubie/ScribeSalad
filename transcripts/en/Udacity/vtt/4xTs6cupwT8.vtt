00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.100
I hope you've been notice that the theme here in our units are different types

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.312
of expressions. We've been learning the skills into perform operations on

00:00:07.312 --> 00:00:12.166
polynomials, rational expressions, and now radicals. The last operation mean to

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:16.776
learn radicals is division. We can think of the division of two radicals as

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:21.793
fraction. We'll have root two divided by root five. But for radical

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:26.430
expressions, we don't want a radical to appear in the denominator. There are

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.811
few reasons why we want to change this. First, it's typically easier to

00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:33.166
approximate this division if we divide it by an integer here rather than a

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:37.519
radical. Secondly, we can determine if the expressions are equivalent to other

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.523
expressions by changing what this fraction looks like. Keep in mind that when

00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:44.437
we rationalize a denominator, we're going to change what the fraction looks

00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:48.850
like but we won't change it's value. What do you think we can multiply the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.170
numerator and denominator by so that we have a denominator without a radical?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.626
We want to multiply by a form of 1 here so whatever we multiply this

00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:02.730
denominator by, we'd also multiply this numerator by.
