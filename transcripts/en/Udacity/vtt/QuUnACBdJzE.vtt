00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.372
In this case, x would equal 4. Great solving if you found this number. Since we

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:09.464
have the log of 3 on both sides of the equation, we know that this number must

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:17.451
equal this number. So, we'll have 2x minus 1 equal to x plus 3. We'll subtract

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:23.028
x from both sides to get x minus 1 equals 3. Then we'll add 1 to both sides to

00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:28.056
get x equals positive 4. If we use some quick mental math, we can see that this

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:33.426
number will be seven and this number will also be seven. So we know the log of

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:39.392
base 3 of seven equals the log of base 3 of seven. Now, I don't actually know

00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:43.113
the log of base 3 of 7 but since the left side equals the right side, I have an

00:00:43.113 --> 00:00:50.153
equivalent relationship. My equation holds true when x equals 4.
