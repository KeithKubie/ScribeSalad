JENI FISHER: Thank you,
Tamzin, for the intro.

00:00:02.446 --> 00:00:05.330
So it's often said that
you are not your user.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.090
As smartphones find their way
into the hands of billions

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.920
of users, your assumptions on
how people will use your apps

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.060
will constantly be challenged.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.330
On one end of the spectrum,
you will find a new generation

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.400
of digital natives who
have no memory of a life

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.800
pre-smartphone.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.580
On the other hand, you'll
find older digital immigrants

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.990
that are only now
coming to terms

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.050
with smartphones and the
possibilities that they unlock.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.940
As we think about
how to build apps

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.610
for the shifting needs
and behaviors of users,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.430
it's my pleasure to welcome
our distinguished panel who

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.520
will share their experiences
in building products for vastly

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.140
different demographics.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.330
So we're joined today
by John Kneeland

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.200
from Bumble, which is a new
way to meet data network.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.470
We have Kemal Ugur,
the co-founder of AVCR,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.780
the developer behind Funimate--

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.370
a video editor and
creative community.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000
And Rojhan Ahmadi, who
leads product and is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.460
the founder of NeuroNation-- a
leading brain training program.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.090
So onto the first question--

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.220
do you feel that there's
a generational gap

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.930
in user's expectations
and behaviors on mobile?

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.340
Or is it more of a
sea change in behavior

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.320
that cuts across generations?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.210
And John, if you'd
like to go first?

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.415
JOHN KNEELAND: Sure,
I think it is--

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:21.165
well, I'm going to do
that annoying answer

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:24.010
where it's both.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.860
I think, it's effecting
how everyone works.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.880
You've got new apps
with new behaviors.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.890
The degree to which
it's, I guess,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.500
creating a true
change in how you act

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.930
depends on how much of a
lifetime of past behaviors

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.250
you have.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.020
If you're in your
40s or 50s, you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.780
have half a century of
behaviors and experiences

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.610
that you're grafting
on to a new app--

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.340
a new way of meeting people.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.890
Whereas if you're
younger, in my case

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.010
I sort of came into age as
this was also coming into age.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.540
Or if you're another
decade younger than I am--

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.950
which is depressing-- it's
really all you've ever known.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.660
And I've found I think the
degree to which it is changing

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.400
is directly tied to how
much experience pre-digital,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.956
pre-mobile, pre-social you had.

00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:11.660
JENI FISHER: Mm hm, great.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.620
KEMAL UGUR: So when it
comes to our audience,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.800
which is quite young--

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.765
so kids and teens--

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:20.060
we can see that they're
really the pro-users

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.960
and they're digital
natives compared to users

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.886
close to my age, for example.

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:29.000
They can really use all
the nitty-gritty details

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.140
of the tools we provide to them.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.030
So definitely when it comes
to these younger generations,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.530
you can see that they are much
more mobile-first and much more

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.487
digital native compared
to the older generation.

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:43.319
JENI FISHER: Great.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.860
ROJHAN AHMADI: Yeah, so I will
be talking now about the older

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.980
people, though our app, of
course, has also younger ones.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.780
But regarding the old people,
we have this aging population

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.640
in general in society.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.610
And in Germany, for example,
20% of the population

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.640
is 65 years old or older.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.580
And you need to
imagine that by 2030,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.750
every third German citizen
will be 65 years old or older.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.650
So the demographics
are changing a lot.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.490
And these guys are different
than these young hipsters

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.250
that we have right now a
lot of times in the apps.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.240
So with them, for
example, there's

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.030
two things that I think
are a lot different.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.560
So one thing is perception.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.950
The other thing is understanding
computer interfaces.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.470
For perception-- of
course as you age,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.910
your ability to see
things, to perceive things,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.690
is not as strong anymore as
it was when you were young.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.060
So that for example, for our app
we once built a version of it--

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.700
brain training app--
specifically for the elderly.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.090
And we did this in
cooperation with a company

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.060
that provided a rent--

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.440
rest houses-- rest homes.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.990
So there, we had to take
care of the visuals.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.650
For example, some colors
cannot be perceived as good.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.950
So you have to take care not
only of increasing font sizes,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.850
but also changing the
assets of your app.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.967
And that's some things
that we look at.

00:04:13.967 --> 00:04:16.550
JENI FISHER: So it sounds like
everyone here should definitely

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.040
anticipate that aging
audience and think

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.790
about how you can prepare
as well with your product.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.614
So for most of you, you are
not your target audience.

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:29.030
So how do you make sure that
you're building products that

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.006
really meet their user needs?

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:33.380
KEMAL UGUR: So
maybe I can start.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.350
So for us, we have a big
beta tester user base.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.190
And we have some
internal people closer

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.240
to that demographics and age
that talks with them almost

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.140
every day.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.210
So we get a lot of feature
requests from our beta testers.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.200
And sometimes we bring new
features and they fine tune,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.790
and they give us some insights
that we don't really knew

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.190
beforehand.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.740
And also, we look at how
they use the existing

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.720
features of our app.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.190
And we get ideas to make
certain parts more efficient

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.370
or bring new features based
on what they actually do.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.080
So it's really the constant
communication-- very close

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.360
communication-- with
these active star

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.190
users of our community.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.200
JENI FISHER: Great.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.700
So how about you, John?

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.200
JOHN KNEELAND: I
think there's sorts

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.370
of two parts of the
flow of information

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.080
that you need to
look at and adjust

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.840
to deal with people who are in
a very different demographic

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.700
than yourself.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.680
The first is the distance
from the entire world

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.080
up to my ears and eyes.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.970
And then, the second
bit of distance--

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.190
which is so much smaller
and yet so much harder--

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.800
is the distance from
there to my brain,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.620
and actually understanding it
and internalizing these things.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.620
In the first case, I think
Bumble is fortunate-- well,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.390
not fortunate.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.870
They tried really hard
and they succeeded--

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.770
in building up a
incredibly powerful network

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.890
of young people around
university campuses

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.620
and in other parts of
life around that age

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.320
to encourage them to use
the product, to get feedback

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.610
from them.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.290
And the workforce
of Bumble itself

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.660
is also predominantly female
and five to 10 years younger

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.290
than I am.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.770
And so I'm fortunate
that there's

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.564
no shortage of data
coming in, along,

00:06:31.564 --> 00:06:33.730
of course, with all the
wonderful analytics tools we

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.900
get from Google and like to look
at how they're using the app.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.780
But the second part
though, was the sea change

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.150
and realizing that you are--

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.290
as the product manager--

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.750
you are not building
something for yourself.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.550
You are a servant of the
company and its customers.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.160
And you truly have to listen to
these people, who even if they

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.000
are younger than you, they don't
have all the degrees that you

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.590
do, or the life
experience you do,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.670
they have an experience
that is every bit as valid--

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.320
in the case of this
particular product,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.170
more valid and more important.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.670
So I think those
two chunks are what

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.479
you have to deal with
and focus on the most.

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:13.270
JENI FISHER: Great.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.353
ROJHAN AHMADI: Yeah, what
we look at-- in addition

00:07:15.353 --> 00:07:16.840
to, of course, the data--

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.270
what's interesting to us
is what our customer care

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.560
teams tells us.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.460
So their people call
us, and then they

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.230
have questions on the product.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.380
And in these cases, you get
this qualitative feedback.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.280
While you listen how they
talk, you see that they--

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.900
for example, the old people--

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.700
they really don't understand
the computer interfaces.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.440
This is not natural to them.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.265
For example, you would
listen to something like--

00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:45.290
you would ask them, so
what is your browser?

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.910
How do you open up a website?

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.900
And then they would
say, what is a browser?

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.390
So then you would
ask them, OK, how

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.160
do you get into the internet?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.990
And they would say,
well, with Google.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.080
And they don't mean Chrome,
they mean the search engine.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.590
So they don't really
get the concept of that.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.270
And also, they don't get
the concept of an app store.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.820
So this is what
we have right now.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.010
Of course they learn,
but they didn't grow up

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.280
with these things, so it
takes some time for them

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.257
to get this in their head.

00:08:18.257 --> 00:08:20.590
JENI FISHER: So taking into
account what you've all just

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.290
said about how you're building
for people that are slightly

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.140
different to yourselves,
what impact does this have

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.690
on the way that you think
about your product roadmapping

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.250
technologies to build in?

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.110
KEMAL UGUR: So
one thing I didn't

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.630
know before I started
the company is

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.130
how much these young
generation was creative

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.190
and how much they have this
internal creative engine that

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.670
is looking for ways
to show to the world.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.930
So basically now,
we're all doubling down

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.880
on building these creative
tools so that they can--

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.670
the audience can-- show
off their creativity.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:09.390
So using all these new
hardware features helps a lot

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.500
from Google, and really
trying to translate it

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.555
to an easy-to-use
fashion for our audience.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.220
JOHN KNEELAND: I think
in the case of Bumble,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.824
it's forced me to
re-evaluate assumptions

00:09:25.824 --> 00:09:28.240
that I wouldn't have even--
it wouldn't have even occurred

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.930
to me that there's a different
way of doing things now.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.780
I think one of the most
concrete examples I have is

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.260
when we were in the process
of building Bumble Bizz--

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.750
which was released on
Android today in Germany.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.760
Go download it and play with it.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.120
A business networking twist
on Bumble to do more than just

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.290
meet people for dating--

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.310
we needed to find a way
of importing your jobs

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.680
and your work history or
education history into the app.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.600
And I think anyone
of age 29 or higher

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.790
would just automatically
think, well obviously,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.410
you go to LinkedIn--

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.000
clear as day.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.291
It's like going to Google
for a search, you just do it.

00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:07.530
Or I guess in the case of
Germany, you'd use Xing--

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.510
Xing-- that one.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.340
But in the case of
these people, when

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.820
I went to share these plans
with my younger colleagues--

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.390
I mean, it wasn't so bad that
they said, what's LinkedIn.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.430
They did know what LinkedIn
was, but that was something

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.260
that old people use.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.970
And that was just so
mind boggling to me

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.240
because how could you not
use a networking thing?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.854
How are you going to find a job?

00:10:30.854 --> 00:10:32.345
Shrug.

00:10:32.345 --> 00:10:33.340
Wow.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.350
So we had to
re-evaluate of the core.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.840
How are we going to get--

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.770
given our limited time
to get this done--

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.130
how do we get this in?

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.506
In the end, we
went with Facebook

00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:44.755
because they're are apparently
just telling everything

00:10:44.755 --> 00:10:45.380
to Facebook.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.270
I think now in
another five years,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:51.010
we're going to find that the
18-year-olds in five years

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.150
are going to be not
even on Facebook.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.120
I don't know, we'll pull it
from Snapchat or something.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.790
ROJHAN AHMADI: Well,
for our roadmap

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.710
there's, for example, one
quite interesting project on it

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.120
for the elderly.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.051
It's about digitalizing
dementia assessments.

00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:08.425
And we do this in
a collaboration

00:11:08.425 --> 00:11:11.530
with the [? charity ?]
clinics, the German Institute

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.569
of Artificial Intelligence.

00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:15.610
The project is also funded
by the German Ministry

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.530
of Education and Research.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.710
And this is a long-term
project, as you can hear.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.740
And for digitalizing
dementia assessment,

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.620
we look at how it's done
right now in the clinics.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.440
And there, the patient
talks to the doctor,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.600
the doctor asks some
things, and based on this,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.310
the doctor calculates
a score that

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.410
goes into dementia assessment.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.590
So as you can see, this
is a natural conversation.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.270
It's not a strange
computer interface.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.100
So we hope a lot in the
natural language processing,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.680
so that we can replace
these kind of things

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.420
with assistance
that can then lead

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.370
the conversation
with the patient

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.820
and assess this
risk in dementia.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.550
And on top of that, it
will be even more reliable.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.780
Because right now for some tests
in dementia assessment, one out

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.470
of 10 times, the doctor
calculates it wrong.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.710
So that's quite important
to do this right

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.870
and to offer the right
interface to the old people.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.795
JENI FISHER: Great.

00:12:12.795 --> 00:12:15.770
And so there's growing awareness
that technology has the power

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.250
to do good and also to do bad.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.530
And so of course,
do you feel that you

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.050
have a real responsibility
towards being mindful

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.607
of your users and their
overall well-being?

00:12:27.607 --> 00:12:29.440
KEMAL UGUR: So when it
comes to-- especially

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.470
for kids and teens,
we try to make

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.540
the community as safe
as possible and suitable

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.400
for their age.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.780
And we have a lot
of tools internally

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.370
that we use to moderate
against, for example, bullying.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.810
Something that I learned also,
after I founded this company,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.200
was bullying was a big
problem in this demographics.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.310
So we have both
community-powered tools,

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:05.100
where people can flag up certain
comments or certain profiles,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.300
and we have internal
people looking at things.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.550
Adult content we thought was
going to be a big problem.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.190
We had all these tools
to filter those out,

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.320
but that didn't turn out to be
as big as a bullying problem.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.200
So definitely.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.360
I mean, people nowadays--

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.840
this is where they spend
most of their time.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.030
And when we see
all these reports

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.580
where when they get a
bad comment from a person

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.010
that they don't
know, they feel down.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.930
We get comments
from their parents

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:43.000
that now their kids are
crying or not feeling bad.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.170
So there's all these.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.026
And we're not still there yet.

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:47.650
There's a lot of
things to still to do.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.260
But definitely I think
as app developers,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.440
we have this
responsibility to protect

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.870
or have a safe environment.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.390
JOHN KNEELAND: I
absolutely think

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.850
that we, as companies and
the people behind them,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:08.200
have a responsibility to be
custodians of our users' time

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.890
and responsible for
their quality of life,

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.120
especially with
the younger ones.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.280
Because again,
they're just coming

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.290
in to digital
technology in life.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.930
And anything we do
is going to play

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.820
a much stronger
role in determining

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.220
how they go through life
than it would for say,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.700
someone in their
40s, or 30s, or 50s--

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.380
sort of a great power,
great responsibility thing.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.310
And within that though, I
think it isn't necessarily

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.380
against your
self-interest to do so.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.460
It's not just the
right thing to do.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.650
I think it's also,
in most cases,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.200
the best thing to do
for your business.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.110
If you pursue pointless
vanity metrics,

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.669
like the number of minutes
somebody spends in your app,

00:14:52.669 --> 00:14:54.210
then yeah, you'd
optimize to just try

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.050
to always distract
them, always get them

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.410
at their most vulnerable
point, and try to get them in--

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.951
which might be great
for that metric,

00:14:59.951 --> 00:15:01.380
but it's not great for them.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.750
And maybe it's not great
for more important metrics,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.810
like how much they convert
to being a paid customer.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.600
In the case of Bumble,
we know from the data

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.490
there are certain
times of the day

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.437
and of the week when engagement
is the most valuable.

00:15:15.437 --> 00:15:17.520
There are actual times of
day when people are more

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.800
likely to be swiping right.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.080
It's definitely
not Monday morning.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.720
And we build around that.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.440
And I think we found that even
if you optimize for the highest

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.180
quality engagement
as opposed to just

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.820
the most engagement
possible, you'll

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.730
have an experience
that is better

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.310
for you and your
bottom line, and also

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.885
better for them and the
society that we all live in.

00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:43.260
ROJHAN AHMADI:
Well, I also think

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.820
we're responsible, of course--

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.850
especially coming
from a health company.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.510
And so we should
not give users--

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.780
we should not help them
build unhealthy habits.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.830
Yeah, of course, we take
the time of our users,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.140
but it should be reasonable.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.380
And right now, of course, the
incentive for us developers

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.580
is to, more short-term, take
the maximum amount of time

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.990
that we can.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:11.160
And this can lead to
establishing unhealthy habits.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.230
However, if really AI is
going to revolutionize health,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.840
and if there will be massive
amounts of data and user

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.360
tracking, then what if
the future AI assistant

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.960
actually will be able to reveal
unhealthy habits to users.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.680
So helping them to see
where they are actually

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.660
maybe spending too much time.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.520
If this works out,
then of course,

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.520
we developers will
have more incentive

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.570
to help them build a--

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.020
establish a healthy
relationship with us

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.979
and not an unhealthy one.

00:16:44.979 --> 00:16:46.270
JENI FISHER: And I fully agree.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.050
I think having that
user-centric approach to design

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.030
is not only good, of
course, for your users,

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.670
but even more so for
your bottom line as well.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.760
And so what would
be your number one

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.160
piece of advice to
developers on dealing

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.670
with the generational gap?

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.849
KEMAL UGUR: I mean, I cannot
talk with all the generations

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:09.210
and demographics, but I can
only speak the audience that

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.780
I'm very familiar with,
which are these youngsters.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.920
And they're digital natives.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.400
They can use your product in
ways that you cannot maybe

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.859
imagined or you haven't
imagined before you released it.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:27.240
So try to keep it as
flexible as possible.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.774
And try to get
feedback very quickly.

00:17:29.774 --> 00:17:31.440
They are very eager
to provide feedback.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.660
And they feel engaged, and they
feel part of the community,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.350
so don't be scared
to ask their feedback

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.360
and be engaged with the app.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.880
As what we found was
they are more than

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.880
willing to help the developer,
especially if they like the app

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.105
and if they like the product.

00:17:52.904 --> 00:17:53.695
JENI FISHER: Great.

00:17:53.695 --> 00:17:56.320
What about you, John?

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.700
JOHN KNEELAND: As
succinctly as possible--

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.690
talk less and listen more.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.590
Being less succinct, I would
say it is important to--

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.980
when you do talk,
start with questions,

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.120
and make them
open-ended questions.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.890
I think there are
certain dynamics of age,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.190
and status, and gender, that
if you start with a statement,

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.570
it can bias what
sorts of answers

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.140
you're getting
from these people.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.680
So I think it's
very important to--

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.380
when you are asking
these questions-- make

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.840
them questions, make
them open-ended.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.450
And you'll be
surprised where they go

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.060
and glad you found out, instead
of developing it and finding

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.292
out the hard way.

00:18:36.292 --> 00:18:38.500
ROJHAN AHMADI: So what I
would suggest for the future

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.800
is really to start
just understanding

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.510
the demographical change.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.177
Start understanding that
these old people will come.

00:18:46.177 --> 00:18:48.760
And right now, they're maybe at
their desktop or their laptops

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.830
using web applications.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.240
But as they grow
more into mobile

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.910
and into whatever kind of
technologies we will have,

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.060
it makes sense to
learn how they think,

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.050
and what abilities they have,
and what kind of interfaces--

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.120
for example, natural
language processing--

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.860
we can offer them to
enable also older people

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.439
to use our products.

00:19:13.439 --> 00:19:14.230
JENI FISHER: Great.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.480
So that's it for my questions.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.430
So now, I'd like to hand
it over to the audience

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.390
to ask any questions as well.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.950
Thank you.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.216
Any questions?

00:19:31.216 --> 00:19:33.090
JOHN KNEELAND: Guess
we've solved everything.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.020
JENI FISHER: Yeah.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.160
There we go.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.980
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.380
So judging from the fact that
people who are 14 years old

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.710
are, kind of, still
don't know who

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.869
they're going to become in
three or in four years--

00:19:48.869 --> 00:19:51.160
and the same happens with
people who when there are 70,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.570
they don't know who they're
going to be in five years--

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.800
how do you compute
customer lifetime value

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.117
in these circumstances?

00:20:02.152 --> 00:20:04.110
ROJHAN AHMADI: So
calculating customer lifetime

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.374
value for old people--
this is what you're about?

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:10.290
AUDIENCE: Both for young
and for old, I guess.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.510
It's just the general
idea of how do you

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.485
deal with the uncertainty
in that age group?

00:20:15.485 --> 00:20:17.110
ROJHAN AHMADI: You
mean the uncertainty

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.360
that they will be alive or what?

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that
in particular but--

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.860
I mean, like their
retirement fund

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.540
could go bust
because of the bank.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.372
And people who are 14
years old, they still

00:20:29.372 --> 00:20:31.080
don't have any money
right now, but maybe

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.649
they will have it later.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:35.190
ROJHAN AHMADI: Well, I can just
tell about the older people--

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.340
that these are the most
loyal ones actually.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.800
Because once they
are your customers,

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.060
they actually are not
interested in exploring

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.070
all of the different
options that they can do.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.350
It's also a cognitive
overload, of course.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:56.460
So also, we know that
old people are a lot more

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.610
sticking to their commitments--
to their own commitments.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.460
Trust is a lot more
important to them.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.810
So once they find that you
are a trustworthy partner,

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.440
you actually have longer
lifetime values with those

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.410
then with the younger ones,
who just jump from one app

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.420
to the next.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.615
That's what I can tell
about the older ones.

00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:15.990
KEMAL UGUR: For
the young ones, I

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.050
think the customer lifetime
value is a difficult thing

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.130
to compute anyway.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.095
So we basically use the same
techniques that everyone use,

00:21:25.095 --> 00:21:29.070
so we don't do anything
specific for younger ones.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:31.950
But what Rojhan mentioned
about the younger ones

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.880
is quite true-- that they can
switch from different apps

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.170
if they get bored.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.350
So what we do is try
to keep it fresh.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.330
We try to make weekly releases.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.620
Try to bring new content all the
time, so that the younger ones,

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.680
they're always thinking that
the app is always fresh,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.550
so that they don't
switch that quickly.
