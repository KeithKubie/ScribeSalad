00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] And this can be done in a single line of code.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You construct the list W by appending

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the output of the function measurement_prob() applied to the [i] particle

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with the argument of the actual measurement,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and as you can see over here most of them look insanely unlikely.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, they have exponents -146, -24.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Some of them are more likely--the ones that are closer to the truth like -5.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Those are the particles that should really survive,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
whereas those ones over here with a -126,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
those are really ready to die off

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because they are so far away from the truth we really don't need them anymore.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, in the final step of the particle filter algorithm,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we just have to sample particles from P

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
with a probability that is proportional to its corresponding W value.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Particles in P that have a large value over here

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
should be drawn more frequently than the ones with a small value over here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.381
How hard can that be.
