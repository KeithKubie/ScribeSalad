00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; I came from Bonn, from Germany, and with
my colleague Tom Arnold,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.520
we want to briefly talk about Haiti.
One of my first jobs was in Haiti in the early

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.820
1980s.
I worked on poverty and hunger and agriculture.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.289
I was deeply impressed by Haiti's rural communities,
what they did with

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:36.520
meager resources, investing in the health
of the children and their

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.079
education.
But I was -- as many are -- deeply depressed

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.780
by government's situation
of the country at that time.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.739
Tom, my colleague, just comes back from Haiti,
and is one of the best

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.710
sources on what's going on now and how you
can help.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.410
&gt;&gt; Yes, I came back from Haiti.
I visit Haiti 4 to 5 days after the earthquake.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.970
I visited there because I feel concern about
our organization has been

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.080
working in Haiti for the past 16 years.
So when I was there, our immediate issue was

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.000
how to get and how to make
our contribution to the immediate needs of

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.780
the people.
I was deeply struck by their dignity and calm

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.170
in a terrible situation.
Our focus was get water to people and beginning

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.030
to look at shelter
situation and on getting food.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.960
And that has remained our focus in the intervening
ten days.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.570
I think at this stage, the international community
is beginning to get

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.860
its act together on the aid front, and I think
they should appear at

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.340
the World Economic Forum to bring together
the Clinton Global

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.920
Initiative and the UN and the World Economic
Forum is highly

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.430
commendable.
[INAUDIBLE] short term needs more [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.350
and the NGOs for the
medium to longer term goal on getting more

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.989
invest to Haiti this
initiative is extremely vital.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.640
&gt;&gt; What I learned in Davos, Tom, is that other
than many of the media

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.989
reports, those who have been on the ground
were deeply impressed by

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.760
good government engagement and NGOs and civil
society.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.349
So I think those who have donated money, resources
and have thought

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.909
about Haiti, can feel a lot better then about
the aid reaching the

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:38.949
poor.

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.879
&gt;&gt; Yes, I think some of the early comments
from the press in the few

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.390
days after the disaster were, I would say,
unfair.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.640
I think there was not sufficient accounting
of the scale of the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.760
devastation that effected the country in terms
to the damage to the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.040
government, both physical and the people and
the physical

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.010
infrastructure, the whole communications systems
were completely

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.819
knocked out.
So there was a huge task.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.150
It was inevitable, I think, it was going to
take a little time to start

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.329
get the aid flowing.
That has now I think begun to happen.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.060
Although certainly not fast enough.
There's a real need to get food or general

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.500
distribution of food to the
population.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.540
But, you know, that's where the challenge
faces, the NGOs on the ground

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.389
faces, the UN agencies to really work effectively
together and I that

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:38.010
is -- and I'm confident that is happening.
