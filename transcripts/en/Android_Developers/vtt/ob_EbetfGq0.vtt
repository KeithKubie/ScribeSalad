DANIEL PHAM: Hi.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.638
My name is Daniel Pham, and
welcome to This Week in Android

00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:15.162
Development for Monday,
January 13, 2014.

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.620
Over the past few
weeks, we've been

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.969
hard at work making Android
better, faster, and stronger.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.510
That doesn't mean we weren't in
the studio producing episodes

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.990
of your favorite
content, though.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.698
So make sure you check
out Android Design

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:28.380
in Action's recap of all
their shows from 2013.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.070
We also had Nazmul and Paul
Saxman explain what context is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.160
and why it matters
on an episode of UXD.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.350
Todd continues his
infiltration with Lesson 2.2

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.630
in his series on
Play Games for iOS.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.650
And finally, Dan
Lavelle introduced us

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.760
all to a new series
we're calling PlayBytes.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.360
Not to be forgotten, our team
members in Japan and Korea

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.445
released a few dev and
design bytes as well,

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:52.590
including ActionBarCompat
and ChromiumWebView,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.242
in both Japanese and Korean.

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.950
We've got a ton of
new content coming out

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.130
in the next few weeks,
so make sure you

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.400
subscribe to our channel.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.650
That's all for this week
in Android Development.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.700
I'm Daniel Pham.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.366
It's in the palm of
your hand now, baby.

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.976
It's a yes or a no; no maybe.
