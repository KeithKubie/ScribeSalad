00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 Sheep ... were not always woolly. 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.520
 We have contributed to increasing their wool by encouraging more sheep to reproduce more in every generation 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.400
 This is the domestication: modification of wild animals for better human use. 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.880
 As we saw in Part I, for humans in ancient times, animals were powerful tools 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.260
 ... food, clothing, transport and tractors. 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.960
 However, although there are animals everywhere, however, the domestication has been on a few in pre-modern times. 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.160
 Why are these animals so domesticated? 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.900
 What do you think we should create a list of requirements for the domestication? 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.440
 First: Easy to feed 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.080
 The cow is a machine turning the grass into a steak. 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.060
 And the whole tiger turns the flesh into ... a tiger. 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.040
 Ten pounds of grass produces a pound of flesh. Ten pounds of meat produce a pound of tiger. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.500
 ... but the two results have the same number of calories - so just eating cow will save yourself a lot of work. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.060
 Therefore, carnivores will not breed, just because of thermodynamics. 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.340
 Research is actually about animals eating the herbs available without conditions and complexity 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.560
 What is required is that animals eat something that is abundantly available but humans do not consume it to eat 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.280
 Animals and carnivores prefer not to require specific eating options and are well worth the effort 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.980
 Generally, we put the pig before the fence because we first have to prose an animal ... 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.640
 friendly 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.700
 Well, obviously catching meat eaters is a bad idea anyway because their profession in life is murder. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 But a lot of carnivores like bears enjoy killing. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.220
 There is no safety in vegetarians as well: buffaloes are terrifying tanks for all the reasons mentioned before ... 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.940
 ... Hippo is the biggest killer in Africa 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.560
 ... The giraffes look stupid / stupid until we notice the extent of their beatings, even the blacks often avoid them 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.920
 Animals that seem easy to domesticate, are not coincidental because they are not dangerous 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.600
 War bears are a great advantage for your tribe, but this will not happen. 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.840
 If the animal is large and not dangerous, it is very tense! 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.820
 Try to sneak on a gazelle? This joke "lol!" 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.120
 Sure, you and your friends can spend a full day with their appendages until they get tired ... 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.880
 ... but if the gazelle does not break his neck himself while trying to drag him to your home 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.700
 ... He will jump and flee easily from the fence he built for him 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.680
 In general, the following point: Some animals have - humming - a reproductive mood 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 Making them unfit for families. And we mean you Panda! 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 Time and energy spent by people to try to encourage panda to reproduce laughable! 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.680
 Fishermen need an animal eager to reproduce, so much so that it tries to reproduce with the wrong things sometimes 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.180
 ... It is not an animal that requires us to closely follow their breeding seasons 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.800
 So: friendly, easy to feed, and - affectionate. 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.580
 It also needs to grow up quickly. 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.680
 This leads us to the crucifixion of the subject of childbearing in exchange for grooming. 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.900
 Again: Animal domestication is changing it to make it better for us. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.540
 And a side note here: we plant plants too. 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.920
 They are so terribly rich / delicious from their wild origin 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.560
 So when the hippie community talks about going back to nature, they forget that these plants are just like making a man like this. 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.860
 Anyway, back to animals ... 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.700
 The success of the pork conclusion project is that the generations of pigs are shorter than human generations. - 10 new pigs every four months - 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.440
 One intelligent person can make progress in a pig project during his life 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.300
 For comparison: Elephants. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 Two years for young elephants, five years between births, nine years to female maturity, fifteen years for males? 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.480
 This is a joke you elephants! We do not have time for this! 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.360
 But humans can tame elephants. You capture Phil, and train him not to fear humans. Then use it for any purpose 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.840
 But the elephants' domestication requires accurate records over several generations of humans ... 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.300
 ... Not to mention that tame one or two incredibly expensive elephants 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.340
 ... This is why the war vile is rare and only in complex and sophisticated societies. 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.820
 The naughty elephants \ pet are of luxury, so this is the rule: if it is in a farm, it's domesticated \ domesticated, if in the circus, it is uncircumcised. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.500
 Finally: Families. 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.460
 Well: Zebra compared to horses. 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.620
 Horses have changed the course of civilizations. It is worth noting that from thousands of years BC to the Telegav ... 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.800
 A man on horseback is considered the best internet available! (comunnication tool) 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.700
 The horses were domesticated in Europe and Asia, but the beginning of humans was in Africa that had a zebra ... 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.520
 Why did not the first man ride on the back of the zebra to invade the world? 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.780
 Because the zebra is cursed. They live on kicking and biting: this is a danger in the pre-penicillin world. - Your hand is inflamed? nice to meet you :( - 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.420
 The mulberry has a reactive reaction that is very difficult to catch. 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.880
 In addition to being an abhorrent animal, zebra lacks a family structure. 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 Horse herds have a hierarchy - you can see that when they travel in a straight line: the male, then the female top, then her children, then the second female, her children, and so on. 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.680
 When a man tames the head of a herd of horses, he imposes himself as the head of the new herd 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.100
 Many domesticated animals are now domesticated, because humans have exploited their family pyramid 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.740
 Animals breed and grow up with the principle that this man is somehow the head of the herd responsible ... no problem! 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.060
 The chickens will click and click some of them until they are absorbed by the larger hen 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.920
 But do you know who is the biggest chicken? We are the biggest chicken! 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.020
 Dogs and cats: This is what makes them different. 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.860
 Dogs will love you and defend you and hunt with you because you are part of the herd for them 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.320
 Living dogs to be useful to us - this in our modern world means falling to pretend death! - But they love it! 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.160
 "Excellent dog! Excellent dog!" [Laugh] 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.180
 ... while a cat is a small tiger living in your home. 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.420
 Overall, back to these! 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.540
 For the zebra, there is no such thing as a herd or community. 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.280
 They live in groups just because it is an excellent way to survive and live. But they do not care about communities 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.460
 Grab a zebra and you'll notice that his family will leave him, try to ride him and you will be lucky if you escaped your fingers! 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.340
 Wild donkeys appear similar to horses from the outside, but different from the inside 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.340
 So the requirements are: friendly - can be fed - and affection - family / social 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.500
 It's not a big requirement, but for hunters, any animal they want to domesticate, it needs all the requirements 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.940
 ... This is why in the history of ancient man, only a limited number of large animals have been domesticated. 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.820
