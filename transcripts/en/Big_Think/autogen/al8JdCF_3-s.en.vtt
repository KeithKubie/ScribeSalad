greatest challenges they have is finding
 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.720
greatest challenges they have is finding
a well qualified workforce and and

a well qualified workforce and and
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400
a well qualified workforce and and
that's at a baseline level that we're

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
that's at a baseline level that we're
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.620
that's at a baseline level that we're
not talking necessarily people with

not talking necessarily people with
 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.229

educational levels we really are not
 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.350

attracting many there were as many young

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
attracting many there were as many young
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720

people as we should particularly to not
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.060
people as we should particularly to not
only get first degrees in these fields

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
only get first degrees in these fields
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.340
only get first degrees in these fields
but to move on and get graduate degrees

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
but to move on and get graduate degrees
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.100
but to move on and get graduate degrees
now fortunately for us we've been able

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110
now fortunately for us we've been able
 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.100
now fortunately for us we've been able
to attract really exquisite talent from

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
to attract really exquisite talent from
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.200
to attract really exquisite talent from
abroad and so that's been kind of the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
abroad and so that's been kind of the
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.749
abroad and so that's been kind of the
secret sauce that we've always been able

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759
secret sauce that we've always been able
 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.599
secret sauce that we've always been able
to attract talent from abroad but you

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:11.609
to attract talent from abroad but you
 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.709
to attract talent from abroad but you
know what other countries now they're

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719
know what other countries now they're
 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.370
know what other countries now they're
emulating our model they're creating

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
emulating our model they're creating
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.019

enterprises with a lot of government
support and they are beginning to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
support and they are beginning to
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.010
support and they are beginning to
attract many of these educated people in

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
attract many of these educated people in
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.139
attract many of these educated people in
the sciences and engineering back home

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149
the sciences and engineering back home
 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.050
the sciences and engineering back home
but there's a global race for talent so

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
but there's a global race for talent so
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.819
but there's a global race for talent so
they're also being attracted to places

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
they're also being attracted to places
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.099
they're also being attracted to places
that may not be back home but they're

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109
that may not be back home but they're
 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:49.039
that may not be back home but they're
not necessarily countries that are where

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
not necessarily countries that are where
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.809
not necessarily countries that are where
we would think and so that means they

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819
we would think and so that means they
 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.449
we would think and so that means they
aren't necessarily staying here so yes I

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459
aren't necessarily staying here so yes I
 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.639
aren't necessarily staying here so yes I
think there is still a quiet crisis

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
think there is still a quiet crisis
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.269
think there is still a quiet crisis
because it's a subtle point it's quiet

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279
because it's a subtle point it's quiet
 

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:02.989
because it's a subtle point it's quiet
because we sort of don't know what the

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999
because we sort of don't know what the
 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.690
because we sort of don't know what the
situation is until it's upon us partly

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
situation is until it's upon us partly
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.809
situation is until it's upon us partly
because people quietly retire there

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
because people quietly retire there
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.290
because people quietly retire there
trends that that occur but we don't see

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
trends that that occur but we don't see
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.220
trends that that occur but we don't see
the real underlying trend for years

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
the real underlying trend for years
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.649
the real underlying trend for years
but also it takes a long time to create

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659
but also it takes a long time to create
 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.780
but also it takes a long time to create
a high functioning a theoretical

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
a high functioning a theoretical
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.170
a high functioning a theoretical
physicist or a nuclear engineer and so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
physicist or a nuclear engineer and so
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.220
physicist or a nuclear engineer and so
it's a time factor that that makes us

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
it's a time factor that that makes us
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.369
it's a time factor that that makes us
you know not see it in addition a lot of

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379
you know not see it in addition a lot of
 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.350
you know not see it in addition a lot of
the technologies that we take for

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
the technologies that we take for
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.089
the technologies that we take for
granted and where a lot of the cool

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099
granted and where a lot of the cool
 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.729
granted and where a lot of the cool
things come from whether we're talking I

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739
things come from whether we're talking I

pod x' or iPads or or Kindles or X boxes
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.979
pod x' or iPads or or Kindles or X boxes
really are built on technologies that

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
really are built on technologies that
 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.470
really are built on technologies that
were developed 20 and 30 and 40 years

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
were developed 20 and 30 and 40 years
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.530
were developed 20 and 30 and 40 years
ago and discoveries that were made that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
ago and discoveries that were made that
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.670
ago and discoveries that were made that
long ago so it's quiet becomes a it kind

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
long ago so it's quiet becomes a it kind
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.949
long ago so it's quiet becomes a it kind
of creeps in on us but it's a crisis

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959
of creeps in on us but it's a crisis
 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.900
of creeps in on us but it's a crisis
because it turns out that scientists and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
because it turns out that scientists and
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.900
because it turns out that scientists and
engineers only comprise about 5% of the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910
engineers only comprise about 5% of the
 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.780
engineers only comprise about 5% of the
workforce and so by the time we come to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790
workforce and so by the time we come to
 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.210
workforce and so by the time we come to

grips with the situation the fact that
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.400
grips with the situation the fact that
it takes so long to really educate a

it takes so long to really educate a
 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.830
it takes so long to really educate a
person to really be well grounded in

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
person to really be well grounded in
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.759
person to really be well grounded in
these arenas it's a crisis a crisis

these arenas it's a crisis a crisis
 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.430
these arenas it's a crisis a crisis
because if we can't fix it fast
