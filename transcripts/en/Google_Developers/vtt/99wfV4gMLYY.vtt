MANO MARKS: Hi, Mano
Marks, developer advocate

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.530
on the Google Maps API team.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.030
This is the third
video in a series

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.760
of four designed to show you how
to get started with the Google

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.610
Maps JavaScript API.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.010
In the last video, I
covered getting an API key

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.270
for the Google Maps
JavaScript API.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.190
In this video, we'll
cover using the key

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.170
when loading the JavaScript
API and the basics

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.580
of using the Google Maps Loader.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.270
The Google Maps JavaScript API
is loaded using a script tag.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.450
The basic format
looks like this.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.620
You can see that there
are two parameters,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.355
both required if you're
going to use an API key.

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:51.270
A common mistake people
make is to copy and paste

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.810
this text without
changing the parameters.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.840
The Maps API will not
load in this case.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.960
First, replace API
key with your API key,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.660
and then set the sensor
to either true or false.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.230
In most cases, it
will probably false.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.040
For example, look at this.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.450
This will pass both
the key and tell Google

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.350
whether you are creating
a map that uses a sensor

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.840
to detect the
location of the user.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.550
A note on the sensor
parameter-- you must set this

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.910
to true or false,
but it doesn't change

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.460
the capabilities
of the Maps API.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.319
If you are using a sensor,
there's no additional data

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.860
that you get.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.140
There's no costs
associated with it.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.730
And likewise if you're not.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.770
We must collect this
information to provide back

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.250
to our data providers.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.009
That's the only
reason we collect it.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.800
There are a few optional
parameters though,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.140
that you should be aware of.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.170
The first is a
language parameter.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.140
By specifying the
language parameter,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.150
you are changing
the default language

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.000
of the map, both the map
tiles and the controls.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.810
In this example, by using JA,
we change the map to Japanese.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.490
We support both left to right
and right to left languages.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.620
For instance, if you
chose AR for Arabic,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.370
you will see right to left.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.509
When you do this, however, you
should specify DIR equals RTO

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.560
in the div containing
any RTL text.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.360
Lastly, we also include
a libraries parameter.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.310
This is to load in the Google
Maps API libraries that

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.520
provide additional
functionality to the API

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.380
but should only be loaded
if they are required.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.890
For more information, see
the libraries documentation

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.885
at this URL.

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:30.580
That's all for this episode.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.520
In the next episode, we'll
cover the basic Maps options

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.090
used to create your first map.
