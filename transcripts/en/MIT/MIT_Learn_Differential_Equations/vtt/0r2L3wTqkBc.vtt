00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.590
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.790
Finally, I'm going to solve this
first order linear differential

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.490
equation with a formula that
works for any source term.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.700
So we've solved it for specific,
nice, special source terms

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.870
I'll remember later.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.430
But now we want a
formula for the solution

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.130
to that equation, period.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.220
And we want to
understand the formula.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.680
So now, write the
formula down, and then

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.140
let's see why it's right.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.610
And then of course, we could
put it into the equation

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.000
and confirm that it's right.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.240
OK the formula is
going to be-- this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.140
is the big formula you
could say, for first order

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.170
linear equations.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.740
So y of t.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.960
First we have the result
of the amount-- I'm

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.040
thinking of this as balance.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.130
The money in the bank is why
it's increasing at this rate,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.840
because of interest being added.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.620
And it's increasing at this
rate because of new deposits

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.930
being added.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.220
And oh, maybe I should
say about those deposits,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.600
I'm not thinking of like deposit
once a year, or once a month,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.170
or once a minute, even.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.710
Deposit continuously.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.990
We're talking differential
equations here.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
Time is running all-- the
clock is always running.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.700
So you're--
theoretically, at least--

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.490
you're depositing at a
rate of so much per second,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.890
all the time.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.740
OK.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.380
So first, the y of 0,
that's a once in a lifetime

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.610
deposit to start the account.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.780
And it grows, as we know,
with the interest rate

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.570
as the exponent.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.720
The question is-- so that's
the null solution that

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.540
matches the initial condition.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.050
No solution, because there
are no deposits here.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.160
This solves this part of
the equation, the null part.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.140
But now I want to add in
a particular solution,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.100
and it'll be the
particular solution

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.500
that matches the deposits.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.100
And I want to
understand this formula.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.780
So here's the formula.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.870
I'm going to-- the deposits
each deposit goes in at time T,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.000
goes in at some time,
and then it grows.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.050
Once you've made
the deposit, it's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.960
going to grow exponentially.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.980
With [INAUDIBLE], it will
grow over the remaining time.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.500
So here's the formula.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.340
You make deposits at any time,
s, between s equal 0 and s

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.760
equal t.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.210
So s is the running clock.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.030
T is the-- we look at our
account and see what's in it.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.360
And this deposit
is made at time s,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.670
and then it grows over the
remaining time, from s to t.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.410
So it grows by a factor
e to the a, t minus s.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.190
That's the key.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.000
And now we add up all those
deposits with their growth.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.800
So that addition for continuous
time addition is integration.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.960
That's the whole
idea of the integral,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.360
is add up continuously.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.105
So there's my formula that
I'm hoping you will admire.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.290
The no solution that grows
out of the initial condition.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:06.040
The particular solution that
grows out of the source term,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.330
q.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.430
Of course I've used
q of t all the way.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.110
Here I call it q of s.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.980
I have to introduce a
integration variable

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.019
s, which goes from the
start of these deposits

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.960
until the current time,
and grows like that.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.020
So that's the formula.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.510
I could put a big box around it.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.110
Let me start a box anyway.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.840
I could check that it's correct.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.420
But I hope you see
why it's right.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:47.510
And let me make some
comment on the examples of q

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.710
where we didn't
have this formula.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.010
We just went for it directly.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.220
So we started with,
these were special.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.340
Especially nice, you could say.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.910
Q of t equal a constant.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.860
That was the first video.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.500
Then we did q of t
equal an exponential.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.840
That was the second one.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.340
Then we did-- so and then we
found the exponential response.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.800
Then I did oscillation.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:33.610
Cosine-- well, let me put it
over here-- cosine of omega t.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.830
Or plus sine of omega t.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.210
You remember, those two kind
of had to come together.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.220
We couldn't stick
with cosines alone,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.980
because the
derivative of a cosine

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.430
here would give us a sign, so
signs got into the picture.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.965
So we found the
formula for that,

00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:51.310
that took a little more work.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.570
And in fact we did it by a real
method and a complex method.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.170
And, now are there any other
nice functions in calculus?

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.100
Well the next video,
I'm going to tell you

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.290
about two more functions
that I think are very nice.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.185
Step function.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.370
So the deposit-- we don't
make any deposits up

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.780
until some time,
and then we start,

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.850
then we go change to constant.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.740
So the step function is
0 and then a constant.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.630
And also-- and this is the
especially interesting one--

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.560
a delta function.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.350
And what is a delta function?

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.540
Which doesn't always come
into the basic differential

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.000
equations, course,
but it belongs there.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.540
Because in a model of
reality, a delta function

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.070
is like a golf club
hitting a golf ball.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.340
In an instant
something happened.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.730
Or a baseball bat
hitting a baseball.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.730
It gives it an instant velocity.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.730
It's an impulse.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:07.310
So step function is like a
light switch off and then on.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.680
Delta function is all in
one instant, an impulse,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.620
and you'll see that coming.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.800
And then those are
the-- oh, and maybe I

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.080
could include-- let's see,
if I've got a constant,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.410
maybe should include
t, t squared, so on.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.830
Powers of t are not too bad.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.780
We could get--

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.610
So for all of these special ones
that I call the nice functions.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.190
For all of those-- and we could
multiply t times e to the st,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.360
that would still be nice.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.520
And we could have
a simple formula.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.080
Those are the ones that give
simple, direct, interesting,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.050
answers in themselves.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.960
And this is the one that
gives the general answer.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.650
And if I put q be any one of
those in this general formula,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.400
I'll get the special one.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.370
You can see how if I
put a constant in there,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.960
that will be exactly
what we found

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.980
at the very, very beginning
for the response to a constant.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.590
Right.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.765
So this is the
general expression.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.890
I feel I should
say more about it.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.550
I guess I should say, two
more things I want to add

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.240
about this general formula.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.610
One is, I should check
that it's correct.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.450
But I hope you saw,
it had to be right.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.059
This input went in, it
grew, everything was linear.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:46.390
So I could just add the separate
growth, separate results,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:52.780
to find out what the balance
was at the final time, t.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.810
But still, I can check it.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.330
And I can derive it.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.770
That step is always
often done by what's

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.930
called an integrating factor.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.480
So there will be
a quick video that

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.950
shows you how an integrating
factor leads to that formula.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.690
Right in this video,
I'm just saying I

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.080
was led to it by common sense.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.800
But I can check
that it's correct.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.060
So let me check
that it's correct.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:26.620
OK.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.460
This part I can see is correct.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.470
So I'd like to
work with that one

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.240
and show that that is
a particular solution

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.750
to the differential equation.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.100
Can I do that?

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:44.070
I want to show that
this-- I'm looking now

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:51.155
at this y particular, and I'll
factor out the e to the at,

00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:53.200
because it doesn't depend on s.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.730
It's not involved
in the integration.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:01.990
So this is in the integral from
s equals 0 to s equal t of e

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.730
to the minus as,
that has an s in it.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.150
Q of s, ds.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.980
This is all the stuff
that depends on what time

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.630
the deposit was made, time s.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.380
And what time we're looking at
the balance, the later time, t.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.350
OK.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.670
This is a product of one
term times another term.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.300
And when I put it into
the differential equation,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.400
I'll use the product rule.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.900
So the derivative
of that product

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.690
will have two terms
from the product rule.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.560
And those two terms
will be-- if all

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.580
goes well-- will be the two
terms in the differential

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.580
equation.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.140
So can I take the derivative
of this by the product rule?

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.990
So I take the derivative
of the first thing,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:11:00.730
so now I'm computing dy,
dt, by ordinary calculus.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:08.610
So the derivative of that is a
e the at times the second term.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.580
That's just ay.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.310
That's a times the y
that we had before.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.080
Because the derivative of e
to the at, by the chain rule,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.440
brings down an a,
and we have that.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.610
But now the product
rule says also I

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:32.040
must take that term times
the derivative of this term.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.260
And that looks messier.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.740
What's the derivative
of that function?

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.290
It's a function of t.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.430
But it's an integral.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.480
It's a function of t.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.920
What's it's time derivative?

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.760
That's the last piece
of the product rule.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.460
Well, look what it is.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.440
It's the integral up to
time t of some function.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.410
And the fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:05.380
says that the derivative
of the integral

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.320
is the original function, right?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.780
So the derivative
of this integral

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.870
is the original function
that we integrated at time t.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.580
So it's e to the
minus a t cubed t.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.870
That's the second term
from the product rule.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.540
And OK, this was
the ay, perfectly.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.030
And what do I have here?

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.070
E to the at cancels
e to the minus at,

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.980
and it's the source term q of t.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.540
So I have ay plus q of t,
the correct right hand side

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.510
for the differential equation.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:55.320
So this, that formula, let
me bring it down once more,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:02.740
is sort of the climax of
this beginning of the videos

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.740
to see first order linear
differential equations.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.130
So what's coming now are
step and delta function.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.930
I just want to
speak about those.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.580
And that takes a few
minutes separately.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.810
And then another step will
be to allow the interest

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.810
rate to change.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.940
We made our problem
simple because we've

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.110
kept a constant interest rate.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.350
So I'll let the
interest rate change.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.380
And then after that
comes the real step

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.900
to non-linear equations.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.090
So delta functions,
varying interest rate,

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:46.080
and then non-linear equations.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.290
And then on to second
order equations

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.800
and all the rest of the theory
of differential equations.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.300
Good.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.130
Thank you.
