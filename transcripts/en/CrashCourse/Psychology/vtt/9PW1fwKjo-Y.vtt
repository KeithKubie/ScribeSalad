00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Lemme get your mind right about hypnosis.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.910
First of all, it’s a real thing -- but it’s
probably not what you think it is.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.570
All kinds of hypnosis-esque practices have
been around for centuries, but the Western

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.959
version of it -- including the kind that you
probably associate with people being made

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.550
to cluck like chickens on stage -- cropped
up around the 18th century, that’s when

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.400
German physician Franz Mesmer started treating
all manner of medical problems by putting

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.030
patients into a trance-like state, during
which he claimed to align their “internal

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.809
magnetic forces,” which he called “animal
magnetism.”

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.539
And many of these mesmerized patients did
feel better, but not because of any magnetism

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.329
or whatever. Mesmer was inadvertently using
the healing power of suggestion.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.289
In addition to his magnetic quackery, other
physicians didn’t appreciate Mesmer’s

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.699
kitschy penchant for wearing capes and playing
ethereal music on a glass harmonica, and eventually

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.690
he was discredited.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.879
So were his patients just gullible idiots,
or was there something else going on?

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.739
Well, we’ve previously defined consciousness
as our awareness of ourselves and our environment,

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.730
and consciousness is at work pretty much whenever
we’re awake, but also while we’re asleep

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.350
and dreaming.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.430
So hypnosis is a good example of an altered
state of consciousness -- when you’re fully

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.010
conscious in the clinical sense, but also
not in what you’d consider a normal waking

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.670
state. As a person who considers himself only
the product of one of several states of consciousness,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.500
this one that I am currently in right now,
it’s worth pointing out how TREMENDOUSLY

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.710
WEIRD THIS IS! My brain has these other gears
that it occasionally drops into during which,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.880
in a sense, I become not me any more.
Altered states can also include things like

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.960
hallucinations, and the effects of psychoactive
drugs. But these states aren’t as uncommon

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.830
as you might think. In fact, you’ve probably
experienced an altered state yourself… even

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.180
if you’ve never taken an illicit drug or
been to a cheesy dinner-theater where the

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.180
main act wore a glittering turban.
[INTRO]

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.740
So, personal opinions of Mesmer aside, here
are some facts and fallacies worth knowing

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.760
about hypnosis.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.219
First off, let’s define hypnosis simply
as a calm, trance-like state during which

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:14.099
you tend to have heightened concentration
and focus, and in which you’re typically

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.150
more open to suggestion.
The phenomenon has been observed in lots of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.189
empirically rigorous studies, and it’s been
used effectively in treatments for stress

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.519
and anxiety, weight loss, and chronic pain.

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.739
BUT! It’s important to understand that even
though you’re more open to suggestion when

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.069
hypnotized, you do NOT lose control over your
behavior.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.299
So, contrary to what you might see in The
Manchurian Candidate or Zoolander, hypnosis

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.150
can’t make you act totally against your
will and, say, jump off a building, rob a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.450
donut shop, or commit a murder most foul.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.349
Nor is hypnosis a reliable way to enhance
the recall of deeply buried memories. We don’t

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.859
file away every single one of our experiences.
We only permanently store some of them, and

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.670
even they tend to mutate over time. We’ll
be talking all about memory in an upcoming

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.219
lesson.
Finally, only about 20 percent of us are thought

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.340
to be highly hypnotizable. Those are the folks
whom a hypnotist could get to smile at the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.459
smell of sour milk just by suggesting it was
rosewater.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.730
And even though we know hypnosis can increase
your suggestibility, there’s still some

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.909
disagreement about what exactly constitutes
a hypnotic state, or how it’s achieved.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.019
Remember, just because we observe a phenomenon
doesn’t mean that we have a clue about its

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.370
mechanisms of action, or whether it works
the way we think it works.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.459
One popular theory looks at hypnosis as phenomenon
of social influence. This camp suggests that,

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.919
like actors caught up in an intense role,
hypnotized subjects may begin to feel and

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.260
act like “good hypnotic subjects” if they
just trust their hypnotist to sort of act

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.680
like a director and focus their attention.
Other researchers suggest that it has more

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.700
to do with a special dual-processing state
of split-consciousness called dissociation.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.980
Dissociation is a sort of detachment from
your surroundings, which can range from mild

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.659
spacing out all the way up to a total loss
of your sense of yourself. It’s something

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.049
we all do to some degree or another, and we’re
often quite aware that we’re doing it. It’s

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.579
not hard to think of instances where dissociation
might even help us, like when we’re faced

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.019
with a dangerous situation that requires quick,
reflexive action and not a ton of focus on

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.769
our own thoughts and feelings.
In this way, hypnosis may ease pain, not by

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.569
magically blocking pain receptors, but by
helping us selectively not attend to that

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.590
pain. Clinicians can do this by basically
guiding the patient into a very relaxed, but

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.229
voluntary state, sort of spaced-out, and then
further guiding them through a series of positive

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.050
thoughts and suggestions.
So, in legitimate clinical hypnosis, people

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.960
aren’t being made to dissociate. Instead,
think of them as being asked to dissociate

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.210
- and some people are better at this than
others, which is essentially what being “highly

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.710
hypnotizable” means.
So, clearly there’s a lot going on in our

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.180
two-track brains at any given time, and hypnosis
-- as researchers understand it -- seems to

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.340
help us tap into some of that adaptive dissociative
capacity that we all seem to have.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.250
But say you’re not so into the idea of someone
feeding you suggestions.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.430
Probably the most classic way to voluntarily
enter an altered state of consciousness is

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.440
by using drugs.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.229
Most of us have used some kind of legal drug…
your morning coffee, a beer at lunch, some

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.770
Tylenol PM to put you the bed… and lots
and lots of folks responsibly use prescription

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.379
and nonprescription drugs.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.669
But of course, some people develop problems.
The more you use a substance, legal or illegal,

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.639
the less you feel its effects as your tolerance
grows. And soon enough, a two-beer buzz turns

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.550
into a four-beer buzz or a case-of-beer buzz.
That’s your brain chemistry adapting to

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.979
offset the drug effect in a process called
neuroadaptation.

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.970
Keep on that road and soon you’ll risk a
physical and/or psychological addiction to

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.150
the substance you choose, or the substance
that chose you. And that’s not even to mention

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.879
serious physiological and neurological damage,
as happens with severe and long-term alcohol

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.810
abuse.
We’ll be delving more deeply into the science

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.110
of addiction in an upcoming episode, but for
now, let’s take a look at some of these

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.970
drug families and how they jack you up, knock
you out, make you do dumb things, see imaginary

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.509
stuff, and generally alter your consciousness.
Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.810
that alter your mood and perception. They’re
the ones that go right to your brain’s synapses,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.319
mimicking the functions of neurotransmitters.
They also work by tapping into the psychological

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.990
component - in other words, the user’s expectations
about what substance use might mean. Like

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.830
if you really believe that drinking tequila
makes you more aggressive, and I give you

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.240
a virgin margarita, your mere expectation
of getting all surly and aggro may actually

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.379
lead you to punch someone in the neck. That’s
also called the placebo effect.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.979
Whether smoked, snorted, ingested, or injected,
we’ll put all of them into three general

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.590
categories: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens.
Depressants, like alcohol, tranquilizers,

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.610
and opiates, do exactly what you’d expect--they
bring the mellow, slow body functions, and

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.520
suppress neural activity.
Historically, the world’s favorite depressant

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.490
is alcohol. Beat writer William S. Burroughs
even called it “our national drug.” A

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.659
little bit of hooch may get the party started,
but not because it’s stimulating anyone.

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.830
Rather, it’s acting as a disinhibitor, impairing
your brain’s judgement areas, while reducing

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.629
your self-awareness and self-control.

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:59.539
And then because alcohol disrupts memory formations
you may wake up wondering where one of your

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:03.379
eyebrows went.
Similar to booze, tranquilizers, or barbiturates,

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:07.930
depress nervous system activity and may be
prescribed to ease anxiety or insomnia, though

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.360
high doses can negatively affect memory and
judgement. And really high doses, or bad interactions

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.159
with other substances like alcohol, can kill
you.

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:20.919
Opiates, like poppy-flower superstar opium
and its derivatives morphine and heroin, work

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:25.789
in a similar way, depressing neural activity
and enveloping the brain in a fog of no-pain

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:29.530
bliss. The thing is, if a brain keeps getting
flooded with outside opiates, it will eventually

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.629
stop brewing its own natural pain killing
neurotransmitters, endorphins. The resulting

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:37.979
withdrawal is particularly nasty.
Stimulants, obviously, excite rather than

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:43.129
suppress neural activity, and speed up body
functions, bringing up your energy, self-confidence,

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:47.060
and changing your mood. On the legal end of
the spectrum here, we’ve got caffeine, nicotine,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.569
and prescription amphetamines, building up
to the more serious illegal stuff like street

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:56.580
amphetamines, meth, Ecstasy, and cocaine.
And you know who loved his coke? Freud. He

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.430
loved i—t so much—it cheered him up when
we was feeling down, opened up his mind, and

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.330
turned him into chatty Kathy. He even wrote
his first big publication, “Über Coca”

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.210
in 1884 about it. During his famous coke years
in his late 20s and 30s, he believed that

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.469
the drug was a viable cure for morphine addiction.
Which… not so much.

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:20.789
Luckily he gave his nose a rest and finally
dropped the habit by his 40s to focus full-time

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:24.310
on his cigar addiction. Which is the thing
that ultimately killed him.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.949
Cocaine hits the bloodstream in a flash of
energetic euphoria that quickly taxes the

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:33.380
brain’s supply of dopamine, serotonin, and
norepinephrine. Methamphetamine also triggers

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.310
the release of dopamine. You’ll remember
from our lesson on neurotransmitters how these

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.899
chemical messengers affect our moods, emotions,
attention, and alertness. So when those neurotransmitters

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:46.079
are excessively activated, they can become
temporarily depleted, which is what causes

00:08:46.079 --> 00:08:49.440
that agitated, depressive crash that users
often feel.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.089
If you drink coffee every morning, and then
you skip a day, you’ll likely be tired and

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:58.220
cranky with a pounding headache. Now multiply
that awful feeling by like thousands and you’ll

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.639
see why people with coke and meth addictions
might keep chasing that high while their bodies

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:05.910
and lives fall apart around them.
In addition to depressants and stimulants,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.300
we’ve got hallucinogens, which come in a
variety of plant and fungal forms, as well

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:16.130
as synthetic forms like LSD or lysergic acid
diethylamide. Also called psychedelics, these

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.850
drugs distort perceptions and evoke sensory
images in the absence of actual sensory input.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.790
Which means you could end up seeing, hearing,
smelling, or feeling things that are not real.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.560
This could be quite nice, if you’re like,
petting baby dolphins or something, but it

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.190
could also be panic-inducing and generally
messed up, if you think you’ve got a bunch

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.260
of centipedes crawling under your skin.
The thing is, there are lots of ways to involuntarily

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.060
hallucinate without the use of drugs. Seizures,
brain injuries, diseases, sensory deprivation,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.320
fever, stress, or even extreme grief or depression
can all cause neurological disturbances that

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.810
spur hallucinations of one kind or another.
Many healthy people have reported experiencing

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.860
vivid auditory hallucinations when in emergencies,
like, you broke your knee skiing and you wanted

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.550
to just fall asleep forever in that blanket
of soft snow, but a strong, seemingly audible

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:05.560
voice ordered you to KEEP MOVING.
And bizarrely, it isn’t uncommon for people

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.490
who lose the use of one sense—like vision
or smell--to perceive sights and odors they

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:16.459
are no longer capable of sensing as their
brains pull from old memories to produce hallucinations

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:20.769
as a way to compensate for that loss.
All this just goes to show that whether you’re

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:24.389
a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher,
our various states of consciousness provide

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:30.769
a rich, complex world of inquiry to contemplate,
showing yet again, just what a messy and marvelous

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:33.980
thing the human mind is.
If your consciousness wasn’t too altered

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.230
today, you learned what hypnosis is and what
it can and can’t do; how psychoactive depressant,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.889
stimulant, and hallucinogenic drugs work on
the brain; and how non-drug induced hallucinations

00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:44.930
can happen to anyone.
