00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.010
No action movie or even action comedy would
be complete without some amazing, death-defying

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.200
stunts - even if the whole audience knows
nobody was ever really in harm's way.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.520
But what if they were?

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.920
The truth is, stuntmen and women are often
asked to put their health on the line - so

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.790
it's only right that movie fans recognize
their risks.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.980
Here are 10 Most Dangerous Stunts Performed
in Movies.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.920
Live and Let Die
In the long history of James Bond films, 007

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.579
has pulled off some ridiculous escapes.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.829
But none is harder to believe than in Live
&amp; Let Die, when the spy finds himself surrounded

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.350
by crocodiles - and decides to just run across
their backs to safety.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.440
The craziest part?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.880
A stuntman actually did it.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.629
No surprise, one of the crocs managed to bite
him on the FOURTH take, but he still had one

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.550
left in him - the shot you see in the film.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.910
Terminator 2
James Cameron is famous for being a ruthless

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.110
director, so when he felt something was missing
from the helicopter chase in Terminator 2,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.250
the pilot flying it had an idea: forget just
missing an overpass - he could fly the helicopter

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.310
UNDER it.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.460
Cameron was convinced, but the crew wasn't.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.330
They were so sure the stunt wasn't worth the
risk, Cameron has to find a driver while he

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.470
filmed the helicopter personally.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.570
Can't argue with the results.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.320
The French Connection
As the first R-Rated movie to win the BEst

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.550
Picture Oscar, the French Connection isn't
best-known for its stunts.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.470
But when the film's chase scene called for
star Gene Hackman's character to speed through

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.650
New York following a train, they didn't overthink
it.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.420
Without any permits or precautions, the director
hopped into the car with a stunt driver and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.360
a camera man wrapped in pillows, and tore
off.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.750
Every close call is for real - including that
bystander who got a little too close - but

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.940
luckily walked away (the crash).

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.510
Skyfall
Sure, there may be plenty of CG to thank for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.920
James Bond's modern stunts, but the opening
action of Skyfall is more real than you realize.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.270
As in... it's completely real.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.450
Actors were really put on a moving train,
scrambled on top of it, and even watched as

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.460
it was torn to pieces around them.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.390
Which means playing 007, and actually being
him aren't all that different.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.280
Raiders of the Lost Ark
No movie fan can forget the opening of Indiana

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.500
Jones' first adventure, fleeing an ancient
tomb with a massive boulder rolling on his

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500
heels.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.290
Massive, yes - but made out of fibreglass
for the shoot.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.470
Still, the ball really was rolling behind
star Harrison Ford, and weighed close to half

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.470
a ton.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.470
In hindsight.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.360
director Steven Spielberg admitted it was
an insane idea to put Ford in harm's way,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.920
since disaster could have struck over the
smallest mistake.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.171
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
How do you top climbing up the side of the

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.030
world's tallest skyscraper?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.410
If you're Tom Cruise, you strap yourself to
an airplane and hang on for dear life.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.400
For Rogue Nation, Cruise committed to the
film's opening number, attached to a real

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.150
airplane with a single safety line, and wearing
special contacts to protect his eyes as it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.250
took off and flew to 5,000 feet before landing.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.950
At one point he worried a pebble had actually
tore through his skin - but apparently it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.280
knew who it was messing with, and just bounced
off harmlessly.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.130
Mission: Impossible 2
Tom Cruise's stunts may have gotten bigger

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.930
with Mission: Impossible sequels, but that
doesn't mean they're crazier.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.580
That honor might go to the first sequel, when
a fight scene required the villain to swing

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.360
a knife within an inch of Cruise's eyeball.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.760
But why rely on CG when you can do it for
real, with a steel cable guaranteed to stop

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.240
the blade just short of killing your star?

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.030
It's almost impossible to believe, but it
really did happen.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.130
The Fellowship of The Ring
The stars of this fantasy epic all earned

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.780
some scars or broken bones, but things almost
got seriously dangerous for Viggo Mortensen.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.840
When battling the lead orc in the first film,
the stuntman was SUPPOSED to pull a knife

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.091
from his leg, and throw it past the actor,
with an added shot showing it slam into a

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.091
tree.

00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:08.910
But when it came time to shoot, the stunt
knife slipped - and flew straight at Mortensen's

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.910
face.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.090
Would it have done the same damage as a real
blade?

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.090
No.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.910
But Mortensen slashing the knife away as a
reflex guaranteed he wouldn't have a stunt

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.299
knife flying at his eyes, either.

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.760
Lethal Weapon 2
The Lethal Weapon series is known for its

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.220
explosions, but one is more than it seems.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.520
In the first sequel, a woman goes for a swim
only to have her dive interrupted by a hidden

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.520
bomb.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.060
It looks like the stunt went off fine, but
in reality, it actually detonated a moment

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.360
too soon, leaving the stuntwoman not only
caught off guard, but actually propelled off

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.029
the diving board by the fiery blast, explaining
why she simply freezes in mid-air, having

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.100
narrowly missed a serious injury.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.661
Point Break
They don't call them "extreme sports" for

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:58.150
nothing, but when the makers of the Point
Break reboot had the idea of sending multiple

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.710
wingsuit jumpers down a mountainside in formation,
there was one problem: it had never been done.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.039
But a handpicked team spent a full year on
hundreds of jumps to dial the stunt down to

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.270
the foot - literally.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.210
The shot of one jumper actually making contact
with the ground made it into the finished

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.089
film - closer than they were actually planning.

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:21.340
Those are just a sample of some of Hollywood's
most insanely dangerous stunts, but there's

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.249
plenty more where those came from!
