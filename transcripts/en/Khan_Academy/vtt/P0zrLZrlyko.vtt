00:00:00.092 --> 00:00:02.163
- [Instructor] We're
now going to talk about

00:00:02.163 --> 00:00:04.279
the Maurya Empire, which is not just one

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.547
of the greatest empires in Indian history,

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:09.381
and really the first truly great empire.

00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:13.033
It's also one of the great
empires of world history.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.641
And just for a little bit of context,

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:17.340
we can see where it
fits in in the large arc

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.629
of ancient Indian
history, and in particular

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:24.224
we see here the life of
Buddha, and the actual dates

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.065
of Buddha's life are under some debate.

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:30.744
But we can see that his,
his life and his teachings

00:00:30.744 --> 00:00:34.911
were roughly 150 to 200 years
before the establishment

00:00:36.377 --> 00:00:39.293
of the Maurya Empire which lasts

00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:42.332
for another 150 or so years.

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:44.112
And this is important to keep in mind,

00:00:44.112 --> 00:00:47.462
because as we'll see, Buddhism
has a strong influence

00:00:47.462 --> 00:00:51.153
on the Maurya Empire, and
maybe just as important,

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:54.400
the Maurya Empire has
a very large influence

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.400
on spreading Buddhism in
a very significant way.

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:03.210
So let's zoom in on what
the Indian subcontinent

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.377
looked like near the end
of the fourth century BCE.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.608
So, in most of north
India you have control

00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:17.374
by the Nanda Empire, which
had its capital at the city

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:21.159
Pataliputra, which was in
the region, or the kingdom,

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.173
of Magada, which is this
ancient region that has been

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:27.985
the seat of power in
north India for some time.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:30.569
You also have other
kingdoms, like Kalinga.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.354
You have several kingdoms
in south India, as well.

00:01:34.354 --> 00:01:38.032
There are counts of a kingdom
potentially quite powerful

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:40.615
in Bengal named the Gangaridai.

00:01:42.277 --> 00:01:45.943
You also might remember in our
videos on Alexander the Great

00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:50.246
that it was around this time,
around 326, that Alexander

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:53.999
came and conquered much
of modern day Afghanistan,

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:56.805
Pakistan, and was at the borders

00:01:56.805 --> 00:02:00.023
of the Nanda Empire in India.

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:03.073
And you might also remember
that that was about the time

00:02:03.073 --> 00:02:06.862
that Alexander the Great and
his soldiers decided to stop.

00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:10.071
They were tired, some accounts
are that they were fearful

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:12.410
of trying to conquer another empire,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.527
especially that far from home.

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:17.523
So it was also around the
time that Alexander the Great

00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:20.456
decided to turn back, and
leave the region under

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:24.623
the control of some of his
governors and generals.

00:02:26.222 --> 00:02:30.389
And it was in that context
that the Maurya Empire emerges.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.011
And the actual events of how it emerges

00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.083
are still shrouded in
history a little bit.

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:41.911
But what eventually happens
is a conqueror by the name

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.078
of Chandragupta Maurya is able
to conquer the Nanda Empire,

00:02:48.243 --> 00:02:50.707
and then not just the Nanda Empire,

00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:53.251
but as Alexander the Great retreats,

00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:56.740
he is able to conquer some
of the territory former,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.100
formerly conquered by Alexander the Great.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.639
And so this here is a statue
of what Chandragupta Maurya

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.806
may have looked like, and you
can see by within a decade

00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:14.292
of establishing the empire,
it had conquered most

00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:18.048
of the Nanda Empire, and had
even reclaimed a significant

00:03:18.048 --> 00:03:22.704
amount of land from the
Greeks from what would

00:03:22.704 --> 00:03:25.943
eventually become the Seleucid Empire.

00:03:25.943 --> 00:03:29.480
Remember, Seleucus was one
of Alexander's generals,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.281
who essentially sets
up a dynasty in Persia,

00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:37.630
the Middle East, after
the death of Alexander.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.224
And Chandragupta Maurya
actually fights several battles

00:03:42.224 --> 00:03:45.483
with Seleucus, and is victorious,

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:49.650
and he actually marries
one of Seleucus' daughters.

00:03:51.108 --> 00:03:54.575
But this is what essentially
establishes the Maurya,

00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:58.246
sometimes referred to or
as, the Mauryan Empire.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:02.413
Now Chandragupta Maurya
in 297, or roughly in 297,

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:09.516
he, he decides to become
a more devout Jain,

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.140
and in other videos
we'll talk about Mahavira

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.438
and the Jain religion.

00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:16.493
But he essentially becomes an ascetic

00:04:16.493 --> 00:04:19.007
and leaves the kingdom, or the empire,

00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:22.618
in the hands of his son Bindusara.

00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:25.909
Now, Bindusara is able
to conquer more of India,

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:30.779
in particular he starts growing
the empire into the south.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.946
But Bindusara is not able to
conquer the kingdom of Kalinga.

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:40.216
Bindusara dies in around 273, or 272 BCE,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.372
and then a civil war erupts
for who should take charge,

00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:50.470
and the civil war is essentially

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.970
amongst the sons of Bindusara.

00:04:53.844 --> 00:04:58.011
But the son who is victorious
ends up being Ashoka.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.139
Now Ashoka is one of, if
not, the most significant

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.889
historical character in
the history of India.

00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:14.818
So, Ashoka is able to take
power roughly around 270 BCE,

00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:22.126
after as legend has it, a
fairly bloody civil war.

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:25.128
Early in his life he is
viewed as a potentially

00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:27.987
cruel figure, killing many
of his brothers in order

00:05:27.987 --> 00:05:31.737
to come to power, and
he is set on conquering

00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:34.974
the kingdom of Kalinga.

00:05:36.404 --> 00:05:39.904
So, in 262, 261, he has a significant war,

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.086
and he is able to successfully
conquer the kingdom

00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:49.003
of Kalinga, which is this
area right over here.

00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:53.510
Now, that ends up, according
to historical records

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.584
and really Ashoka's own accounts,

00:05:55.584 --> 00:05:58.064
ends up becoming a
significant turning point

00:05:58.064 --> 00:06:01.428
in the life of Asoka, and
potentially in the life of India

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:05.595
or the world, because here
are his direct accounts

00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:10.418
of his feelings about
what happened in Kalinga.

00:06:11.366 --> 00:06:14.522
And we get this account from what

00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:16.772
are known as Ashoka edicts.

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:21.412
As the Maurya Empire
expanded under Ashoka,

00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:24.447
it had peace and prosperity.

00:06:24.447 --> 00:06:26.850
He put his edicts throughout the empire

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.005
on what are often known as Ashoka pillars,

00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:33.566
where he wrote what his beliefs
and the things that he did.

00:06:33.566 --> 00:06:35.286
He would also write them on rocks

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:37.170
and stone throughout the empire.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.250
But this is the one where he
talks about the conquering

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.446
of Kalinga, and it's pretty interesting.

00:06:43.446 --> 00:06:46.939
Beloved of the Gods King
Piyadasi, and he refers to himself

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.693
as beloved of the Gods King Piyadasi,

00:06:49.693 --> 00:06:54.157
conquered the Kalingas eight
years after his coronation.

00:06:54.157 --> 00:06:56.889
And so you see he was
coronated roughly in 270.

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.665
He conquers roughly in 262.

00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:03.248
150,000 were deported,
100,000 were killed,

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.847
and many more died from other causes.

00:07:07.847 --> 00:07:10.337
After the Kalingas had been conquered,

00:07:10.337 --> 00:07:12.286
beloved of the Gods came to feel,

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:14.469
he's talking about himself,
beloved of the Gods

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:18.237
came to feel a strong
inclination towards the Dhamma.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:21.848
So Dhamma is the same word
that we use today, dharma.

00:07:21.848 --> 00:07:25.423
And dharma you could ref,
you can, you can view it

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:27.643
as the cosmic order of things.

00:07:27.643 --> 00:07:31.382
It also, to a Buddhist, refers
to the teachings of Buddha,

00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:33.446
or the Buddhist religion.

00:07:33.446 --> 00:07:37.132
So, beloved of the Gods came
to feel a strong inclination

00:07:37.132 --> 00:07:40.232
towards the Dhamma, a love for the Dhamma,

00:07:40.232 --> 00:07:42.574
and for the instruction in Dhamma.

00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:45.564
Now beloved of the Gods feels deep remorse

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:47.941
for having conquered the Kalingas.

00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:49.779
So this is really interesting.

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.590
You don't have a lot of conquerors,

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.117
especially in ancient history,

00:07:53.117 --> 00:07:55.491
after killing several hundred thousand,

00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:57.307
or maybe being responsible for the death

00:07:57.307 --> 00:07:58.674
of several hundred thousand,

00:07:58.674 --> 00:08:01.981
for feeling remorse about
it, and writing about it.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.382
And so not only is this
profound to be coming

00:08:04.382 --> 00:08:07.249
from a conqueror, but
also reminds us how bloody

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:10.203
some of these ancient wars were.

00:08:10.203 --> 00:08:12.034
But this is a turning point for him.

00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:15.369
He turns to Buddhism, and
he really then becomes

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:18.005
anti violence, not just towards humans,

00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:20.470
but even towards animals.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.026
He becomes a devoted Buddhist,

00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:26.742
and sponsors Buddhist temples
throughout his empire.

00:08:26.742 --> 00:08:30.285
He sends Buddhist missionaries
throughout the world,

00:08:30.285 --> 00:08:32.956
and is viewed as one of the main people

00:08:32.956 --> 00:08:35.656
responsible for the spread of Buddhism

00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:39.093
from Europe all the way to the far east.

00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:42.301
We already talked about
his edicts of Ashoka.

00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:44.797
He started doing a bunch
of public works projects,

00:08:44.797 --> 00:08:47.610
digging of wells, hospitals,
and public gardens,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.814
education including for women.

00:08:49.814 --> 00:08:53.055
During his reign you
have the maximum extent

00:08:53.055 --> 00:08:56.245
of any empire that ever ruled over India.

00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:58.369
50% larger than modern,

00:08:58.369 --> 00:09:01.452
than the modern day country of India.

00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:04.548
There were roughly 50 million people

00:09:04.548 --> 00:09:07.881
under the Mauryan Empire under his rule.

00:09:08.984 --> 00:09:11.345
Now, eventually after his death,

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:14.726
the empire goes under
weaker and weaker rulers,

00:09:14.726 --> 00:09:18.559
and by about 184, 185
BCE, it falls to another

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:23.737
less significant dynasty in
the whole scope of history.

00:09:23.737 --> 00:09:27.365
But just to appreciate
what a big deal Ashoka is

00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:31.532
in the scope of history,
here is a quote by H.G. Wells

00:09:34.763 --> 00:09:37.531
from his Outline of History.

00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:40.355
"Ashoka worked for the real needs of men.

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:43.157
Amidst the tens of thousands
of names of monarchs

00:09:43.157 --> 00:09:45.234
that crowd the columns of history,

00:09:45.234 --> 00:09:48.047
the name of Asoka, or Ashoka, shines,

00:09:48.047 --> 00:09:51.003
and shines almost alone, a star.

00:09:51.003 --> 00:09:55.461
From the Volga to Japan
his name is still honored."

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:58.570
A lot because of his spread of Buddhism.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.456
"More living men cherish his memory today

00:10:01.456 --> 00:10:03.338
than have ever heard the name

00:10:03.338 --> 00:10:06.579
of Constantine or Charlemagne."

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:09.361
And just to appreciate
the impact of Ashoka,

00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:12.220
even on modern day India,
and this right over here

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.004
is called the Ashoka
chakra, and if you look

00:10:16.004 --> 00:10:18.779
at the flag of India,
the Ashoka chakra sits

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:22.058
at the center of it, and
this is actually part of the,

00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:25.817
the modern day emblem of
the republic of India,

00:10:25.817 --> 00:10:29.586
because after his turn to
becoming a more benevolent ruler,

00:10:29.586 --> 00:10:33.423
he's considered as the model,
ideal ruler in Indian history,

00:10:33.423 --> 00:10:36.840
and by many historians in all of history.
