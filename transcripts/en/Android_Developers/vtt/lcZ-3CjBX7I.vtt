00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.070
MALE SPEAKER: So
now that we know

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.130
how to unlock an achievement,
let's make some progress

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.230
towards unlocking an
incremental achievement.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.860
As you recall, one
of the achievements

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.890
we wanted to implement is
our Centaguesser achievement.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.920
This is an achievement
that a player

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.800
earns for making 100 guesses.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.805
And this is an
incremental achievement

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:25.930
meaning that we want the
player to see that they've

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.440
made a certain amount
of progress every time

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.830
they play the game.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.259
And so let's get to
implementing that.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.830
This process is fairly
similar to what we did before.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.700
In my Achievement
Manager, I'm going

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.946
to create a method,
Increment Achievement with ID

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:48.570
and we'll have our NS
string achievement ID.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.330
Say by amount.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.350
Let's get that colon in there.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.800
There we go.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.745
And we'll have an INT that
will reflect our progress.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.010
And now we can
implement this method.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.040
We'll go down here
and once again,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.900
like before, we're going to
create a GPGAchievement object.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.580
We'll call this
one Increment Me.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.580
And we're going to call
GPGAchievement, achievement

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.010
with ID, and pass in our
achievement ID string.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.800
And then, Increment Me,
instead of unlock achievement

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.750
with completion handler, we will
say increment achievement NUM

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.580
steps, with a
completion handler.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.670
Now this number of steps
is the amount of progress

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.390
that we want to make towards
unlocking this achievement.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.160
Remember we're doing this for
our Centaguesser achievement

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.000
where we want the user to make
a 100 guesses so this will

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.670
be the number of guesses that
the user has made every game.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.010
So it might be seven,
then maybe it'll be six,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.240
then maybe it will
be 12, and then four.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.869
And so our number
of steps by which

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.410
we want to increment
this achievement

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.919
is the progress variable
that we pass in.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.585
And then we have our
completion handler.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.707
And put this on a
new line and we're

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:24.040
going to have three arguments
passed into our completion

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.750
handler.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.620
First, how we newly
unlocked this achievement,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.560
that is have we
made enough progress

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.700
towards completing
this achievement

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.230
that we've unlocked it.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.670
Current steps is the
number of total steps

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.730
that the player has now made
as reported by your system.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.592
And error is if
there's any error.

00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:43.050
Now by the way, if we wanted,
we could leave this all blank

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.460
and everything will
work just fine,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.870
the library will
record everything,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.260
and it will display an
achievement unlocked toast

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.490
when appropriate.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.190
But just so we can
see what's going on,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.020
we'll do some logging here.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.072
So if error, we'll NSLog.

00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:02.510
Got an error.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.680
Our incrementing and
achievement and we'll

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.940
pass in our
localized description

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.911
and otherwise if newly
unlocked, NS log.

00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:22.410
Hooray!

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.035
Newly unlocked.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.330
I suppose in either case, we can
NSLog according to the system.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:42.820
Your total progress is
now percent d steps.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.110
And this will be current steps.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.650
Close that up.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.610
And that's about it.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.420
We now have a generic
method to make progress

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.810
towards an achievement.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.320
Let's go back to our
game model and we're

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.410
going to increment this
achievement from our player

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.980
guess method.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.140
Now you might be tempted
to just increment

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.460
this achievement here.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.110
Every time the
player makes a guess,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.170
you would call self dot
achievement manager, increment

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.160
achievement, by
ID, whatever we're

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.080
calling it, by amount one.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.160
However, this will
run you into trouble.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.720
And that's because when you
call GPG increment achievement,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.380
our games client will actually
go out onto the network

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.210
and try to make a
network call every time.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.290
And if this were to happen very
frequently, if a player were

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.310
to make a lot of
guesses, there's

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.560
a chance that your
game could end up

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.120
getting throttled by your system
for making too many network

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.970
calls.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.960
This is probably in contrast
to Game Center's recommendation

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.460
where I believe they
encourage you to make progress

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.390
towards achievements constantly.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.790
I'm pretty sure this is because
Game Center's on device client

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.750
is much more aggressive about
caching and automatically

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.907
batching network calls than
our client currently is.

00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.490
We're looking into
making improvements

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.920
to ours in the future,
but for right now,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.600
our recommendation is not to
increment achievement by one

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.290
every single time.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.400
So here's what we're
going to do instead.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.800
Once the player has
won a game, we're

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.400
going to call self dot
achievement manager

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.170
and we're going to increment
our Centaguesser achievement

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.300
by the total number of guesses
that the player has made.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.910
So we're only making this
achievement increment call once

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.180
per game instead
of once per guess.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.370
And that will work
out a whole lot better

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.540
both in terms of the
system not throttling

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.810
your game and your user's
device not having to go out

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.360
onto the network
every three seconds.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.310
We can get our achievement
ID by once again going

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.370
to the developer console
and in Guess My Number,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.759
go to My Achievements,
and here's

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:53.925
my Centaguesser achievement.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.685
Copy that.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.899
We'll paste it in here.

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:05.190
Yes, it does kind of bug me
that these two strings look

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.930
nearly identical
but there you go.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.590
So now we can run this and it
looks like our build succeeded.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:25.780
And we'll go to our
application here

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.300
and check out our achievements.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.910
Once again, my Centaguesser
achievement is still at 0%

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.910
but now I'm going to
play a game and I'm

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.076
going to make a few guesses.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.880
Some more guesses.

00:06:49.456 --> 00:06:52.080
This is six guesses and I think
this will be our seventh guess.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.730
So we've hit our game over call.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.530
Let's look at what's
happening in the log here.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.690
So we've got two messages
here on our counsel log.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.720
This first one,
according to the system,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.900
your total progress
is now seven steps

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.830
is what we got back from
our increment achievement

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.090
with ID callback.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.710
So that means that we
didn't get an error,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.370
newly unlocked is false because
this has not been unlocked yet,

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.250
but we've now recorded our
total progress as seven steps.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.410
And the second message
looks like you've

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.240
earned this one
already is because we

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.740
told the system to try
and unlock our first timer

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.250
achievement and that one
has already been earned.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.410
By the way, this is completely
normal programming style.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.380
You don't need to perform any
special logic on your side

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.170
to detect whether the user has
earned this achievement or not

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.340
yet and perform an unlock call
depending on whether they have

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.350
or whether they haven't.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.016
From your perspective,
I would encourage

00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:53.540
you to just not worry about it.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.780
Feel free to submit an
achievement multiple times.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.820
Either our client will
catch it or the server

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.050
will catch it and say,
you know, it's OK.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.700
The user's already earned this.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.630
And that's completely
normal behavior.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.050
We don't expect you to
perform a lot of logic just

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.910
to keep track of this stuff.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:18.100
And, by the way, if I
were to run this again,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.195
and I were to make
a few more guesses.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.310
You see I've made seven guesses
and in my increment achievement

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.640
with ID callback and
you've seen the call.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.730
I'm specifying the amount
of progress is seven

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.169
but what gets returned back
by the system is now 14.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.480
Again, I believe this is--
unlike Game Center-- where it's

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.520
your client's job to keep track
of the total amount of progress

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.680
the user has made towards
unlocking an achievement,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.420
Play Games, all
you need to do is

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.530
record the amount of
progress the user has made

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.020
for that game and the system
will add up your achievement

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.350
progress for you.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.660
So there we go.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.110
We have now successfully
incremented an achievement,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.070
as well as unlocked
an achievement.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.840
We have two more
achievements to implement

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.240
but before we add those
in, I don't know about you,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.970
but it's kind of
bothering me that we've

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.000
got our achievement IDs embedded
right there within the code.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.670
So I think in our
next lesson, we're

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.170
going to clean this
up a little bit,

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.960
just get these out
of here, and then

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.070
we'll implement these
last two achievements.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.060
So I'll see you soon.
