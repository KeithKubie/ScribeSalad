00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.850
Find the probability of pulling
a yellow marble from a

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.060
bag with three yellow, two red,
two green, and one blue

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.480
marbles, I'm assuming.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.510
So let's just think about
this bag a little bit.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.470
There are three yellow
marbles in it.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.660
So let me draw them.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.350
We have one, two, three
yellow marbles.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.010
We have two red marbles.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:27.170
So we have one, two red marbles,
assuming they're all

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.240
mixed in there.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.990
We have two green marbles--
one, two green marbles.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.500
And then there's one
blue marble.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.820
And they want to know the
probability of pulling a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.700
yellow marble.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.530
So they want to know what is the
probability of pulling a

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.430
yellow marble.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.470
Now probability is just a way of
expressing-- well, I don't

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.330
want to use too loaded words.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.460
But it's the odds of picking
yours relative to the odds of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.440
picking everything else.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.130
Or another way of thinking about
it is, it's the number

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.330
of outcomes that could result
in what you want, a yellow

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.100
marble, over the total
number of outcomes.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.720
So how many ways are there-- how
many events-- you're going

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.710
to pick out a ball.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.980
How many of those-- how many
ways-- or how many balls can

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.670
you pick out that
will be yellow?

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.710
Well, there's three balls.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.580
There's three balls that you
can pick out as yellow.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.400
One, two, and three.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.260
We're assuming that they're
all equally likely

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.970
to be picked up.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.090
They're all mixed in there.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.760
So there's three yellow balls
you could pick up.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.080
Now how many total
balls are there?

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.810
How many total balls are
there to be picked up?

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.540
Well, you could be picking up
any one of eight balls, right?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.010
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.060
So there's a total number
of eight balls.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.160
So the probability of picking
a yellow marble is 3/8.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.730
So you have a 3/8 chance of
picking a yellow marble.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.500
And just a way to
think about it.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.560
I just want to reiterate.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.840
It's just the number
of outcomes.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.490
There's eight total outcomes.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.320
There's eight different
things that you could

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.580
pull out of the bag.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.840
Three of them satisfy
your conditions.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.080
Three of them would be
a yellow marble.
