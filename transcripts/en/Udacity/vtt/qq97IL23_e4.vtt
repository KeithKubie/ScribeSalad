00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.430
The problem here is
that M1 might not halt.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.100
If M1 accepts, then the program is fine.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.660
If M1 rejects, then we'll get to here,
M2 will accept, and D will reject.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.470
That's also correct.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.870
If M1 loops, however,
then this whole program will loop.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.398
Yet we need it to reject in order for
D to decide the language L.

00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:28.780
Note that M2 looping can't be a problem

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.287
because it can only loop when
x is in the language, but

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:39.180
then M1 would of accepted and
we would have accepted by that point.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.530
Also, if this program returns
any answer, it will be correct.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.180
So both of these are wrong for
that reason.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.600
All right, so
how do we fix this problem of looping?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.950
Well one idea is to run
the two programs parallel, and

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.056
accept if M1 accepts,
and reject if M2 does.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:01:00.350
Now we can't actually run the two
programs in parallel, but

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.739
we can do the next best thing by
switching between the two at every step.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.800
First running a step of M1,
then one of M2, then one of M1, etc.
