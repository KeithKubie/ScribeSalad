00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And I said this was the best answer, but don't worry if you put something different.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's see what Dr. Fara has to say.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
[Patricia Fara] There is one thing that everybody knows about Isaac Newton--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that he sat beneath an apple tree and had a flash of inspiration.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We don't know, and I don't think we can ever know, whether it really happened.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What he said was that he was sitting in his garden, in his orchard

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
where he'd had to retreat from Cambridge because of the plague,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so he was sitting in the orchard watching the apples fall around him

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and suddenly he thought to himself, why is it that that apple falls to the ground?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Why doesn't it move sideways or upwards?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And is it possible that there is one single force that makes the apple fall to the ground

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and makes the moon go 'round the earth and makes the earth go 'round the sun?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And that is allegedly the great "Eurkea" moment, the flash of inspiration,

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that's the significance of the apple.
