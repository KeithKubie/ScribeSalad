00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, there is a couple of ways to answer this question,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
at least a couple, and I'm going to show you too.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The period is 2 seconds and we're talking about 7.5 seconds.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If a mass starts off up here, what are 2 seconds is complete one period;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
two more, it's gone up here; two more, another period.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Okay, so far we've had 6 seconds elapsed.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What are 7 seconds that's half a period, and then another half a second,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
well that's another half of what's left.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'd wind up here. How else could we have solve this?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Remember that the amount of angle we go through in a certain amount of time is equal to ω  t.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay, I know that t is 7.5 seconds. How can I find ω?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well, we have this relationship, T = 2π/ω, or rearrange, ω = 2π/T.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In this case, with a T of 2, ω is equal to just π radians/sec.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That means in each second, it's going to go π radians.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, 7π radians would be seven-halves of the circle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Starting from here, that would be this angle, one-half, two, three, four, five, six, and seven,

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but it was 7.5 seconds, so the extra π over 2 radians, and again that puts us right here.
