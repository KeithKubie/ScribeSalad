Vaccinations don’t cause autism - but pollution
actually might!

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.870
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and thanks
to the recent efforts of certain celebrities,

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.630
autism has become one of the most widely-debated
disorders out there. There’s a subset of

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.230
people who like to claim that vaccinations
are responsible for causing autism. And despite

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.929
evidence to the contrary, there IS new data
published this week, that suggests another

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.820
cause could be to blame.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.390
Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh
recently discovered that children with autism

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.390
spectrum disorder, or ASD, are significantly
more likely to have been exposed to high levels

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.640
of certain air toxins at a very young age.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.640
This study looked at 217 families of children
with and without ASD, spread across 6 counties

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.960
in southern Pennsylvania.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.690
For each family, researchers used the EPA’s
National Air Toxics Assessment to estimate

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.170
their levels of exposure to 30 different air
pollutants known to cause endocrine disruption

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.100
or neuro-developmental problems. And after
accounting for things like race, education,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.010
maternal age, and maternal smoking - the scientists
noticed a clear trend.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.640
Children who were exposed to those pollutants
anywhere from in utero up to age 2, were at

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.650
a significantly higher risk of developing
ASD. And there were two specific pollutants

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.350
singled out in this study: styrene and chromium.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.690
Styrene is a chemical used in the production
of plastics and paints, but it’s also a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.210
by-product of car exhaust. Chromium is a heavy
metal, typically seen in air pollution around

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.000
manufacturing, industrial, and power plants.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.810
Some of the other pollutants they looked at
that also increased the risk of ASD, were

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.540
Cyanide, methylene chloride, methanol, and
arsenic - all of which can also be found in

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.240
car exhaust, and in or around industrial plants.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.630
You may recall last week, I did an episode
on how living within 50 meters of a major

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.780
roadway, increases a woman’s risk of sudden
cardiac death by 38%. Seeing as how the incidence

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.720
of ASD has risen 8-fold over the past 20 years
alone - it stands to reason that an increase

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.860
in productions plants, and more cars on the
road, could be at least partially responsible

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.150
for a number of diseases - including autism.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.470
There was another recent study which found
that mothers exposed to pesticides during

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.010
pregnancy are more likely to have a child
with ASD. So clearly, environmental exposure

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.780
is a big factor here - and one that should
be evaluated more closely.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.100
What do you guys think? Any thoughts on this?
You can let us know down below in the comments.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.220
Otherwise, thanks for watching!
