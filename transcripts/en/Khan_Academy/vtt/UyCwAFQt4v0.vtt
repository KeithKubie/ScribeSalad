00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.180
In the last video we had this
second order linear

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.320
homogeneous differential
equation and we just tried it

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.700
out the solution y is equal
to e to the rx.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.720
And we figured out that if you
try that out, that it works

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.540
for particular r's.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.990
And those r's, we figured out in
the last one, were minus 2

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.490
and minus 3.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.880
But it came out of factoring
this characteristic equation.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.060
And watch the last video if
you forgot how we got that

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.160
characteristic equation.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.310
And we ended up with this
general solution for this

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.340
differential equation.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.439
And you could try it
out if you don't

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.840
believe me that it works.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.150
But what if we don't want the
general solution, we want to

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.530
find the particular solution?

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.120
Well then we need initial
conditions.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.880
So let's do this differential
equation with some initial

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.360
conditions.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.610
So let's say the initial
conditions are-- we have the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.560
solution that we figured
out in the last video.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.330
Let me rewrite the differential
equation.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.330
So it was the second derivative
plus 5 times the

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.460
first derivative plus 6 times
the function, is equal to 0.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.770
And the initial conditions we're
given is that y of 0 is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.010
equal to 2.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.120
And the first derivative
at 0, or y prime at

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.640
0, is equal to 3.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.460
What does y equal at the point
0, and what is the slope at

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.990
0-- at x is equal to 0--
and the slope is 3.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.420
So how do we use these to
solve for c1 and c2?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.550
Well, let's just use the first
initial condition. y of 0 is

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.530
equal to 2, which is equal
to-- essentially just

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.010
substitute 0 in into
this equation.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.670
So it's c1 times e to the
minus 2 times 0, that's

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.970
essentially e to the 0,
so that's just 1.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.760
So it's c1 times 1, which is
c1, plus c2 times e to the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.960
minus 3 times 0.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.230
This is e to the 0,
so it's just 1.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.410
So plus c2.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.979
So the first equation we get
when we substitute our first

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.590
initial condition is essentially
c1 plus c2 is

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.680
equal to 2.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.800
Now let's apply our second
initial condition that tells

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.620
us the slope at x
is equal to 0.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.580
So y prime is 0.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.170
So this is our general solution,
let's take its

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.180
derivative, and then
we can use this.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.590
So y prime of x is
equal to what?

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.360
The derivative of this is equal
to minus 2 c1 times e to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.760
the minus 2x.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.060
And what's the derivative
of this?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.710
It's minus 3 c2 times
e to the minus 3x.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.970
And now we can use our initial
condition, y prime at 0.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.620
So when x is equal
to 0, what's the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.760
right-hand side equal?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.130
It's minus 2 times c1 and then
e to the minus 0, e to the 0,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.390
that's just 1.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.360
Minus 3 c2, and then once again
x is 0, so e to the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.350
minus 3 times 0,
that's just 1.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.980
So it's just 1 times
minus 3 c2.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.920
And it tells us that when x is
equal to 0, what does this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.580
whole derivative equal?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.050
Well, it equals 3, right?

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.940
Y prime of 0 is equal to 3.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.990
So now we go back into your
first year of algebra.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.100
We have two equations-- two
linear equations with two

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.840
unknowns-- and we could solve.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.140
Let me write them in
a form that you're

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.970
probably more used to.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.980
So the first one is c1 plus
c2 is equal to 2.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:52.635
And the second one is minus 2
c1 minus 3 c2 is equal to 3.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.390
So what can we do?

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.230
Let's multiply this
top equation by 2.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.260
There's a ton of ways to solve
this, but if you multiply the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.540
top equation times 2, you'll
get-- and I'll do this is a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.130
different color, just so that
it's changed-- I'm just

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.570
multiplying the top one by 2,
you get 2 c1 plus 2 c2 is

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.560
equal to 4.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.230
And now we can add these
two equations.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.360
Minus 2 c1 plus 2,
those cancel out.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.140
So minus 3 plus 2, you get
minus c2 is equal to 7.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.360
Or we could say that c2
is equal to minus 7.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.990
And now we can substitute
back in here.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.950
We have c1 plus c2-- c2 is minus
7-- so minus 7, is equal

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:49.500
to 9, or we know that c--
oh sorry, no I'm already

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.310
confusing myself.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.950
My brain was getting
ahead of myself.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.600
c1 plus c2, that's minus 7,
is equal to 2, right?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.340
I'm just substituting back
into this differential

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.950
equation-- sorry, to this
equation, not a differential

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.580
it's just a simple linear
equation-- and then we get c1

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.290
is equal to 9.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.510
And now we have our particular
solution to the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.790
differential equation.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.460
So this was our general
solution.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.240
We can just substitute our c1's
and our c2's back in.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.080
We have our particular solution
for those initial

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.500
conditions.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.440
And I think that warrants
a different color.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.010
So our particular solution is
y of x is equal to c1, which

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:34.190
we figured out is 9e to the
minus 2x, plus c2-- well, c2

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.230
is minus 7-- minus 7e
to the minus 3x.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.510
That is the particular solution
to our original

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.415
differential equation.

00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:48.230
And it might be a good exercise
for you to actually

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.975
test it out.

00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:53.440
This particular solution to this
differential equation.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.160
I'll do another example
in the next video.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.790
I'll see you soon.
