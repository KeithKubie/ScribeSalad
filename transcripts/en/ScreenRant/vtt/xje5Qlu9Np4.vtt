00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.279
Superheroes are more prominent in pop culture
today than ever before.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.080
Not only are comic books still going strong
as an art form, the comic book movie is also

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.890
the most popular genre in Hollywood.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.309
More people now know facts about superheroes
as a result.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.310
They know Wolverine and Deadpool have regenerative
healing factors, they know Spider-Man obtained

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.089
his powers after a radioactive spider bit
him, they know Superman is vulnerable to Kryptonite,

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.460
and they know Thor has a hammer that they
can't pronounce the name of properly - but

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.329
they don't know everything about these iconic
characters.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.420
This video will run you through some lesser-known
facts about superheroes.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.540

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:52.829
Here are ten superhero facts that never crossed
your mind.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.920
Superman Was Originally Meant To Be Evil
As far as superheroes go, Superman is not

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.690
only the most iconic of them all, he's also
the epitome of a shining beacon of good.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.690
It takes a lot to make him breach his own
moral code and he is very rarely anything

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.409
other than righteous and noble - so it's hard
to believe that he was actually originally

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.070
intended to be a villain.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.591
Jerry Siegel - one of the men who co-created
the Man of Steel - first envisaged the character

00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:15.730
as "The Super-Man," who would have been a
bad guy with intentions to take over the whole

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.470
world and enslave humanity.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.110
Fortunately, that character concept didn't
come into fruition - otherwise the entire

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:30.740
comic book scene would have been vastly different
today.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.670
Spider-Man Once Operated As Four Different
Heroes

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.820
It's hard to imagine New York student Peter
Parker working under any other superhuman

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.530
guise than that of the iconic Spider-Man,
but at one point in his comic book history

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.500
he had no choice but to change his name and
image - and he actually used four different

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.880
identities to carry out his heroic escapades.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.860
It happened when Spider-Man was being hunted
by the police, after Norman Osborn had framed

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.860
him for murder.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.390
Parker donned four different costumes and
used four separate identities to go about

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.060
his duties - all of which had different weapons,
gadgets and abilities.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.630
There was Hornet and Prodigy, who actually
acted as heroes, and Ricochet and Dusk, who

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.580
posed as criminals while actually doing heroic
things undercover in the criminal underbelly

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.580
of New York.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.780
The four identities went on to be used by
other individuals after Spider-Man was able

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.400
to come out of hiding.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.110
Wonder Woman Ran For President (Twice)
In a world in which tiny-hands himself, Mr.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.840
Donald Trump, is causing controversy every
single day in his role as the President of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.500
the United States of America, having a president
as morally sound as Wonder Woman is about

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.170
as far from being reality as one could possibly
imagine.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.560
However, the fictional Amazonian heroine has
actually been seen running for president twice!

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.310
DC's utmost feminist icon took political action
on the 1972 cover of Gloria Steinem’s Ms.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.270
Magazine, accompanied by the headline “Wonder
Woman for President!”

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.820
The cover of the original 1943 Wonder Woman
comic book featured the same scenario - and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.360
all of this is in spite of the fact that Wonder
Woman isn't even American!

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.080
The aformentioned Mr. Trump would NOT approve
of that!

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.870
Wolverine Was Originally Meant To Be A Teenager
Since his first appearance back in 1974, Wolverine

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.010
has been depicted as a grizzled man - even
a very old one in certain stories - and that's

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.880
been an essential part of his character.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.810
He's battle-hardened, war-torn, absolutely
no-nonsense, and often seemingly sick of the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.069
world around him - but that could have been
very different if he'd been presented as was

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.890
originally intended.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.900
Wolverine was actually meant to be a teenager!

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.010
The change to his character dynamic would
have been massive and, thankfully, Marvel

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.600
went with the Logan we know today.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.670
Additionally, the plan was for him to only
have enhanced senses and an animalistic rage,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.000
and not the healing factor and adamantium
claws he so famously possesses instead.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.020
Aquaman's First Love Was A Dolphin
Aquaman takes a lot of abuse and is often

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.560
the source of laughs, in spite of the fact
that he's actually a very powerful and formidable

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.790
character - but it shouldn't really come as
a surprise, given some of his behaviour in

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.140
his earlier appearances.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.740
One such example was that his first love was
actually a dolphin.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.850
That's right, Aquaman was in love with a dolphin,
who went by the name "Nera" (so it's probably

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.870
no coincidence that Nera is a very similar
name to the woman who would later become his

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.870
wife).

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.900
The relationship with Nera ended when Aquaman
was jilted in favour of another dolphin - who

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.250
happened to be Aquaman's adopted brother.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.569
It's something the character would never live
down and, in spite of the fact that he longer

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:20.180
seeks relationships with marine animals, he's
still a target for mockery.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.430
Thor Once Helped Hitler
Thor is one of the only beings in the Marvel

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.259
universe worthy of wielding Mjolnir for a
reason.

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.819
He's heroic, brave, selfless and, as a general
rule, good.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.530
But he once did something quite unspeakable
- even if he wasn't fully aware of what he

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.180
was doing; he helped Adolf Hitler.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.080
In 1978's The Invaders #33, Captain America
and his team - the titular Invaders - discovered

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.259
Thor helping the infamous Führer and the
Nazis on their mission to kill Joseph Stalin.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.090
When Thor initially failed to do slay Stalin,
Hitler even had the audacity to give him a

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.710
stern telling off! Thor ultimately realised
that he had made a terrible error in judgement

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.059
- isn't THAT an understatement? - but seeing
him working alongside arguably the most evil

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:07.610
man in real world history was quite the shock.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.840
Ultimate Hulk Hates Freddie Prinze Jr.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.740
The Marvel multivese consists of a near infinite
number of universes, meaning every Marvel

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.430
hero has counterparts in different timelines,
and for this particular entry we're moving

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.360
away from the classic 616 Universe and taking
you to Earth-1610 AKA the Ultimate Universe.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.270
Back in 2002, the Ultimate version of Bruce
Banner was extremely upset to see that Betty

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.050
Ross was dating the actor Freddie Prinze Jr.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.860
He was so upset, in fact, that the Hulk was
gunning for the actor and actually wanted

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.370
to find him and eat him!

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.009
The Avengers saved him in the end, but the
beef between Hulk and Freddie didn't end there

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.069
- it actually spread to the real world!

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.550
In 2014, the actor called out Hulk for a fight,
saying "Hulk had beef with me.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.479
I've got a Hulk pool toy, so he don't look
so tough now.

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.479
Bring it, Hulk!"

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.870
He even went on to call out Hulk actor Mark
Ruffalo, saying "Who's playing the Hulk now?

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.870
Mark?

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.870
Gracie.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.870
Jiu-jitsu.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.870
Torrence Academy.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.509
Let's go!"

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:06.060
Batman Was Inspired By 3 Iconic Characters
Batman AKA Bruce Wayne is one of DC's flagship

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.139
characters and one of the most iconic superheroes
in all of fiction.

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.009
He's pretty unique, so it's hard to imagine
that almost every aspect of the character

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.219
was heavily influenced by other people - both
real and fictional - but he actually was.

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.080
The Batman side of the character was heavily
influenced by Zorro, the Shadow and, believe

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.559
it or not, Dracula - and it's pretty clear
to see those influences when you actually

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:28.080
think about them.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.569
Moreover, the name of his civilian identity
comes from two unlikely real world people

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.169
- Scottish folk hero Robert the Bruce, and
the United States Army general and statesman

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.520
Mad Anthony Wayne.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.379
Captain America Turned Into A Werewolf
Like may other fictional universes, Marvel's

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:49.740
comic book universe has a supernatural element.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.919
There are ghosts, vampires, zombies, demons
and indeed werewolves, for example - but you

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.009
probably already knew that.

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.110
What you might not know is that Marvel icon
Captain America actually became a werewolf

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.150
on one occasion!

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.810
It happened in 1992's Captain America #405,
after the evil Nightshade injected the hero

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.240
with her werewolf serum.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.659
Despite the rather obvious physical change,
Cap's personality barely changed at all, and

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.419
he managed to escape, before stumbling inexplicably
across Wolverine.

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.360
Cap being a werewolf and Wolverine being in
a berserker rage was a recipe for a fight

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.819
- and that's exactly what the pair had.

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.569
Wolverine slashed at Wolf-Cap's shoulder,
then Cap embraced his new form and slashed

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:31.189
Wolverine's eye, before literally throwing
him away from the fight.

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:35.840
Deadpool Isn't Completely Indestructible
Deadpool is an incredibly popular character

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:47.479
who has now successfully transfered from the
pages of Marvel comic books to 

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:50.089
the big screen.

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:53.729
Everyone knows he has an extremely impressive
healing factor, but the character's popularity

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:58.189
often results in fanboys and girls claiming
that he's completely indestructible as a result

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:00.839
of it - but the fact is he absolutely isn't.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:05.149
Sure, he's come back from some serious injuries
and even from being reduced to a single speck

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:09.090
of bood, but he's been outright killed (or
at least effectively killed) on more than

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.379
one occasion in the past.

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:14.430
Most recently, in the Death of Deadpool arc,
he died along with everyone else when his

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.370
entire universe collided with the Ultimate
Universe.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.899
In Age of Apocalypse, Nightcrawler decapitated
him and teleported his head away from his

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:23.749
body, rendering it unable to heal.

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:27.740
He was also reduced to a mushy pile of flesh
by Thanos, before the villain realised that

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.039
killing Deadpool actually did him a favour.

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:33.729
So, next time somebody tries to tell you that
Deadpool can't be beaten, feel free to prove

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:35.630
them wrong.
