00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.380
- [Narrator] Why is the
Speaker second in succession

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.690
to the President after the Vice President?

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.290
- The idea of succession actually

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.930
it was a little muddied
and it wasn't until

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.802
the 25th amendment that actually

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:14.540
the relationship between the President

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.890
and the Vice President
was actually formalized.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.110
When William Henry Harrison died

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.480
and John Tyler came in,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.870
his Vice President as President

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.410
there was a big debate about whether

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.720
he was actually really the President.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.720
So, even though the line of
succession is written down

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.470
there's a lot of debate about whether

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.140
what enforces it and what doesn't.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.110
The Speaker of the House
though has prominence

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.050
in that line of succession because

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.730
the Speaker of the House
is closest to the people

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.624
and the formation of
the federal government.

00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:49.440
Article one defines the powers of Congress

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.630
because the framers wanted Congress

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.230
really to be the powerful branch,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.180
close to the people.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.920
They were worried about a monarchy.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.960
So they didn't want the President to have

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.730
excessive power and the
Speaker of the House represents

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.550
all of the, is elected
by all of the members

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.640
and so has a closer
relationship to the people

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.990
and that's what gives them power

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.060
in the question of succession.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.460
What's interesting though is that there's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.890
only been one Speaker of the House

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.460
who's then gone on to be President,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.950
James K. Polk.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.440
So while they are high up
in the order of succession

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.910
behind the Vice President,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.180
that doesn't necessarily make the job

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.040
a stepping stone to actual
power of the presidency

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.573
through the electoral process.
