00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:01.312
- Whoa!

00:00:01.312 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Teacher] What do you see now?

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.040
- A penguin!

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.360
I can see a boat!

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.300
- [Mr. Berry] Surprise and Delight

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.700
is the heartbeat of our school.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.120
It is that element of fun,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.460
and excitement and engagement.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.320
It's taking anything that
you normally would do,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.270
and then trying to crank it up
to something that's awesome.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.700
It is embedded in every
aspect of our culture.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.960
Even the space itself.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.110
We have holograms.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.330
We have vending machines

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.170
that are stocked with student product.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.610
We have the hallway made of lava tiles.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.350
- Surprise and Delights also
happen within the classroom.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.480
Oftentimes we use technology.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.670
One of those Surprise and Delights

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.610
that students love a lot,
is the virtual field trip.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.940
- [Teacher] Scientist. That's right.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.539
What do you think the
scientist is studying?

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:48.372
- The penguin?

00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:49.205
- [Teacher] The penguins, maybe?

00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:51.840
He could be studying
penguins, you're right.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.690
- You can change the place or the space,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.030
it can be just a treat,
the activity itself.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.730
- Okay, so guys, you all remember

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.590
that yesterday in class, we
read "Doughnuts Don't Lie"

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.820
and the author Angela Wilkinson

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.766
is a former graduate of
Eminence High School.

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.006
- Hello guys!

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:11.530
- [Students] Hi!

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.560
- Today we had the
opportunity to ask the author

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.470
of the book "Doughnuts
Don't Lie" questions.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.470
- After publishing it, I did wonder.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.500
Will people like this book?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.780
- [Daynisha] Then Ms. Montgomery,
she gave us doughnuts.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.613
- [Ms. Montgomery] I'll go ahead

00:01:25.613 --> 00:01:27.120
and start this one down this way.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.947
- They're so good!

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:31.230
(laughter)

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.230
- [Ms. Montgomery] The
Surprise and Delight

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.690
completely changes the school culture.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.330
It makes it fun and exciting,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.660
a great place to be.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.730
- We want kids to want to be here.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.640
We want them to be thinking differently,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.830
and to make them creative,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.380
and so Surprise and Delight,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.770
it triggers new ideas for everybody.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.010
- Another clue!

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.160
- Clue.
- A ha!
