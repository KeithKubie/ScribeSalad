like them that those systems arose and
and that there are steps you can take to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
and that there are steps you can take to
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.380
and that there are steps you can take to
limit the probability that you would

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
limit the probability that you would
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630
limit the probability that you would
participate in such a thing and that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
actions because the stability of those
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.730
actions because the stability of those
systems depends on the willingness of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
systems depends on the willingness of
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.499
