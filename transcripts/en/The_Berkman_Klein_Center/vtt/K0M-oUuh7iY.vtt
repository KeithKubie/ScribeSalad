00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.470
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.040
I suggested, in the preceding
segment of this lecture,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.280
that many people believe that
retribution and perhaps deterrence

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.820
are inappropriate roles for private
copyright infringement suits.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.770
Such things, is commonly said,
should be left to the criminal law.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.100
Why?

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.750
In part because the government,
representing the people as a whole

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.300
not individual parties,
is the right party

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.260
to identify behavior
worthy of punishment

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.410
and to impose such punishments.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.670
A more subtle explanation
sometimes offered

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.730
is that enforcement of criminal law,
unlike enforcement of civil law,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.790
is controlled by prosecutors who can
and do exercise discretion in selecting,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.630
from among the surplus of
potentially punishable actions, those

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.730
that truly merit prosecution.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.290
Arguably, in short,
there's an important role

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.990
for criminal sanctions
in the law of copyright.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.590
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.630
For better or worse until recently, the
role that criminal law actually played

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.360
was modest.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.630
Although the United States first adopted
criminal copyright penalties in 1897,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.860
until the late 20th Century, they
were rarely applicable to instances

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.480
of copyright infringement and
even more rarely enforced.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.780
In the last 15 years,
the tide has turned.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.640
Congress repeatedly has both
expanded the set of activities

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.160
that are subject to criminal
penalties and increased

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.590
the magnitude of those penalties.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.470
Prosecutions, relying on the strength
and rules, have been increasing.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.180
Here are a few
manifestations of this trend.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.509
In 1994, David LaMacchia, then an
MIT graduate student shown here

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.880
with his lawyer, set up an
electronic bulletin board

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.280
and encouraged users to upload to it
copies of popular commercial software

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.830
programs which other users could
then download to their own computers.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.990
At a time, Section 505(a)
of the copyright statute

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.140
was, in the court's judgment, the
only applicable criminal provision.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.690
And it required the government to
prove that the defendant acted quote

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.110
willfully and for the purpose
of commercial advantage

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.090
or private financial gain close quote.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.070
Because LaMacchia had not sought to
profit in any way from his actions,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.430
he escaped liability.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.500
In response, Congress adopted
the so-called No Electronic Theft

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.530
Act, which closed what it
saw as a loophole by adding,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.140
as an additional possible
basis of liability,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.780
that the defendant made multiple
copies of copyrighted works

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.460
worth more than $2,500.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.500
The relevant provision has since
been amended to make it even easier

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.230
for the government.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.130
The current version of Section 505(a)
allows conviction upon a showing

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.220
that the defendant reproduced or
distributed during any 180-day period

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.540
one or more copies or phonorecords of
one or more copyrighted works, which

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.480
have a total retail value
of more than $1,000.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.960
These statutory adjustments have since
enabled the government to secure guilty

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.400
pleas from defendants who engaged
in conduct similar to LaMacchia's.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.390
 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.500
It should be emphasized that the
pertinent criminal penalties are not

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.780
trivial.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.820
In addition to fines, defendants
convicted under 505(a)

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.700
are potentially subject to
substantial terms of imprisonment.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.280
Back to our list.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.710
As you know from the
previous lecture, in 1998,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.400
Congress adopted the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.250
which, among other things, added
to the copyright statute Section

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.370
1201 which imposes serious criminal
sanctions on persons who circumvent

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.680
technological protection
measures or traffic in technology

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.120
designed for such circumvention.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.360
In 2004, Congress adopted the
Anti-Counterfeiting Amendments Act,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.549
which criminalized trafficking in
false labels on copyrighted works.

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:41.340
The following year, it added the
Family Entertainment and Copyright

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.060
Act, which penalized the
recording of movies in theaters.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.580
Finally in 2008, Congress adopted the
Prioritizing Resources and Organization

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.200
for Intellectual
Property Act, the Pro-IP

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.570
Act for short, which converted
to felonies most copyright

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.720
related offenses that
previously had been misdemeanors

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.700
and increased the resources
of the Justice Department

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.350
for pursuing IP related crimes.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.440
 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.110
Since then, the United States has
sought during trade negotiations

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.200
to persuade other nations to increase
the levels of criminal copyright

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.750
enforcement in their own jurisdictions.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.220
The most important
such initiative to date

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.050
is the Anti-Counterfeiting
Trade Agreement.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.440
In whose negotiation, the United
States was a major participant.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.590
As you can see, Article 23 of
ACTA requires member countries,

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.590
among other things, to quote provide
for criminal procedures and penalties

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.180
to be applied at least in cases of
willful copyright or related rights

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.490
piracy on a commercial scale.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.570
Note how the next
clause in the provision

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.330
attempts to grapple with
the same issues addressed

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.650
in the No Electronic Theft Act quote
acts carried out on a commercial scale

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.050
include at least those carried
out as commercial activities

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.180
for direct or indirect economic
or commercial advantage.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.100
 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.710
As you know from lecture number one,
ACTA has not yet entered into force

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.540
and may never do so.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.730
But if it does, it will extend the US
trend toward increasingly expensive

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.470
criminal copyright liability
to other member countries.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.710
 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.590
These legislative initiatives
have been accompanied

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.580
by an increasing in the frequency
of prosecution, both in the US

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.950
and in other countries.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.600
Among the most high profile cases
was the successful prosecution

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.820
in Sweden of the four people who set
up and ran the file sharing site Pirate

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.300
Bay.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.120
Although the Swedish authorities
seem to have had trouble

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.070
enforcing the relatively
modest prison terms and fines

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.520
imposed on those four defendants.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.320
Even more notorious are the ongoing
efforts of the US prosecutors

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.410
to extradite and prosecute Kim
Dotcom, the flamboyant creator

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.930
of the New Zealand-based
site Megaupload.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.470
Before it was shut down, Megaupload
was definitely a for profit enterprise.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:29.860
Between 2005 and 2012, according
to the indictment in the case,

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.620
Megaupload earned more than $150
million in paid subscriptions

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.300
and more than $25 million
in advertising fees.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.470
In 2010 alone Mr. Dotcom himself
earned more than $42 million.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.060
 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.610
Not all of these prosecutions
have resulted in convictions.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.930
For example, Isamu Kaneko, the Japanese
developer of the Winny file sharing

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.430
system, was ultimately
acquitted on the ground

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.260
that the system, although most
often used for illegal purposes,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.280
was capable of substantial
non-infringing uses.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.970
Note the echo of the
Betamax CONSU defense here.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.150
But in most of these cases, the
government has ultimately prevailed.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.790
 

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.420
One of the most recent prosecutions
came painfully close to home.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:32.330
Aaron Swartz was a brilliant young
programmer and internet activist.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.360
Among many other things, he helped
found the social news site reddit

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.510
and helped Larry Lessig establish
Creative Commons about which you

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.610
learned in lecture number six.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.120
Swartz believed deeply that
information of all sorts

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.310
should be widely accessible.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.530
And that belief proved his undoing.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.450
In 2011, while he was a fellow
at Harvard's Safra Center,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.910
Swartz surreptitiously downloaded
a large number of journal articles

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:08.880
from the website of JSTOR, a massive
nonprofit repository of such articles,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.410
to a laptop computer that
he placed in a closet

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.840
at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.740
Most likely, Swartz intended
to make the articles

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.030
available to the public at large.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.930
But he never did so.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.330
His actions were detected,
and he was arrested.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.090
He subsequently returned to JSTOR
all of the data he had downloaded.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.630
JSTOR itself, the
ostensible victim of Swartz'

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.600
misconduct, released
a statement indicating

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.020
that it would not bring a civil
copyright infringement suit against him

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.720
and did not support a
criminal prosecution.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.900
Nevertheless, the United
States Attorney in Boston

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.690
pressed forward with the prosecution.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.190
Swartz was indicted, not for
violating Section 506(a),

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.340
but for quote wire
fraud, computer fraud,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.810
unlawfully obtaining information
from a protected computer,

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:08.710
and recklessly damaging a
protected computer closed quote.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.800
In a press release
accompanying the indictment,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.350
the US Attorney announced that
quote, if convicted on these charges,

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.190
Swartz faces up to 35 years
in prison to be followed

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.430
by three years of supervised
release, restitution, forfeiture,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.450
and a fine of up to $1 million.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.660
 

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.830
Swartz' lawyer sought to
negotiate a plea bargain.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.950
The prosecutors reportedly were willing
to accept a deal under which Swartz

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.900
would serve only six
months in jail but no less.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.440
The lawyers failed to come to terms.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.630
A trial loomed.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:54.570
In January of this year, at the age
of 26, Swartz committed suicide.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.760
Several forces and
circumstances undoubtedly

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.000
contributed to his
decision to end his life.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.230
But one of them,
undoubtedly, was anxiety

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.505
caused by the ongoing prosecution
and the prospect of a trial

00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:09.130
and likely conviction and imprisonment.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.740
 

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:17.280
His suicide could and
should have been avoided.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.960
To be sure, Swartz most
likely had committed a crime.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.820
Owen Kerr a specialist
in this field, may well

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.770
have been right when he wrote,
"All of the charges against Swartz

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.080
were based on established case law.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.130
Indeed, once the decision to
charge the case had been made,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.600
the charges brought here
were pretty much what

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.640
any good federal prosecutor
would have charged."

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.740
Close quote.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.680
But one of the crucial
responsibilities of a prosecutor

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.465
is to decide not just when successful
criminal prosecution is possible

00:11:51.465 --> 00:11:54.240
but when it is appropriate.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.025
Prosecutors, as we've seen, have
discretion not to bring charges at all,

00:12:00.025 --> 00:12:06.010
to bring lesser charges than they might,
or to accept lenient plea bargains.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.110
This is just the sort of case in
which the exercise of such discretion

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:14.170
is warranted, even demanded.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.820
Swartz' motives were
altruistic not mercenary.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.140
He had no interest in making money.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.490
His goal was to make scholarship
more widely available.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.520
The contrast between
his motives and those

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.420
of all the other defendants I
canvased a few minutes ago is stark.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.360
JSTOR, the victim of
his unlawful behavior,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:41.680
acknowledged that JSTOR had not been
harmed and sought no civil remedy.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.720
Now, to repeat, Swartz was
certainly not blameless.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.300
Arguably, his actions were misguided.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.470
A colorable argument could be made
that the uncontrolled dissemination

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.890
of scholarly articles that
he sought to accomplish

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.830
would have seriously disrupted the
business of academic publishing

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.500
and thus threaten several the
interest that this course has

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.500
sought to highlight.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.650
A better, more responsible way of
making scholarship more widely available

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.360
would have been either to seek
reform of the copyright statute

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.130
or the rules that govern
governmentally-funded research.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.940
Or as my colleague
Stuart Shieber has done,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.160
to persuade professors
or their universities

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:29.740
to insist that academic articles be
posted on publicly available websites.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.410
In short, the methods that
Swartz chose to pursue his vision

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.040
may well have been wrong.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.400
But there's a big difference
between misguided idealism

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.460
and the sort of
self-serving piracy at which

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.630
the criminal statutes
are primarily aimed.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:52.030
Perhaps some sort of criminal penalty
was warranted in this case, perhaps

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.670
a deferred prosecution
agreement which would

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.090
have been effective in
preventing Swartz from engaging

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.610
in similar conduct in the future.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.660
Perhaps.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.220
But certainly not six months in jail.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:09.850
In short, the prosecutors in this case
failed to exercise their power wisely.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.900
I know and respect one
of those prosecutors.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.280
He's not a cruel person.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.146
But he and his colleagues
acted irresponsibly,

00:14:19.146 --> 00:14:20.270
and the result was tragedy.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.030
 

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.470
From that tragedy, at least
two lessons can be drawn.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:32.675
First, criminal sanctions are
both formidable and dangerous.

00:14:32.675 --> 00:14:38.010
They have important social functions,
but their power makes them risky.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.820
The hazard that they will be
imposed in appropriate circumstances

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.600
is exacerbated by the large
and increasing diversity

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.570
of the sets of circumstances, and
the kinds of technologies implicated

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.900
by copyright law, and
the kinds of activities

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.400
that may constitute
copyright infringement.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.180
It's impossible for legislators to
anticipate all of those circumstances

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.870
and to differentiate them on the
basis of the severity of the harms

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.840
they threaten and consequently the
severity of the sanctions they merit.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.850
It's, thus, imperative
that the people who

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.220
control the machinery, the
criminal law exercise their power

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.475
sensitively and wisely.

00:15:19.475 --> 00:15:22.050
 

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:27.530
The second broader point is that
the copyright system as a whole

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.460
is an extraordinarily
complex and powerful machine.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.360
As I hope you now see, it
affects myriad dimensions

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.130
of the global economy and culture.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.200
It seeks, simultaneously, to
advance many different social goals

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.880
and to protect many different rights and
freedoms, some of which are intention.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.130
Effectively operating a machine
this complex and important

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.710
requires care and, again, wisdom.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:00.170
When tuned intelligently
and deployed thoughtfully,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.880
copyright has enormous
and growing benefits.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.490
If it is out of tune or deployed
thoughtlessly, it can cause great harm.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.050
My ambition in this
lecture series has been

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.630
to provide you the information
and analytical tools

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.380
you need not just to understand the
copyright system as it currently exists

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:25.340
but to participate in the ongoing
project of adopting that machine

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:31.280
to deal responsibly with changing
social and cultural circumstances.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.420
I hope you have found the
lectures helpful in this regard.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.700
Thank you for your
patience and attention.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.614
