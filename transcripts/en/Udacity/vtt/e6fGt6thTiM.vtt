00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.160
Imagine, you're a computational biologist who just

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.200
got a job at 23andMe. Congratulations, and now

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.030
you're working on their ancestry and relative finder

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.410
features. Your job is to create algorithms to

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.950
determine identity by descent or IBD scores.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.240
To see how related two people might be.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.460
Remember we learned about IBD in lesson 11.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.760
In writing your code you see an example

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.130
that gives you pause. In one comparison you

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.880
see two people who share short segments of

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.280
five different chromosomes. All about the same size.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.740
But in a different comparison with two different people,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.680
you see a comparison that shows one long

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.160
shared segment from just one chromosome. It's about twice

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.330
the size of the segments from the other

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.250
comparison. So as you continue to write your code,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.600
which of these scenarios should be ranked as more related? Which of them

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.945
shows a closer relationship? The individuals with

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.460
five shared short segments, or the individuals

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.720
with the one shared longer segment. I want you to pick which answer

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.850
you think is best, and then tell me why in the text box here.
