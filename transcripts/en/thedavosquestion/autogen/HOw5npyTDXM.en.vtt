00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.660
Hello I'm Arthur Mutambara from Zimbabwe.
I'm addressing the question of whether the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.250
environment is going to lose out to the economy
in this year. First and foremost, I think

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.740
this is a wrongly posed question. It's not
an either or situation. We need to empoower

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.520
our ships and know everything about the environment,
know everything about the economy. They're

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.140
interconnected. In other words you can't actually
succeed economically without serving environments.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.699
In other words we must understand the environment
as an engine for economic growth. We must

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.930
understand the environment as a platform to
bring about sustainable development in economic

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.460
growth which is spread across the different
nations on the world. Across the different

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.059
tresses of each country. So, no, the environment
won't lose out to the economy. If we get our

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.670
ideas clear, we are going to be able to serve
the environment. We are going to be able to

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.250
use several methods of energy, greener technologies,
to drive economic development. So there's

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.111
go to me a somatic function between to environment
and technology. You will not succeed in economic

00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:11.880
endeavors unless you are to embrace the ecological
agenda. The climate change agenda. Also, in

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.490
the climate agenda, space. You won't succeed
in serving the globe unless you address the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.639
needs of those who are victims of the economic
activities in this world. A poor starving

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:27.359
peasant in Dafur can reset the environment,
though it often causes commotion in that country.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:33.539
So it's important that we address these matters
in a holistic manner. The environment, poverty,

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:41.159
HIV/AIDS, nuclear weapons, governs, that interconnected
what we seek to achieve. Our holistic solutions

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.369
that address all these matters. There is no
conflict whatsoever between the environment

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.039
and the economy. They work hand in hand. And
for us to have a sustainable economic idea

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.969
we can make model, we must address the climate
change agenda.
