00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.920
So we have f of x equaling 4x
to the fifth minus 3x squared

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.870
plus 3, all of that over
6x to the fifth minus 100x

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.690
squared minus 10.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.830
Now, what I want
to think about is--

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:21.667
what is the limit of f of
x, as x approaches infinity?

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.750
And there are several ways
that you could do this.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.410
You could actually try to plug
in larger and larger numbers

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.410
for x and see if it seems to
be approaching some value.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.396
Or you could reason
through this.

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:33.270
And when I talk about
reasoning through this,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.140
it's to think about the
behavior of this numerator

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.684
and denominator as x gets
very, very, very large.

00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:41.850
And when I'm talking about
that, what I'm saying is,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.580
as x gets very, very
large-- let's just

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.610
focus on the numerator.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.470
As x gets very, very
large, this term right

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.640
over here in the numerator--
4x to the fifth--

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.930
is going to become a much,
much more significant

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.460
than any of these other things.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.795
Something squaring gets large.

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:56.670
But something being
raised to the fifth power

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670
gets raised that
much, much faster.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.600
Similarly, in the denominator,
this term right over here-,,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.510
the highest degree
term-- 6x to the fifth--

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.070
is going to grow much, much,
much faster than any of these

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.600
other terms.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.350
Even though this has 100 as a
coefficient or a negative 100

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.000
as a coefficient, when you take
something to the fifth power,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.960
it's going to grow so much
faster than x squared.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.470
So as x gets very,
very, very large,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670
this thing is going
to approximate 4x

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:36.800
to the fifth over 6x to the
fifth for a very large, large x

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.910
Or we could say as x
approaches infinity.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.877
Now, what could this
be simplified to?

00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:45.210
Well, you have x to the fifth
divided by x to the fifth.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730
These are going
to grow together.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.320
So these you can think
of them as canceling out.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.130
And so you are left with 2/3.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.010
So what you could say
is-- the limit of f

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.140
of x, as x approaches infinity,
as x gets larger and larger

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.890
and larger, all of
these other terms

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.480
aren't going to
matter that much.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.375
And so it's going
to approach 2/3.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.320
Now, let's look at
the graph and see

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.509
if that actually makes sense.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.050
What we're actually
saying is that we

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.630
have a horizontal asymptote
at y is equal to 2/3.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.490
So lets look at the graph.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.260
So right here is the graph.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.390
Got it from Wolfram Alpha.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.440
And we see, indeed, as x gets
larger and larger and larger, f

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.415
of x seems to be approaching
this value that looks right

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:28.210
at around 2/3.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.440
So it looks like we have
a horizontal asymptote

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.615
right over here.

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:34.830
Let me draw that a
little bit neater.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.860
We have a horizontal
asymptote right at 2/3.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.340
So let me draw it
as neatly as I can.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.350
So this right over here
is y is equal to 2/3.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.540
The limit as x gets
really, really large,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.370
as it approaches infinity, y
is getting closer and closer

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.310
and closer to 2/3.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.530
And when we just look
at the graph here,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.440
it seems like the same
thing is happening

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.820
from the bottom direction, when
x approaches negative infinity.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.040
So we could say the
limit of f of x,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.110
as x approaches
negative infinity, that

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.730
also looks like it's 2/3.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790
And we can use the
exact same logic.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.950
When x becomes a very,
very, very negative number,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.590
as it becomes
further and further

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.620
to the left on the number
line, the only terms

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.800
that are going to matter are
going to be the 4x to the fifth

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.250
and the 6x to the fifth.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.240
So this is true
for very large x's.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.580
It's also true for
very negative x's.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.230
So we could also say, as x
approaches negative infinity,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.564
this is also true.

00:03:37.564 --> 00:03:39.730
And then, the x to the fifth
over the x to the fifth

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.710
is going to cancel out.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.970
These are the dominant terms.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.400
And we're going to
get it equaling 2/3.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.160
And once again, you see
that in the graph here.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.610
We have a horizontal asymptote
at y is equal to 2/3.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.910
We take the limit of f of
x as x approaches infinity,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.710
we get 2/3.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.610
And the limit of f of x as x
approaches negative infinity

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.410
is 2/3.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.910
So in general,
whenever you do this,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.284
you just have to
think about what

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.900
terms are going to
dominate the rest?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.072
And focus on those.
