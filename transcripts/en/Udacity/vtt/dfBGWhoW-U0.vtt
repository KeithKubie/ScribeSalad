00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.330
There is one more important point to be noted here.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.220
This again is the illustration from incremental concept learning. When we

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.480
were talking about incremental concept learning, we talked about technique for

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.337
learning. We did not talk about how this concept were going to be used.

00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:17.620
How about in correcting mistakes, we're talking about

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.638
how the agent actually uses the knowledge it learns. This point too,

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:28.370
is centered [INAUDIBLE] reason. The first reason is that knowledge based AI,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.500
looks at reasoning. Looks at action, besides how knowledge is going to be used.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.230
And then, determined what knowledge is to be learned. Assess the target for

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.480
learning, secondly you may recall this particular figure for

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.640
the target of architecture that we'd drawn earlier. You may see that reasoning,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.580
learning and memory are closely connected, and all of that is occurring on

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.120
the surface of action selection. This figure suggests that we not only learn,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.080
so that we can do action selection. But additionally, as we do action selection,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.420
and we get feedback from the world, it informs the learning.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.160
As this figure suggests, intelligent agents, cognitive systems, not only learn,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.630
so that they can take actions on the world. But further, that the world gives

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.255
some feedback, and that feedback informs the learning. Once again, failure

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:22.310
a great opportunities for learning. One additional point to be made here,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.830
learning by correcting mistakes, use learning as a problem-solving activity.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.430
An agent meets failure, it needs to learn from the failure.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.324
It converts this learning task into a problem-solving task. Let us first,

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:37.910
identify what knowledge are related to failure. Then, let us build and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.720
explanation for this. Then we'll repair it. This learning is closely intertwined

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.130
with memory, reasoning, action, and feedback from the world. Notice also,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.670
that there's reasoning, learning, and memory here. In the deliberation module

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.660
closely connected with the metacognition module. Here, the reasoning, memory,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.040
and learning may be about action selection in the world.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.440
But in a metacognition module may have its own reasoning, learning, and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.750
memory capacities. And some of the learning in the metacognition is about fixing

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.880
the errors in the deliberative reasoning. So, metacognition is thinking about

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.970
thinking. The agent uses the knowledge, to think about the action selection, and

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.550
it conducted those actions in the world. Metacognition is thinking about

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.880
what went wrong in its original thinking. What was the knowledge error?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.010
We'll return to metacognition in the lesson on metareasoning.
