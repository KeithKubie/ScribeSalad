for your loss.

I like your shoes.
They're very nice.

for your loss.

Genevieve Russell?

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.391
- Oh, that's totally me.
The priest knows my name.

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.627
How cool is that?
How'd you know?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.229 align:start position:0%
- Because this ceremony
ended 15 minutes ago,

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.764 align:start position:0%
and we've been waiting
for a Genevieve Russell

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:34.100 size:88% position:44%
to deliver the final eulogy.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.202
- Oh, shoot.
Okay, yeah. Coming.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:37.703
Where's the thing?
- What thing?

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.472 align:start position:0%
- [whispers] The paper.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:41.207
The eulogy. Where is it?
- I don't have it.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.209
I don't have it. Just wing it.
- I can't.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.477
- Just wing it.
- I'm not gonna wing it.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.379
I'm not a bird.
- Then do it. Go, go.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.314 align:start position:0%
- [whispering] All right.
What's wrong with your voice?

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.283
Why can't you whisper?
- I don't know. I don't know.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:57.790 align:start position:0%
- Hey, you're the truck
driver guy, right?

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.692 align:start position:0%
You're the guy
that killed Chet?

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.227
- Yes.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:06.132 align:start position:0%
- Oh, that's okay, man.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.669 align:start position:0%
Hey, I, uh--
can I ask you a question?

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
Were you scared?

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:16.542 align:start position:0%
Did he scare you,
even a bit?

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.411
- He scared the [bleep]
out of me.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.713 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.
[chuckles]

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:22.181 align:start position:0%
Yeah, he did.

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:23.649
- Ma'am?
- Coming.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.518 align:end position:100%
- Whoo! Yay, Gene.
Yay, Ge--

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.521
- Okay.
That's enough, Billie.

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:29.555
Hey, everybody.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.891
How's it going?

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:35.461
Um, sorry I'm late.

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.430
Not the sort of thing
you want to hurry up and get to,

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:38.731
am I right?

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.567
- [laughs]
- [clears throat]

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.904
Chet Bingham
was a maker of apps

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:48.341
and a lover of shadow
government conspiracy theory.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:52.178 align:start position:0%
He was my friend,
and I, uh...

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.880
I don't have
a lot of those,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:58.417
so losing one
is really hard.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.454
He--he was a...

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.623
Sorry.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.192
He was a...
[speaks gibberish]

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:08.161
Yeah.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.329
He was a...
[speaking gibberish]

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.431
He was a...
[speaks gibberish]

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:14.600
[speaking gibberish]

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.503
[gasps]
To know!

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:19.672
He was a...
[speaking gibberish]

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.642
- Okay.
- What I'm trying to say is...

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.677
[speaking gibberish]

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.912
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.513
Move, sir. Please.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:30.216
I got this.
- [speaking gibberish]

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:31.551
- Okay.
- [speaks gibberish]

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.619
- [mouths words]
- I'm sorry.

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:36.189 align:start position:0%
I feel like an idiot.
Move your Bible.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.723
- Move your Bible.
- Jesus.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.892
Hold this with your--
- What?

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:41.894 align:start position:0%
- Hold it with
your holy hands.

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:45.565 align:start position:0%
[clears throat]

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:50.403
I have never seen anyone
try and evade the pain of loss

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.438
as much as this woman
has today.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.906
- What's up?
- Is it

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.609
because she's a bad person?
- Yes.

00:02:56.642 --> 00:03:00.279
- No. Is it because
she has the maturity

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:02.315
of a Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle,

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.884
a TMNT?
No.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:08.321
It is because her heart

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.390
is as big as Chet's head
in this poster behind me,

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:13.259
which, if I am not mistaken,

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.927
has been sneaking up
this whole time

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.829
trying to push me in the coffin!
- What? No.

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:18.831
- No, sir! You won't have me!
- No. Billie. Someone. Someone.

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:20.399
- Stop it!
- Get her off of there!

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:21.634
- You will never--
- Get her off. Don't--

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:22.735
- Billie.
- I'll kill you!

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:23.769
- Billie!
- [screaming]

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:25.238
- Get off of him!

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.639
- You're not gonna
take me with you!

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:27.807
- Get off of him.
- I'm embarrassed.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.640
I'm embarrassed now,
please.
