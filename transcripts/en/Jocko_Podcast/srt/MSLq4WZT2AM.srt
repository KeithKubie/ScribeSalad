1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,690
Jocko.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,690
There is an army cliche that I'm sure
you've heard of or you've heard that goes,

3
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:08,440
everyone's leadership style is different.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,240
I've heard it used many times as a coverup
for a failed mission or with someone

5
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:14,620
who just isn't getting it done.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,500
What's your opinion on this for
all the advice that you give?

7
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:21,460
There seems to be a continuous method to
your madness and some basic principles

8
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:22,480
for being a good leader.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,820
Does everyone have a different leadership
style or is there an optimal optimal

10
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:30,850
method with personality tweaks?

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,100
That's just amazing how well this
Jujitsu comparison to this is, this is,

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,040
this is just an incredible translation
and if you know the way broad broadly you

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,890
you've seen in all things because what
this question is is exactly the same as

14
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:48,640
the question above and
the fact of the matter is,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,020
if you know Jujitsu,
Brazilian Jujitsu, yeah.

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,350
You know the fundamental principles of it,

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,850
you can do these tweaks them. If you don't
know the fundamental principles of it,

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,400
you're just going to get destroyed now.
Okay.

19
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,500
If you're a catch wrestler that those
have the same sort of fundamental things

20
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,740
going on. You know what I mean? If
you know sambal. So if you know judo,

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,320
so I'm saying if you understand,
I don't know what to call them,

22
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:17,770
but if you understand like the fundamental
principles of submission grappling of

23
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:20,350
any kind,
if you know what those are,

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,580
then you can make some tweaks to them.
You can make some,

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,080
some adjustments to them to bait based
on your style and your body type and your

26
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:32,200
personality and your
strengths and weaknesses. Yes,

27
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,020
it is the same thing with leadership.

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,030
So people are going to
have different styles.

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,790
They're going to have
different styles of leadership.

30
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,160
Some people are super
caring, charismatic, right?

31
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,440
And that person could take
advantage of their, their charisma.

32
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,910
Some people like connect with other
people really easily. Some people don't.

33
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,870
You're going to have just different little
nuances to your personality and your

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,730
brain that are going to,

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,910
that you're gonna make a little
adaptations and your leadership style.

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,810
That's okay.

37
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,770
Where it gets not okay is if you
leave the fundamental principles.

38
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,540
That's where you have a problem with.
Because there was a,

39
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,900
there's an example that I thought
of when I read this question.

40
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,160
There was a guy that was coming through
my training when I was running the uh,

41
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,370
the advanced training for the seals and
he was making actually leafs told story.

42
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,250
You remember life, he's told the
story. I think it's in the book too.

43
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,910
I don't remember, but it's, it's podcast
book. We've talked about it a bunch.

44
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:35,830
We talk about it when we
to go talk to clients.

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Life tells the story about how he was
trying to give commands over the radio and

46
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,990
no one's doing anything because it's
ineffective to give commands in the radio.

47
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,330
You know, when there's a lot of machine
gun fire and all the stuff going on.

48
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:53,260
So I said a life use verbal commands and
he kinda like looked at me like I was

49
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:56,110
crazy and I said to him and just
give it a try. He did it. It worked.

50
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,050
A couple of years later,
I'm running training.

51
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,860
There's a guy that's given a bunch of
commands on the radio and I go to him,

52
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,540
I go, hey man, use verbal commands. And
he's like, he's like, what do you mean?

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,320
And I'm like, yell at everyone so they
know what it is you want them to do.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,660
They can't hear you on the radio. There's
a lot of stuff going on. And he goes,

55
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,040
I don't lead that way.
That's what he said to me.

56
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,840
I don't lead that way.
And you know,

57
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:29,800
they just got destroyed because you know,
in his, I don't know if he thought like,

58
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,730
hey look,
I'm not going to yet.

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,600
I wasn't telling him to yell at US
people I was telling him like yelled the

60
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,500
verbal commands and he wouldn't do it.

61
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,300
And they just got
annihilated all the time.

62
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,020
And he ended up not doing well as a
leader because he was breaking the

63
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:52,000
fundamental principles of combat
leadership, like simple, clear,

64
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:54,160
concise commands that everyone understands
that if they don't understand it,

65
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,450
whose fault that is it,
it's yours.

66
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,150
And if you're talking on the
radio giving these complex orders,

67
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:00,970
people aren't going to understand what
to do. But if you give them the, the,

68
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,990
the standard operating procedure,
maneuver, command peel, right,

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,570
that's going to get passed
and everyone's going to do it.

70
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,390
So he strayed away from the
fundamental principles. It's like,

71
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,690
it's like saying, well, you
know with me, if I give you,

72
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,070
if I use a pressure point on your
neck, then I'll win. It's like, no,

73
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:23,410
actually that's not going to
be effective. You know, you,

74
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,880
the pressure point thing is a
fantasy. Oh No, it's real. Oh, okay.

75
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,620
It is real. You know what? And there's,

76
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,520
there's certain parts of your body that
hurt a little bit more when you press

77
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,090
into him.

78
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,040
I understand that that doesn't change you
from getting choked doesn't change you

79
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,390
from getting double leg take down.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,450
You try and hit some of the pressure point
while they're doing a double leg take

81
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:48,280
down on you. You're not going to make
it. No, it was not going to happen. So,

82
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,110
um, you, you,

83
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,590
you have enough told this story too
about the guy that wasn't very loud and I

84
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,760
told them like, Hey,
you've got to get louder.

85
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:00,910
And eventually he got the guys that were
allowed in his platoon to start giving

86
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,760
the verbal commands cause he wasn't
loud enough to do it and that was an

87
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,980
effective way.
Still using the same principle,

88
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,250
just using a little bit of a different
technique. That's fine. So yes,

89
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,630
different leaders are
going to lead differently,

90
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:14,380
but the principles are going to remain
the same that the principles of ownership

91
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,490
cover, move, simple,

92
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:19,300
prioritize and execute decentralized
command and balancing the dichotomies.

93
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,340
And then there's plenty of them in
leadership. The good leaders out there,

94
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,060
they will follow those principles and
they'll make little tweaks to them based

95
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,930
on their personality.
And that's fine.

96
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,460
But a tweak doesn't require an excuse
and also effective or ineffective.

97
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,030
Like if you make a change,

98
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,400
if you do something a certain
way and it's not effective,

99
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,610
then whatever you change, this
isn't working. It's not working.

100
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,160
So use the fundamental principles, make
little APP to adaptations. It's okay.

101
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,090
But if a leader is ineffective
and they're failing, guess what?

102
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:57,830
Their little adaptations like,
hey, I could make up a new move,

103
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,740
right for Jujitsu and I,

104
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,610
and I call it the the
Wizbang. Sure. And I say, Hey,

105
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,780
I made up the school move. It's called
the Wizbang and let me show it to you.

106
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,950
And so I show it to you and you're like,
well,

107
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,260
I don't know if that'll work or not.
And I like, no, it'll definitely work.

108
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,940
The cool thing about Jujitsu is when I try
it, we find out if it works. Right now,

109
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,040
something doesn't work immediately,
right.

110
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,130
But let's say I keep drilling it on you
and drilling it on you and I can never

111
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,560
get you in the Wiz.
Okay.

112
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,550
And then I go on a tournament and I
try the Whiz Bang and I get smashed and

113
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,340
defeated, and then I go through
the constellation bracket.

114
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,490
I tried the Wizbang and it
gets smashed and defeated.

115
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,440
Then I go on the next tournament.
I try the Wizbang here,

116
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,080
you get smashed and defeated.
Then I get in the constellation bracket.

117
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,410
I tried the Wizbang and get smashed and
defeated and I do this for six months

118
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,190
and the whizzbang never works
effective or ineffective currently.

119
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:51,230
In effect, it's ineffective,
it's ineffective.

120
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,220
If you're in a leadership position or
someone's in a leadership position and

121
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,150
they're failing and they're failing to
execute the mission over and over and

122
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,250
over again,
they're little tweak that,

123
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:04,280
a little leadership thing that
they think is good to go. It's not,

124
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,450
it's not good to go. And it
probably, in fact, I'll tell you,

125
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,110
it violates one of the fundamental
principles of combat leadership.

126
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,220
And if you can identify which one
of those things it's violating,

127
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,550
you can get them to
clean it up and fix it.

128
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,040
So there you go. Whizz Bang. Don't
try it. Don't try the Wizbang.

129
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,940
I don't know though. I mean
these digits, Jujitsu moves.

130
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,780
You know how like guys like bus
up moves, man, I don't know. It's,

131
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,400
it's this endless thing to
notice. New moves come out. Yeah,

132
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,820
and you won't hit a move 100% of the
time and you definitely won't hit it when

133
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,500
you first started doing it.
It's going to be hard.

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,130
How many arm locks do you think you put
on someone before you made someone tap?

135
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,750
In the beginning you probably did 50
arm locks before you got someone to tap.

136
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,120
Yeah, probably more. Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe even more.

137
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,530
So that doesn't mean what the after the
first 49 outs and effective emoc going

138
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:00,020
to do it.
The big differences,

139
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,200
the big differences on arm lock is a
proven known entity covering move is a

140
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:10,190
proven known entity.
Simple is a proven known entity.

141
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,000
Prioritize. Next. Cute. Is
it proven known entity? Yeah.

142
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,020
Extreme ownership is a proven, known
and decentralized command is a proven,

143
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:18,920
it's like an art markets.

144
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,710
I could choke and that's why
when some people say to me, Oh,

145
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:24,680
well my boss doesn't
like extreme ownership,

146
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,660
you know, I know what's happening.
Like it's, they're the bosses.

147
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,970
Ego is offended because
there's some other,

148
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,910
some somebody telling them a
different way to lead. No. It's like,

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,840
what do you believe in? I don't believe
in extreme ownership. Oh, I blame him.

150
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,440
I believe in placing the blame on
other people. That's how I lead.

151
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,430
That's complete. Completely ridiculous.
Everybody knows that's ridiculous.

152
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,170
It's completely ridiculous. Cover move.
I don't believe in cover move. Oh,

153
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:54,740
so you just like your other team members
to go and take care of themselves and

154
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:59,410
you take care of yourself. How does
that work? It doesn't work. Keep the,

155
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,370
oh I don't like to keep things simple.
No, I like to make things so complicated.

156
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,380
Complicated that people don't
understand what I'm talking about.

157
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,360
Does that make any sense whatsoever? No,
it doesn't. Yeah. Prioritize and execute.

158
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,430
No, don't do that. What I,

159
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,210
what I'm going to do is spread myself
so thin that I don't have the assets or

160
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:18,270
resources to actually accomplish anything.
That's what I'm going to do.

161
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:18,991
Because that makes sense.

162
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,450
Cause I don't believe in extreme ownership
or those are the fundamental laws of

163
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,830
combat leadership. That's where
you're at. Decentralized Command. Oh,

164
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,300
I don't believe in that.

165
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,110
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make
every single decision myself from the

166
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,130
headquarters position.

167
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,860
When you guys want to make a decision out
there on the battlefield are out there

168
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:37,110
on the,
on the manufacturing floor,

169
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,230
I want you to run every single
division decision up through me.

170
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,310
Cause that's going to be effective.

171
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,420
So if you violate one of these principles,

172
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,590
you're going to have problems as a leader.
If you tweak these principles,

173
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,920
that's fine. If you look at decentralized
command and you're like, you know what?

174
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,230
I know that the normal kind of
span of control is five people.

175
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,570
I can handle more than that. I can
handle nine and you step it up. That's,

176
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,050
that's tweak. That's okay.
Right? That's fine. If you pray,

177
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,560
when you prioritize and execute, Hey,
oh the way I prioritize and execute,

178
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,670
and this is the truth.
The way I prioritize and execute isn't,

179
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
I look at my number one problem
and I only focused on that one.

180
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,960
I assign somebody to my number
one problem and I say, hey bill,

181
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,490
go handle that room over there. It's a
problem. And then I look at Mike and say,

182
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,550
Hey Mike,
get the rest of this hallway cleared.

183
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,480
So I'm actually handling two things,
but I give build a priority.

184
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,320
So that's a tweak. I'm
using assets. That's fine.

185
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,240
So sometimes yes,
you got to make these little adjustments.

186
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,060
Everyone's got a different
leadership style,

187
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,510
but you don't violate the
principles of leadership.
