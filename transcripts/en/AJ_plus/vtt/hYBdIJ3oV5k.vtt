00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.020
Welcome to Texas!

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.720
Whenever I think of coming home to Texas,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.800
this is what I think of. Beef ribs.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.580
I love these. And I am so happy right now,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.900
I’m going to finish eating this plate off camera.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.260
I know so many other people see Texas as either this,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.960
this,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.320
or this:

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.300
“I am so happy to be back in the great state of Texas.”

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.020
GOP country.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.980
Yes, Texas is a state that’s spent the last few decades solidly in the red column.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.980
And in fact, out of any state in the nation, Texas voters have gone the longest

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.040
without putting a Democrat in statewide office.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.520
The state has also gone for every Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.120
But could 2018 be a new dawn for Texas Democrats?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.620
I think everything is on the line, everything that you could possibly care about.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.760
This state could be the state that brings this country together at this divided moment.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.480
And some have high hopes for Beto O’Rourke to turn Texas blue again.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.420
You heard me.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.280
Again.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.700
Hey, fam. I’m Imaeyen, and this Sunday we’ve traveled to one of my very favorite places, Texas.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.580
And we’re here to find out the real odds of this state going blue in 2018 or 2020.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.580
So stay with us and hit that subscribe button right now, because we’re going on a journey,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.620
and I promise to show you more food.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.940
Though I’m not sharing this. No way.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.360
The last time this state had either a Democratic governor or senator, TLC owned the billboard charts.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.880
“So I creep ... yeeeeah ...”

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.840
Just creepin’ on the down-low...

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.280
And now people are wondering if Beto O’Rourke can break that streak.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.280
Beto O’Rourke is a senatorial candidate who’s campaigning on

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.500
immigration reform, universal healthcare

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.640
and generally not being Ted Cruz.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.680
Cruz has low approval ratings and this is the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.040
first time he’s even had a serious Democratic challenger for his seat.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.160
And I gotta say, O'Rourke is unlike any other Texas politician I’ve seen in recent years.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.440
So could this be the guy who ends up changing the course of Texas politics?

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.700
I'd say he has a pretty good chance of pulling off an upset.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.560
The enthusiasm is real high.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.260
I haven't seen anything like this in a while.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.080
Meet political analyst Ed Espinoza.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.880
His bold prediction is that 2018 is *the year* O’Rourke and other Democrats

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.660
pull off upsets unlike anything seen in two decades.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.860
Espinoza is a data guy, and he broke down why he thinks it looks so optimistic.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.400
For one, first-time voters in Texas favored Democrats by a margin of 5-1 in the last election.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.460
And it wasn’t just in the blue cities, it also happened in the red parts of the state, too.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.000
And earlier this year in the midterm primaries,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.640
Texas Democrats *doubled* their turnout rate from 2014,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.880
and Republicans only increased their turnout rate by a tiny bit.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.000
The truth is it’s a real moment happening in Texas right now.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.440
And we’re seeing it, we've seen it in the primaries this year,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.140
we're seeing it in the activism with the campaigns that are out there.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.680
We're seeing it in the fundraising numbers.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.220
We're confident that it's gonna make a difference in 2018.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.660
For the first time in 30 years, every congressional district, even the most Republican,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.240
has a Democratic challenger

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.340
And a handful of them are actually expected to flip to blue ,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.400
even some that have been GOP strongholds since the ‘60s.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.480
Texas Dems are also targeting the Republican state attorney general,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.060
who’s currently under indictment.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.720
Espinoza says Democrats’ hopeful outlook is all because of the changing of Texas demographics.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.280
It’s the Latino populations around the state and that this is a population that will rise, awaken

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.080
and seize its political power, but what you’re also seeing are other groups from around the state.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.880
It's all these new people moving to Texas who are saying to themselves, wait a minute, I'm a Texan too.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.160
I can vote. I have a voice. I have something to say.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.840
And that's what's challenging this Republican power right now.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.600
Now for those of you chuckling at the thought of a blue Texas, guess what?

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.120
Texas *used* to be a blue state.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.440
Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.480
She just did it backwards and in high heels.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.200
Growing up, this woman was my introduction to Texas politics: Governor Ann Richards.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.440
She was sharp and witty –

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.340
and she was a Democrat.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.920
That’s right, the governor of Texas from 1991 to 1995 was a Democrat.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.660
And way before her, there was this guy.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.420
Their cause must be our cause too.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.366
Because it’s not just Negroes, but really it’s all of us who must overcome

00:04:54.366 --> 00:05:01.200
the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.280
Lyndon Johnson was JFK’s vice presidential pick because he was a Southern Democrat.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.760
Johnson would go on to become the president who signed the Civil Rights Act,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.680
the Voting Rights Act, and he gave us Medicaid and Medicare – landmark legislation and policies.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.140
So that’s the Texas I knew growing up, but that was years and several Republican governors ago.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.880
So how did Texas lose its blue streak?

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.660
After the civil rights movement, white Texas Democrats started to leave the party in droves,

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.080
and they found a home in the Republican Party.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.720
Then came the state’s economic boom in the late ’70s and early ’80s,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.840
and we begin to see people from out of state flock to Texas,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.500
bringing with them more conservative ideals and more stringent religious beliefs.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.700
And Texas becomes a haven for those seeking fewer taxes and less federal regulation.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.540
Fast-forward to 1994 when that growing conservatism made George W. Bush governor,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.420
and the state has never looked back.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.620
Texas is ready for a new generation of leadership, and I will provide it.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.440
Since then, state Republicans’ partisan redistricting, also known as gerrymandering,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.620
has helped keep the legislature overwhelmingly Republican.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.300
They have been able to hold onto a state that doesn't necessarily look like that government.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.940
But again, one wave election with a lot of gerrymandering layered in can do a lot of damage.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.660
And we're hoping to undo that in 2018.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.360
But many Republicans say that won’t be easy to undo.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.580
Texas will be red as long as I'm alive.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.260
Andy Hogue is a spokesperson for the Travis County Republican party,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.720
and he thinks that while some districts might flip in November,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.720
there’s no way Beto O’Rourke will win the Texas senate seat.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.000
He's still a Democrat and he still supports abortion.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.600
He still supports expanding programs and higher taxes to fulfill the Democratic agenda.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.160
I still don't think he's gonna crack 43 percent, personally.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.880
Hogue thinks O’Rourke is nothing more than another flash-in-the-pan Texas Democrat

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.240
that gets a lot of attention but then fizzles out,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.200
like the last Democratic candidate for governor who ended up losing by 20 points.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.360
Wendy Davis. Now she was a state senator here in Texas

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.800
who made national headlines, international headlines even,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.840
for supporting abortion rights, and that made her a celebrity,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.600
but it wasn't enough to carry her through.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.680
Ultimately I think it's gonna all boil down to the fact that people are going to vote their values.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.200
But Espinoza told me something that could change the way you’ve been looking at Texas politics.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.880
Well what we like to say is Texas is not a red state, it’s a non-voting state.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.680
He’s right. Texas ranks 46th in voter turnout.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.180
In 2016, only about half of Texans voted.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.760
"We’re volunteers with an organization called Jolt and

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.700
we’re trying to mobilize the Latino community

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.660
to get out and vote."

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.840
"So we wanted to know if we could count on your pledge to vote?"

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.840
So that’s where groups like Jolt come in.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.380
Jolt’s an organization that’s trying to get young Latinos to the polls,

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.840
a group they believe is crucial for the state to elect Democrats.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.440
Texas in a general, people always think, like, oh, white, cowboys right?

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.420
People riding horses, ranchers, farmers, things like that,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.860
but that’s not Texas.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:10.060
Texas is nearly 40% Latinx and by 2030 we will be the majority.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.120
In fact half of everyone under 18 right now is Latinx.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.500
That’s so many young people who are turning 18 every day.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:26.460
So if we really had, you know, people going out and voting in large numbers,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.740
Texas politics would look very different.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.560
I think it matters that we’re out here.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.640
Having a good conversation about it is gonna be important for us.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.100
As a community we need to come together and show we’re a powerful force,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.120
across, especially, Texas.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.880
So could efforts like this one

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.340
and excitement like this

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.540
be an early indication that Texas is on the move again?

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.040
And what would that mean for 2020?

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.020
"When you think of a progressive Texas, you think of a Texas that speaks for

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.060
the full diversity of the population that lives here.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.880
People who live in different cities, people who look different, people who are of a different age

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.160
and of a different race.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.720
Those are voices that should be represented in everything we do,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.080
but what we have right now too often is a government that tends to be adversarial

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.980
with many populations in the state.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.780
That's not representative of a population. That's not representative government at all."

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.180
If we were to really change Texas, we could change the country.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.140
We could change what the outcomes are in upcoming elections.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.980
Regardless of what happens in Texas, there’s one thing we know to be true.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.540
Their barbeque is delicious every election cycle.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.000
I told you I’d show you more food.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.780
Hey fam, thanks  much for watching.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.180
Don’t forget to like, share and subscribe

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.580
as you watch us have basically a dance-off in the middle of Austin, Texas.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.200
We had an amazing time on this shoot, and we’ll see you next Sunday.
