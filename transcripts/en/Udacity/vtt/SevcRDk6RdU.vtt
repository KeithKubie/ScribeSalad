00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.220
&gt;&gt; So, what, how do you start with this now, Charles?

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.540
&gt;&gt; Okay, so the first thing I'm going to do is,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.860
I'm going to look at the first two examples. And the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.130
reason I'm doing that is because I know they both

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.450
generate true. And so I'm going to look for variables that

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.150
are inconsistent. So if I look at X1, for example,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.840
it's a one in the first case, and a zero

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.990
in the second case. So it can't be the case

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.230
that it's required in order for this to be true.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.970
And the same would be true for x3. So I'm going to say that neither x1 nor x3

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.540
matter. By contrast, x2, x4, and x5 all

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.600
have the same values in both of those cases.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.118
&gt;&gt; So we don't know much about them quite yet.

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:38.194
&gt;&gt; No

00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:41.940
&gt;&gt; But let's so let's, that seems very well reasoned. So we

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.330
know that x1 can't be part of this formula and x3 can't

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.240
be a part of this formula. So, let's just sort of imagine

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.440
that they're not there cause they don't really give us any information

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.780
any more.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.640
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.780
&gt;&gt; Alright, So what's left?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.000
&gt;&gt; So what's left is now to make certain that x2, x4 and x5 are

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.870
necessary, and particularly necessary with the, the values

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.670
that they have. So I guess all I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.300
can really do is see if there's anything

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.090
else to eliminate. If I were just looking

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.846
at the first two, I would think that the answer was not X2, X4, not X5.

00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:15.946
&gt;&gt; Alright. so, hang on, not X2, X4, not X5.

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:19.750
&gt;&gt; Right. So, that's what I currently think it is based upon what I just saw.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.200
&gt;&gt; And that would be, that's consistent with the first two examples.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.980
&gt;&gt; Right. And so, now I want to make certain is consistent with the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.020
next three examples. This is the easiest way for me to think about

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.020
this, anyway. So, let's see. Not X2, X4, so that should be false, which it is.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.760
They're all false, so let's see not X2. But x4,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.910
up, that should be false, which it is. And then I do that

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.830
same thing. But wait, why isn't that the answer? That can't be the answer.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.730
&gt;&gt; Is the answer you got it.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.650
&gt;&gt; Huh I got it right.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.640
&gt;&gt; So the thing to notice is that in these first two examples

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.380
we have X2 is false X4 is true and X5 is false and that's

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.500
enough to make the conjunction true but making. Flipping any one of those

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830
bits is enough to make it false so what I showed in the in

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.310
the remaining examples is that just by turning this

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.790
X2 into an X1 leaving everything else the same

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.280
we lose it. Similarly if we flip the X4

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.260
to zero and leave everything else the same, we

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.350
lose it. Similarly if we flip x5 to one,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.640
and leave everything else the same, we lose it.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.160
So that means that each of these is necessary

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.010
to make the conjunction. They're all actually in there.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.050
&gt;&gt; That's just what I was thinking. So, in

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.000
other words, you gave me some positive examples to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.030
eliminate things that were necessary, and then you gave

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.210
me negative examples to validate that each of the variables

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.250
that I saw so far were necessary because getting rid

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.430
of any one of them, gave me the wrong answer.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.530
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Let's, let's even write down those

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.140
two steps. So the first thing was show

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.180
what's irrelevant. And how many questions How many

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.000
queries might we have needed to show that?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.800
&gt;&gt; Well, one per variable.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.210
&gt;&gt; Well actually we only need two because

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.570
what I did is I, I used, all the relevant ones I

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.970
kept the same and all the irrelevant ones I flipped from one

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.600
to the other. I just have to show you that it's still,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.960
the output is still one even though they have two different values.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.690
&gt;&gt; Oh, no, no. When I said all of them, you know, k of

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.335
them was because I didn't know that, what if all of them were irrelevant

00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:15.620
&gt;&gt; Then it would still be two. because then I

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.860
could just show you the all zeroes, and the all ones.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.220
&gt;&gt; You're right. You're right. You just

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.040
need, oh that's right. That's exactly right.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.830
&gt;&gt; Alright. And

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.560
then I have to show you that the, that

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.290
each, the remaining variables is relevant by flipping it

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.170
and showing you that the answer is zero. And

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.580
how many questions did I need to do for that?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.900
&gt;&gt; Three.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, three in this case cause there were three variables

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.490
that were used in the formula. What's the most it could be?

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.010
&gt;&gt; Well k, cause all of them could be relevant.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's you know, it's kind of interesting that, that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.800
in fact the total number of hypothesis here is three to

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.110
the K. Because you know, you can see it right

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.190
off this table that for each of the variables, it's either

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.540
positive, absent or negated. But the number of questions that a

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.220
smart teacher had to ask was more like, K plus two.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.380
&gt;&gt; Huh.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.460
&gt;&gt; Which is pretty powerful.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.500
&gt;&gt; Right, so. The smart teacher can help me

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.370
do this in linear term. So what if I

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.470
were, I, I didn't have the teacher who could

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.550
give me these examples and I always had to ask?

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.720
&gt;&gt; That's a good question, let's let's do that.
