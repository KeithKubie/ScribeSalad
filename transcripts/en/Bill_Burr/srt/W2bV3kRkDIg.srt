00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,960
How's it going? Oh,

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,880
did that happen this week? Good for you.
You know, it could feel good for you.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,880
Um, you know, I, I'm going to be, oh, I'm

00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:30,070
this Thursday. I know it's supposed
to be about you on Thursdays.

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,880
Mondays it's about me, but on Thursdays
it's supposed to be about you.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,830
You know what I mean? You sit there,

10
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:40,831
you sit in there with that
Styrofoam Cup drinking a cup of Cho

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,540
America that don't work without you.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,040
Now he's singing those condescending
songs to the working man. Hey,

13
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:55,480
gay puts his fucking pants on
one leg at a time. Joe. Six pack.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,703
Yeah.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,733
Okay.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,860
Goes the track every once in a while
has an occasional [inaudible] again,

17
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,460
you know, laughs that are racist,

18
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,590
choke every 7.2 days. You
know, never questions it.

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,920
Um, yeah, I'm going down the rabbit
hole this week cause I, you know, I,

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,370
I would like a little bit credit after
the Superbowl for being a fucking

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,430
gentleman as a Patriot fan. Okay.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,940
And you Bronco fans better know what
I'm talking about. I was a gentleman,

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,440
you know, it's so funny. A
lot of you are in chickens.

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,510
Get your fucking head so far up your
fucking bronco is that you don't even know

25
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,440
what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,480
You think I'm talking about because
you guys kicked my team's ass, right?

27
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,460
Not really kicked her ass.
Fucking won in the last second.

28
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:48,100
Took the whole fucking game
to win. Right. You take that.

29
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:51,550
I'm fucking saying that I was nice that
I actually rooted for Peyton manning and

30
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:54,640
the Broncos. Now that's
not what I'm talking about.

31
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:58,540
You know what I'm
talking about? After tar,

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,010
Brady went to that fucking to deflate
gate thing went to the entire baseball

33
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,180
season. Air Pressure. Okay.

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,340
You know, you would think of, that's
what happens with air pressure.

35
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:15,900
What if a certain, someone had a certain
something shipped to his certain house?

36
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,190
To a certain wife.

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,180
Okay.

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,200
And that certain someone is in the
fucking super bowl, Jesus Christ,

39
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,620
if they can make a fucking
air pressure in eight months,

40
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:29,260
fucking Goddamn story on ESPN,

41
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,350
how long is this thing gonna last answer?

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,980
Zero seconds wasn't even a fucking story.

43
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,160
Okay. And you know what? And
I loved that it happened.

44
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,300
I love that they didn't make a big
fucking deal out of it. You know,

45
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,410
cause I don't think they should.

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,810
I think we're all going to be on
roids in the future. In the future.

47
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:53,350
We're all gonna be Jack.
Right. And the future,

48
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:56,170
they're going to have like a fucking 80
enrolled or like heavyweight division,

49
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,480
you know? Um, sorry,
meet the Hershey's cuss.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,220
I just had some salty, I
apologize. Very rude. You know,

51
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
I'm just saying

52
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,610
what I loved about how that happened is
I'm never going to lose another fucking

53
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:17,611
argument that there is a fucking witch
hunt or that was a fucking witch hunt.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,270
Okay. If you're going
to fucking, you know,

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,380
go fucking ballistic about
that Horse Shit, you know,

56
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,930
then all somebody has to come out
and says, you should, you know,

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,370
just makes me sheer cool. Oh
girl, you where'd she come from?

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,260
And then that's it. It's over. It's
over. Done. I don't know about you guys,

59
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:39,730
but I don't have any more
questions. They down place that

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,920
close the book. Take it off
the board. Now the case solved.

61
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,970
I'm fucking unbelief. I was a
gentlemen. Oh, I was general. Give Up.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,670
Not even naming names. You
know what I'm talking about?

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,610
Everyone knows the fuck I'm talking
about. I'm just being a fucking gentleman.

64
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,030
I'm just a gentleman right now sitting
in here and some fucking basketball

65
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:02,190
shorts, eating Hershey kisses. Just
talking. Just talking to myself. Oh,

66
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,183
I'm having [inaudible].

67
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,080
Who's the fucking annoying
content makes Hershey's kisses.

68
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,100
I don't fucking get it.

69
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,290
Okay,

70
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,410
thank God we've made sure that kisses
also doesn't make popcorn or you have to

71
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:19,920
fucking unwrap each
goddamn colonel. Pop Dry.

72
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,750
Am I doing 80 standup right now? Why

73
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,140
or would you go do so small? You know,

74
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:31,470
I bet they make bigger ones now for
fat fucks. I got to look that up.

75
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,450
What should I Google here? The
Hershey kiss for a fat fuck.

76
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,550
I gotta do it now just to
see if something comes up.

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
Do my dog looks so fucking cute right
now. She's completely just like,

78
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,780
she has her bed and um,

79
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,450
nobody fucking lies down
on a bed like a dog.

80
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:55,260
Just cause they're pack animals and
they don't need their space. They, they,

81
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,920
they like being in each other's spaces,
laying down on top of each other.

82
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:00,810
She fucking, she's laying there right now.

83
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,090
She'll say a fucking lion
just laying in a cage.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,030
Except she's got a bed and there's no
cage. Surely doesn't look like a lion.

85
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,350
She's like a dog. She's chilling. That's
what I'm trying to say. All right.

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,050
Alright. I say Hershey. Kiss her.

87
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:17,130
She is the one chocolate I
have. All right. Hershey kiss

88
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,620
for fat. Fuck.

89
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,320
You know there's going to be a hit
here. Hershey kisses. This annoys me.

90
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:31,620
Irish people taste test. Hershey kisses.

91
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,560
Oh, let me guess. They're going to shit
on America's chocolate when the fuck go.

92
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,750
Europe is just enough
already. You know what I mean?

93
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:42,080
Isn't it enough that we accepted the
fact that you stole Blues Music after we

94
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:46,460
stole it and then brought it back to
us? We were nice about it. Then we, um,

95
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,900
all right, I bet I would supersized
supersize Hershey's kits and then,

96
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,070
and there's no way they're going to say
for fat. Fuck, come on. Let's, let's,

97
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,780
let's be intelligence about this. All
right. Hershey kiss for a supersize,

98
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,260
but then they're not going to be able to
say that because McDonald's uses that,

99
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,930
right? Supersize which all just
means for fat fucks, right?

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,320
Hm.

101
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,270
Kisses giants, milk chocolate,
seven ounce package images for her.

102
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:16,380
She kisses [inaudible] super
cy. There they are. Oh yeah.

103
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,660
You know somebody fucking complaint,

104
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,230
you know some fucking [inaudible].

105
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,760
You know as people that
breathe like biggie smalls,

106
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,610
that kind of out of shape, they have
sleep apnea even when they're awake.

107
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:32,830
You know, they called up the Hershey

108
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,790
[inaudible] department,
please, I want you,

109
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,220
if you work so much, okay, you
gotta burn so many calories,

110
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,390
you know, it's just so
fucking gross to him. Like,

111
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,630
it was just gross to you that they just
said five, five and make them bigger,

112
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,700
you know, just imagine how much
more aluminum foil that was

113
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,120
some poor kid fucking, you
know, thrown out his back,

114
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,130
picking up those giant
chocolate fucking kisses.

115
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,630
Okay.

116
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,890
They're really not that
much bigger. Oh fuck.

117
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:11,080
You may have those peanut butter
ones. What am I talking about here?

118
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:14,270
Jesus Christ. Let's, let's
continue on here. So anyways, um,

119
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,290
I am going to have a good
time with that. When I go to,

120
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:21,590
I'm actually going to Cheyenne,
Wyoming and Denver, Colorado,

121
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,600
and uh, all the fun.

122
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:28,601
I'm going to have a Denver wishing them
a happy celebration for the Superbowl

123
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,610
wind and uh, you know, you
know, and I'll have a couple of,

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,100
you know, choice words to say,

125
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,493
okay,

126
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,490
and you know what? The best
part is as much as if I do,

127
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:45,301
I don't think I'm going to do it,

128
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:49,770
but if I do it as much as they bow and
as loud as they do in the back of their

129
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:51,450
heads, they know I'm fucking right.

130
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,040
I challenge anyone that you guys send me
a fucking email right now and you tell

131
00:07:56,041 --> 00:08:00,390
me that there isn't some
unbalanced fucking going
after the Patriots thing after

132
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:01,770
that fucking horse shit.

133
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,490
If the flight date is an eight months
story and that fucking thing is eight

134
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:10,490
seconds. Oh, what a gentleman
I didn't say shit to.

135
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,490
I alluded to it, but I, you
know, still not naming names.

136
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,690
We had protection issues.
That's not a story.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,100
Nothing to say. Um, anyway,

138
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:26,460
so I'm going to Wyoming and uh,

139
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:29,310
I drove through it a long time ago and
saw these things that look like deer,

140
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,360
but I knew they weren't, you
know, so I was just like, wow,

141
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,380
where the fuck am I even I
knew I was in Wyoming, right?

142
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,150
This podcast is all over
the place. Um, let me, uh,

143
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,770
so I looked up Wyoming on Wikipedia.
Who's kidding? Who? I went to Wikipedia.

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,830
I didn't even go to Wikipedia. I just
wrote Wyoming. And Wikipedia always,

145
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,210
always comes up, right? It's
just a great website. You know,

146
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,820
you just read a bunch of things about
the thing that you looked up and

147
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:58,560
afterwards you feel like you something
and then you throw it out at a party and

148
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
you go, yeah it does.

149
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,520
And then eventually you run into somebody
that's an expert on it and then you

150
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,310
realize halfway through it and then
you're like, Yo, I had fuck Yale.

151
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,120
And you just walk away during the, uh,

152
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:12,740
the Wikipedia shuffle as you walk
away. 20 ways I found out that Wyoming

153
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,100
is, um, I bet somebody
there named their kid oming,

154
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,120
you know their first name Omi,
so they can be like Wyoming.

155
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:28,750
How are you doing? Sorry. Jesus.
Brutal podcast. All right.

156
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,930
This article includes a sortable
listing of the United States 50,

157
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,720
50 United States by population density
cause I immediately found out that

158
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:39,910
Wyoming, Wyoming is the, um,

159
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,170
second least, uh, densely
populated state. All right,

160
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,710
so here we go. Let me get
to the list here. Density,

161
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:55,580
state ranks. Here we go.
All right, the top one.

162
00:09:55,581 --> 00:10:00,560
What do you think it is now? This
is density. This is not population.

163
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,760
This is like elbow room. Okay.

164
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,250
Density. Uh,

165
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,370
the most densely populated state is
you'd never guess this and they shoot New

166
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,470
Jersey. I never would have guessed that
most densely populated was New Jersey.

167
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,360
That's cause of all it cons that can't
afford to live in Manhattan right along

168
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:26,170
the coast. I think. Then there's
Rhode Island. It's a number two.

169
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,910
Massachusetts is number three.

170
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:31,690
It's all the small ones on the east
coast where the white man first landed,

171
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,640
right first started banging away.
First said to the native Americans,

172
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:41,330
what do you call that stuff,
man? Can you teach us? Right?

173
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,610
Four, they took it from them. Um,
Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware,

174
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:51,450
New York, Florida, right.

175
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,140
Wherever he lose it with a
dream from the east coast.

176
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,850
Fucking vacations deal with
going down to Fort Myers.

177
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,500
My cousins has a boat.
Uh, Pennsylvania in Ohio,

178
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:07,350
that's the top 10 most densely
populated. I was surprised.

179
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:10,380
California was 11 was not
in the top 10. Granted,

180
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,190
I live in Los Angeles. All right. Least
populated state. What do you guess?

181
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,450
What do you got? What do you got?
Alaska. All right, here we go.

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Is the top the least populated from
number 10 all the way down to number one,

183
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:28,810
number one being the least densely
populated. All right. Kansas,

184
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:32,530
Nevada and Nebraska. Idaho, New Mexico,

185
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,840
South Dakota, North Dakota,
Montana. Wow. I mean in Alaska.

186
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,780
So there you go. In generally speaking,

187
00:11:40,781 --> 00:11:45,550
I guess we are a not a very densely
populated country and a, you know,

188
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,390
you'd think I would notice that
the amount of traveling I've done,

189
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:51,760
the only time I really noticed it was
when I went to Asia and I was like,

190
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:55,600
Jesus Christ, there's a of fucking
people over here. You know?

191
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,540
That's all you do when you go to Asia.
Go holy fucking shit. Look at all these.

192
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,500
Look, they fucking just look at all these
apartment buildings. Look at them all.

193
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,550
They're all filled. There's
laundry hanging out every window.

194
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,770
Um, isn't it amazing that there's a
billion people in China and they all have

195
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,020
shirts? Have you ever fucking
thought about stuff like that?

196
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:19,021
Like who the fuck made all those shirts
you take with all those fucking pee,

197
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:21,920
all those shirts that needed to be made.
What do you think that you would know?

198
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:25,610
Somebody that makes shirts. I don't know
anybody in the clothing industry yet.

199
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,370
Everybody, everybody in the
fucking, that's unbelievable.

200
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,220
As much as many rollerblades as they
sold, right? Everybody didn't have them,

201
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,270
but everybody's got a shirt, right?
Everybody's got to cover up the junk.

202
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,910
Even the strippers,

203
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,530
even strippers have to walk out with some
clothes right before they take it off.

204
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,130
All right. This article is
about the u s state. Wyoming.

205
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,310
Wyoming is a state in their mountain
region of West, so we know all this shit,

206
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:55,400
the United States, but
booboo, popo populates a,

207
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,740
where the fuck is it? Come on.

208
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,610
The Western two thirds of the state is
covered mostly with the mountain ranges

209
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,410
and the range lands in the foothills of
the eastern rocky mountains is has God's

210
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,990
country here. While the eastern
third of the state is high plank,

211
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,050
high elevation prairie,
known as the high plains.

212
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Cheyenne is the capital in
the most populous city in
Wyoming with the population

213
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,420
estimate of this is
the most populated city

214
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,573
in Wyoming,

215
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,730
a population of 62,448 people as of 2013

216
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,840
62,448 people.

217
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:39,250
Do you realize what a let them
that that is, that's a dream.

218
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,560
Okay.

219
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,350
It's a dream. You know what the sad
thing is? Most people like myself,

220
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,800
I would go there and I would go crazy
because there was nothing to do.

221
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,380
Look at these fucking pictures. It's
all the second Clint Eastwood movie.

222
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,170
You don't know. Oh my God. Look at the
sunset. Yeah. I'd go out of my mind here.

223
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,750
Jesus Christ.

224
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,093
Okay.

225
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,601
It's fucking unreal.

226
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:07,090
I mean at the have you run to a native
American that it doesn't even know that

227
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:09,130
they lost, right?

228
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,353
Yeah.

229
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Like back in the day when those Japanese
soldiers stayed on the fucking islands,

230
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,800
it kept fighting. World War Two is
old faithful there. Yellowstone.

231
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,360
Yellowstone is in fucking Wyoming.
I never knew that. Oh Man.

232
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:24,200
I wish I had the time.

233
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,770
I would drive all the way up there
on the John d Rockefeller Jr memorial

234
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:32,240
parkway. I would go all the way up there.

235
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,350
[inaudible]

236
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,130
why I'm asking me a fucking amazing
state. This is all like fucking like,

237
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,950
like the people that live there.

238
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,070
You got the regular people that
are from their generations,

239
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:48,330
generations of people that you know
first went across the country and had the

240
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:53,331
balls to pull up stakes from east coast
and go west and a didn't have the balls

241
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:58,460
to continue. Like all those real
men that settled in San Francisco,

242
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,260
in Los Angeles, particularly Hollywood.

243
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,930
They stayed there. Right.

244
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,560
And then what you have now is you have
rich Fox and a rich Fox meaning just like

245
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:16,190
business people and then uh,
celebrities, celebrities,

246
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:19,820
a big on going out there and buying
someplace where they can just get away and

247
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:22,690
clear their head, you know,
become a singer songwriter,

248
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,010
wherever the fuck it is they want to
do. I'd like to do that Shit, man.

249
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,360
I'd like to fucking rent a log cabin
out there. But like one of those,

250
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,340
it looks like a log
cabin from the outside,

251
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:37,390
but on the inside it looks like a
house. Right. Like an updated one,

252
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:39,000
not a real one with a
dirt floor, you know,

253
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,890
so grizzly bear sticking his face
through the fucking kitchen window.

254
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,190
Like there is a kitchen that's
just a fireplace. Right.

255
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,620
Fuck all that. You know what I mean?

256
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,260
I, I, you know something, this is what,

257
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,440
you know what I always enjoyed most
about fucking skiing cause this time of

258
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,470
year, I'm sure there's great skiing.
Uh, even with global warming, right?

259
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,290
Which we're not causing evidently
from the documentaries that I watched,

260
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,140
I didn't watch him. I just saw the
links and I was just like, you know,

261
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:07,540
I'm too fucking busy. I'm too
busy. I'm staying with the,

262
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,770
I'm staying with my life, you know? Um,

263
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,200
well the thing that I like most about
skiing is after skiing and going down to

264
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:20,080
the lodge and sitting by the fire
and getting shit faced, you know,

265
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,620
the whole skiing itself and worrying
that I'm going to blow out my knee.

266
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,340
I fucking hate skiing, man.
I respect the hell out of it.

267
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:30,310
I think it's an amazing workout.
But like a, I should take a lesson.

268
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,680
I never took a lesson. I was
like, I can skate. Right.

269
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:35,350
And I just started going down
the blue square ones, right?

270
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,130
Then of course you know your ego, then
it's black diamond, double black diamond.

271
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,030
I don't wear a helmet.

272
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:43,090
It's really fucking dumb and I don't
know how to fall and whatever I do,

273
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:46,360
one knee goes one way, one goes
the other way and it's just like,

274
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:47,380
you know what I should just do,

275
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,530
I should just buy all the ski ship Shit
minus the fucking poles in the skis and

276
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,700
then just go do cardio like a
fucking maniac for two hours. Okay.

277
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,540
Then I put all the ski shit on a roll
around on the snow and then I come walking

278
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:05,320
into the lodge and just say I went
down some quadruple black diamond.

279
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:08,080
I would like an IPA night.
And then I sit there,

280
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:10,720
a couple of snow bunnies
come walking up, right

281
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,660
little have she have fun and I'm in
there. Um, but that's not going to happen.

282
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,520
I'm just going to go to Cheyenne
and tell some shit jokes.

283
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:19,360
That's what's going to happen.

284
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,570
You know what sucks is I'm
barely into that beautiful state,

285
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,670
mark my words. At some point I'm
going to a, I've got to do a tour,

286
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,993
uh,

287
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,150
you know, of all I, you know, go from
fucking Wyoming over to Nebraska,

288
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:40,740
up through the Dakotas, through
Montana, down through fucking Idaho,

289
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:42,990
back over to Yellowstone. And
then I'll fucking hit home.

290
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,130
I had to do one of those fucking
runs. That'd be a fun one.

291
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,410
Cost a fucking fortunate gas. It'd
be fucking city. There's like nine,

292
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,450
eight hours, nine hour
dries between each of them.

293
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,730
I run into some comics that have
done those runs out there. Dude,

294
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,900
that is not for the fucking faith of
heart. I can tell you that right now. But,

295
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,060
um, I'm definitely going
to do that. You know,

296
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,270
I'm psyched cause I haven't, I haven't
been in Nebraska in a long fucking time.

297
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,770
I used to all of those things.

298
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,280
I was just watching better
call Saul and when they,

299
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,070
when name and some of the cities,
you know, I was going like,

300
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:20,250
I fucking know those Hays Grand
Junction. I bend to all of those.

301
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,710
That's on route 80. Route 80
goes through Nebraska. I'm sorry,

302
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:29,190
what the fuck am I talking about? Let's,
let's back up here for a second. Oh,

303
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,170
freckles flew yesterday in the helicopter.

304
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:34,420
I flew with my instructor by

305
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,920
and we flew all the way up to
Santa Barbara and came back and um,

306
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,400
was fucking incredible. And I went
along the coastline the whole way.

307
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,390
I was trying to get a,
a a three point. Um,

308
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,380
I needed 3.4 on the Hobbs
me to have 100 hours right.

309
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,580
And uh,

310
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,020
ended up getting a 2.9 cause we had a
tailwind and I also took the coasts back

311
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,200
rather than going along the
one-on-one and down the four oh five,

312
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,760
but just was too beautiful. Did
Not do it. And on the way back, um,

313
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,470
you go over this, uh, navy airstrip,

314
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,150
which is restricted
area, but if, you know,

315
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,070
if they don't have any planes
coming in, they let you fly over it.

316
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,510
So we were flying along the coast of
it and they let us go in and they said,

317
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:21,811
you know,

318
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:24,270
and then they came back on the radio and
they said they had a couple of planes

319
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:26,760
coming in to basically
keep your eye out for it.

320
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,050
And of course my instructor finds
him first and I look, I go, dude,

321
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:32,970
I only see one. Where's the
other one? Where's the other one?

322
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,530
Where's the other one? I'm
like, freaking out. He goes, no,

323
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:38,370
they're like fucking those FAA teens,
they fly like really close together.

324
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:41,670
And sure enough when they turned the
corner there was like two of them.

325
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,120
And they do this fucking sick ass approach
that they do is they come in right

326
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,940
turn base and turned final.
And as they come in, right,

327
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,200
one of them peels away. Neither one
of them lands on the first pass.

328
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,310
They fly right over the runway.
One of them does a tight circle.

329
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:03,330
And the other does a bigger circle and
then they just fucking one lands and the

330
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:07,050
other one comes in right in and after
them it's fucking and say what was funny

331
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:12,051
was the tower was going on once the
other hotel that keep a traffic in sight.

332
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,200
And I'm like, yeah, keeping
traffic at site once Sierra hotel.

333
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,530
And then I'm like going like,

334
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,590
like I could do anything if that
fucking thing was coming at me.

335
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:24,450
Like this thing was like in like a
f, like not even like a Lamborghini.

336
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,500
He's like in a Ferrari, not a fry me
enough to fucking Batmobile. Right.

337
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,300
Whatever.

338
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,420
It's more like one of those land speed
fucking things they have out there in the

339
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,030
, uh, the, the Salt Lake,
whatever the fuck the salt flats,

340
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,620
the fucking salty dirt out there
in Utah. And I'm in this fucking,

341
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:43,770
I was basically in a Chevy Chevette.
Like if it came at me, like,

342
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:48,020
what was I going to do other than be
like, and then that would have been

343
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,510
what a way to go. Um, but
when we were coming back down,

344
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,560
um, we got to a point on the,
a lot of geography in this one.

345
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,730
We got along at this point on the
California coast, which is called, uh,

346
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,410
I think, I think dunes point. I'd
never flown up there before. And um,

347
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,640
there's a sick ass fucking house
there, right as you go up there.

348
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:16,800
It's got like a fucking a pool that's
shaped like a fucking cutlass. Oh,

349
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,640
like a sword. And we will
looking at that as it,

350
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:21,630
as we came down a little bit further, um,

351
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,660
we saw something splashing in the water
and we looked down and it was a whale

352
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,210
coming up by breaching, I
believe is what you call it.

353
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,770
And we did a little loop around, I got
some video, I'll put that up there. Um,

354
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,960
it was fucking amazing. And then there's
just this point, I think maybe it's,

355
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,940
maybe that was further up.

356
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,230
I think it was further up north
when we came around dunes point.

357
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,240
Like all of a sudden you could start
to see lax and then Santa Monica,

358
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,081
Culver City,

359
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,870
and then downtown La is one of the most
beautiful flights that I've been on.

360
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,110
But the big thing was, um,

361
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,640
I flew by lax and I made all the
radio calls, which is, you know,

362
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,470
Bravo airspaces I've mentioned before,
and that's like the shit where I'm,

363
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,540
you need explicit permission to go into
that airspace where they have to read

364
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,530
your whole fucking tail
number. And, uh, I dunno,

365
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,380
it's like you feel like you're fucking
talking to God when you talk to those

366
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:18,760
guys. So I had rehearsed the radio call
like fucking 30 times on the drive down.

367
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,600
And, uh, I was able to say it
with enough confidence, um,

368
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,020
that he didn't sound too much
like an asshole. And, um,

369
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,840
and he let us go through and
it was kind of anticlimactic.

370
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:31,510
I had really built it up in my fucking
head. But anyway, so I went back,

371
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:36,130
I got a 2.9, so old freckled says 99.5,

372
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,420
um, 99.5 hours. So, uh,

373
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,510
I was supposed to fly today but I was
tired and I don't fuck around doing that

374
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:48,370
shit. I'm just like, yeah, I'm feeling
tired. I'm not feeling it. Fuck it. Um,

375
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,250
so anyways, another thing
that I was looking up is, uh,

376
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,220
is beautiful as these
states are, you know,

377
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:56,770
that I've been going to all of
these states that people, you know,

378
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,550
consider fly overstates and fucking
what the fuck goes on there. You know,

379
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,880
just shitting all over him even though
they're absolutely gorgeous and there's

380
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:08,320
great people out there is um, you know,

381
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:11,370
just to the drug use and that type
of shit is really fucking bad.

382
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,680
The heroin man, everywhere I go
is this fucking heroin problem.

383
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,210
And they keep linking it
back to these, uh, you know,

384
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,850
people having an injury,
I saw this on real sports.

385
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:24,580
People have an injury and then they
get like whatever they get the fucking,

386
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,870
was it percosets Viking and I don't know
what the fuck it is. Oxy and that shit.

387
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:32,710
And then when that runs out, they still
want that high and heroin is cheaper.

388
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:37,320
And it's just like, you know, once again,
once again you would think, you know,

389
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,930
with all this shit of talking
about terrorism, you know,

390
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:43,240
and people doing shit to
this country for some reason,

391
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:47,030
you can fuck with the food supply and
you can get your own countrymen addicted

392
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:51,110
to heroin. And as long as you've got
enough fucking money, nobody gives a shit.

393
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,020
It's completely flag. Isn't
that like an act of terrorism?

394
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,800
Am I out of my fucking mind? How
can you do that to fellow Americans?

395
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:00,230
You'll ruin people's
lives. It's fucking brutal.

396
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,250
But it's one of the reasons why I stay
out of the politics shit. You know,

397
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:07,320
every once in awhile I look at
this stuff and it just, I dunno,

398
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,840
it's like overwhelmingly
depressing, you know, like,

399
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,630
um, I saw us up to the other day on, uh,

400
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,380
for some reason I was looking up Chelsea
Clinton cause I saw her on TV with

401
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:19,940
Hillary and Hillary was giving a speech.

402
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,600
Yeah. [inaudible]

403
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,930
right. And I was literally going like,

404
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,070
there's no fucking way I can listen
to that voice for four fucking years.

405
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:36,390
I just can't, I am not against a
woman being president whatsoever,

406
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,910
but you cannot sound like somebody's
learning how to play a trumpet, Dee.

407
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,760
I just, I don't give us, you could have
all the answers to the fucking universe.

408
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,100
There is no fee. Can't
hear what she's saying.

409
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,970
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,470
You know, my dog's looking at
me right now. Like, really? Um,

411
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,730
so anyways, so I looked up and I was
just going like, how old is she now?

412
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:07,290
And when I started out in comedy,
she was just a kid. And, um,

413
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,521
you know,

414
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:11,130
she was at that awkward age and it
was kind of this nice unwritten rule,

415
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:13,240
you know, you did make fun of her
wishing that fucking awkward age. Right.

416
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,230
I was like, was she like 12 or
something like that? And, uh,

417
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:18,780
I went to go look it up. You
know how old she was final,

418
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:20,790
she was in her thirties,
which fucking blew my mind,

419
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,450
even though obviously it was
20 years ago. Right. But, um,

420
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,470
what killed me is what I saw was
they had a stat on our wedding.

421
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,680
Do you know our parents fucking
through are a $3 million wedding.

422
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,260
Okay.

423
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,710
Like these politicians is so fucking
dishonest. They don't even try to hide it.

424
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,860
It's like, how the fuck could you afford
a $3 million wedding? The most money,

425
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:47,700
either one of you ever made in public
service was, was being president,

426
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:52,410
which was 400 grand of fucking year.
Dude, you make 400 fucking grand a year.

427
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,480
They're going to whack you in half.
You're going to maybe walk with 200,

428
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,890
right? Nowadays probably less
than that. Probably one 95.

429
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,390
What the fuck are you getting
off playing for a fucking

430
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,513
[inaudible]?

431
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,880
You got a fucking $3 million wedding
house on fucking math is vineyard.

432
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:18,810
Give me a fucking break. These
cars go around, right? All right,

433
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,840
got another Hershey's kiss my mom. So
you know I'm playing them true. Um,

434
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,630
these guys go around.

435
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,630
They just give speeches and his wife
two 53 in a grand a fucking whack.

436
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,390
Just giving speeches. Can you imagine
paying a trainer? Granted, listen,

437
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,493
sunny for an hour ago,

438
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,120
right, right.

439
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,050
For a fucking hour.

440
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,710
Now you got sickly Clinton with
that awful face lifted he got,

441
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:51,150
which just made his head
look fucking huge. You know,

442
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,480
he's lost all that weight and
he got it. You got a chin,

443
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,140
whatever the fuck he did to his
chin, he yanked that fucker back.

444
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:02,760
He looked like a bobble head version
of himself and I'll tell you,

445
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:06,630
his shit's Yag back so tidy. Can't even
clap anymore. You know what I mean?

446
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,120
Either that or that's his true
failings about his wife. Right.

447
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,080
What you can't blame,

448
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,080
you really can't blame Bill Clinton for
going out and taking a cigar and putting

449
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:20,370
it in that woman. You know what I mean?

450
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,600
If like that's what he's laying
next to his bed. I mean I, you know,

451
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,860
Jesus Christ, if I was married to
Hillary Clinton, she would have to have,

452
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,760
you know, those, those surgical masks
that Asian people wear when they get sick,

453
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:35,640
cause they don't want to get anybody
else sick cause they're fucking courteous

454
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,090
or because it's like nine zillion
people that live next door.

455
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,420
They get turned into an epidemic. I
don't fucking know why they do it. Right.

456
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,580
I would make her wear one of those all
the time because maybe then she'd sound

457
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,650
like a muted trumpet. Right.

458
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,270
And every once in a while she'd hit a
couple of notes that remind me of a miles

459
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:57,810
Davis song and then maybe I could just
stop myself from strangling her in the

460
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:58,920
fucking Oval Office.

461
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,043
Yeah.

462
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,460
She reminds me like an animal that
like is getting eaten alive. You know,

463
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,220
you ever hear that? Like, just like
time I saw that fucking monkey,

464
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,540
that other monkey alive just digging
meat out of its back. And he's like,

465
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,270
you know, it's sort of like, not
as sharp but not as quick as that.

466
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,243
Um,

467
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,700
anyways, and they fucking that,

468
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:29,260
that Bernie Sanders guys with his
fucking [inaudible]. You look at Bro,

469
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,030
you know, you wonder why Bill Clinton
got a fucking face lift and then you,

470
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,360
yeah, you're fucking, you got his neck
done. Then you look at Bernie Sanders,

471
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:41,140
you're like, oh, that's why Jesus
Christ, he looks like a fucking,

472
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,020
he looks like a bloodhound
eating a fucking Turkey dinner,

473
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,090
jowls flopping all around. We go,
you're in a federal job. All right.

474
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,530
All of these guys that Jerry
Jersey guy looks all fat,

475
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,120
then everybody else just looks
like an extra to me. Granted,

476
00:28:58,121 --> 00:29:01,420
I have not listened to one fucking word.

477
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:06,700
Any of them have said, but it's a, it's
going to be interesting. Oh really?

478
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,050
Bill, you think it's
going to be interesting,

479
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:10,360
a presidential election that
might Pique your interest?

480
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:11,830
You have freckled arrogant country.

481
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,400
Um, anyways, so,

482
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,650
so what else? I'm doing a,
I'm doing a show tonight.

483
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,310
I got some new fucking material. I'm
really excited about it. And, uh,

484
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,540
I want to thank everybody
who bought tickets out and
Cheyenne at Denver, Denver.

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,880

there and shit on your fucking team.

486
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:34,340
I would do that to you. I'll have fun
with it. And then at the end of the day,

487
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:39,341
no matter how much I fucking allude to
the 800 pound roided up elephant in the

488
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:44,170
fucking room metal, how much I allude to
that you can just sit back and be like,

489
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:48,370
well, it gives a fuck. We
won the Super Bowl, right?

490
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,600
Rocky map had Colorado.

491
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,450
All right, let's read
it. Let's do some, uh,

497
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,660

of roses that are going to die in a

498
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,470
week. Anyways, shots fired. Give the gift.

499
00:30:30,471 --> 00:30:34,640
Everyone is talking about. Nobody
is talking about this underwear.

500
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,660
Hey man, did you hear about me undies? No.

501
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,450

and feels great to sometimes something

504
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,010

505
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:59,300
Treat yourself and your boo two
a matching pair of me undies.

507
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:08,720
modal, Motown, the and this underwear
is coming is as comfy as it gets.

508
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:13,430
His coming gross me undies
are made of micro modal,

509
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,260
modal fabric, meaning they're
twice as soft as cotton.

510
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,170
You know what? I'm sick of saying that.

511
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,670
I'm going to fucking look that
up right now. Modal verse,

512
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,530
Cotton Bump, bump, bump,

513
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,830
[inaudible], googly ugly little
tonight mode. Albertsons, con,

514
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,320
a men's underwear. Fabric types.

515
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,690
The ones considered artificial
silk. Oh, it's artificial silk.

516
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,910
Holy Shit.

517
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,250
Okay,

518
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,360
wait a minute. Once considered
an artificial silk silk,

519
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:59,570
it was once considered, considered
an artificial silk. Gross.

520
00:31:59,571 --> 00:32:02,720
What the fuck is that? Jesus Christ.

521
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,020
All of a sudden this ad came
down and it was a shredded duty.

522
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:07,850
Looked like a diver. I
remember I was shredded.

523
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:12,851
Greg Louganis was with these little
skivvies on at his fucking package.

524
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,830
Jesus Christ. They should've been
awarding a package delivery on the way.

525
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,610
All right. Once considered
an artificial silk modal.

526
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:28,210
Modal is a type of ray on what they used
to make slacks in the 70s that's softer

527
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:33,470
than cotton and is smooth and
thought and breathes extremely well.

528
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:36,230
They you go, there you go.

529
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:41,231
No more sweaty balls and luxurious fabric.

530
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,820
My mistake, excuse me,

531
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,480
it's cool to the touch absorbent,

532
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,850
gross and similar and textured as silk
or cotton. Unlike cotton, however,

533
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:57,851
it is resistant to shrinkage
and less likely to fade or pill.

534
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,870
Well, Jesus Christ. Don't I owe
everybody fucking me undies in apology.

535
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,340
I'll never be a current again
when I read this. All right,

536
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:11,120
the twice as soft as cotton. It's an
artificial silk. Okay, I'll go with that.

537
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,610
Keeps your balls dry. It's cool to the
touch and they don't just feel great.

538
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,900
Feel Great. They look great
to me. Undies comes in.

539
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:21,620
Tons of cool prints and styles and
new designs come out every month.

540
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,370
That sounds like a lie. Anytime
they say tons, give me a number. Oh,

541
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:28,220
there's tons of them. Got them right
around the corner. Just give me the money.

542
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:28,970
A,

543
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,200
you won't want to miss February's limited
edition design from legendary artists,

544
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:36,740
Keith haring. Oh fuck he. Aaron.
What the fuck is Keith? Eric,

545
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,700
hang on a second. Keith.
The fuck is Keith Herring.

546
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,160
He probably opens for Clinton
when he fucking gives speeches.

547
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,180
Can I ask them all of them?
Silky underwear for she sucks.

548
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,210
My Dick Keith Herring wasn't.
It was an American artist.

549
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,820
This guy's fucking dead. How the
hell is he designing underwear?

550
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,093
Yeah.

551
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,540
1958 to 1990

552
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,520
he was 32 Jesus Christ. He died young.

553
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,860
He was an American artists and social
activists. Oh, of course he died.

554
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,620
Those are the fucking people that the
government puts shit in your coffee.

555
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,960
Whose work responded to the New York City
street culture of the eighties concept

556
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:25,080
of birth deck set death,
sexuality in war. She's crunchy.

557
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,180
Going to put this on underwear.

558
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,130
Okay.

559
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,530
Oh yeah, the stick figures. Oh yeah.

560
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,590
This guy had his own style. I
actually know what this guy's shit is.

561
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,410
I've seen that before. I don't get it.

562
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,230
I mean it looks like a fucking better
version when I drew in kindergarten.

563
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,910
But then again, a lot of
modern art does. Hey Bill,

564
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:45,720
why don't just read the
fucking copy? Alright.

565
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:50,170
It's retro design is inspired by love
making it the perfect Valentine's Day

566
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:50,770
gift.

567
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,000
Grab yourself a pair and celebrate the
holiday sporting matching underwear with

symbol for another year passes.

585
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,010
Take the time to get your life organized
with legal zoom. Do you have a family?

586
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,970
Do you have any assets? The old property,

587
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,480
if any of those answers were yes,
you should have an estate plan.

588
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,030
Don't worry if that sounds,
if that sounds complicated,

589
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,270
legal zone can help legal
zooms, estate plan bundles. Uh,

590
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,910
eliminate the guesswork.

591
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,050
You don't have to figure out on your own.

592
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,740
You don't have to figure out on your
own whether I will or living trust works

593
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:21,820
best for you. Instead,

594
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:25,030
you work with an independent attorney
available in most states, wouldn't it?

595
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,370
In that how you do it anyways. Uh,

596
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:31,030
they'll walk you through the options
and recommend in a state plan that best,

597
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,910
uh, that offers the best
solution to fit your needs.

598
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:37,540
Since legal zoom is not a law firm,
you can count on efficiency and value.

599
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,520
It's such a [inaudible]

600
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,800
weird sentence to me. Everything is
on your, yeah, we're not a law firm.

601

planned bundles cost up front instead of

00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,980
That's how legal zoom has

to be the Thursday afternoon podcast.

613
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,083
Once again,

614
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,210
Andrew Families' is going to give you
some cool music that I know nothing about,

615
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,550
um, as he does every single week.
Uh, thank you guys for listening.

616
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,010
I hope you have your wonderful
weekend, your constant bronco fans.

617
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,140
I'm just fucking with you.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

618
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:37,590
You think I'm not going to be
on Roids when I'm, you know,

619
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,110
I was going to say older.
I'm going to be 48 this year,

620
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:41,790
so I should probably
start taking it, you know,

621
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,690
start showing up to gigs
with no neck. You know,

622
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,220
seeing if people fucking, dude,

623
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,510
you know what fucking Peyton
Manning's neck and head look like.

624
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:56,400
Do you remember when Steve Was Shimmy?
You got stuck in that chipper in Fargo?

625
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,830
Do you remember when his leg was
just sticking out with the foot?

626
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,620
That's what paint man, his neck
looks like. You just stick a head.

627
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,370
Stick a head on it. Sorry. Got
The hiccups. All right, that's it.

628
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,390
Go Fuck Yourself.

629
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,220
Enjoy the throwback podcast for the
last half hour and the wonderful music.

630
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:13,090
I'll talk to you on Monday. [inaudible]

631
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,733
[inaudible]

632
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,790
I never know about. I do now.
Valentine's Day advice. Billy boy,

633
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,760
dear his billion. I know
this is last minute.

634
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,220
I had a question about Valentine's Day.

635
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:37,220
I am a single guy in my
mid twenties rejoice,

636
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,070
dude, I'm going to tell you right now,

637
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:47,270
if you're a single guy in
your mid twenties and you
live in America and you're

638
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:49,740
living on your own, please

639
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,570
dropped to your knees and thank whatever
gods you pray to every day because

640
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:57,250
you're never going to
be free or in your life.

641
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,980
I know you've probably got
student loans at Blah, blah, blah,

642
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,580
the stress and all that
bullshit. Fuck that. Okay?

643
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,100
Do you never going to
be freer in your life?

644
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,330
Go get three years
supplies of condoms, okay,

645
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,650
and bang away my friend. Maybe you
don't need to do it for three years.

646
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,300
Maybe you're one of those
guys for only three weeks,

647
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:21,780
but you need to get it out of
your system. All right? He says,

648
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:25,350
I never really had a girlfriend for
whatever reason. Oh, Jesus Christ.

649
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:28,200
All right, we're gone the whole
other other way. Truth be told,

650
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:32,160
my friends could name numerous
reasons why I don't have a girlfriend,

651
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,060
but that's an entirely different
issue. What? Jesus Christ,

652
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,710
there's a fucking can of worms.

653
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,773
They can.

654
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,550
You don't seem defensive or argumentative.

655
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,760
So I don't know if it's an
anger issue that, look, I'm,

656
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,070
I'm so sick of trying to be
fucking Hannibal Lecter here.

657
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,730
Trying to guess what your shoes look
like with w with the way you write,

658
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,180
you know. All right. I'm just gonna
read the rest of the shit. Uh,

659
00:40:57,181 --> 00:41:00,940
as of right now, I am currently
sleeping with three girls off of,

660
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,670
see you fucking, you'll
get knocking it out.

661
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:05,190
I thought you'd like never
had a girlfriend like,

662
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,860
and you've never banged
anybody. Alright. My fault.

663
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,723
All right.

664
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,440
Do go fuck yourself.

665
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,850
You're a guy in your mid twenties and
you fucking three girls right now and I'm

666
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:19,510
on this. You need advice? I
keep doing what you're doing.

667
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,910
Um, anyways, depending on what day of
the week it is and how much I've drank.

668
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:26,880
Okay. That depends on how
many girls he's paying it.

669
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,360
I've never lied to any of the,

670
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:33,361
any of any of them about where
our relationship is going.

671
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,810
And although they never met each other,

672
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,360
each of them has an idea that I'm seeing
other girls. It's kind of a don't ask,

673
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:46,220
don't tell policy. Um, yeah, dude and
I, you got to come with that. You know,

674
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,600
you can open with that, you know,
what are you doing? I'm dating,

675
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,080
I'm playing the field. I mean,
people you're dating right now.

676
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,100
A couple of people kind of seeing
just having a good time. Well,

677
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:00,830
I don't do stuff like that.
Well there's the door sweetheart

678
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:06,660
then they'll respect like that.
The honesty of that. Some won't,

679
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:08,550
some will actually have
self esteem and walked out,

680
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:12,570
but a lot of them they'll hang around
eventually that if tired their neck gets

681
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:16,020
weak and they'll fall right
in your fucking Dick. Um,

682
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,490
birthdays and Christmas are always a
piece of cake because all that requires a

683
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:24,660
quick text or a phone call or at
the very most drinks at the bar.

684
00:42:24,661 --> 00:42:26,220
But Valentine's Day is tricky.

685
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,030
Our dates consist of bar
hopping and drunk sex.

686
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:34,620
So flowers and a nice dinner would
completely send the wrong message. Dude,

687
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:35,560
you selfish Kahn?

688
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,330
Are you asking me how to keep banging
these three chicks while getting through

689
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:40,380
Valentine's Day?

690
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,710
Why don't you just look at the Valentine's
Day like that's your pussy getting

691
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:44,730
all star break.

692
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:50,570
Just take three days off the day before
the day after on the day of just say,

693
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,990
uh, what are you doing for
Valentine's Day? Um, uh,

694
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,130
I'm going to be a Jesus. Where are
you going to be? I don't, you know,

695
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:02,370
I don't have a good one for that
one. All right. You know what?

696
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,830
I just put myself in your shoes
and I understand your problem now.

697
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,690
You said I got to do a
little bit of trouble.

698
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:09,360
Last year one of the girls
texted me and said, you know,

699
00:43:09,361 --> 00:43:11,880
every girl likes flowers
on Valentine's Day.

700
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,630
He said, I knew my response couldn't
be. Yeah, but if I get you flowers done,

701
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,210
I have to get you flowers
for all the other girls.

702
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,130
So I just post out and
responded. Yeah, well, oh dude,

703
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:26,480
you shouldn't responded at all.

704
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,000
You know, every girl likes to give flowers
on Valentine's Day. Isn't that funny?

705
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,570
And that has nothing to do with most
likely her having any sort of feelings

706
00:43:36,571 --> 00:43:38,970
towards you. It's just
the bitch next to her.

707
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,680
And the other cubicle probably got some,
you know why the girl on their fucking,

708
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:44,850
whatever the fuck you want to call it.

709
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,300
Some guy broke my balls this
week was fucking hilarious.

710
00:43:48,301 --> 00:43:52,140
He was trashing me say come off as a
pompous ass because I always talk about

711
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,590
anybody who doesn't do comedy
works in a cubicle, you know?

712
00:43:56,591 --> 00:43:59,920
And for some reason he decided to take
that seriously and tell me that he

713
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:03,560
actually works at the u n and
travels all around the world.

714
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,263
Okay.

715
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,530
If that's actually true. Sarah, why
don't you just get on with doing that?

716
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,440
You work at the UN and you
travel all over the world.

717
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:18,950
Why would you give a fuck
what some absolute jackass.

718
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,210
You say it on a fucking podcast. How
insecure are you? Your insecurities?

719
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,690
Probably a great thing cause that's
probably the thing that drove you to be at

720
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:31,590
the UN where you travel all around
the world. You know what sir?

721
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,440
Good for you. That's awesome.

722
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:39,530
I hope working at the UN and traveling
all around the world fills you up some

723
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:44,100
point where it fills you up high enough
where you don't have to respond to a

724
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:48,840
silly joke on some dumb ass podcast. Um,

725
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,380
I travel all around the world. Um,

726
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,090
you know what? That's
actually a great fucking job.

727
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,750
Do you feel like you get
anything done? You know,

728
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,680
do you sit there wearing that headpiece
next to that guy who's wearing the water

729
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:08,280
buffalo hat? I buy their beer
at the above doing that shit.

730
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,190
And you're sitting there trying to talk
to him about how you can sell your rich

731
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:15,600
crackers. Did their country, is that
what you're doing when you're traveling?

732
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:19,260
All around the where I
travel all around the world.

733
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,920
I can just see you on the plane
with the of fucking dress socks on.

734
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:31,860
You have a dash cunt. Oh,

735
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:35,850
just sitting there or what movies am I
gonna Watch on this flight as I travel

736
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:39,720
all around the world? Um, anyways.

737
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,490
Yeah.

738
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,960
You know something sir? You had you,

739
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:46,410
you had the James Bond job and then
you fucking, you played yourself.

740
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,540
I don't know why you did
that. Why would you fucking,

741
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,480
that's like me responding to people
on Twitter. Why would I do it?

742
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:55,140
I should pretend like I have
better things to do. Um, anyways,

743
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,380
I want to keep seeing all these
girls back to this guy, but this,

744
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:02,610
but at the same time, I don't want
any broken hearts on Valentine's Day.

745
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,280
Oh two. You know what? Go [inaudible].
I don't know. What is your problem here,

746
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,550
dude? Yeah. You like a Gemini. It's
like you're this fucking lady killer.

747
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:15,380
Then also you kind of like you
how you want to hurt anybody. She,

748
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,810
I get her some jam jams. I can't even,

749
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,170
I won't talk to the fucking UN guy.
What the hell was going on here again?

750
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,340
Valentine's Day got a little
trouble as you, well listen,

751
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,880
you're anticipating trouble. Didn't you
learn anything from last year? You know,

752
00:46:30,881 --> 00:46:33,550
every girl likes flowers
on Valentine's Day.

753
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,573
Okay.

754
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,790
Um, what, what would I write back?

755
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,870
I know what my response would be.

756
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:45,660
The second I read that if it was just
some girl I was banging and then they

757
00:46:45,661 --> 00:46:48,840
wrote that I would get this
awful feeling in my stomach

758
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,550
and I would, I would read it and
as I got that awful feeling, I'd go

759
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,070
and make that noise.

760
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,140
Yeah.

761
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,480
You know that thing like when you're
just banging a girl and then all of a

762
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:04,450
sudden she just fucking
makes that comment. You know,

763
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,050
you think she's on the same page as you.
When did, she just makes that comment,

764
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,450
you know, I was thinking about you today.

765
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:15,520
You just feel that feeling in your
stomach. Yes. Oh yeah. Well a don't

766
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,280
fucking worst. Ah, you
gotta be one and done,

767
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:28,020
but one had done is scary. You just gotta
be honest. I don't know if some girls,

768
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:31,210
what would I say? You know, every
girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

769
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,730
Um, what would I text back? Yeah.
You know, that's what I heard.

770
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,640
You know what I, you know when
I shouldn't give you shit,

771
00:47:40,641 --> 00:47:43,190
I don't have a good
response to that. Well,

772
00:47:43,191 --> 00:47:45,740
maybe someday you'll meet a
guy who wants to give you some,

773
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,620
you want to get drunk and fuck. Um,

774
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,590
and I got nothing and you can't ignore it.

775
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:54,970
You know what I would've done?

776
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:57,040
I would've ignored the text
and I would have called her,

777
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:02,220
but a good three hours later, three,
four hours, three hours later,

778
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:03,240
that's a good one. You call her,

779
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:07,110
you ignore that text and then you call
and she goes hell hour. And they're like,

780
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:09,540
hey, what's going on? What
are you doing tonight?

781
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,480
I got no plans Valentine's
Day. What are you doing?

782
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,490
He just started with
that and then she, well,

783
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,170
what are you at it there?
And she'll be seen.

784
00:48:19,171 --> 00:48:20,940
If you're going to take
it in some romantic,

785
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,240
you know, direction and you don't,

786
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,180
you just keep it in the fuck buddy.

787
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,820
I figured we'd go down to our
meet hammers or whatever the fuck

788
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,160
we go down to. Uh,

789
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,480
take it the face and have a couple
pitchers of beer and see what happens.

790
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,850
Dude, you know what? You're, you're,

791
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,130
it seems to me you're not
just fucking these girls.

792
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:49,890
You're actually having like these
mini relationships with them.

793
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,600
You know the, the key to
having a fuck buddy is,

794
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,650
is the time between fucking them.

795
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,750
And I don't give a shit how much a
woman says that she can handle it.

796
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:07,450
Most of them can't. Most of them can't.

797
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:11,380
If you fucking come on over
there and you, and it just,

798
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:15,460
eventually they're going to
get feelings. They're more,

799
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:18,670
I don't know if they're more mature
or if it's a defect. It's just,

800
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,300
I just respect the fact that
that's how they're wired. So

801
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,460
if you have a fuck buddy, okay, let's,
let's just do the math. Okay, now, now,

802
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,150
February is a very short month here. So
let's just say right out of the gate,

803
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:35,290
you fucker on February 2nd all right?

804
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:40,350
You shouldn't come around again
til at least the 17th and progress.

805
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,830
You Fuck and you leave

806
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,053
f and l,

807
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:47,910
you fuck them and then you leave.
You don't bang her on the SEC.

808
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,230
You Bang around the second and
then you bang her on the seventh.

809
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,110
You're in a fucking
relationship in their world.

810
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,713
You know,

811
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,241
unless you,

812
00:49:57,241 --> 00:50:01,620
literally this second you have
an orgasm as you're coming,

813
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:04,920
you're scooping up your clothes
and you walk out like half naked,

814
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:08,670
then you just bizarre is another
good way to keep them at bay.

815
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,640
And why don't I just read the rest of
the, to see what his question is here.

816
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,070
He says, I want to keep
seeing all these girls,

817
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,020
but at the same time I don't want to Bray,

818
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,570
I don't want any broken hearts
on Valentine's Day. Yeah,

819
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:22,020
you want to keep fucking all of
them now do what you have to have.

820
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,360
You have to have a road involving door.

821
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,400
You have to have a stable of women if
you're going to this life or you have to

822
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:31,820
give into fucking rubbing
one out. All right?

823
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,090
But you can't be a relationship guy
with three different women cause you are

824
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:37,940
going to end up hurting them. So
what you have to constantly be doing,

825
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,970
you gotta be like a
college coach. All right?

826
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:46,550
Every year you lose some top prospects,
but you're out there recruiting. Okay.

827
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:51,770
See you. So you maintain, but it's
never ending. It's fucking exhausting.

828
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,590
But if that's the game you want to
play, that's what you have to do.

829
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,020
So that girl who says, you know,

830
00:50:57,021 --> 00:51:01,910
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's
Day right there, you put on waivers,

831
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,010
okay, for a fucking piece of
ass to be named later, you got,

832
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:13,070
you got to get rid of her.
Okay. And you got to look,

833
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:17,660
go back and analyze what the fuck you
did wrong that she felt it was okay for

834
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:21,410
her to text you cause you fucked up. That
right there shows that you fucked up,

835
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,160
that she felt that she could send that
to you if you think you're just fucked

836
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:29,600
buddies. All right? So
anyways, he continues. He says,

837
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:32,840
I know that like it or not,
this shit is important to women.

838
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:37,610
If I take one girl out, I'm playing
favorites and setting a bad precedent.

839
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:42,290
Plus if she does that check in Shit
on Facebook, I'm completely fucked.

840
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,020
Yeah Dude, you're doing dirtbag shit.

841
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,000
If you're a single guy and something
could happen that fucks you on Facebook,

842
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,840
you're leaving these
girls on anyways. He says,

843
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:56,510
if I take none of them out or do nothing,

844
00:51:56,511 --> 00:52:00,410
I have three irritable
ladies on my hand. Dude,

845
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:04,400
are you going to marry any of
them now? Well then let them go.

846
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,180
Why don't you have the
balls to do that? You know,

847
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,630
when a team halfway through the season
just realized their weight went in this

848
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:16,310
shit, just pull a fucking
Marlin's. Just get rid of everybody

849
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,840
and then your fan base is your
Dick and they're going to,

850
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,300
he's going to be pissed for awhile.

851
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:31,340
Um, but then you build it back
up again. Build it back up again.

852
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:37,720
You know, I dunno, look to it. If you
want to be in a fucking relationship,

853
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,570
you know, there's other ways
about going about and doing this,

854
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:43,930
but you're trying to have your cake
and eat it. Um, told you, get you,

855
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,750
you got three women right now, you're
banging in three different women.

856
00:52:46,751 --> 00:52:49,180
Where's your confidence?
You know what you're doing.

857
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,250
All right.

858
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,800
Dump to keep one at bay
and then get two more.

859
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:58,710
Then dump the other one and get
the other ones. You see them.

860
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,130
You don't even dump them. You
just phase him out, phase him out.

861
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,640
But the new recruits that you get in, you
gotta be straight up honest with them.

862
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,540
You know, unless you actually feel
failure, if you're feeling no failings,

863
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,350
you know, don't keep coming back
fucking them. Unless you know,

864
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,090
you get that 15 day,

865
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,140
you fuck them on the second
you fuck them on the 17th,

866
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,410
then you're into March and
then bang her on like the 11th.

867
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,420
All right? And even then, they
can't catch feelings doing that.

868
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,310
But before you know it,
you know, that's like 14,

869
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:38,610
15 days out of the year taken up while
you, well, you got to bag somebody.

870
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:39,910
This is such, this is a,

871
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,930
this is really should be eye opening to
women that I'm actually saying this is

872
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:47,640
really, uh, this is really awful
that I'm speaking this out loud. Um,

873
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,930
he says, in a perfect world,

874
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:52,980
I'll take all of them out at once and
have the force and I've been chasing after

875
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:55,560
my entire life, but we don't
always get what we want.

876
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:59,310
Any advice from the lovely neo
would be much appreciated as well.

877
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,920
Love the podcast. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh,

878
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:03,591
yeah,

879
00:54:03,591 --> 00:54:06,770
she probably wouldn't have been is a
understanding is I was even going to give

880
00:54:06,771 --> 00:54:07,604
you a lot of shifts.

881
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,473
[inaudible] [inaudible]

882
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:12,230
I've been asking some of the
ladies to Reagan and uh, finally,

883
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,660
I haven't even read this yet, but this
already seems like goals. This is,

884
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:17,740
this is the, the

885
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,260
and the subject line
of this email. It says,

886
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,510
I think the guy I'm dating is a pussy.

887
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,140
Hello Bill. I am a 21 year old student.

888
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:37,380
I began listening to your podcast recently
and I heard you complaining about how

889
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:38,550
women have not written in,

890
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,300
in awhile and being a woman myself
decided to do so and asks you for advice.

891
00:55:43,301 --> 00:55:47,110
Well, God bless you. Uh, I live at
home with my mom and go to college.

892
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:50,410
I recently found a very nice guy. Uh,

893
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,240
they were at college and
was really into them,

894
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:54,670
but then I started
suspecting something strange.

895
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,580
I started suspecting that
maybe he was a pussy.

896
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,300
At first I thought it was pretty harmless,

897
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:05,020
but then one night we had a house
party and everyone was pretty drunk.

898
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:10,230
And a friend of mine who I haven't seen
in a while was there and when everyone

899
00:56:10,421 --> 00:56:12,640
was way, way, way past drunk,

900
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:18,660
she tried to get into a fight with me
and eventually pushed me down the wall,

901
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,350
then stole my iPhone and he
was there and did nothing.

902
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,700
Jesus Christ.

903
00:56:26,701 --> 00:56:30,540
I was so scared that I called
my ex to come get me any did.

904
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,210
Wow.

905
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,730
Right. You think you're dating a pussy?

906
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:42,410
I mean that right there g and he just
stood there and let this other guy who

907
00:56:42,411 --> 00:56:45,380
used to hook up with you come
in riding in on his white horse.

908
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:47,611
Anyways,

909
00:56:47,611 --> 00:56:52,080
my ex was more of a man than the guy
was dating now even though the guy I'm

910
00:56:52,081 --> 00:56:55,980
dating was drunk, I felt like he should
have protected me or done something,

911
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:56,760
anything.

912
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,380
He did nothing and later he even confessed
to me that he was scared of my drunk

913
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:05,790
friend and even scared of
me. What the fuck? Right.

914
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:08,670
Even though he says this
will never happen again.

915
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:13,260
I have enough knowledge to know that
people do do not usually change like that,

916
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:18,390
you know? That's really wise that
you're really wise for your age at 21,

917
00:57:18,391 --> 00:57:22,560
if you, if you are already not
buying into the, I'm gonna Change,

918
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,750
that's a, you're, you're wise
beyond your years. You know,

919
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:29,970
they say that your, basically,

920
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:32,610
your psychological makeup is
done by the time you're three.

921
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,690
So if you see some little toddler standing
there while somebody is taking his

922
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:38,790
blocks, that kid's going to be a pussy

923
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:46,530
anyway. So should I be upset or give him
another chance? Is this a deal breaker?

924
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,580
Is there no way to change a
guy from a pussy to a real man?

925
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,120
Should I just break off
things off with him and if so,

926
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:58,120
should I remain friends with him? Thanks
bill. And I hope you read this. Uh,

927
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,860
I love you in the Oh,
that's nice. Um, all right.

928
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,150
This is the deal. Uh, you ask a question,

929
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,660
is there no way to change a
guy from a pussy to a real man?

930
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,950
No, I don't think. I
think that that happens.

931
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:20,951
I think it happens way more in movies
where somebody has a life changing moment.

932
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:23,723
Uh,

933
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,790
and then they just decide I'm
not going to take shit anymore.

934
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,440
But even then,

935
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:34,370
that just begins the journey of not
being a pussy. You don't just say,

936
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,040
I'm not going to be a pussy and then
Bam, you're not a pussy anymore.

937
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,080
You have to, you got to work your way up.

938
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,890
It's like if you were a hundred pounds
overweight and you're like this,

939
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,150
I'm done. I'm not eating
fucking ice cream anymore.

940
00:58:44,151 --> 00:58:47,450
The next day you don't
have a six pack, you know,

941
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,620
takes a fucking year or something. You
really gotta turn it around. So, um,

942
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:57,250
I dunno, what are you
looking for in a guy? I mean,

943
00:58:57,251 --> 00:59:00,190
I think the fact that you're
writing me and you're saying,

944
00:59:00,191 --> 00:59:03,210
I think the guy I'm dating
is a pussy. I mean that,

945
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:08,211
that actually hurts me on some level
just because I insert myself into this

946
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,660
story and the person I'm dating would
be calling me a pussy or it could be the

947
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:17,350
ex, I guess. I don't know. This isn't
about me. This is about you. Come up,

948
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:19,840
you'll stop being selfish. All right. Um,

949
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,340
I think you've totally
lost respect for this guy.

950
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:24,410
And if you don't respect
the person you're with,

951
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:28,840
eventually you're going to
blow somebody else. You know,

952
00:59:28,841 --> 00:59:30,910
if you don't break up with this
guy, that's what I'm predicting.

953
00:59:30,911 --> 00:59:31,960
If you don't break up with this guy,

954
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:36,810
you just going to cheat on him just
to facilitate getting out of the

955
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:40,820
relationship because uh, you know,

956
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,890
to get to that ll cool j moment,
we can just be fucking on us.

957
00:59:43,891 --> 00:59:47,450
But I don't think you'd like that when
something about you knowing that people

958
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:51,140
don't change your age and the fact that
you like, you know, this guy's a pussy,

959
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,610
he's not sticking up for me.

960
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:56,570
And the fact that he didn't stick up for
you and then you took charge and say,

961
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:59,060
well I'm going to fucking
call somebody who will,

962
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:05,200
I mean technically you should have fucked
your ex boyfriend that night and he,

963
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:06,280
and he shouldn't have been mad.

964
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,770
He should have been like Eddie probably
wouldn't have been cause he's a pussy.

965
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,730
Ain't I stared, oh man. You know when
you needed a big swinging dick. I mean,

966
01:00:12,731 --> 01:00:15,790
God knows it wasn't me. So, uh, yeah.

967
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,160
Um, I think if you don't
break up with this guy,

968
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:24,480
you're actually fighting
nature. All right? And

969
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,710
you guys are wired to too,

970
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:35,330
I know you guys aren't wired
to just have kids with pussies.

971
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:39,870
You know what I mean? You want a
strong son, right? You know, like,

972
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,970
you know what that Pussy DNA and your
kid, right? Oh, that's going to kill you.

973
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,770
Imagine that you have a kid with this
guy and you want this kid to be like a,

974
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,950
like your ex boyfriend and it comes down
and it's like this fucking little wormy

975
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:56,640
worm guy. Ah, that'd be awful.

976
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,210
Walking down the aisle to marry
this guy with dead sheepish.

977
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,370
[inaudible] you do you know what?

978
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,530
That you want this guy to be the man
standing down there in a white Tuxedo,

979
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:10,800
like fucking Roger Moore on James
Bond. I think. I think, uh, look,

980
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:15,330
I don't know if this just
happened and you're really upset.

981
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,360
So, uh, you know, and like,

982
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,390
and in three days you're not going to
care and you're going to go back to having

983
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:26,370
a picnic with this guy because for all
I know, your ex who came coming back,

984
01:01:26,371 --> 01:01:28,350
maybe you broke up with him
because he cheated on you.

985
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,290
Maybe he was too much of a
guy, if you know what I mean.

986
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,960
So then you said, well,
all right, I'm gonna.

987
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:41,070
Maybe I'm this next time I'm dating a
nice guy to now you dated a nice guy.

988
01:01:41,071 --> 01:01:43,230
The thing about is sometimes
you'd date a nice guy.

989
01:01:43,231 --> 01:01:47,940
They can be so nice that they're
pussies. All right? And look, I'm not,

990
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,950
I'm not sitting there
acting like, you know,

991
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,630
if I'm out with my girl in some
fucking 200 pounds, 300 pounds,

992
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,580
Jack fucking 25 year old comes
up and starts doing shit,

993
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,030
then I'm going to start swinging
because I'm not, I'm not,

994
01:02:03,031 --> 01:02:07,860
I'm not getting my fucking head
kicked in just for the fuck of it now.

995
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,220
You know what I mean? I mean,
it's not like just, you know,

996
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:14,170
straight across the board as a guy,

997
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,990
you have to fucking go and get
your Goddamn head kicked in.

998
01:02:16,991 --> 01:02:21,570
But this was a fucking woman.
This was a, I mean he's Jesus.

999
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:25,020
It is a weird situation
in defense of him where,

1000
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,410
how do you get the fucking iPhone back?

1001
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,260
You start wrestling with her and now
you're kind of fucking throwing a girl

1002
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:35,940
around so you're looking at that possible
assault charge cause God knows that's

1003
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:40,140
how the world worked. Works
right now. Your honor.

1004
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:42,830
I was trying to steal a phone and he,

1005
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:47,130
that this guy is salted me and you're
going to be sitting there going,

1006
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:49,770
she was stealing of phone and then
not gonna be able to get past your,

1007
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:52,470
you're a guy and she's a girl. But um,

1008
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,830
yeah, he should have just,

1009
01:02:56,831 --> 01:03:01,090
he should've just held her by the back
of her pants so she couldn't leave and

1010
01:03:01,091 --> 01:03:04,330
just stayed out of reach of her swinging.

1011
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:09,520
That's what you do. If you're
in that situation as that guy,

1012
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,900
you just reached out,

1013
01:03:10,901 --> 01:03:14,950
you grabbed by the back of your pants
and you just start running in a circle

1014
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,570
until cops get there. So they can't swing
at Ya. That running backwards. I mean,

1015
01:03:19,571 --> 01:03:20,330
I don't know what you,

1016
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,840
you gotta you gotta fucking do
something and he didn't do anything.

1017
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,760
That's the big thing. If
you told them, honestly,

1018
01:03:24,761 --> 01:03:28,000
if you told me that this was some giant
guy who could kick the shit out of him,

1019
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:33,070
uh, I wouldn't say that the guy's a pussy.

1020
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,590
You know what I mean? I mean,

1021
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:37,630
what is the point of going
and getting a concussion?

1022
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,060
Getting your tooth driven up
through your fucking nose.

1023
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:44,710
The Guy Still gonna leave with
your phone. You know that said old,

1024
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:47,810
uh, Richard Pryor. Bit Macho, man.

1025
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:50,740
I'll take that knife and stick it up
your ass macho man. It's like, no,

1026
01:03:50,741 --> 01:03:53,830
you're going to get the shit kicked out
of you. But this was a woman. Alright.

1027
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,670
Pill for fuck sakes. Quit. You have
God damn rambling. Wrap it up. Um,

1028
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:02,710
I think you know what you want
to do when you should do it. Um,

1029
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:06,550
you are dating a pussy. The
fact that when he was sober,

1030
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:10,390
he said that he was scared
of her and have you, uh,

1031
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:13,840
he seems like he's a
little for clamped and uh,

1032
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:18,250
I just can't imagine there's
going to be a stereotype,

1033
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:22,510
but a guy like that actually putting it
on you in the bedroom. I really don't.

1034
01:04:22,511 --> 01:04:26,320
He probably stares at you in the eye. Am
I hurting you? Is Everything okay? God,

1035
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:29,470
you're so beautiful. I mean,
come on right. Flip her over.

1036
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:33,520
What's your face in the pillows? I'm
always, she says in ps, don't worry.

1037
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:35,200
Uh,

1038
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,100
that con I used to call a
friend who pushed me and
took my phone is no longer in

1039
01:04:39,101 --> 01:04:43,780
my life. She gets your phone back.
Well, what happened with you guys?

1040
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,380
Now wait a minute. What can
I hear the followup here?

1041
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,710
There's so many different ways that this
could be gone. Was that like a girl?

1042
01:04:50,711 --> 01:04:55,711
Like when you thought that maybe you were
a swinging another way and now all of

1043
01:04:56,471 --> 01:04:57,870
a sudden you broke up with her and

1044
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,910
a problem.

1045
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:18,803
[inaudible]

1046
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,840
anyway, I got them into the biggest,

1047
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,430
dumbest fucking fight last
night with my girl, right?

1048
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:56,690
We had this great day, you
know, everything's going great.

1049
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:02,180
So I stay in, I take a night off from
comedy and I say, Hey, why don't we watch,

1050
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:05,000
why don't we watch your
movie? You know what I mean?

1051
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,570
Cap Off this wonderful fucking
day. Everything's going great.

1052
01:06:08,571 --> 01:06:09,404
What could go wrong?

1053
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,530
This is like the beginning of a horror
movie where they just show like the

1054
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:16,070
perfect family and everything's great
and people are wearing like white linen,

1055
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:17,630
you know?

1056
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:20,210
And then all of a sudden they just
start showing the camera in the bushes,

1057
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:23,600
like a POV of like Mike Meyers.
This is basically what happens.

1058
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:25,850
So 60 minutes comes on, right?

1059
01:06:25,851 --> 01:06:29,060
Who doesn't want to watch that show
and pretend they're smart? You know,

1060
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,250
I like it some more that Morley
safer comes on and you know,

1061
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:37,340
we smells like an old person. Some old
people don't smell like old people,

1062
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:40,040
but he looks like he smells
like an old person, you know,

1063
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:46,070
smells of cigars, ash trays,
you know, a couple of wars,

1064
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,320
maybe a date rape. Um,

1065
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:55,040
so he's interviewing
Meryl Streep, all right.

1066
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,600
The Great Meryl Streep,

1067
01:06:56,601 --> 01:07:00,410
and they're going through all our old
oral frigging life and all the movies and

1068
01:07:00,411 --> 01:07:04,370
all the different characters that she's
played. Oh, first of all, they start,

1069
01:07:04,371 --> 01:07:09,260
they start the report off with
Morley safer just sitting there,

1070
01:07:09,261 --> 01:07:13,890
right smelling of fucking Ben
Gay in Whiskey, right? And, uh,

1071
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:18,650
he says, how, you know how
over in England, you know,

1072
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,070
they, you know, I dunno, they
make their, their actors, they,

1073
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,090
they award them by calling them
Lords and they knight them.

1074
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:27,980
But over here at America,

1075
01:07:27,981 --> 01:07:31,250
all we do is just give them the
shiny statue and it's just like,

1076
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:34,970
starts off right off the bat for some
reason, just shitting on America.

1077
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:40,400
I don't know why. Like an
Oscar is somehow beneath

1078
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:46,130
sir, uh, Anthony Michael
Hall. I mean, or, or Lord,

1079
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:49,610
what Lord of what, what are, what,

1080
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:55,220
at least you can fucking hold our
statue, your lord of what kingdom,

1081
01:07:56,510 --> 01:08:00,350
that phony horse shit that you have
with Prince Charles in the popper or

1082
01:08:00,351 --> 01:08:03,290
whatever the fuck is going
on over there. You know,

1083
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:07,340
look, if the Rothschilds
knight you over there,

1084
01:08:07,341 --> 01:08:08,690
then that fucking means something.

1085
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,350
Then you can come become part of their
yacht convoy as they go around the world

1086
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:16,970
figuring out how to take over another
currency, right? Then you're in with them.

1087
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,570
Okay. But if you're, if you're fucking,
you know, Lord of this and you're,

1088
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:23,870
your wing man is the Duke
of Elton John. I mean,

1089
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,690
it's a whole thing is fucking
stupid, right? So right off the bat,

1090
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:30,230
it's already bugging me. But I know Nia
hates when I talk to the TV, right? So,

1091
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:31,243
you know,

1092
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,810
I keep my big fucking Yap shut and
they start talking about Meryl Streep.

1093
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:40,400
Babababababa gone through the whole
thing and then I'm the old guy.

1094
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:44,660
They're smelling, have a, you know,
prescription meds goes, uh, you know,

1095
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:47,360
whenever they talk about the roles
you play, they always say, you know,

1096
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,110
you play independent minded women,
very strong women. And Meryl Goes,

1097
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:53,630
I know that's, yeah, that's what
they say. You know, when a guy,

1098
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,830
they never say to a guy, oh, you're
playing a strong willed character,

1099
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:01,850
Yada Yada Yada. I let that go,
whatever, no Biggie, I'll take that.

1100
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:06,500
It's probably true. The fuck do
I know I'm not a Horman right.

1101
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:11,570
But then they show her after she played
Margaret Stature and she's given a

1102
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:16,250
speech to a bunch of women's young girls.
She's trying to inspire them and she,

1103
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:20,510
she takes a quote from Margaret Thatcher
and it was something along the lines

1104
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,730
of, if you want a bunch
of people to talk around,

1105
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:26,630
talk is standing around talking
about doing something, you know,

1106
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,260
something a Golden Eagle,
you got to talk to men.

1107
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,960
But if you want it to actually get done,

1108
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:37,550
you got to get a woman and then all
the chicks go, Woo. Like flipping out.

1109
01:09:37,551 --> 01:09:41,600
Right. So I laughed and I'm
like, Yay. Reverse sexism. Right.

1110
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,980
Just seeing, you know, my,

1111
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,980
my whole fucking theory how
everybody is just a piece of shit.

1112
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,490
You just don't have the power to act
out what the fuck you want to do because

1113
01:09:52,491 --> 01:09:56,060
that, that right there, if
you flip that around as a guy,

1114
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,750
if you're running for president,
it's fucking over. He can't be like,

1115
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:00,470
let me tell you know,

1116
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,470
tell you what after I get you jobs
and after I fixed this economy,

1117
01:10:05,511 --> 01:10:08,240
okay? And I'm the man to do it
because I'll tell you right now,

1118
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:13,430
if you're looking for someone to stand
around and talk about doing something,

1119
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:16,610
you get a woman. You want to
get done. You got to get a man.

1120
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:18,560
Here are my nuts right here on the podium.

1121
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:21,710
Vote for me November 4th go fuck
yourself. Right? You did that.

1122
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:25,040
Your presidential campaigns
over. She does it.

1123
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:29,930
It's fucking adorable and it's just as
fucking ignorant, you know what I mean?

1124
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,130
What a fuck do you get off saying
that we stand around and do nothing.

1125
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:38,180
Meryl Streep. Huh? Or quoting Margaret
and you too. Margaret Thatcher.

1126
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,390
Let me taste you bitches something.
Alright? We faked a fucking lunar landing.

1127
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:50,120
Okay. You think that's just talking.
Anybody can land on the fucking moon,

1128
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:50,930
that's easy.

1129
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:55,730
But to pretend you did it all right and
get everybody to shut the fuck up about

1130
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:59,030
it. That, that, that, that right
there, that takes skill. So whatever.

1131
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:02,810
So I make that little comment and um,
then I just go with that, that, that,

1132
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:05,400
that, that suddenly fucking porky pig. So,

1133
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,360
so I make that comment and like, you know,

1134
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:11,180
I've been with Nia long enough that I
can tell by the side of her face when

1135
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:12,680
she's just thinking about like,

1136
01:11:12,681 --> 01:11:15,690
what if I just grabbed everything I
really cared about and walked out of this

1137
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:20,040
house right now? She got
like that fucking mad at me,

1138
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,550
you know? And I'm like, she's just like,

1139
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:30,280
right after the story was over, she
just shut the fucking thing off. And uh,

1140
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:35,450
I own half an extent. I'm walking to seven
11 and get some ice cream. I haven't,

1141
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:40,450
I've done even what happened
was all going great. You know,

1142
01:11:40,451 --> 01:11:41,410
am I the asshole there?

1143
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:46,960
What am I supposed to just fucking sit
there with my mouth hanging open with

1144
01:11:46,961 --> 01:11:50,020
drool coming out when I watch TV,
if somebody says something Douchey,

1145
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:54,610
I'm not supposed to say
it, whatever, whatever.

1146
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:57,820
So I just finally just said, you know
what? Fuck this. I take the dog out.

1147
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:02,530
I go around the block. What do I do?
I'm calling my guy friends, right?

1148
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:06,190
They're all backing me up. I'm not
saying who I called. I don't name names,

1149
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,260
right? And they're all laughing their
ass off and they 100% agree with me,

1150
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,850
which is all I'm looking
for at this point.

1151
01:12:12,851 --> 01:12:14,450
I just want people to say that I'm right.

1152
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:18,220
I don't want to learn anything from this
experience. Just tell me I was right.

1153
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:22,180
So it can be an ignorant
ass again. I don't know.

1154
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,430
Why don't you guys weigh in on
that? Am I a Dick for saying that?

1155
01:12:24,431 --> 01:12:28,870
Should I just let that one go? You
know? Oh, you know what she said?

1156
01:12:28,871 --> 01:12:31,420
That fucking drove me up the
wall. She goes, why are you,

1157
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,310
she didn't say intimidated.
She was one of those words.

1158
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:45,250
Why are you threatened by what
she, it's like I'm not threatened.

1159
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,430
I, yeah, Jesus Christ. Then
I take the bait, you know,

1160
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:53,050
it just sends me right over it, like
threatened about what? Oh my God.

1161
01:12:53,051 --> 01:12:57,160
This person that I don't know who has
never called me, nor will ever call me,

1162
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,490
who has no effect on my life. How
do you get threatened by that?

1163
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:03,610
I'm just calling it for the bullshit
that it is. Cause you know what?

1164
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:05,470
This is what fucking drives me nuts.

1165
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:10,660
I can't stand when somebody tells me that
their shit sandwich tastes worse than

1166
01:13:10,661 --> 01:13:14,620
my shit sandwich. Okay, go fuck yourself.

1167
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:19,300
At what point am I supposed to have
empathy as I'm sitting here eating a shit

1168
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:23,140
sandwich and you're telling me how much
worse your yours, yours is, you know,

1169
01:13:23,141 --> 01:13:27,040
at the end of the fucking day. You know
what I mean? Sure. Mine might be on,

1170
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:28,870
you know, a better slice of bread,

1171
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,290
which I guess would make it
taste a little bit better,

1172
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:35,500
but at the end of the fucking day,
right the end of the fucking day.

1173
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:40,390
All right. I'm going to end up
in a FEMA camp with you. Okay?

1174
01:13:40,391 --> 01:13:45,040
You think on the next fucking a psycho
comes along. I'm gonna make the cut.

1175
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:49,900
What the fuck? The white board, what
do I bring to the world? Huh? Exactly.

1176
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:52,990
And to be standing right next
to you. So go fuck yourself.

1177
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,870
You just fucking woman.
Every time she sneezes,

1178
01:13:55,871 --> 01:13:58,420
they give her another God damn
award. She's still pitching,

1179
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:00,970
still fucking pitching. You know,

1180
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:03,910
I remember when I did this
Oscar nominated part out.

1181
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:07,270
Go Fuck yourself with your wigs
though thing. Just, you know,

1182
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,750
that's what fucking pisses me
off when I watched this shit.

1183
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:14,620
If you want to know my perspective
is from where I come from,

1184
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,680
I can't bitch about shit cause
everybody's like, oh go fuck yourself.

1185
01:14:17,681 --> 01:14:20,560
You hit the lottery. Right. But I got
to sit here and listen to you bitch.

1186
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:25,510
Even if you fucking killing it,
even if you're killing it, you know,

1187
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,950
Yale School of drama and
he's stepped on the bull.

1188
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:34,530
Go Fuck yourself with your
goddamn yachts. Alright,

1189
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,920
there you go. That felt good. It's
probably ignorant or whatever.

1190
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:40,023
I love you.

1191
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,353
Yeah.

1192
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:20,643
[inaudible]

1193
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:40,740
[inaudible].
