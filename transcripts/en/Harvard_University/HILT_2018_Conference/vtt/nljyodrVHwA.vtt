00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.570
So my name's Dustin Tingley.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.320
I'm a professor of government
and the new faculty director

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.890
of HILT. And I'm just so pleased
that everyone has come out

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.490
and is having a great time.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.190
So before we get
started, I just wanted

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.606
to remind folks
that if you wanted

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:22.930
to enter in some
questions into the poll,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.910
you can look over
here for the website.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.030
That would be great.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.730
As a little added
incentive, if we

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.040
choose one of your
questions, Alan

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.870
has agreed to put his voice
on your home voicemail.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.720
He actually hasn't, but
I thought it would work.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.430
Sorry, boss.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
So before we get started
with this last session,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.790
I just want to take a second
to really thank the HILT team--

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.730
Cassie McGrath, Allison Pingree,
Jaime Goldstein, Zach Wang,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.320
and Melissa Godet.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.370
They've just done such an
amazing job in organizing this.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.140
The amount of thought and
detail that goes into this

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.220
is just amazing.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.950
You know, briefers for all the
people involved, et cetera.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.510
And super honored
that some friends

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.910
of Sarah Shaughnessy and
Brooke Pulitzer and others

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.560
have come to chip in, as well.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.200
So we just really,
really appreciate that.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.720
Furthermore, I just want
to take another second

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.820
to honor Erin Driver-Linn.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.320
I know she was
honored this morning,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.420
but I'm going to
get my piece, too.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.934
So as many of you know, Erin was
the founding director of HILT

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.850
and led HILT for I'm
going to say eight years.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.097
Because it wasn't
really just starting

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:28.180
with the first conference.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.230
It was more than that, right?

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.646
There was a lot
of lead up to that

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:33.580
that Erin really invested in.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.430
And I think personally-- but
I suspect I speak for a lot

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.570
of folks--

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.800
Erin has not just been a friend,
but a real mentor and teacher,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.300
right?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.909
In some senses, I feel
like I've gone through what

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:44.700
I'm going to call--

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.199
I'm going to create
a new department

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:47.490
called EDL, Erin Driver-Linn.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.880
So I feel like I've gone through
EDL 101, 102, 103, 104, 105,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.420
106.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.003
Like, I'm going to
get another degree.

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:55.880
I always wanted another degree.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.352
And I just-- it's amazing.

00:01:57.352 --> 00:01:58.810
I looked into a
little bit of data.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.377
You haven't been able to teach
any classes in your capacity.

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:04.960
But in some senses, you've been
running one of the most highly

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.900
subscribed informal
learning experiences

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.850
in the history of
Harvard University.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.210
And that is just tremendous.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.180
And I feel like we owe
the whole HILT team

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.854
and Erin a round of applause.

00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:17.758
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.890
So now, to switch
gears a little bit,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.390
we're really honored to have
today both Provost Alan Garber

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.600
and the incoming Vice Provost
for Advances in Learning Bharat

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.990
Anand.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.260
Both of them have had huge
impacts throughout Harvard

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.570
already, and we thought
it would be a great idea

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.210
to get these folks
together and let them have

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.624
a conversation with each other.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:47.540
And I thought I would
just kind of kick it off

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.010
by asking both to kind of
reflect in the past seven

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.200
years, what's some of
the things that we've

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.521
learned about teaching
and learning at Harvard

00:02:57.521 --> 00:02:58.520
in the last seven years.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.728
And we'll take it from there.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.810
Bharat, you should
take advantage of this.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.370
This may be the
last time that we're

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.539
allowed to publicly disagree.

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:10.580
And you should start out.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.310
Looking at sort of the landscape
more broadly beyond what

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.820
we do here, which
I think many of us

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.040
have been doing for
the last several years,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.600
I had three observations.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.040
The first is, as
much as we would

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.220
like to believe that the
challenges we are confronting

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.640
are entirely different
from what anyone

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.860
else in the history of
organizations has confronted,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.150
I think this is--

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.370
I think we're sort of seeing the
early stages of how many what

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.220
I would call content
industries have played out

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.400
for the last quarter century.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.070
And so what do I mean by that?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.870
One of the things that some of
you know I have written about

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.490
is that when digital
came along, we've

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.347
almost gone through three phases
in many of these other markets

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:10.430
or businesses, whether we
think about, by the way,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.970
music or newspapers or
media more generally.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.870
The first is what we might
call the phase of optimizing

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.019
on reach, which is, you
know, the big attractiveness

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.450
of digital technologies
was we don't

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.650
need to distribute a
newspaper to 100 people.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.900
We can reach a million people.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.560
The same thing goes
for education, right?

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.620
And so reach you might
think of as phase one.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.549
And that's, by the way, a
big attraction of digital.

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:40.340
But the moment you
start thinking about it,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.380
there's at least two
other benefits we get,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.860
which we might
call interactivity,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.340
which is we're not just reaching
people through information

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.030
transfer, but unlike,
let's say, radio and TV

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.460
and so on, people
can talk back to us.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.690
And that has many benefits.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.566
So let's call that sort
of benefit of type two.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:01.940
And benefit of
type three is when

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.540
we realize it's not just
what we might call hub

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.240
to spoke transfers or
spoke to hub communication,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.640
but spoke to spoke.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.840
And I've called
that connectedness.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.730
What's interesting is
all the digital giants

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.300
we talk about are phase
three kind of firms.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.210
That's just a lens
through which at least I

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.120
look at what's happening.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.440
And what's interesting
to me is much

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.290
of what we're seeing
in the edtech space

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.470
or even education more
broadly is literally

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.780
examples of these three
kinds of organizations.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.950
Peer learning is an example
of phase three, which,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.200
you know, I think has huge
implications going forward,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.979
which we're just
beginning to scratch.

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.520
In different parts
of the university,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.040
we've started seeing
the benefits of this.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.725
But the other thing I just want
to throw out is that, you know,

00:05:56.725 --> 00:05:59.570
I've spent a lot of time looking
at newspaper organizations,

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.236
and one of the things
that's interesting

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.580
is the people who
actually survived

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.250
the digital transition
are not necessarily

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.510
the folks in those organizations
who are the most tech savvy.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.297
They were the folks who believed
in the art of storytelling.

00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:16.130
And that's actually
something useful to keep

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.380
in mind, which is that
technology is just

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.980
an instrument.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.640
I mean, it's here for us.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.694
It's up to us to figure out how
to use this most powerfully.

00:06:23.694 --> 00:06:25.610
And the example I just
want to use-- and then,

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.400
maybe this intersects with even
the topic of the conference

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.380
about the science of learning--
is a story that David Garvin,

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.140
who was one of my
colleagues at HBS,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.480
probably one of the most
thoughtful people on campus

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.030
when it came to thinking
about teaching and learning--

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.000
and I know many of
you interact with him.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.580
When I came to the university as
a faculty member 21 years ago,

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.490
David was amongst a group of
faculty who were teaching us

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.120
about teaching.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.480
And I still remember one story
he told us, which some of you

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.430
may have heard.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.260
He said, you know, when you
think about closing a class,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.730
here's one way to close a class.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.940
Let's say you're telling
a story about a kingdom

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.240
and what happened to
the king and queen,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.600
and the queen died, and
then, the king died.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.137
You know, that's one
way to close the story.

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:20.220
Here's another way to close
that same story, which

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.700
is to say the queen
died, and then, the king

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.510
died of a broken heart.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.580
And what is fascinating was
now that I think back to that,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.470
we didn't need to measure
which one was most effective.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.090
You know, that was--

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.780
you knew immediately.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.440
And this is just something that
I have found really powerful

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.023
and goes back to, in fact, some
of the comments in the morning

00:07:46.023 --> 00:07:48.160
session that Erin
was mentioning,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.877
which is when we think about
the science of learning,

00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:52.710
there's a lot of things
that we can actually

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.160
do pretty well on in terms
of quantitative information

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.330
and measurement.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.310
But there's also a lot
of things which we just

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.516
know in the classroom are
working and not working.

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.140
I was speaking with
Gary King recently,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.910
and Gary and his
usual incredible way

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:10.967
just gave me some advice.

00:08:10.967 --> 00:08:13.300
He said everything about
improving teaching and learning

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.730
is a measurement problem.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.810
And I was like, OK, I've
got to start taking notes.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.700
And he said, ultimately,
you want feedback.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.820
And you want feedback
more frequently than just

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.404
once in the semester.

00:08:26.404 --> 00:08:28.070
You might want it
twice in the semester.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.528
You might want it
once every class.

00:08:29.528 --> 00:08:30.993
You might want it
during the class.

00:08:30.993 --> 00:08:32.576
And you start thinking
about the idea,

00:08:32.576 --> 00:08:35.669
and wow, this is
actually pretty profound.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.880
But then, my reaction was,
hold on a second, Gary.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.730
When we actually do or
engage in active learning,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.550
I don't need any observed
or measurable feedback.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.200
I can see it in the students.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.629
I can see it
throughout the class.

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:50.170
And he was like,
wow, that's actually

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.610
a great point,
which is, you know,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.811
I need feedback
when I'm lecturing.

00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:55.810
And so again, you know,
what's interesting to me

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.050
is these things are
often compliments,

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.010
but it speaks to this
core question, which

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.710
is when we think about
the trends of digital

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.945
and how it impacts
teaching and learning,

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:07.570
it's useful actually to think in
these three terms-- at least I

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.580
found it useful-- which
is reach, interactively,

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.600
and connectedness.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.225
I'll just say a couple
of other things.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.750
A direct implication of
that-- and I think most

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.840
of the organizations or
innovations that I've seen over

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.650
the last six to seven years
which have really impacted

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.850
my thinking are ones which have
put the learner at the center

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.464
of the enterprise--

00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:32.880
pedagogy and learning at the
center of the enterprise-- as

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.760
opposed to the content.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.040
That's not a trivial
observation, I don't think.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.510
And it has some pretty
important implications.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.210
And what does that mean in
terms of how we actually

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.480
set up an organization that's
designed to improve things?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.740
What does it mean in terms
of even something as simple

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.280
as saying, well, if you're
going to improve that, this

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.810
is a corollary, perhaps?

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.400
Content and technology
ought to sit side by side.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.410
Because any ideas we get about
improving content or learning

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.045
or pedagogy must ultimately
be reflected in the platforms.

00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:10.420
You know, again,
I'm not thinking

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.060
about what that means in
terms of implications for us

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.480
as a university, but
it's just an observation.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.230
So that's the other thing that
I would say is, I believe,

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.700
absolutely essential.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.810
And the third is--

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.260
and this is an obvious
statement coming from me--

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.060
that strategy matters.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.080
And what do I mean by that?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.020
I keep saying that
when we were starting

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.520
in our small world, HBX,
about five or six years ago,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.980
the most useful three months
we spent during the last five

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.670
years were the first three
months when all we were doing

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.030
was just asking, "Who
are we tried to target?

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.330
What's the problem
we're trying to solve?

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.290
And what can we do as an
institution that differentiates

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.720
ourselves from everyone else?"

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.160
Because once you're
in the online space,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.360
anyone can offer anything.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.170
What gives us a license to play?

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.530
And in some sense,
those questions

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.025
have been incredibly powerful.

00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:12.400
When I look across the landscape
of organizations, again,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.860
I see it's not surprising that
we should ask those questions,

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.620
it is surprising how many don't.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.650
So that's the other--

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.380
that's the other thing
I'd just throw out.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.200
Well, I hope you can all see why
Bharat was the obvious choice

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.830
to become the next vice provost
for advances in learning.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.200
Nobody has thought
more thoroughly

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.980
about these issues, particularly
the issues of strategy,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.530
when it comes to learning, and
especially online learning.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.990
And to those of you
who haven't read it,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.650
I'd like to highly recommend his
book, The Content Trap, where

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.330
he really developed
some of the ideas

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.659
that he just touched
upon lightly here.

00:11:51.659 --> 00:11:53.200
But it'll give you
a really good idea

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.730
about digital
technologies in general,

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.090
but particularly about learning.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.890
I want to say a little bit about
the question Dustin posed--

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.540
what's the most
important thing we've

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.456
learned about teaching
and learning at Harvard

00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:08.330
in the last seven years?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.120
And I can't pretend to
speak for anybody but me

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.720
in answering that question.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.570
Seven years, by the
way, corresponds

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.420
to how long I've
been here as provost,

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.540
so it's kind of easy for me
to think about the beginning

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.080
and today.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.990
And, by the way, my answer
when people ask what

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.560
surprised you most when
you came to Harvard--

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.170
and many of you have heard me
say this at previous health

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.720
conferences.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.150
The biggest surprise to
me was how many people

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.320
cared so deeply about teaching.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.040
That was not, in my view, what
Harvard's outside reputation

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.090
was.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.930
And I won't say that every
person who teaches at Harvard

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.300
has a real passion
for it, but I would

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.660
say an amazing fraction
of people who teach here

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.790
care deeply about the teaching.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.900
And in fact, even some people
who don't put as much effort

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.860
into it as we might like, it's a
matter of competing priorities.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.420
It's not that they disparage
teaching in any way

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.260
or don't place a
high value in it.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.350
And, you know, it's
a tough thing to say.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.920
But I think most people really
do care here about teaching.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.370
But anyway, that was
an initial impression

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.190
based on my first
couple of years here.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:33.280
Now, I would say it has much
more to do with the challenges

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.570
in disseminating, in gaining
adoption of innovations,

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.000
and teaching on our campus.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.820
And I don't think it's
unique to Harvard.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.630
I think many of you are
familiar with the history of how

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.970
we created edX and
HarvardX, and I just

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.150
want to remind you that
we had three goals.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.920
One was to make
courses at Harvard

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.730
and other top institutions
available to everybody

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.100
with an internet connection.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.240
That's kind of the externally
facing goal that we had.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.210
The second was to
conduct research

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.420
into how people learn,
taking advantage

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.020
of this digital platform.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.220
And then, the third, which
actually in my role as provost

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.800
is the one that I would
put the most emphasis on,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.890
was to improve teaching
on our own campuses.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.570
In other words, to use our
investments in online learning

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.210
to improve face to face
teaching, the kind that

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.950
occurs on our campuses.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:42.620
And so for me, maybe
the biggest findings--

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.320
and you could say that's just a
nice way of saying frustration

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.790
with lack of progress--

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:52.010
has been in how these
technologies have had impact

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.400
or not had impact
on our campuses.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.870
And here, I really want to
focus on Harvard, of course.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.240
And, you know, you
think about the problem

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.820
that we set for ourselves is
we think we're experimenting,

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.770
coming up with new and
better methods for teaching.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:19.870
Why don't people adopt them,
these better new methods?

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.910
And I remember when we
started with edX and HarvardX,

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.860
the people who had worked
on teaching effectiveness

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.260
and how people
learn had a number

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.050
of very important findings
that could easily be applied,

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.770
and this entire
literature was largely

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.700
ignored by the pioneers
in developing MOOCs

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.027
and other forms of
online learning.

00:15:43.027 --> 00:15:45.110
So you start out with the
fact that there actually

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.630
was a good evidence base
that was, to a great extent,

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.290
ignored.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.690
Well, we'll set that aside, but
it's part of the same issue.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:00.100
And I would contend that
part of what we've learned

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.290
is that if you care
about teaching,

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.530
you also have strong
opinions about how to teach.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.860
And to get people to
adopt different methods

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.260
is not that easy.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.770
And I can't blame anybody
who teaches a course

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.260
for demanding a high
standard of evidence

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.600
before changing what they do.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.590
And in fact, when it
comes to online learning,

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.230
we have a number of
really, I believe,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.350
interesting and important
research results,

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.600
but I don't think we're yet
at the point-- and Dustin,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.980
you should feel
free to disagree.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.485
But I don't think we're at
the point where we can say,

00:16:37.485 --> 00:16:43.620
we absolutely know the best way
to organize an online course

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.840
so that people will learn.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.919
And I'm very much in the Gary
King camp about the importance

00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:50.460
and measurement and
so on, but I want

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.580
to point out that the greatest
barrier to measurement

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.520
is not so much obtaining the
measure, although, I have

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.860
to say that turned out to be
far harder than I imagined

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.580
at the beginning.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.130
That required changing
platform, making

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:09.069
all kinds of adjustments that
took time and a lot of effort.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.410
The biggest issue
is agreeing on what

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.810
is your measure of success.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.869
What are the
outcomes to measure?

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.300
And I was struck by what
you said about you could

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.530
see in the students' faces.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.869
Well, that is one
kind of outcome.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:25.800
But what if you're interested--

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.420
what if you're interested
in how much people

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.850
can apply the results
of their learning

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.560
a year after they have
completed a course?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.650
You don't get immediate
feedback on that by definition.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.310
It's not obvious
how to measure it.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.690
And the studies
that have been done

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.370
are discouraging,
so I don't think

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.470
there's a lot of
enthusiasm for doing it.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.350
But, in fact, that's
a huge issue, right?

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.130
If we're going to
conduct research,

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.830
we have to decide what
outcomes really matter.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.970
And that's a very important
substantive question.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.020
So people require-- they
need to be convinced

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.510
if they're going to change
how they teach, especially

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.680
if, by their own beliefs,
they've been pretty

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.390
successful at how they teach.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.370
But I would add a
big part of this

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.730
is that the people
who care care deeply.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.630
And that doesn't only
lead to skepticism.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.290
It means that there are
coordination problems.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.414
You know, you might agree
with other approaches,

00:18:27.414 --> 00:18:28.830
what other people
are doing if you

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.630
didn't have that much at stake.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.400
In here, I have to
say, if you just

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.600
take a look at the last
few years at Harvard,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.230
we've had major
teaching initiatives

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.090
in multiple schools.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.470
To name a few, the
school of public health

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.170
developed a mostly
online master's

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.070
of public health program.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.400
The law school is
currently engaged

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.370
in a review of its
curriculum and anticipating

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.790
curriculum reform.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.910
And by the way, I
haven't seen a case

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.550
where a school engages
in curricular reform

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.530
without thinking
about how they teach.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.610
It's not just about
what the content is.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.690
The medical school
instituted yet

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.730
another new pathway
program, which

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.960
is really a major change
in how they teach.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.850
The ed school is reorganizing
its master's programs

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:26.470
after really extensive
community conversations.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:32.290
And within FAS, the reform
of the gen ed program,

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.340
the new gen ed, which I
think was probably at least,

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.020
what, a three year effort,
a very prolonged effort--

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.150
so there has been
a lot going on.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:48.870
And in every case, it's been
difficult. It's been difficult.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.960
And it has not been
difficult because of apathy.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.960
It's been difficult
because people care.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.270
So when we think about how we
apply what we're learning, how

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.060
we adopt innovations,
we have to also think

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.850
about what is the milieu.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.690
What's the environment?

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.960
What are the norms
within the schools?

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.960
How much authority do
faculty have over the courses

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.620
they teach?

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.750
And here, I have to
say, the business school

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:19.620
is really different from many
other parts of the university.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.110
You can think of the
business school and FAS

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.590
as being on somewhat different
ends of the spectrum.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.960
Well, in the business
school, some of the courses

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.660
are essentially
institutional, right?

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.930
The content may be changed a
little bit from year to year,

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.510
but it's about the course
rather than the faculty member

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.120
teaching it for some of
the core courses, where

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.320
in FAS, very often, it's
the faculty's creation.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.680
So as you can imagine,
to roll out innovations

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.440
and how that's taught requires
convincing and individual

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.580
faculty members.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.710
So that's what I think
is most important now.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:57.390
And I care about this
hugely because really, we

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:02.680
are at our core a residential
teaching institution.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.510
And if we're going to be
a successful university,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.790
we have to continue to improve
our teaching and learning.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:10.290
Thank you.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.490
It's interesting that in the
course of both of your comments

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.814
on the past seven years, how
much you wove in your thoughts

00:21:18.814 --> 00:21:20.730
about the future and
what you're excited about

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.010
and what you feel good about.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.010
Maybe we could just, inspired
by President Bacow's comments

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.950
this morning, kind of
pivot into situating

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.000
Harvard's efforts a little bit
more broadly within society.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.490
What excites you
about what we're

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.230
doing that will have an impact
beyond our own learners,

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.740
of course, or even our own
learners in online courses,

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.770
but even more generally?

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.110
How is Harvard going to be a
leader in the field of teaching

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.869
and learning for
society more generally?

00:21:51.869 --> 00:21:52.410
Or excuse me.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.510
Not necessarily a leader,
but also a partner.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.305
I think that was a big part
of President Bacow's comments.

00:21:57.305 --> 00:21:59.430
What are ways that we're
thinking about partnering?

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.971
What are the issues
that we're trying

00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:03.090
to solve in a more
general societal level?

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.490
Well, this is a great
question, Dustin.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.860
And I'd really like
to be able to draw

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.670
on the wisdom in
the room about that,

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.140
but I can say a little bit about
how we're thinking about some

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.030
of the issues.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.210
We believe-- and here, I think
I speak for the leadership

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.780
of the university, and that
includes many of the deans--

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.310
that we have an obligation
to society within the US

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.730
as well as overseas,
and we're very concerned

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.165
about the future of work.

00:22:32.165 --> 00:22:34.040
We're not the only ones
concerned about that,

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.620
obviously.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.030
But you think about people who
will lose their jobs because

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.140
of automation.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.250
And economists have a course
of debate about what happens

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.080
with technological change.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.690
Will there be new
jobs to replace

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.500
the ones that disappear?

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.700
And I'm generally in the camp
that answers that question yes.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.040
But for individuals,
there are individuals

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.120
who will lose their jobs.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.400
Unless they acquire an entirely
different new set of skills,

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.380
they're not really
going to be employable.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.130
And we feel that we need to
have something to offer there.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.430
We thought a lot about
using edX and maybe

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.920
HarvardX to help
with reskilling,

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.200
but frankly, you think about
what our strengths are.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.860
We're not going to replace
what a community college does.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.160
That's not our
comparative advantage.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.640
But one thing that
we do very well

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.960
is teach leaders
and teach teachers.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.090
And I think many of you
know this is Dustin's work.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:40.440
I believe that a huge fraction
of people who learn on HarvardX

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.060
are themselves teachers.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.730
It can be secondary
school teachers, sometimes

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.400
college teachers.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.970
And we really need
to think about how

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.500
we can up our game in
that regard and make sure

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.650
that we are contributing to the
solutions to these problems.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.220
Now, the reason-- one of
the reasons I particularly

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.566
appreciate your wisdom
is we don't really

00:24:07.566 --> 00:24:08.940
know how to do
that yet, but it's

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.350
a topic of very
active discussion,

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.980
and there are many people around
the university who care deeply

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.630
about this issue.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:20.100
And Larry going out to
Pontiac and to Detroit

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.030
has made a very public statement
that we care deeply about what

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.580
happens in parts of
the country that people

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.810
think we've ignored.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:32.550
The fact is we've never ignored
the heartland of the US,

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:37.292
but we have not trumpeted it
the way that we might have done.

00:24:37.292 --> 00:24:39.000
And I don't know if
Larry mentioned this,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.300
but when he went to Detroit
and Pontiac, basically

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.330
all of these leaders
he met with were alumni

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.090
of the college, of the ed
school, of the Kennedy School,

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.140
and so on.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.530
So we have a presence,
and we have an obligation

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.149
to contribute.

00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:56.690
Did you want to add
anything to that?

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.700
So maybe I'll come back to the
first part of your question,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.650
which is actually thinking
about opportunities

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.800
going forward as I
see it within Harvard,

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.170
just to make that more
explicit, and then

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.790
thinking beyond Harvard.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.080
So I have to say I'm excited
about what lies ahead of us.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.620
And maybe this is because
there's still 10 days before I

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.850
assume the new role.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.330
And, of course, you're
spending zero time on it now.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.870
Yeah.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.110
It's coming.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.900
But if I think about
the opportunities,

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.870
at least I'm sort of
mentally classifying them

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.677
into three or four.

00:25:34.677 --> 00:25:36.260
The first one has
to do with something

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:41.360
that came up this morning about
how do we even think about what

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.260
or when student
interactions occur with us.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.510
I think historically, we've
obviously thought about it

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:51.245
when students come to campus.

00:25:51.245 --> 00:25:53.060
It's a very different
way of looking

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.180
at how interactions
occur with us today, now

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.610
that we have digital learning.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.890
One of things that
several schools have now

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.470
seen over the last few years--

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.310
HBS.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.146
HMS.

00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:07.520
The Kennedy School is moving
in this direction of the law

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.720
school.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.420
Perhaps even FAS-- is
start to think about

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:16.530
what can we do to help students
before they come to campus.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.830
By the way, that's a
non-trivial task and impact.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.580
20% of our students don't know
the basic language of business

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.830
before they step foot
on the HBS campus.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.480
That was where we
focused our efforts.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.630
If we think about
prematriculations--

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.790
so this is now students' time
before they come to campus--

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.430
let's just, for the
sake of symmetry,

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.130
extend it to the other
end of the spectrum, which

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:42.084
is what happens in the 50 years
after they leave us on campus.

00:26:42.084 --> 00:26:43.500
And lifelong
learning is something

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.100
we've always aspired to
try and crack the code of.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.520
I think it's fair to say we have
not been as successful as we

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.790
would like.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.990
But now that we start
looking at the platforms

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.154
that we have built
around the university--

00:26:57.154 --> 00:26:59.070
and these are not just
asynchronous platforms,

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.660
but synchronous
digital platforms

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.820
where we are, in fact,
engaging with alums

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.200
in some interesting ways--

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.670
the potential there, I think,
is massive, absolutely massive.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.180
So that's sort of one
aspect, which is just looking

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.530
at time of these interactions.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.170
The second is-- and this is
picking up something that Alan

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.285
referred to--

00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:21.660
there's been a
lot of innovation,

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.630
actually, across the different
schools in different areas.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.850
So for instance, the HarvardX
content creation team,

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.200
which I'm now sort of
beginning to just appreciate--

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.470
the talent in that team
is pretty incredible.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.420
If we think about
the other parts

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.040
of what makes online
learning effective,

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.500
it's digital marketing.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.590
Well, we've started to build
out centers of excellence

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.730
in areas like DC
and other schools.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.240
If we think about
platforms, some of us

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.800
have actually built those.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.200
I think there could be
massive complimentarities

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.810
in actually starting to not
just share information and best

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:02.790
practices, but sharing
assets, fixed investments,

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.900
across the university.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.420
I mean, this is where one
plus one could equal three.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.960
The third is complementarities
between residential and online

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.090
and research and online.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.250
And both of these are sort
of typically considered

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.280
as the toughest nuts to crack.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.140
Let me just say why I'm
optimistic, actually,

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:21.640
which is--

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.090
I mean, take research
for a second.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:29.190
I think research has sort of
become cool in the last decade.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.450
And, you know, I don't know
if we call this the TED

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.542
effect or the Gladwell
effect, or call it

00:28:33.542 --> 00:28:34.750
whatever you want to call it.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:40.180
But people with
ideas have audiences.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.550
If we start thinking about what
we can offer to our faculty--

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:47.200
and this goes back to the
core strength of Harvard--

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.180
if we can offer
digital platforms that

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.540
actually allow them to
disseminate ideas, not just

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.670
courses, wow.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.182
There's a lot of
possibilities there.

00:28:58.182 --> 00:29:00.640
And this is one of the places
I'm beginning to think about,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.969
which is short form content,
not just 30 hour courses.

00:29:02.969 --> 00:29:05.260
I mean, one of the things
that some of you heard me say

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.210
is if we took pen to paper
and just asked the question,

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.174
"What's should
Harvard do online?"

00:29:10.174 --> 00:29:11.590
it would be a
complete coincidence

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.860
if the answer was 50
hour long courses, right?

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.200
That's just a mirror of
what we do residentially.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.960
There's so much more
we can do online.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.580
And the same for residential.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.630
I mean, now that we have digital
first platforms, you know,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.180
there are many ways to
integrate them with residential.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.680
I was talking with
Alyssa yesterday.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.260
Gen ed is going to
kick off next year.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.700
What if we actually just
took three or four courses

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.820
and we're very deliberate right
at the outset about saying,

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.030
can we carve out what the
blended version of this

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:47.050
might look like for
our on campus students?

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.730
So in a sense, I see
complementarities

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.790
across schools, over
time for learners,

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.590
between different activities.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.780
That's what I see.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.070
But the key point that
I'm trying to make

00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:00.280
is that oftentimes, we
can enable innovation

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.070
and improvements
by enabling others

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.740
who are operating at
so-called the last mile, which

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.480
is all the teachers.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.850
Sometimes, we can
actually engage in them

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.200
through deliberate
efforts to innovate.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.100
And I wouldn't understate
the importance of that.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.070
So that's why I'm
personally excited.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.220
You know, everything that
Alan has been talking about,

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.690
Larry's been talking
about in terms of you

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.190
now start looking
beyond Harvard.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.017
What can we do with
the school system?

00:30:27.017 --> 00:30:28.850
Not just higher education,
but K through 12.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.060
What can we do with
job retraining?

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.550
I mean, this
potential is massive.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.280
And at least mentally,
the model that I have

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.890
is not one where we go out
and create the solution.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.831
I think Larry used
the word humble.

00:30:41.831 --> 00:30:43.580
We ought to be a little
humble in thinking

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.900
about what we can do.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.910
But really thinking
of a wholesale model

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:51.020
where if we have done
something which deserves

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.270
or merits sharing
with the world, let's

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.890
partner with those who
are feet on the ground.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.190
You know, we have examples
already of this on campus.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.950
David Moss, who's
one of my colleagues,

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:05.045
was teaching a course to the
undergraduates on democracy.

00:31:05.045 --> 00:31:06.920
Some of the undergrads
went to him afterwards

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.790
and said, "You know what?

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.623
We'd love to share your
case-based materials

00:31:09.623 --> 00:31:13.060
with our high school
teachers in civics."

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.960
To cut the long story
short, David now

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.740
has a two-day residential
seminar with 150 high school

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.820
teachers every year.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.520
This is a multiplier effect.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.800
It's not trying to
say, let's go directly

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.020
to the learner with
these case materials,

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.840
but let's partner with
those who, in fact, do

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.004
this in the last mile.

00:31:31.004 --> 00:31:32.420
The same thing
with the ed school.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.260
I mean, the courses
that have been created,

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.350
one just got put out,
which was targeting

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.830
principals of schools.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.640
It's an online course.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.850
By the way, kudos to
everyone on that project.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.530
This is just spectacular by
any stretch of the imagination.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.570
I was speaking to
someone last month

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:55.011
who runs an organization
which coaches principals.

00:31:55.011 --> 00:31:56.510
Like, these are
people on the ground

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.140
in the schools who help them
on administrative skills,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.100
teaching, and so
on and so forth.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.710
And she was saying, "We don't
have any digital materials."

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:05.126
And I said, you
know, "Guess what?

00:32:05.126 --> 00:32:08.030
Our ed school just
created some."

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.957
Connected them.

00:32:08.957 --> 00:32:10.790
And there's massive
complementarities there,

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:11.550
as well.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.350
So, you know, start thinking
about the possibilities.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.260
And, you know, I'd say that when
we approach these much bigger

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.530
problems, at least
the way I'd love

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:24.440
for us to think about it is just
to be very clear about where we

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.590
want to play, how
we can play in a way

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:33.420
that amplifies, as opposed to
tries to do it on their own.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:33.920
Great.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.430
Thank you.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:35.790
So we have a couple
more minutes.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.206
I thought that it would be
nice to open it up to the crowd

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:42.010
and get a couple of
questions and some responses.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.547
Who would like to ask
our panelists something?

00:32:44.547 --> 00:32:45.920
Thank you.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.030
So I'd like to raise the
ugly issue of monetization.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.980
I come from a particular place.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.790
I was an early adopter and big
fan of Eric Mazur's learning

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:59.420
catalytics, and I still
use it, but it eventually

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.310
got sold to Pearson,
and now, we kind of

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.290
have to go hat in hand
to the people at Pearson

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.140
and say, you know, "I
teach in this course.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.140
I'm a Harvard professor.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.080
Can I get 30 seats
for this class?"

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.380
And so that kind
of changes things.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.540
And I'm just curious.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.031
I heard-- you know, at one
of these breakout sessions,

00:33:16.031 --> 00:33:17.780
I heard all of these
fantastic-- you know,

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.210
DART and all these great tools.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.550
And right now, they all
look like they're free,

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:26.180
and the question is how long
are things going to be free,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.810
and to what extent do they
have to become self-financing?

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.223
Dustin, you should
take that one.

00:33:34.223 --> 00:33:36.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.830
So it's a great question.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.190
I would note that I
believe historically

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.580
speaking, wasn't the learning--

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.602
that was funded by--
yeah, that's for HILT So

00:33:44.602 --> 00:33:45.810
look, let me put it this way.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.790
If you've got any problems with
Pearson, you just come to me

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.000
and I'll take care
of those bad boys.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.720
The enforcer.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.870
But it's a great question.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.000
I mean, I have to say,
as someone who has helped

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.570
create some of
those tools, someone

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.720
who helped create DART with
Daniel Seaton and others

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.850
and working in
partnership with Hewitt,

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:11.449
this is something that we
are building for the Harvard

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:15.770
community in some-- so DART is
just a platform that lets you

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.280
search through digital
content like HarvardX content,

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.900
preview it, embed it
into your Canvas course.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.420
dart.harvard.edu.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.040
Go for it.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.159
That was built, in
some ways, to leverage

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:32.690
a different investment that
was HarvardX, right, initially.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.100
And so that was--

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.900
how can we do more with what
we've already invested in?

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.020
So there's already, you
know, just multiplying

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:39.894
that investment here.

00:34:39.894 --> 00:34:42.889
But that is absolutely something
that, at least for the policy

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.810
matter, in my view,
would always be

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.070
available to Harvard faculty.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.199
It's Harvard content anyways.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.159
We want that content to be used.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.819
There's brilliant
content out there.

00:34:51.819 --> 00:34:53.360
There's brilliant
content that people

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.840
like Alyssa Goodman and
others are developing that are

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.830
useful for our classes.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.270
So that's something where
there's no question in my mind

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.390
that, you know, that's something
that for the Harvard community,

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.042
we want to be made available.

00:35:07.042 --> 00:35:08.750
It's also something
where we want to make

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.160
some of that open more broadly.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.940
But we have to be thinking about
sustainability, as well, right?

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.790
And if there are partner
institutions that,

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.480
for example, see value in
that technology in a way

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.610
that I see value
in that technology,

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:23.870
then they should chip in.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.390
Let's make the
product better, right?

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.330
That's a different
form of monetization.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.920
It's more of a
consortium type approach.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.460
But those are all things
that I'm certainly open to.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.880
And if you have a great idea
about a new ed technology

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.747
that you do want to
monetize, come to me

00:35:39.747 --> 00:35:41.330
and we'll try to
figure something out,

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.172
as long as I get a piece.

00:35:43.172 --> 00:35:44.630
Could I just add
something to that?

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.060
So what I actually appreciate
is that the debate today is

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.720
no longer what it was,
let's say, 10 years ago,

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.270
when at least sometimes,
the premise was everything

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.110
we offer online should be free.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.900
Right now-- now, if you
actually start digging

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:13.060
into that premise,
there's a reason

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.300
that people who advocate that
are seeing it, which is let's

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.830
make education accessible to
those who can't afford it.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:19.870
That's the premise.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:23.445
It's not that we don't have cost
that we don't need to cover.

00:36:23.445 --> 00:36:26.070
So I'm actually glad the debate
has actually moved beyond that.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.810
As I actually think
about the possibilities,

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.450
frankly, I think there's many.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:35.560
One of the reasons--

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.110
when we were thinking about
pricing five years ago--

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.480
this was the business
school courses--

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.990
a lot of people would
look at us and say,

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.696
"You guys must
have known exactly

00:36:44.696 --> 00:36:46.570
how to do the conjoint
analysis to figure out

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.330
that the optimal
price was $1,500."

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.460
We had no clue, OK?

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:56.350
The debates were ranging
from $50 to $5,000.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.100
Why $50?

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.620
Because we wanted to make
this accessible to people

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.780
who can't afford it.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.310
Why did we end up where we did?

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.140
Because this costs
massive amounts

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.460
of money to get this right.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.490
What was our answer?

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:14.300
The answer was $1,500, but $100
for those who can't afford it.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.800
And so financially,
it becomes, even

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.820
in the online market, a nice
way to price discriminate.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.300
You start taking that a
little further, I mean,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.220
there's a lot of
variation in the demand

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.940
for online materials.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.940
If you start looking at
organizations out there,

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.640
I mean, which is the online
ed tech company which

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.520
has a $5 billion valuation?

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.440
Does anyone know?

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.320
So there's a company called 2U.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.220
What is their model?

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.370
Their model is partnering
with universities like ours

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.670
to help us build the content,
and they would provide

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.560
the platform and the marketing.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.410
This is a $5 billion enterprise.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.200
It immediately starts raising
the question, hold on a second.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.991
Wait, if we have the platforms,
if we can do the marketing--

00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:03.490
I mean, you start seeing sort
of where this line of thinking

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.300
might go.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.880
Again, short form content,
there's a lot of opportunities

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.720
there.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.450
None of this is to say
that any improvements we

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.600
make in residential
should or will

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.890
end up with tuition increases.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.600
I think that's a non-starter.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.120
But, again, if we start thinking
about this as a portfolio,

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.570
at least I see a lot of
opportunity in terms of ways

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:29.630
to monetize that still allow us
to be very true to our mission.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.960
So I'm, you know-- again, it's
nine days before I take over,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.120
but I'm excited.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.950
Could I just add something?

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.100
I appreciate your
question, but I

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.990
wouldn't want us to focus solely
on sustainability and revenue

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.720
issues.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.010
There's a much broader
context that we should all

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:50.870
be thinking about,
and that is what

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.090
is the cost of
producing a Harvard

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:57.710
education in whatever part of
Harvard you're talking about.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:01.490
And I think most
people believe that we

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:05.550
don't have a very sustainable
model in terms of our costs.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.330
And here, I'm not talking
about our online endeavors.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:13.640
I'm talking about our core
business of educating students,

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.300
students who are resident here.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.900
And one of the promises
of online education

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.060
is that it will
improve productivity.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.720
And this includes hybrid
versions, the kinds of things

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.720
that we're doing in various
parts of the university, where

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.010
there is an online component.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:34.270
Many of you are
familiar with a study

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.900
that was carried out by Ithaca.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.680
It was a randomized
trial to look

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.910
at what the effects of a
mostly online versus purely

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:48.400
residential curriculum
were in a set of colleges.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.350
And it basically found that
outcomes were identical,

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.790
but it costs less to use
the online components.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.430
I would wager if you
did the same thing here,

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.630
you might find outcomes
are better in hybrid

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:08.440
and costs are also
higher, especially

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.700
if you account for time costs.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.510
And when you look
at most of what

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:19.150
we do in terms of pedagogical
innovation here at Harvard,

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.800
you're cost increasing.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.740
Just think about it
across various schools.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.820
Now, I don't want to name names,
but I'll go back in history

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.830
so I can name names.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.600
I remember when I
was on the visiting

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.680
committee to the medical school,
there was another curriculum

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.180
reform back then,
and it involved

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.060
many more teachers per student.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.930
And so I asked the person
who led the transformation,

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:45.960
I said, "Did you ever think
about a reform that might

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.000
actually lower your costs?"

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.790
And he looked at me like I
came from another planet.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.960
No, I just came
from the West Coast.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:59.040
But in any case, it was viewed
as kind of an odd question.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.650
Several of the schools
here have engaged

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.910
in reforms that will
predictably increase costs.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.360
VPAL office itself is
helping to move things

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.380
in the other direction.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.210
And here, I want
to call out DART.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:18.770
What you talked about, Bharat,
in terms of creating modules

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:24.120
in DART, which enables users
to find educational content

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.640
online, are both
ways that we can

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.070
avoid duplication of efforts.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.920
And all of these resources
have been out there,

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.250
but they haven't
been accessible.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.040
And this technology
makes it accessible.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.760
And I also want to
call out Dustin's work

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.320
with syllabus finder.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.440
I was actually just
putting together

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.920
a reading list for teaching
I'll be doing in the spring,

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.320
and I decided to
look up courses that

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.130
have anything to do with health
policy or the Affordable Care

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:54.030
Act.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.710
Now, I found a lot
of courses, and I

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:59.010
have to admit I only found
one new reference that I

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.430
wanted to use.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:04.060
But still, the fact that I
could do this with was huge.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.160
We have we're at the cusp
of having technologies that

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.891
enable us to increase
productivity,

00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:11.640
and the challenge that
we're going to face

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.520
is we want to increase
productivity in a way

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:19.710
that increases costs with the
hope of improving outcomes,

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:24.840
or in a way that enables
us to maybe reduce

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.540
the amount of expenditures
we have to make.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.690
This is not an imminent
problem for us, in some ways,

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:34.150
but guaranteed over a
five to 10 year horizon,

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.990
we're going to have to think
about this very, very hard.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:39.387
So we should stay
focused on that.

00:42:39.387 --> 00:42:41.220
Incidentally, you may
know there are studies

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.830
that show that
for undergraduates

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:48.540
at elite universities, even
the full tuition rate that we

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:53.820
charge covers an
estimated maybe 50% to 60%

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.890
of the actual costs of
educating the students.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.480
That's not a problem
that we're going

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.210
to solve purely by philanthropy
or whatever magic bullet people

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.410
may think we have.

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:06.450
But I just want
to point out VPAL

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.700
has been a leader in
thinking about how

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.490
to address these challenges.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.890
We might as well end
it on that one, then.

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:17.200
So I just want to wrap
up the day very briefly.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.320
And I want to actually
start with something

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.780
that Erin started
us off with, which

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:27.180
was an assumption that nobody
wants to be a bad teacher.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.150
And, you know, I actually--

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:33.704
I do think that
that is a correct--

00:43:33.704 --> 00:43:34.870
it's not just an assumption.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:38.460
It's almost sort
of like a lemma.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.450
It's so fundamental.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:44.110
And here's a couple of
data points for that.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.540
The first is that I think it is.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:50.280
When people are struggling with
being an effective teacher,

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.730
part of it is there are lots
of different constraints.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.870
Part of it is a
general understanding.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:57.270
It's hard.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.737
I mean, I've been teaching
now almost for 20 years.

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:01.320
Many of you have
been in the classroom

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.610
much longer than that.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.880
None of us walks around thinking
that we've figured it out.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.630
All of us are trying to explore.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:13.260
And that's just motivated by not
wanting to sort of contradict

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.880
that assumption, right?

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.910
There is something
very joyful in being

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.610
able to instruct a
group of people that

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.420
really is like no other thing.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.810
And it's also fun and engaging,
and you're with other people,

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:27.720
right?

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.510
I sit behind a computer
a lot, and that's

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:33.150
coding things and doing
sophisticated data analysis,

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:34.890
building technology tools.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:36.255
That's really not that fun.

00:44:36.255 --> 00:44:37.380
That's not that fulfilling.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.840
And the human dimension
of teaching is, I think,

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.490
a reason--

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.320
that's why we're in this.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.500
The other thing is, just to then
riff a little bit off of Erin,

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.450
part of this is about the
intentional university.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:53.730
I think it's helpful
to remind ourselves

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.830
that the notion
of intentionality

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.050
is not exclusive
of other things.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.980
I used to play a lot of
jazz, improvisational jazz,

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.380
some weird stuff
from the 70s, right?

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.057
I wasn't there, but it was
some pretty cool music.

00:45:07.057 --> 00:45:07.890
And there was a set.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:08.806
You know, you'd go in.

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:10.210
You'd choose a key.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.460
And then, you just go with it.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.930
And there's a rhythm,
and so on and so forth.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:14.850
And I wasn't that--

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:15.780
my friends were a lot better.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.154
And I was talking
to one of them.

00:45:17.154 --> 00:45:19.710
I'm like, well, how
do you approach that?

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.570
He's like, well,
I'm very intentional

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.220
about my improvisation.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.856
Well, what do you mean by that?

00:45:24.856 --> 00:45:25.980
Well, I'm very intentional.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.580
I listen to what
others are doing.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.080
I interpret.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.170
I try to feed new ideas
out to other musicians.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.010
They're listening
to it, et cetera.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:38.350
But all of that is a
very intentional process.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:42.680
It's not like they're just
stepping in and saying, hey,

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.470
this is what I'm going to
do sort of off the cuff.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:48.810
That is not how the production
of music was actually made.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.810
And I think teaching has
a lot of those flavors.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.280
It's good to innovate.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.900
It's good to fail.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.760
And, as Miles Davis
says, if you mess up,

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.800
do it again and call it jazz.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.160
And I think that's kind of
what we're up to in this.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:06.860
Finally, I'd just like to close
with how much it means to me

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.760
and I think Alan and Bharat
certainly, that all of you

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.550
keep coming back to
this convening event.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.250
This year was a record
number of attendees.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.860
Even at the lunch session,
we're at a record, as well.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.850
And that to me shows not only
interest, but dedication.

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.620
The HILT community
is a great community,

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.810
and I can't wait to continue
to interface with all of you.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.840
And with that, I'd like to
thank both Provost Garber

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.800
and incoming VPL Bharat
Anand for their time today.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.640
Thank you.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.690
