00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.300
Last time, in the good Star Trek movie...

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.020
Nothing that really connects to this one, so...

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.020
fuck it.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:19.340
[Kirk screams "KHAN!" over and over to the opening theme of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.660
And now The Next Generation team takes over the plots that don't make sense.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.280
This is Star Trek: Generations.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.120
Star Trek: The Next Generation was a big hit on TV for years.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.060
But in their first motion picture ride out,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.240
you get a pretty unbalanced, pretty nonsensical,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.600
and, at times, pretty annoying series of subplots that often result in this reaction:

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.360
DATA: I HATE this!

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.240
So, let's not waste any time. Let's see how their first attempt at filmdom went.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.000
We open with the voyages of the starship Korbel as we see it doesn't have a very long run.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.920
It's actually christening the new starship Enterprise,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.680
as retired Captain Kirk and...

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.780
whichever castmembers would work for scale...

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.360
show up to give their blessing.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.520
HARRIMAN: I just want you to know, how excited we all are,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.840
to have a group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.700
I remember reading about your missions when I was in grade school.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.100
KIRK: Oh really?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520
CAMERON: You're my hero.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.240
CHEKOV: I'd like you to meet the helmsman of the Enterprise-B.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.780
Ensign Demora...Sulu.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.200
SULU: It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.600
My father's told me some interesting stories about you.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.480
Yes...like how he originally wanted to be the captain of the Excelsior in Star Trek II, but you wouldn't let him,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.640
uh, how you didn't show up to Gene Roddenberry's funeral, that was pretty douchey,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.760
uh, and how you're just an all-around great big prick. It's a fascinating read.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.440
KIRK: When did he find time for a family?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.040
SCOTTY: Finding retirement a little lonely, are we?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060
You know, I'm glad you're an engineer.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.420
With tact like that, you'd make a lousy psychiatrist.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.200
[DING!]

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.780
[DING!]

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.360
[DING!]

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.180
[DING!]

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.360
(Awkward laugh)

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.400
(Laughing) I'm contractually obligated to like you.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
So as they go out on their first trip just for a routine test run,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.460
there's, say it with me now:

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.880
(Critic in unison with other voices)

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.400
I have trained you well.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.800
So, looks like an intergalactic tapeworm is threatening two ships,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.900
as Star Trek proves once again that ANYONE who is NOT Captain Kirk is a pure incompetent.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.100
Except for these guys, but let's face it, they kiss Kirk's ass all the time.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.840
HARRIMAN: Captain Kirk.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.080
I would appreciate any suggestions you might have.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.300
["Get Ready for This" by 2 Unlimited]

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.160
KIRK: First, move us within transporter range.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.420
Beam those people aboard the Enterprise.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.460
They'll tear us apart.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.740
Risk is part of the game if you wanna sit in that chair.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.200
CRITIC: Why do we let anyone, anywhere, do anything WITHOUT James T. Kirk?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.080
[Music stops]
They get close, and beam up as many of the survivors as they can.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.360
One of them is being played by Malcolm McDowell.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.520
Good to know Kirk saves someone who would just end up killing him in the end.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.160
SCOTTY: Antimatter discharge directly ahead might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.220
CRITIC: But there's some technobabble that needs to be resolved,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.640
so Kirk goes down below to partake in what Star Trek does best:

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.620
vent porn.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.740
KIRK: That's it!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.540
SULU: We're clear!

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.940
HARRIMAN: You did it, Kirk!

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.440
SCOTTY: Bridge to Captain Kirk.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.720
Captain Kirk, please, respond.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.280
CRITIC (as Kirk): Hey, Scotty. This is Captain Kirk saying, AHHHHHH!!

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.620
SCOTTY: Have Chekov meet me on Deck 15.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.260
CRITIC: So they see that Kirk has gone where most castmembers wanted him to go before,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.820
and we cut to years later.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.100
We see our new crew of the Enterprise on the holodeck -

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.040
still the most improbable of Star Trek inventions -

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.780
as we see they're partaking in the HMS Pina-Worf.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.500
(Crew cheers)

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.000
RIKER: Computer! Remove the plank!

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.300
PICARD: That's...retract plank, not remove plank.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.220
[WAH WAH WAH WAH!]

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.180
DATA: I must confess, I am...

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.380
uncertain as to why someone falling into freezing water...

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.820
is amusing.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.880
CRUSHER: Oh, it's all in good fun, Data.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.160
I do not understand.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.060
CRITIC: Oh, Data. You've only been here 12 seconds and already your bit is old.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.420
CRUSHER: Do something unexpected. Get it?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.420
DATA: Got it.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.520
(Crusher screams)

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.320
(Worf screams)

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.560
That was...

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.000
LA FORGE: NOT funny.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.860
Oh, no. You want unfunny? Wait until he gets the emotion chip.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.260
That's right, there's an emotion chip in this movie, a device that, well,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.580
is pretty much HUMANITY in a hunk of metal.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.980
Which Data now feels he HAS to put in,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.240
seeing how he did the UNSPEAKABLE crime of pushing someone into water.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.260
So yes, you could say that his growth spurned,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.560
from getting a woman wet.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.200
(Boos)

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.520
["Hello! Ma Baby" from "One Froggy Evening"]

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.460
But Captain Picard then finds out some devastating news that he decides to keep from most of the crew.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.660
RIKER: Looks like the observatory took quite a beating.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.120
PICARD: Will you begin an investigation? I'll be in my ready room.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.620
Sir?

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.320
-Make it so.
-I thought...
-Just do it!

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.200
CRITIC: Boy, dodging responsibility, being totally emotional and illogical?

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.040
He's acting like a real boss!

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.320
But they do find one survivor, though:

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.040
Malcolm McDowell's character, who we saw years before.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.560
SORAN: Soran. Dr. Tolian Soran.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.640
What? No Lord of the Rings clip?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.960
What?!

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.740
You mean for the four years I've been doing this show, I've played every single clip from the Lord of the Rings movies?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320
Well, great, now what am I supposed to do?

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.920
Oh.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.120
Um...

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.340
Ever notice how the Soran here sounds like the Sauron from...

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.440
the X-Men comics that was only around very briefly?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.920
Don't know how many of you remember that,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.600
you'd have to be pretty hardcore to get that reference...

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.020
["Hello! Ma Baby"]

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.940
But that's not important, we have Data's annoying emotion chip to exploit.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.800
DATA: I believe this beverage has produced an emotional response.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.520
GUINAN: Well it looks like he hates it.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.140
Ooh, yes! I hate this!

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.600
It is revolting!

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.400
More?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.380
Please.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.440
Well I guess it wasn't TOO bad, as long as they don't exploit it any more...

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.560
[Looney Tunes theme]

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.540
[Looney Tunes theme]
DATA: No, Geordi, I have not.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.540
[Looney Tunes theme]
Open sesame!

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.420
[Looney Tunes theme]
(Data laughing)

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.120
[Looney Tunes theme]
(Critic crying)

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.860
[Looney Tunes theme]
CRITIC: Yeah, they go on with this for a while.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.960
[Looney Tunes theme]
DATA: Very funny!

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.140
[Looney Tunes theme]
Mr. Tricorder.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.920
[Looney Tunes theme]
I love it!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.460
[Looney Tunes theme]
I cannot help myself!

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.040
[Looney Tunes theme ends]
(Data laughing)

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.560
Ok, did someone slip him the Rob Schneider chip 'cause I swear, I'm ready to smack him!

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.840
LA FORGE: Just see if you can help me get these panels open, will you?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.360
DATA (as Picard): Make it so.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.540
CRITIC: Ok, somebody please up the badass-ness of this movie.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.860
Thank you, McDowell.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.440
So Soran fights for his research and Data chickens out because of the emotion chip.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.820
But a Klingon ship appears and beams him out,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.080
while also attempting to kidnap Geordi.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.540
Yeah, I know, big shock, Geordi gets kidnapped in Star Trek.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.080
I'm sure they put him in a holding cell with Robin, April O'Neil, and Princess Peach.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.360
They start a poker game in every dungeon!

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.500
But, while that's going on, we do find out why Picard is so bummed out.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.280
PICARD: You never met my brother and his wife, did you?

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.620
TROI: No.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.560
Robert.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.200
So opinionated.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.100
So...

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.880
very gentile.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.980
What's happened?

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.420
Burned to death in a fire.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.560
Um...

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.680
["Hello! Ma Baby"]

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.920
Yeah...

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.200
Pretty heavy stuff to lay in the first Star Trek: Next Generation film.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.800
I wouldn't mind so much, except that, it's made even stranger by the fact that,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.960
they were only featured in one episode, are rarely referenced,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.000
and even here we just get a few sideways pictures of them.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.240
It's kind of odd to devote so much time to this when, really, we know so little about them.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.200
How are we supposed to get emotionally connected to characters that we never see in the movie,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.920
or only reference very briefly?

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.440
I mean...

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.960
(Phone rings)
Hold on one second.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.760
(Phone rings)

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.580
Hello?

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.360
Oh no!

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.080
My mother's uncle's nephew's father's brother's sister's cousin's son's grandfather's great aunt's niece just died?

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.140
MELISSA!!

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.400
(Crying)

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.000
Feel bad for me!

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.880
So we find out that Soran is teamed up with the Duras sisters,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.380
a duo of Klingon terrorists who are helping Soran out with his plan in exchange for his deadly weapon designs.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.340
Only one other person knows what Soran is looking for, and it turns out it's that chick from Theodore Rex.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.020
GUINAN: He just cares about getting back to The Nexus.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.040
PICARD: What is The Nexus?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.540
It's a doorway to another place that we call The Nexus.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.360
What happened to you?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.560
It was like being inside joy.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.820
Eeeewwww!

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.320
I had a feeling what they did behind the scenes at The View, but,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.760
EW!

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.580
The should call it "The EW!"

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.600
GUINAN: If you go,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.120
you're not gonna care...about anything.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.500
All you'll want is to stay in The Nexus.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.680
CRITIC (as Picard): Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find The Nexus. Sounds frickin' awesome.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.100
(Normal voice) So the captain and Data try to figure out where Soran is heading

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.240
using a room on the ship that they've never used before, and,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.760
will never use again. But it looks cool!

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.840
However, Data is having trouble handling his emotions.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.460
DATA: I cannot continue with this investigation.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.360
PICARD: Are you having some kind of malfunction?

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.300
No sir, I simply do not have the ability to control these emotions.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.560
Part of having feelings is learning to integrate them into your life, Data.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.300
PICARD: Though, no matter what the circumstances...
DATA: Sir, I cannot...

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.320
You will NOT be de-activated!

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.440
You're an officer onboard this ship,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.500
and I require you to perform your duty!

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.460
CRITIC: Just like the duties I dodged earlier because of MY emotional matters!

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.640
But I'm the captain. Nyah nyah, nyah nyah nyah!

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.420
So they find out that Soran's going to wipe out a star to change the direction of The Nexus,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.800
to make it come towards him,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.000
wiping out all other life inhabiting the planets in that solar system.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.960
They make their way there, but the Duras sisters threaten them with hostage Geordi.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.180
RIKER: You can't trust them. For all we know they killed Geordi, they might kill you, too.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.600
LURSA: We did not harm your engineer.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.500
Then return him!

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.560
B'ETOR: In exchange for what?

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.900
PICARD: Me. I will be your prisoner.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.220
But first, you must beam me to the surface so that I can speak with Soran.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.460
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.140
CRITIC: So...really with no plan in mind,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.440
they beam the captain down to the planet to talk to Soran while they beam Geordi back to the ship.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.000
Is there an amount of time he's gonna stay down there?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.780
Couldn't the Enterprise just beam him back later, seeing how they're more powerful?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.480
Is there a reason the uniforms suddenly don't match? Nothing's adding up.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.060
(as Geordi) Oh, it was terrible! They tried forcing my name to Toby!

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.560
(Normal voice) So Picard tries to reason with Soran,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.400
while, it turns out, Geordi's VISOR has been bugged with a camera

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.780
so they can figure out where's the best point to penetrate their shields.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.280
For God's sake, nobody checked him out beforehand?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.420
I can't go through airport security without having my BALLS touched,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.060
and yet they never inspected this guy who just came off an enemy ship?

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.100
Giving up our freedoms my butt!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.280
But hey, at least it puts Data in a better mood.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.180
RIKER: Can you find a way to scan for life forms?

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.900
DATA: I would be happy to, sir.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.980
I just...love scanning for life forms.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.200
(Singing) Life forms...
[Control panel beeps to a tune]

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.120
You tiny little life forms...
[Control panel beeps]

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.300
You precious little life forms...

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.400
CRITIC: It's sing-along time again.
You precious little life forms...

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.380
This side of the internet sing "Life Forms," this side sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat."

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.300
(Singing) Row, row, row your boat/Gently down the stream/

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.180
You tiny little life forms, do do do do do,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.280
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily/Life is but a/

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.460
You precious little life forms, do do do do do,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.580
Everybody, sing along!

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.720
I said sing along!

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.200
I'm not continuing the review unless you do!

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.560
Yeah, what are you gonna do, cut to commercial?

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.040
Dicks.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.500
So it seems Soran has placed a force field around his missile that's going to blow up the star.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.740
Uh, here's an idea, um, why don't you beam him inside the force field?

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.520
That shouldn't be too hard.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.600
(Crackle)

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.300
(as Picard) Number one.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.560
Thank you!

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.340
(Zap!)

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.000
(Normal voice) But he still tries to talk him out of destroying the star in order to get to The Nexus.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.000
SORAN: In the end, time is going to hunt you down.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.800
PICARD: It's part of the truth of our existence.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.800
What if I told you, I've found a new truth?

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.460
CRITIC: You know, Soran, I think you're making it more complicated than it needs to be.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.080
Blowing up stars, killing people, destroying planets;

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.800
you know where the Nexus is going. Couldn't you just save up your money and be like:

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.180
Shuttle please.
(Ch-ching!)

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.740
My God that was easy!

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.020
Hello, Nexus, how are you? Yay-hey-hey!

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.440
Is everyone's common sense in The Nexus, too?

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.620
But the sisters figure out how to penetrate the shields and attack the Enterprise,

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.600
who quickly tries to look for a way out.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.500
RIKER: Could the defective plasma coil be susceptible to some sort of ionic pulse?

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.080
DATA: Perhaps. Yes. Yes!

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.900
If we sent a low-level ionic pulse it might reset the coil and trigger the cloaking device.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.400
Yeah, yeah, I can't understand it either. I'll just sum up what it always is.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.600
(as Riker) Data, can we blah blah blah the technobabble?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.760
(as Data) Maybe. If we yada yada yada there's a chance it'll boomity-boomity.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.480
It's very unlikely that it'll humina humina, but we'll give it a shot and of course it'll work.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.740
(as Riker) All hands, brace for boomity boomity!

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.540
So they pull off the...humina humina,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.300
and the sisters are now defenseless.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.060
Roll the explosion from Star Trek VI to save money. Engage!

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.600
Now partake in a funny line for the trailer...

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.400
DATA: Yes!

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.080
...and we have our McDonald's commercial.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.960
DATA: Yes!

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.820
ANNOUNCER: McDonald's Star Trek meal, available for your kids now!

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.980
CRITIC: So Soran continues to listen to Picard pester him -

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.660
hey, here's an idea: lower the force field and shoot him -

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.740
but he does eventually find a way through and tries to stop him.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.580
Yeah, you know what you should have done? Lower the force field and shoot him.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.580
But, even bigger problems are happening.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.460
The ship was hit bad and they have to separate the Enterprise in order to survive.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.800
Yes, be sure to move the children you always bring on this constantly-attacked ship of peace.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.240
You know, if I so much as heard a Klingon say a bad word, I'd take my kid off.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.320
But in hindsight, we do see the real tragedy in all this chaos.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.980
The little girl's bear! No!

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.660
Oh, she doesn't go back for it, we never see it again, it's not even referenced.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.520
They just felt it was really important to show that a little girl lost her bear.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.900
Oh, the...bear-manity.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.600
Oh my God there it goes! There goes the bear! Oh my God goodbye bear, goodbye!

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.020
Oh the casualties of war!

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.580
We'll bury him next to Ballsack.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.680
[Choir singing]

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.320
Now, to be fair, the ship separating is not only a cool scene,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.760
but it also leads to one hell of an awesome crash.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.620
There are some of the best effects in Star Trek history.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.520
RAY STANTZ: Well that wasn't such a chore, now was it?

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.100
[DING!]

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.800
Oh great, now I ran that out. I gotta see more movies.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.440
But Soran does destroy the star, and The Nexus comes right at him and Picard.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.620
They get sucked into it, as the rest of the Enterprise and the planet get blown apart.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.320
We then see that The Nexus is, in fact:

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.040
Patrick Stweart doing another rendition of A Christmas Carol?

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.620
Oh, come on, guy, the tickets aren't selling anymore!

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.340
(Children showering Picard with affection)

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.020
No, it turns out The Nexus brings to life whatever your deepest dream is,

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.520
and Picard's is that his family is back to life and totally happy.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.120
But a shadow - whatever that means - of Whoopi Goldberg is there to tell him

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.100
that it's not all real and that he has a chance to still go back and save everybody.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.060
GUINAN: Well as I said, time has no meaning here.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.420
So if you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.620
PICARD: All right. I know exactly where I want to go:

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.580
to the mountain top on Veridian III, just before Soran destroyed the star.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.480
CRITIC: What? Why there?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.820
Why don't you go to where you first picked him up,

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.840
or when you decided to first go out there in the first place?

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.680
Fuck, why don't you go and save your brother's family while you're at it?

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.160
What's this shit about being put back in the moment you already know you lost in?

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.600
What are you, a moron?

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.400
Did everyone's brains just get beamed out of their heads?

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.420
PICARD: I have to stop him.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.560
But, I need help.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.160
CRITIC: Yes, the most physically-fit fighter the world has ever known...

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.400
or, William Shatner.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.140
Yeah. Th...that'll work.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.540
PICARD: I'm wondering,

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.080
do you realize...
KIRK: Hold on a minute.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.440
Do you smell something burning?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.900
CRITIC (as Kirk): By the way, I know a great place that does toupees.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.640
KIRK: Looks like somebody was trying to cook some eggs.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.100
It's all right; it's my house. At least, it used to be.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.720
I sold it, years ago.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.440
CRITIC: So...yeah, as we pretty much partake in somebody's fan fiction,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.480
Picard tells Kirk what's going on.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.760
PICARD: This isn't really your house.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.420
We are, both of us, caught up in some kind of temporal Nexus.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.060
KIRK: Dill.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.260
I beg your pardon.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.900
Dill weed. In the cabinet. Behind the oregano.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:55.240
[Star Trek: The Next Generation theme]
(Voice echoing) Behold: two of the greatest Starfleet captains of all time, making eggs!

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.960
Only one other thing could top off this epic pairing of awesomeness:

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.600
KIRK: Mmm.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.160
Toast! We have toast! Ladies and gentlemen, toast.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.040
Oh my God, I just soiled myself.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.000
[ST:TNG theme ends[

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.840
(Normal voice) So, definitely kind of a strange setup,

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.140
but it does lead to some interesting conflict.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.320
Kirk acknowledges that he wants to stay in his perfect past.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.780
PICARD: You're a Starfleet officer. You have a duty!

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.300
KIRK: I don't need to be lectured by you.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.640
I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was in diapers.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.340
YOU'RE in diapers!

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.860
KIRK: This time I'm gonna walk up these stairs,

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.660
march into that bedroom,

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.000
and tell Antonia I want to marry her.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.680
CRITIC (as Kirk): Remember all that stuff I said in Star Trek V about needing your pain and how we should embrace how it makes us who we are?

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.440
Total 180! I wish I'd slingshot around the sun YEARS ago and pulled this off.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.140
(Singing) Hello Nexus, I love The Nexus!

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.140
No responsibility, I'm gonna like it here.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.800
(Normal voice) But Kirk starts to realize just how unreal everything is,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.400
and that no fear and no remorse is not always such a hot thing.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.880
KIRK: Because it isn't real.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.900
PICARD: Come back with me. Help me stop Soran.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:14.020
You know, if Spock were here, he'd say that I was an irrational, illogical human being for taking on a mission like that.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.120
Spock was going to be here, but apparently they only gave him two lines, and so he said "live long and suck it."

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.400
That's my joke! First Family Guy, then Big Bang Theory, and now you, Critic!

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.380
Oh come on, there's enough memes on the Internet. What else have I stolen from you?

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.940
Well how about my voice for "Big Lipped Alligator Moment?"

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.980
Well, it's not like you really need the residuals or anything.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.700
Got me there!

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.120
CRITIC: So Kirk and Picard go back and try to stop Soran together.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:52.360
You do realize that, if you never go into The Nexus, you'd never be able to come back and do this properly.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.800
And here's another thing. It looks like things are going awry.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.740
Why don't they just let Soran continue with his plan and let The Nexus hit 'em?

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.180
They can just go back and try it again, can't they?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.800
Hell, they could do this for all eternity if they wanted until they get it right!

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.400
It's not like anything of major importance is lost this time around,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.740
just Captain Kirk.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.080
(Tom of Tom and Jerry screaming)

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.040
SORAN: Get away from that launcher.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.960
CRITIC (as Soran): I just wanted to go to the so' 'op.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.720
(Normal voice) So Kirk is lying under a bridge, dying, as he says his final words.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.480
PICARD: We made a difference.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.100
KIRK: Oh my.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.620
That's right. Captain James T. Kirk, with his very last breath, did, in fact,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.580
do a George Takei impression.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.460
GEORGE TAKEI: Ohhhh myyyy.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.080
You win, Georgie! You win!

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.840
So he buries him under some rocks -

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.920
not...sure if they get him later or anything -

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.700
and a shuttle comes to take Picard back to his ship.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.980
(as Picard) Well it'll be good to see the ship once again...AW DAMMIT!

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.660
Number One, I gave you two orders while I was gone:

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.180
don't blow up the ship and don't sleep with anything.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.660
I thought the latter would be more probable!

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.280
(Normal voice) But as we look through the wreck, Data finds one survivor that he holds very close to his heart:

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.360
DATA: Spot!

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.980
[Choir singing]
ANNOUNCER: Spot will live.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.620
(Squealing)

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.120
[Choir singing stops]

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.440
So the ship is destroyed, but the Trek lives on,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.540
as they beam themselves out and make their way back to spacedock.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.140
PICARD: Picard to Farragut.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.700
CRITIC (as voice over communicator):
What'd you call me?

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.840
PICARD: Two to beam up.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.120
CRITIC (as Picard): By the way, did I tell you I met Jim Kirk?

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.340
-What?
-Yeah, he's under a bunch of rocks.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.640
Geeks are gonna complain about it for years.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.260
So that's Star Trek: Generations. It makes no sense.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.440
And that really is the biggest problem of all.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.420
I can overlook some of the annoyances, as it does have some real good powerhouse scenes later,

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:15.260
but, the plot threads are so nonsensical that, it really does distract.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.080
It's all over the place. Some parts are good, some parts are bad,

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.000
I'm glad I saw it, but,

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.700
it could have been a hell of a lot better.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.460
But hey, on the plus side, Star Trek Month is almost over!

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.180
I have only one Star Trek movie left to review!

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.440
Do you know what that means?

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.040
No Linkara cameo!

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.920
I haven't seen him at all! Isn't that fantastic?

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.380
No Linkara! No bitching about the little technicals that that nobody cares about!

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.000
No talking about all the dumb little things that I don't give a shit!

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.320
It's all coming together!

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.800
It's not gonna happen!

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.040
There's gonna be no Linkara cameo at all, do you hear me?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.380
No Linkara cameo AT ALL...

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:21.340
[Star Trek II theme]

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.020
DATA: You tiny little life forms...
