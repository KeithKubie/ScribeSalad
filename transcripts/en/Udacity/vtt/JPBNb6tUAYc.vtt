00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, we certainly have to know the score.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We have to know how much is pending, because that's going to affect the score.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have to know what player is playing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now these things, what happened before, they might be interesting,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but they don't really help us to find the current state.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So those are unnecessary.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, the state's going to end up being something like a four tuple.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I've written it as p, me, you, pending, the player to move, that player's score,

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the other player's score, and the pending score that hasn't been reaped yet.
