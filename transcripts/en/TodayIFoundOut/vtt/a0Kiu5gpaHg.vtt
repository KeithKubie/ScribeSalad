00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:16.470
The Unusual Origin of 
Scrabble

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.010
There aren’t a great number of positive
things that can be attributed to the Great

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.010
Depression.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.119
However, Scrabble is a game that probably
wouldn’t have existed without it.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.460
It all began with an unemployed architect
by the name of Alfred Mosher Butts of Poughkeepsie,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.680
New York.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.480
Thanks to his excessive free time while unemployed,
he decided to invent a word game that was

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.550
inspired by anagrams and crossword puzzles.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.960
Butts’ decision to go with a word game was
partially from previous study he’d done

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.060
into popular games.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.750
In his 1931 paper, aptly titled “Study of
Games,” he noted that nearly all popular

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.001
games of the day were either strategy “move-based”
games, number games, or letter games, with

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.379
the former two being most popular.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.820
He felt that the third category had quite
a bit of untapped potential.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.860
A few years later, he put the finishing touches
on the prototype of his own letter-based game.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.140
Butts originally called his game ‘LEXICO’
and it didn’t require a board to play, simply

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.990
comprising of small cardboard squares with
letters on them; otherwise the game was very

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.659
similar to the modern version.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.719
The letters even had their signature point
values.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.500
He determined these values by performing a
frequency analysis on the alphabet from sources

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.360
such as the New York Times.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.649
In order to combat the lazy use of plurals,
he only included four ‘S’ tiles.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.850
By 1938, Butts changed the name of his game
to Criss-Crosswords and had added a 15×15

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.850
board.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.670
Although he personally developed multiple
sets in attempt to sell them to large game

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.369
manufacturers, he was unsuccessful in this
venture.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.280
An entire decade passed before Butt’s game
began getting any kind of recognition.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.499
Things changed when a Connecticut man by the
name of James Brunot happened to have a copy

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.729
of Criss-Crosswords and believed that it could
be commercially successful.

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.810
He subsequently bought the manufacturing rights
from Butts, on the condition that the latter

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.789
would get royalties on every copy sold.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.850
Once he owned the rights, Brunot decided to
tweak things somewhat, such as shifting the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.750
starting point to the middle, instead of the
top left corner, and renaming the game Scrabble,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.810
which means “an act of scratching or scrambling
for something” (from the Dutch “schrabbelan”).

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.290
He also re-designed the board slightly, including
coming up with the now familiar colour scheme.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.310
After perfecting the game, Brunot and his
wife setup shop in an abandoned schoolhouse

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.310
in Dodgingtown, Connecticut.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.709
Despite Brunot’s enthusiasm, only a couple
of thousand units were sold during Scrabble’s

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.310
first year of production.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.879
After expenses, this actually resulted in
a net loss of $450 that year (about $4,200

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.879
today).

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.360
Business remained slow until a couple years
later when Macy’s president, Jack Strauss,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.280
played the game while on vacation in 1952.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.360
Upon his return, he was shocked that his store
didn’t sell the game and proceeded to place

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.840
a large order.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.130
Apparently his hunch about the game was correct,
because within twelve months it was the ‘must

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.530
have’ game for most American households.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.799
Thanks to the huge surge in orders, Brunot
could no longer keep up with the demand, so

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.970
licensed the rights to game maker Selchow
and Righter.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.750
Two years later, sales of the game had risen
to over four million sets sold.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.650
Not bad for a game that Selchow and Righter
had previously rejected back when Butts was

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.680
the owner, as did Milton Bradley and Parker
Brothers.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.420
While you’ll often read that Butts ultimately
did not receive anything for the game he invented,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.710
this isn’t true at all.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.379
By the time Brunot sold the trademark rights
to Selchow and Righter (rather than just licensing

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:45.170
the game to them) in 1971, Butts’ had received
about $265,000 in royalties (approximately

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.189
$2 million today).

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.939
Brunot fared better walking away from the
whole thing with about $1.5 million (about

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.079
$11.5 million today).

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.439
The game was still going strong thirty years
after its big boom when Selchow and Righter

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.000
was sold to Coleco.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.569
Unfortunately, the latter company went bankrupt
shortly afterwards, but Scrabble was quickly

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.799
snatched up by Hasbro and later the international
rights were acquired by Mattel for $90 million.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.140
Today, Scrabble seems to be as popular as
ever.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.329
Besides its online and otherwise digital popularity,
it is estimated that roughly one third of

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.500
US households contain a physical copy of the
game, as well as a little over half of all

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.410
households in Great Britain.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.101
To date, over a hundred and fifty million
sets have been sold worldwide, making it one

00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:33.120
of the most popular board games of all time.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.710
Bonus Facts
• Leo Fender of Fender guitar fame was also

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.890
out of work thanks to the Great Depression
when he decided to start his own company,

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.850
Fender Radio and Record Shop.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.860
He was previously an accountant.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.220
Despite going on to be famous for his guitars,
Fender never learned to play the guitar, hiring

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.530
musicians to test out his designs instead.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.590
• Alfred Butts invented another game in
1985 which was rather aptly titled Alfred’s

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.670
Other Game.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:06.400
It still included words and points, but had
more of a solitaire type gameplay to it.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.770
• Besides inventing Scrabble and his other
game, Butts was also an amateur artist.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.770
The Metropolitan Museum of Art is in possession
of six of Butts’ drawings.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.250
• There was a Scrabble game show that ran
from 1984 – 1990.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.930
It contained a ‘crossword’ round and a
‘Scrabble sprint’ round to determine the

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.640
winner of that weeks show.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.840
The very existence of such a show may seem
strange, but there also used to be a Cluedo

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.370
game show in Australia and the UK during the
nineties.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:49.320
It was amazing.
