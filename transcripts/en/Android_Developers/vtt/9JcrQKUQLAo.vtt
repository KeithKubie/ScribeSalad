OMER PERCHIK: Hey, I'm Omer.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.060
I'm the Founder and
CEO of Any.DO.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.480
Any.DO is the world's leading
task management application

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.820
for mobile devices.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.990
Our mission is to turn every
day into a good day through

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.050
creation of day-to-day simple,
beautiful and fun life

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.540
management applications.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.240
Creating an app is not just
having an icon in the user's

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.370
home screen.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.980
It's about creating engagement
and getting the user to use

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.550
your app from different
parts of the OS.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.440
That's why we integrated our
app deeply to the OS, and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.620
created different ways for the
user to interact with our app.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.990
In most cases, people think
about opening an app

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.740
just for the icon.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.670
But in Any.DO's case, we deeply
integrated into the OS

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.080
in several ways.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.210
The first way was to integrate
with widgets.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.950
In the widgets, you can actually
see all of your tasks

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.230
that you have planned for today,
tomorrow, upcoming and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.840
someday, but you can even
mark them as complete.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.420
So just by clicking on one of
the tasks, you can choose and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.190
you can mark them as complete.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.429
The second type of integration
that we did in the active part

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:08.770
was to actually, in the
notification center, show all

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.170
the tasks that you have
planned for today.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.450
And you can easily scroll
between everything you have

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.550
planned or add a new task.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.770
We've seen that over 40% of
our users open the app not

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.965
through the icon, which means
that the integration with the

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:27.590
OS on the deepest level provides
a lot more engagement

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.160
than anything else.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.690
So to sum up, the Android
platform allows us to do a lot

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.960
of things to increase
users' engagement.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.180
We've managed to create an
experience in which the app is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.150
so deeply integrated to the
device where you feel as if

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.410
it's part of the OS.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.850
This allows us to create a great
user interface, a great

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.690
experience, and a better
usage from our users.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.940
Thank you, Android.
