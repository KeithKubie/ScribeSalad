00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:10.430
Why Do Some Coins Have Ridges?

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.530
Putting ridges on some coins in America got
its start back in the 1700’s.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.569
At this time, coins were actually made of
materials that were worth what the coin was

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:20.569
worth.

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:24.140
For example, a half dollar silver coin contained
fifty cents worth of silver.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.429
Likewise, a $10 gold coin contained $10 worth
of gold.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.050
As a consequence of this, people started to
shave off bits of these coins around the edges;

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.330
so now a $10 gold piece only contained, say,
$9.50 worth of gold.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.510
The payoff came from that if they were very
careful when they shaved the coins, it was

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.240
very difficult to tell that anything had been
shaved off, so they could still generally

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.370
get their $10 worth out of the now $9.50 piece.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.730
Over time, they’d collect the shavings and
when they had a large enough amount, go sell

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.730
them.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.900
Eventually, the government decided to do something
about this and one of the methods to combat

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.850
this practice was to add ridges to these coins;
something known as “Reeding” the coins.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.440
With the ridges on the edges, it became significantly
more difficult to shave anything off the coins

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440
without detection.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.340
They chose not to do so with smaller valued
coins that came out later, pennies and nickels,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.960
because the metals these coins were made of
weren’t valuable enough for shaving them

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.079
to be worth the effort.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.929
So that was then, why do they still do it
today when the coins are no longer made of

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:23.929
valuable metals?

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.840
Initially, supposedly it was because it was
easier and cheaper than modifying the existing

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.840
machinery.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.869
Today however, it is to help the visually
impaired to more easily distinguish between

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.890
coins of a somewhat similar size like a penny
and a dime.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.889
This is something unfortunately not done with
today’s American paper money, which is indistinguishable

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:46.639
to blind people without resorting to tricks
like folding them certain ways for different

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.729
bills, Braille money stampers, or much more
recently special apps which will identify

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:49.729
the bills for them.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.380
Excepting via an app, the blind still need
someone to tell them what the bill is in the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.090
first place when they receive it, so they
can do whatever they do to it to be able to

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.799
distinguish it later on their own.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.399
Although, supposedly the government is working
on this problem with one of the most popular

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.939
suggested solutions being to adopt the new
Canadian system of imprinting the bills with

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:27.730
Braille.
