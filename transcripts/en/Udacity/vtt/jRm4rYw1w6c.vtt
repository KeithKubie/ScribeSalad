00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.950
So the best way to answer this is to use

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.520
pop. Pop's the only thing we've seen that actually removes

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.990
elements from a list and it also has the property

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.690
that it returns that element. If we do tocrawl.pop() that'll get

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.270
us the last element in the tocrawl list. Remove that

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.920
element from the list tocrawl. And assign that to the variable

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.720
page. One important point to note is because we're getting

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.590
the last element first. What we are implementing is what's called

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.760
a depth-first search and that means that as we crawl webpages,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.450
If we had three links on the first page. Well, what's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.810
going to happen is we are going to follow that last link. We're

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.240
going to add the links that we find there to the page.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.110
Before getting to these links, well, we're going to follow this link,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.840
right? That's going to be the last link that we added. We're

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.480
going to follow that, we're going to get to that page, and we're

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.660
going to follow the last link on that page. So, this is why

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.700
it's a depth-first search. We don't get to look at the second

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.060
link on the first page until we've followed all the links that

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.840
we can reach from the last link on the first page. If

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.098
our goal was to get a good corpus of the web quickly,

00:01:03.098 --> 00:01:06.050
doing a depth-first search would probably not be the best way to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.580
do it. And some of the questions at the end of your

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270
homework, ask you to figure out ways to change the search order,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.870
that will give us a better way of capturing content on the Web.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.550
For now, we're going to be happy, and with the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.840
test site, it's enough to do a depth-first search. If

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.230
we can complete our search, no matter what order we

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.080
follow, we'll always find the same set of pages. If

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.140
we aren't able to complete the search, and with a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.940
real web crawler, there's far too many pages to wait

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.320
until we find them all to return a result, then

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.310
the order that we do the pages matters a lot.
