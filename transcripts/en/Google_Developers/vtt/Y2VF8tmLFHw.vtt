It's a beautiful day.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.790
We're being joined

Last year was the 10th year
since Google I/O started,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.540
and so we moved it closer
to home at Shoreline,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.190
back where it all began.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.690
It seems to have gone well.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.480
I checked the Wikipedia
entry from last year.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.680
There were some
mentions of sunburn,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.940
so we have plenty of
sunscreen all around.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.150
It's on us.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.440
Use it liberally.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.850
It's been a very busy year
since last year, no different

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.280
from my 13 years at Google.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.290
That's because
we've been focused

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.740
ever more on our core mission
of organizing the world's

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.120
information.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.610
And we're doing it for everyone.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.430
And we approach it by
applying [? deep ?]

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.230
computer science and technical
insights to solve problems

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.770
at scale.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.860
That approach has served
us very, very well.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.170
This is what allowed
us to scale up

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.360
seven of our most
important products

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.580
and platforms to over a billion
monthly active users each.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.920
And it's not just
the scale at which

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.230
these products
are working, users

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.490
engage with them very heavily.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.130
YouTube, not just has
over a billion users,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.210
but every single day, users
watch over 1 billion hours

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.770
of videos on YouTube.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.870
Google Maps.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.010
Every single day, users navigate
over 1 billion kilometers

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.520
with Google Maps.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.700
So the scale is
inspiring to see,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.480
and there are other products
approaching this scale.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.270
We launched Google
Drive five years ago,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.590
and today, it is over 800
million monthly active users.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.310
And every single week, there
are over 3 billion objects

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.220
uploaded to Google Drive.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.630
Two years ago at Google I/O,
we launched Photos as a way

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.840
to organize user's photos
using machine learning.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.600
And today, we are over
500 million active users,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.840
and every single day, users
upload 1.2 billion photos

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.520
to Google.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.200
So the scale of these
products are amazing,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.710
but they are all still
working up their way

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.520
to what's Android, which
I'm excited as of this week,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.460
we crossed over 2 billion
active devices of Android.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.800
As you can see, the robot is
pretty happy, too, behind me,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.400
so it's a privilege to
serve users of this scale.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.180
And this is all
because of the growth

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.520
of mobile and smartphones, but
computing is evolving again.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.810
We spoke last year about this
important shift in computing

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.860
from a mobile first to
a AI first approach.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.850
Mobile made us reimagine every
product we were working on.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.490
We had to take into account that
the user interaction model had

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.660
fundamentally changed,
with multi-touch, location,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.400
identity, payments, and so on.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.540
Similarly, in a
AI first world, we

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.200
are rethinking all our products
and applying machine learning

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.030
and AI to solve user problems.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.740
And we are doing this across
every one of our products.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.850
So today, if you
use Google Search,

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.700
we rank differently
using machine learning.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.010
Or if you're using Google
Maps, Street View automatically

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.210
recognizes restaurant
signs, street signs,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.250
using machine learning.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.590
Duo with video calling
uses machine learning

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.050
for low bandwidth situations.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.340
And Smart Reply and Allo last
year had great reception.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.810
And so today, we
are excited that we

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.540
are rolling out Smart Reply to
over 1 billion users of Gmail.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.280
It works really well.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.360
Here's a sample email.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.330
If you get an email like this,
the machine learning systems

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.520
learn to be
conversational, and it

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.180
can reply, I'm fine with
Saturday, or whatever.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.070
So it's really nice to see.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.820
Just like with every platform
shift, how users interact

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.830
with computing changes.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.840
Mobile brought multi-touch.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.930
We evolved beyond
keyboard and mouse.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.530
Similarly, we now
voice and vision

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.170
as two new important
modalities for computing.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.500
Humans are interacting
with computing in more

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.210
natural and immersive ways.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.986
Let's start with voice.

00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:39.820
We've been using
voice as an input

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.460
across many of our products.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.770
That's because computers
are getting much

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.380
better at understanding speech.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.330
We have had significant
breakthroughs,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.220
but the pace, even
since last year,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.410
has been pretty amazing to see.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.010
Our word error rate
continues to improve, even

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.710
in very noisy environments.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.190
This is why if you speak to
Google on your phone or Google

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.350
Home, we can pick up
your voice accurately,

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.820
even in noisy environments.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.780
When we were
shipping Google Home,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.050
we had originally planned to
include eight microphones so

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.430
that we could accurately
locate the source of where

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.420
the user was speaking from.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.460
But thanks to deep
learning, we use a technique

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.080
called neural beamforming.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.290
We were able to ship it
with just two microphones

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.360
and achieve the same quality.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.780
Deep learning is what allowed
us about two weeks ago

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.500
to announce support for
multiple users in Google Home,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.090
so that we can recognize up
to six people in your house

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.090
and personalize the experience
for each and every one.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.430
So voice is becoming
an important modality

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.170
in our products.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.920
The same thing is
happening with vision.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.620
Similar to speech, we are
seeing great improvements

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.190
in computer vision.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.430
So when we look at
a picture like this,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.430
we are able to understand the
attributes behind the picture.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.020
We realize it's your
boy in a birthday party.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.030
There was cake and
family involved,

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.710
and your boy was happy.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.830
So we can understand
all that better now.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.860
And our computer
vision systems now,

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.350
for the task of the
image recognition,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.620
are even better than humans.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.480
So it's astounding
progress and we're

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.130
using it across our products.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.040
So if you used the
Google Pixel, it

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.700
has the best-in-class camera,
and we do a lot of work

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.170
with computer vision.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.500
You can take a low light picture
like this, which is noisy,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:42.470
and we automatically make
it much clearer for you.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:47.000
Or coming very soon, if you
take a picture of your daughter

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.480
at a baseball game, and there
is something obstructing it,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.030
we can do the hard work
remove the obstruction--

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.871
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:55.370
--and--

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.440
--have the picture of what
matters to you in front of you.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.330
We are clearly at an
inflection point with vision,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.700
and so today, we are
announcing a new initiative

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.780
called Google Lens.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.430
Google Lens is a set of
vision-based computing

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.750
capabilities that can understand
what you're looking at

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.390
and help you take action
based on that information.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.190
We'll ship it first in
Google Assistant and Photos,

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.250
and it'll come to
other products.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.892
So how does it work?

00:11:29.892 --> 00:11:31.600
So for example, if
you run into something

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.550
and you want to know
what it is, say,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.610
a flower, you can invoke Google
Lens from your Assistant,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.540
point your phone at it, and we
can tell you what flower it is.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.254
It's great for someone
like me with allergies.

00:11:43.254 --> 00:11:44.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.200
Or if you've ever been
at a friend's place

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.180
and you have
crawled under a desk

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.089
just to get the username and
password from a Wi-Fi router,

00:11:53.089 --> 00:11:54.380
you can point your phone at it.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.860
And we can automatically
do the hard work for you.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.410
Or if you're walking
in a street downtown

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.900
and you see a set of
restaurants across you,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.460
you can point your phone.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.610
Because we know where you are
and we have our Knowledge Graph

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.320
and we know what
you're looking at,

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.450
we can give you the
right information

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.980
in a meaningful way.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.250
As you can see, we're
beginning to understand

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.670
images and videos.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.120
All of Google was built because
we started understanding

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.770
text and web pages.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.790
So the fact that computers can
understand images and videos

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:39.690
has profound implications
for our core mission.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.120
When we started
working on Search,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.310
we wanted to do it at scale.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:49.230
This is why we rethought our
computational architecture.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.960
We designed our data
centers from the ground up.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.410
And we put a lot
of effort in them.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.100
Now that we are evolving for
this machine learning and AI

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.420
world, we are rethinking our
computational architecture

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.480
again.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.930
We are building what we think
of as AI first data centers.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.050
This is why last year,
we launched the tensor

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.620
processing units.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.790
They are custom hardware
for machine learning.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.380
They were about 15 to 30 times
faster and 30 to 80 times more

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.160
power efficient than CPUs
and GPUs at that time.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.760
We use TPUs across
all our products,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.960
every time you do a search,
every time you speak to Google.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.940
In fact, TPUs are what powered
AlphaGo in its historic match

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.160
against Lee Sedol.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.860
I see now machine learning
as two components.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.320
Training, that is, how
we build the neural net.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.470
Training is very
computationally intensive,

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.580
and inference is what
we do at real time,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.490
so that when you
show it a picture,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.140
we'd recognize whether it's
a dog or a cat, and so on.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.680
Last year's TPU were
optimized for inference.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.620
Training is computationally
very intensive.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.880
To give you a sense, each one of
our machine translation models

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.110
takes a training of
over three billion words

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.380
for a week on about 100 GPUs.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.080
So we've been working
hard and I'm really

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.580
excited to announce our next
generation of TPUs, Cloud

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.680
TPUs, which are optimized for
both training and inference.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.400
What you see behind me
is one Cloud TPU board.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.340
It has four chips in
it, and each board

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.880
is capable of 180
trillion floating point

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.990
operations per second.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.360
[WHOOPING]

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.740
And we've designed it
for our data centers,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.780
so you can easily stack them.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.430
You can put 64 of these
into one big supercomputer.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.910
We call these TPU
pods, and each pod

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:01.080
is capable of 11.5 petaflops.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.590
It is an important advance
in technical infrastructure

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.450
for the AI era.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.927
The reason we named
it cloud TPU is

00:15:09.927 --> 00:15:12.010
because we're bringing it
through the Google Cloud

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.130
Platform.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.900
So cloud TPUs are
coming to Google Compute

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.370
Engine as of today.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.166
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.310
We want Google Cloud to be
the best cloud for machine

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.550
learning, and so we want
to provide our customers

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.020
with a wide range
of hardware, be it

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.510
CPUs, GPUs, including the
great GPUs Nvidia announced

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.330
last week, and now Cloud TPUs.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.410
So this lays the foundation
for significant progress.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.390
So we are focused
on driving the shift

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.630
and applying AI to
solving problems.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.890
At Google, we are bringing
our AI efforts together

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.590
under Google.ai.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.300
It's a collection
of efforts and teams

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.960
across the company focused on
bringing the benefits of AI

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.730
to everyone.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.030
Google.ai will focus
on three areas,

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.750
state-of-the-art research,
tools, and infrastructure--

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.300
like TensorFlow and Cloud TPUs--

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.970
and applied AI.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.920
So let me talk a little
bit about these areas.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.670
Talking about research, we're
excited about designing better

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.520
machine learning
models, but today it

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.800
is really time consuming.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.970
It's a painstaking effort of a
few engineers and scientists,

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.700
mainly machine learning PhDs.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.150
We want it to be possible
for hundreds of thousands

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.280
of developers to use
machine learning.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.700
So what better way to do
this than getting neural nets

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.400
to design better neural nets?

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.890
We call this approach AutoML.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.610
It's learning to learn.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.350
So the way it works is we take
a set of candidate neural nets.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.690
Think of these as
little baby neural nets.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.660
And we actually use a neural net
to iterate through them till we

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.910
arrive at the best neural net.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.550
We use a reinforcement
learning approach.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.819
And it's-- the
results are promising.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.160
To do this is
computationally hard,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.400
but Cloud TPUs put it in
the realm of possibility.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.420
We are already approaching state
of the art in standard tasks

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.000
like, say, for our
image recognition.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.619
So whenever I spend
time with the team

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:23.710
and think about neural nets
building their own neural nets,

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.430
it reminds me of one of my
favorite movies, "Inception."

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.780
And I tell them
we must go deeper.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.584
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.480
So we are taking all
these AI advances

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.480
and applying them to
newer, harder problems

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.450
across a wide range
of disciplines.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.230
One such area is health care.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.040
Last year, I spoke about our
work on diabetic retinopathy.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.740
It's a preventable
cause of blindness.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.510
This year, we
published our paper

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.030
in the "Journal of the
American Medical Association,"

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.700
and [? verily ?] is working
on bringing products

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.870
to the medical community.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.710
Another such area is pathology.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.770
Pathology is a
very complex area.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.400
If you take an area like
breast cancer diagnosis,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.790
even amongst highly
trained pathologists,

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.770
agreement on some
forms of breast cancer

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.620
can be as low as 48%.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.350
That's because
each pathologist is

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.490
reviewing the equivalent of
1,000 10-megapixel images

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.470
for every case.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.160
This is a large data problem,
but one which machine learning

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.770
is uniquely equipped to solve.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.310
So we built neural nets
to detect cancer spreading

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.290
to adjacent lymph nodes.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.120
It's early days,
but our neural nets

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.870
show a much higher
degree of accuracy, 89%

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.050
compared to previous
methods of 73%.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:50.990
There are important caveats we
do have higher false positives,

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.460
but already giving this in
the hands of pathologists,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.920
they can improve diagnosis.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.380
In general, I think this is
a great approach for machine

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.590
learning, providing
tools for people

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.530
to do what they do better.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:08.770
And we're applying it
across even basic sciences.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.250
Take biology.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.100
We are training
neural nets to improve

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.760
the accuracy of DNA sequencing.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.910
[? Deep ?] [? Piriant ?] is a
new tool from Google.ai that

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.480
identifies genetic variants
more accurately than

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.910
state-of-the-art methods.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.750
Reducing errors is in
important in applications.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.850
We can more accurately
identify whether or not

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.940
a patient has genetic disease
and can help with better

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.330
diagnosis and treatment.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.220
We're applying it to chemistry.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.020
We're using machine
learning to predict

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.120
the properties of molecules.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.970
Today, it takes an incredible
amount of computing resources

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.100
to hunt for new
molecules, and we

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.900
think we can
[? accelerate ?] timelines

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.180
by orders of magnitude.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.960
This opens up possibilities
in drug discovery or material

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.370
sciences.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.530
I'm entirely
confident one day, AI

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:04.380
will invent new molecules that
behave in predefined ways.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.600
Not everything we are
doing is so profound.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.180
We are doing even
simple and fun things,

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.930
like a simple tool which
can help people draw.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.624
We call this AutoDraw.

00:20:14.624 --> 00:20:16.290
Just like today when
you type in Google,

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.670
we give you suggestions,
we can do the same

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.700
when you're trying to draw,
even I can draw with this thing.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.530
So it may look
like fun and games,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.630
but pushing computers
to do things

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.860
like this is what helps them
be creative and actually gain

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.380
knowledge.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.290
So we are very excited about
progress even in these areas

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.590
as well.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.280
So we are making
impressive progress

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.630
in applying machine learning,
and we are applying it

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:46.070
across all our products, but
the most important product

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.910
we are using this is for Google
Search and Google Assistant.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.620
We are evolving
Google Search to be

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.310
more assistive for our users.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.460
This is why last
year at Google I/O,

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.730

[APPLAUSE]

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.110
SCOTT HUFFMAN: Hey, everyone.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.110
Last year at I/O, we introduced
the Google Assistant,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.720
a way for you to have a
conversation with Google

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.210
to get things done
in your world.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.800
Today, as Sundar
mentioned, we're

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.720
well on our way,
with the Assistant

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.940
available on over
100 million devices.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.180
But just as Google
Search simplified the web

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.550
and made it more
useful for everyone,

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.130
your Google Assistant
simplifies all the technology

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.414
in your life.

00:23:01.414 --> 00:23:02.830
You should be able
to just express

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.870
what you want
throughout your day

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.030
and the right things
should happen.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.950
That's what the Google
Assistant is all about.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.175
It's your own individual Google.

00:23:11.175 --> 00:23:13.150
So that video we
saw really captures

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.040
the momentum of this project.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.250
We've made such big strides
and there's so much more

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.140
to talk about today.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.440
The Assistant is becoming
even more conversational,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.620
always available wherever you
need it, and ready to help

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.800
get even more things done.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.840
First, we fundamentally believe
that the Google Assistant

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.180
should be, hands
down, the easiest

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.320
way to accomplish tasks, and
that's through conversation.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.020
It comes so naturally to
humans, and now Google

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.290
is getting really good
at conversation, too.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.320
Almost 70% of requests
to the Assistant

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.360
are expressed in
natural language,

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.170
not the typical keywords that
people type in a search box.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:57.640
And many requests or follow-ups
that continue the conversation.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.370
We're really starting to crack
the hard computer science

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.500
challenge of conversationality
by combining our strengths

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.660
in speech recognition, natural
language understanding,

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.415
and contextual meaning.

00:24:09.415 --> 00:24:11.290
Now recently, we made
the Assistant even more

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.780
conversational, so each
member of the family

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.330
gets relevant
responses just for them

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.730
by asking with their own voice.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.610
And we're continuing to make
interacting with your Assistant

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.050
more natural.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.020
For example, it doesn't always
feel comfortable to speak out

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.720
loud to your Assistant,
so today, we're

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.860
adding the ability to type to
your Assistant on the phone.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.050
Now, this is great when
you're in a public place

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.330
and you don't want
to be overheard.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.050
The Assistant's also learning
conversation beyond just words.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.760
With another person,
it's really natural

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.920
to talk about what
you're looking at.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.830
Sundar spoke earlier about
how AI and deep learning

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.100
have led to tremendous
strides in computer vision.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.800
Soon, with the smarts
of Google Lens,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.770
your Assistant will be able to
have a conversation about what

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.290
you see.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.030
And this is really cool,
and Ibrahim is here

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.280
to help me show you a couple
of examples of what we'll

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.590
launch in the coming months.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.800
So, last time I
traveled to Osaka,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.900
I came across a line of
people waiting to try

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.225
something that smelled amazing.

00:25:13.225 --> 00:25:15.790
Now, I don't speak Japanese,
so I couldn't read the sign

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.080
out front, but Google Translate
knows over 100 languages,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.590
and my Assistant will help
with visual translation.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.770
I just tap the Google Lens
icon, point the camera,

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:31.180
and my Assistant can instantly
translate the menu to English.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.684
And now, I can continue
the conversation.

00:25:33.684 --> 00:25:35.350
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: What
does it look like?

00:25:39.234 --> 00:25:41.150
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: These
pictures should match.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.191
SCOTT HUFFMAN: All right.

00:25:42.191 --> 00:25:43.210
It looks pretty yummy.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.420
Now notice, I never had to
type the name of the dish.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.690
My Assistant used visual
context and answered my question

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.460
conversationally.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.350
Let's look at another example.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.050
Some of the most tedious
things I do on my phone

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:57.880
stem from what I see--

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.980
a business card I
want to save, details

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.770
from a receipt I need
to track, and so on.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.750
With Google Lens,
my Assistant will

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.110
be able to help with
those kinds of tasks, too.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.640
I love live music,
and sometimes I

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.150
see info for shows around
town that look like fun.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.000
Now, I can just tap
the Google Lens icon

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.060
and point the camera
at the venue's marquee.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.580
My Assistant instantly
recognizes what I'm looking at.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.360
Now, if I wanted to, I could
tap to hear some of this band's

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.660
songs, and my Assistant offers
other helpful suggestions

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.430
right in the viewfinder.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.530
There's one to buy
tickets from Ticketmaster,

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.170
and another to add the
show to my calendar.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.230
With just a tap, my Assistant
adds the concert details

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.639
to my schedule.

00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:40.930
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Saving event.

00:26:43.872 --> 00:26:44.830

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.850
My Assistant will help me
keep track of the event,

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.470
so I won't miss the
show, and I didn't

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.500
have to open a bunch of
apps or type anything.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.376
Thanks Ibrahim.

00:26:55.376 --> 00:26:57.250
So that's how the
Assistant is getting better

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.600
at conversation--

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.410
by understanding language and
voices, with new input choices,

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.290
and with the power
of Google Lens.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.670
Second, the
Assistant is becoming

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.700
a more connected experience
that's available everywhere you

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.880
need help, from your living
room to your morning jog,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.879
from your commute to
errands around town,

00:27:14.879 --> 00:27:16.420
your Assistant should
know how to use

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.245
all of your connected
devices for your benefit.

00:27:19.245 --> 00:27:21.620
Now, we're making good progress
in bringing the Assistant

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.280
to those 2 billion
phones, and other devices

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.570
powered by Android, like TVs,
wearables, and car systems.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.120
And today, I'm
excited to announce

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.460
that the Google Assistant is
now available on the iPhone.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.843
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:35.843 --> 00:27:37.230
Woo.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.270
So no matter what
smartphone you use,

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.030
you can now get help from
the same smart assistant

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.150
throughout the day at
home, and on the go.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.400
The Assistant brings together
all your favorite Google

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.110
features on the iPhone.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.320
Just ask to get package
delivery details from Gmail,

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.810
watch videos from your
favorite YouTube creators,

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.792
get answers from Google
Search, and much more.

00:27:58.792 --> 00:28:01.000
You can even turn on the
lights and heat up the house

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.980
before you get home.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.280
Now, Android devices and iPhones
are just part of the story.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.250
We think the Assistant should
be available on all kinds

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.650
of devices where people
might want to ask for help.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.840
The new Google Assistant SDK
allows any device manufacturer

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.900
to easily build the Google
Assistant into whatever they're

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.680
building.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.070
Speakers, toys,
drink-mixing robots,

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.380
whatever crazy device
all of you think up,

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.087
now can incorporate
the Google Assistant.

00:28:29.087 --> 00:28:31.420
And we're working with many
of the world's best consumer

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.850
brands and their
suppliers, so keep an eye

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.150
out for the badge that says,
"Google Assistant built-in"

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.000
when you do your holiday
shopping this year.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.630
Now obviously, another aspect
of being useful to people

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.670
everywhere is support
for many languages.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.880
I'm excited to announce
that starting this summer,

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.671
the Google Assistant
will begin rolling out

00:28:50.671 --> 00:28:53.170
in French, German,
Brazilian Portuguese,

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:57.220
and Japanese on both
Android phones and iPhones.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.930
By the end of the
year, we'll also

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.750
support Italian,
Spanish and Korean.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.480
So that's how the Assistant is
becoming more conversational,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.300
and how it will be available
in even more contexts.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.740
Finally, the
Assistant needs to be

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.680
able to get all kinds of
useful things done for people.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.310
People sometimes ask if
the Assistant is just

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.960
a new way to search.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.940
Now of course, you
can ask your Assistant

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.850
to get all sorts of
answers from Google Search,

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.250
but beyond finding
information, users

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.560
are also asking
the Assistant to do

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.690
all sorts of things for them.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.400
Now as you've already
seen, the Assistant

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.630
can tap into capabilities across
many Google Apps and services,

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.460
but Google's features are
just part of the story.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.330
We also open the Assistant
to third-party developers

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.570
who are building some
really useful integrations.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.970
I'll turn it over to Valerie
to share more about how

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.144
the developer platform
is getting stronger.

00:29:52.144 --> 00:29:54.112
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:54.112 --> 00:29:57.064
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:59.524 --> 00:30:01.850
VALERIE NYGAARD: Hi.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.976
OK, so with the actions
on Google Platform,

00:30:05.976 --> 00:30:07.600
it's been awesome to
see how developers

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.850
like you have been engaging
with the Google Assistant.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.360
Like honestly, you've built
some really cool integrations.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.850
Like, I can ask Food Network
about the recipe that's

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.380
on TV right now.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.110
I can work out with
Fitstar, ask CNBC

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.900
about the news, or
my husband and I

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.810
can play name that tune
with SongPop, which

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.680
he is surprisingly good at.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.810
Until now, these
experiences have

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.460
been available through the
Assistant on Google Home.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.100
But today, we're
also bringing them

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.800
to Android phones and iPhones.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.680
It's over 100 million
devices on Android alone.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.840
So now people can get
to Google features

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.520
and third-party
services from anywhere,

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.292
and they can even pick up where
they left off across devices.

00:30:50.292 --> 00:30:52.000
So, not only are
third-party integrations

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.760
available in more places.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.960
They'll be able to do more.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.150
Starting today,
actions on Google

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:02.120
will be supporting transactions.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.120
It's a complete end-to-end
solution for developers,

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:10.420
including payments, identity,
notifications, receipts, even

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.625
account creation.

00:31:11.625 --> 00:31:15.520
The platform handles
all the complexity.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.790
Let me show you
how one will work.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.680
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Hi, how can I help?

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.770
VALERIE NYGAARD: I'd like
delivery from Panera.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:25.440
PANERA: Hi, this is Panera.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.280
I'll need your delivery address.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.130
Which one can I get from Google?

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.470
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: We'll
go with 1600 Amphitheater.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.310
PANERA: What can I
get you started with?

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.726
VALERIE NYGAARD: I'll have the
strawberry poppy seed salad

00:31:36.726 --> 00:31:38.865
with steak instead of chicken.

00:31:38.865 --> 00:31:39.490
PANERA: Got it.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.560
How about one of
these cool drinks?

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.180
VALERIE NYGAARD: And here, I can
just swipe through my options.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.270
See what looks good.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.540
Agave lemonade.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.170
PANERA: Great.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.590
Are you ready to check out?

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.350
VALERIE NYGAARD: Yep.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:54.900
PANERA: OK, the total is $18.40.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.460
Are you ready to
place the order?

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.335
VALERIE NYGAARD: Yes.

00:31:57.335 --> 00:32:02.276
I'll just scan my fingerprint to
pay with Google, and that's it.

00:32:02.276 --> 00:32:03.214
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:03.214 --> 00:32:04.152
PANERA: Thanks.

00:32:04.152 --> 00:32:07.440
You're all set.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.180
VALERIE NYGAARD:
Yeah, super easy,

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.670
like I was talking to
someone at the store.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.170
So here I was a new
Panera customer.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.739
I didn't have to install
anything or create an account.

00:32:15.739 --> 00:32:17.280
You've also probably
noticed I didn't

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.890
have to enter my address
or my credit card.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:21.630
I just saved those
earlier with Google,

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.850
and Panera used
built-in platform calls

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:25.330
to request the information.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.950
Now, I was in control over what
I shared every step of the way.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:31.800
So--

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.690
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.580
VALERIE NYGAARD: [CHUCKLES]
The developer platform's also

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.640
getting much stronger for
home automation integrations.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.860
Actions on Google can now
support any smart home

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.950
developer that wants to
add conversational control.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.200
Today, over 70 smart
home companies work

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.140
with the Google Assistant,
so now in my Google Home

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.440
or from my phone, I can lock my
front door with August locks,

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.050
control a range
of LG appliances,

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:59.340
or check in on my son's room
by putting the Nest cam on TV.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.110
All right, now
that we're talking

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.930
about making your home smarter,
we also have a lot of news

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.840
to share today about Google
Home, our own smart speaker

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.240
with the Google
Assistant built in.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.794
Here to tell you more
is Rishi Chandra.

00:33:11.794 --> 00:33:14.703
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:15.203 --> 00:33:18.125
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.680
RISHI CHANDRA: Thanks, Valerie.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.730
You know, it's really
hard to believe

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.430
we launched Google Home a
little over six months ago,

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.830
and we've been really
busy ever since.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.680
Since launch, we've added
50 new features, including

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.920
some my favorites like
support for Google Shopping,

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.290
where I can use my voice
to order items from Costco

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.090
right to my front door.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.580
Or I can get step-by-step
cooking instructions

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.950
from over 5 million recipes.

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.970
Or I can even play my favorite
song just by using the lyrics.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:50.499
Now in April, we launched in
the UK to some great reviews.

00:33:50.499 --> 00:33:52.040
And starting this
summer, we're going

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.500
to be launching in
Canada, Australia, France,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.098
Germany, and Japan.

00:33:57.098 --> 00:34:00.086
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.320
And with support
for multiple users,

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.870
we can unlock the full
potential of Google Home

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:09.820
to offer a truly
personal experience.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.199
So now, you can schedule
a meeting, set a reminder,

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.210
or get your own daily
briefing with My Day

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.889
by using your own voice.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.739
And get your commute, your
calendar appointments,

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.340
and your news sources.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.179
Now today, I'd like you
share four new features

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.250
we'll be rolling out
over the coming months.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.440
So first, we're
announcing support

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.024
for proactive assistance
coming to Google Home.

00:34:32.024 --> 00:34:34.440
Home is great at providing
personally relevant information

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.300
for you when you
ask for it, but we

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.969
think it'd be even more
helpful if it can automatically

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:42.060
notify you of those timely
and important messages.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.820
And we do this by understanding
the context of your daily life,

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.940
and proactively looking for
that really helpful information,

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.868
and providing for you
and a hands-free way.

00:34:49.868 --> 00:34:52.409
So for example, let's say I'm
relaxing and [? playing game ?]

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:53.612
with the kids.

00:34:53.612 --> 00:34:56.070
Well, I can see that the Google
Home lights just turned on.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.364
Hey, Google, what's up?

00:34:57.364 --> 00:34:58.530
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Hi, Rishi.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.270
Traffic's heavy
right now, so you'll

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.110
need to leave in 14 minutes
to get to Shoreline Athletic

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.454
Fields by 3:30 PM.

00:35:05.454 --> 00:35:06.870
RISHI CHANDRA:
That's pretty nice.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.120
The Assistant saw the game
coming up on my calendar,

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.536
and got my attention
because I had

00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:12.070
to leave earlier than normal.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.195
So now, my daughter can
make it to that soccer game

00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:15.360
right on time.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.890
Now, we're going
to start simple,

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.860
with really important messages
like reminders, traffic delays,

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.500
and flight status changes.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.026
And with multiple-user
support, you

00:35:23.026 --> 00:35:25.650
have the ability to control the
type of proactive notifications

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.270
you want over time.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.600
All right, and second,
another really common activity

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.760
we do in the home today is
communicate with others.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.320
And a phone call is still the
easiest way to reach someone.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.394
So today, I'm excited to
announce hands-free calling

00:35:40.394 --> 00:35:41.310
coming to Google Home.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:44.118
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.430
It's really simple to use.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.520
Just ask the Google
Assistant to make a call,

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.720
and we'll connect you.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.360
You can call any landline
or mobile number in the US

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.540
or Canada completely free.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.300
And it's all done
in a hands-free way.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.384
For example, let's say I forgot
to call my mom on Mother's Day.

00:36:02.384 --> 00:36:03.800
Well now, I can
call her while I'm

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.829
scrambling to get the kids
ready for school in the morning.

00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:08.120
I just see and say, hey Google.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.340
Call mom.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.274
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Sure, calling mom.

00:36:11.274 --> 00:36:13.242
[RINGING]

00:36:15.702 --> 00:36:17.670
[RINGING]

00:36:19.638 --> 00:36:22.240
SPEAKER 1: So, you're
finally calling.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.317
Mother's Day was three days ago.

00:36:24.317 --> 00:36:25.900
RISHI CHANDRA: Yeah,
sorry about that.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.975
They made me rehearse
for I/O on Mother's Day.

00:36:27.975 --> 00:36:29.850
Speaking of which, you're
on stage right now.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:30.641
Say hi to everyone.

00:36:30.641 --> 00:36:32.386
SPEAKER 1: Oh, hi, everyone.

00:36:32.386 --> 00:36:33.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.740
RISHI CHANDRA: So, hopefully,
this makes up for not calling,

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.420
right?

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.920
SPEAKER 1: No, it doesn't.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.502
You still need to visit
and bring flowers.

00:36:40.502 --> 00:36:41.710
RISHI CHANDRA: OK, I'm on it.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:42.670
Bye.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.320
SPEAKER 1: Bye.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.890
RISHI CHANDRA: It's that simple.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.430
We're just making a standard
phone call through Google Home.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:49.910
So mom didn't need to learn anything new.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.060
She just needs to answer her phone.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.200
There's no additional setup,
apps, or even phone required.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.510
And since the Assistant
recognized my voice,

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.070
we called my mom.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.560
If my wife had asked, 
we would have called her mom.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.410
We can personalize calling
just like everything else.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.380
And now, anyone home can
call friends, family, even

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.520
businesses.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.685
Maybe even a local florist to
get some flowers for your mom.

00:37:12.685 --> 00:37:15.310
Now, by default, we're going to
call out with a private number,

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.980
but you also have the option
to link your mobile number

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.144
to the Google Assistant.

00:37:19.144 --> 00:37:20.560
And we'll use that
number whenever

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.270
we recognize your voice.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.420
So whoever you call [? must ?]
know it's coming from you.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.940
Now, we're rolling out
hands-free calling in the US

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.530
to all existing
Google Home devices

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.180
over the next few months.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.710
It's the ultimate
hands-free speakerphone.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.210
No setup required, call anyone,
including personal contacts

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:40.630
or businesses, and even dial out
with your personal number when

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.160
we detect your voice.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.770
We can't wait for
you to try it out.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.160
OK, third, let's talk a
little about entertainment.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.760
We designed Google Home
to be a great speaker, one

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.540
that can put in any
room in the house

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.090
or wirelessly connect to other
Chromecast built-in speaker

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:56.360
systems.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.570
Well today, we're
announcing that Spotify,

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.760
in addition to their
subscription service,

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.670
will be adding their free
music service to Google Home,

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.295
so it's even easier to play
your Spotify playlists.

00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:09.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.310
We'll also be adding support
for SoundCloud and Deezer

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.500
to the largest global
music services today.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.740
And these music
services will join

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.240
many of the others
already available

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.560
through the Assistant.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.080
And finally, we'll be
adding Bluetooth support

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.210
to all existing
Google Home devices.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.723
So you can play any audio from
your iOS or Android device.

00:38:28.723 --> 00:38:29.306
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:32.021
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.204
But Google Home can do
much more than just audio.

00:38:35.204 --> 00:38:36.620
Last year, we
launched the ability

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.960
to use your voice to play
YouTube, Netflix, and Google

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.261
Photos right on your TV.

00:38:42.261 --> 00:38:44.260
And today, we're announcing
additional partners,

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.003
including HBO NOW.

00:38:46.003 --> 00:38:49.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.950
So just say you want to watch,
and we'll play it for you

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:53.830
all in a hands-free way.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.350
With Google Home, we want to
make it really easy to play

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.570
your favorite entertainment.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.550
OK, finally, I want
to talk a little bit

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.820
how we see the Assistant
evolving to help you

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.570
in a more visual way.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.970
Voice responses are great,
but sometimes a picture

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:08.650
is worth a thousand words.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.410
So today, we're announcing
support for visual responses

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.150
with Google Home.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.959
Now to do that,
we need a screen.

00:39:15.959 --> 00:39:17.500
Well, fortunately,
many of us already

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.260
have a ton of screens in
our home today, our phones,

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.270
our tablets, even our TVs.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.010
The Google Assistant
should smartly

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.130
take advantage of all
these different devices

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:29.710
to provide you the best
response on the right device.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.720
For example, with Google
Home, I can easily

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.280
get location information.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:33.960
OK, Google.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.737
Where is my next event?

00:39:35.737 --> 00:39:37.320
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Your Pokemon GO hike

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.160
is at Rancho San
Antonio Reserve.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:39.370
RISHI CHANDRA: It's for my kids.

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.420
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: It's
at 11:00 AM today.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:40.820
RISHI CHANDRA: It's for my kids.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.319
Relax.

00:39:41.319 --> 00:39:42.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.470
But if I want to
view the directions,

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.591
the best place to do
it is on my phone.

00:39:46.591 --> 00:39:48.340
Well soon, you could
just say, OK, Google.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.259
Let's go.

00:39:49.259 --> 00:39:51.550
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: All right,
I'm sending the best route

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:52.134
to your phone.

00:39:52.134 --> 00:39:54.216
RISHI CHANDRA: And will
automatically your phone--

00:39:54.216 --> 00:39:56.470
and notify your phone,
whether it's Android or iOS,

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:58.240
and take you straight
to Google Maps.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.890
So you can glance at directions,
interact with the map,

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:02.320
or just start navigation.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.030
It's really simple.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.680
Now TVs are another
natural place

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.510
to get help from the
Google Assistant,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.930
and we've a great place to start
with over 50 million Chromecast

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.139
and Chromecast built-in devices.

00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:14.680
So today, we're
announcing that we'll

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.490
be updating Chromecast to show
visual responses on your TV

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.770
when you ask for help
from Google Home.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.440
For example, I can
now say, OK, Google.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.600
Show my calendar for Saturday.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.056
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Showing it on your TV.

00:40:28.056 --> 00:40:30.055
RISHI CHANDRA: It'll show
up right on TV screen.

00:40:30.055 --> 00:40:32.396
I'll immediately get
results from the Assistant.

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:35.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.990
And since the Assistant
detected my voice,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.680
we're showing my calendar.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.830
Others would see their
calendar by using their voice.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.081
We can personalize the
experience, even on the TV.

00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:49.080
They can continue to
follow-up the conversation.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.270
Looks like I have a
biking trip to Santa Cruz.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:53.206
What's the weather in
Santa Cruz this weekend?

00:40:53.206 --> 00:40:55.080
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: This
weekend in Santa Cruz,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.232
it will be clear and
sunny most of the time.

00:40:57.232 --> 00:40:58.690
RISHI CHANDRA: So
it's really easy.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.630
It's all hands-free.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.830
Your Assistant can provide
a visual response to a TV

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.047
to a lot of different
types of questions.

00:41:05.047 --> 00:41:06.630
We talked about how
easy it is to play

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.830
what you want to watch
on the TV screen,

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:11.367
but what about those times
you don't know what to watch?

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:13.200
Well, soon, you could
just ask, hey, Google.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.480
What's on YouTube?

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.730
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Here you go.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.750
RISHI CHANDRA: And it'll show
me my personalized results

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.990
right on the TV screen.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.448
If I don't like
any of the options,

00:41:20.448 --> 00:41:22.590
I can continue the
conversation with my voice.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.904
Show my Watch Later list.

00:41:24.904 --> 00:41:26.070
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: All right.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.251
RISHI CHANDRA: Play
"Send My Love."

00:41:28.251 --> 00:41:30.500
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Playing
"Send My Love" from YouTube.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.380
[MUSIC - "SEND MY LOVE"]

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:38.510
RISHI CHANDRA:
It's really simple.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.709
Again, no remotes
or phone required.

00:41:40.709 --> 00:41:43.250
In a short conversation, I found
something really interesting

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.550
to watch using Google Home.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.090
I can even do it
with other things.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:47.780
OK, Google.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.110
What's on my DVR?

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.360
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Here you go.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:50.930
RISHI CHANDRA:
Here we're showing

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.750
how it works with YouTube
TV, a new live TV streaming

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.150
service that gives you
live sports and shows

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.010
from popular TV networks.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.990
And YouTube TV
includes a cloud DVR,

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.030
so I can easily play
my saved episodes.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.430
Everything can be done
in a hands-free way

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.279
all from the
comfort of my couch.

00:42:06.279 --> 00:42:08.570
And over time, we're going
to bring all those developer

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:11.540
actions that Valerie had already
talked about right to the TV

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.200
screen.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.350
So we'll do even more over
time with Google Home.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.260
And that's our update
for Google Home.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.240
Proactive assistance will bring
important information to you

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.740
at the right time, simple
and easy hands-free calling,

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.020
more entertainment
options, and evolving

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.225
the Assistant to provide
visual responses in the home.

00:42:30.225 --> 00:42:32.600
Next up is Anil, who's going
to talk about Google Photos.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.546
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.380
ANIL SABHARWAL:
Two years ago, we

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.200
launched Google Photos
with an audacious goal--

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.390
to be the home for
all of your photos,

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.810
automatically organized
and brought to life

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:56.420
so that you could easily
share and save what matters.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.340
In doing so, we took a
fundamentally different

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.250
approach.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:03.320
We built a product from the
ground up with AI at its core.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.210
And that's enabled
us to do things

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.170
in ways that only Google can.

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.640
Like when you're looking for
that one photo you can't find,

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.500
Google Photos
organizes your library

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.170
by people, places, and things.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.710
Simply type, "Anil
pineapple Hawaii,"

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.116
and instantly find this gem.

00:43:21.116 --> 00:43:22.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.130
Or when you come home
from vacation, overwhelmed

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:27.200
by the hundreds of
photos you took,

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.540
Google Photos will
give you an album

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.540
curated with only the
best shots, removing

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.600
duplicates and blurry images.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.570
This is the secret ingredient
behind Google Photos,

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.420
and the momentum we've seen
in these two short years

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.680
is remarkable.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.190
As Sundar mentioned, we now
have more than half a billion

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:50.960
monthly active users, uploading
more than 1.2 billion photos

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.000
and videos per day.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.310
And today, I'm
excited to show you

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.830
three new features
we're launching

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:01.100
to make it even easier
to send and receive

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.670
the meaningful
moments in your life.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.740
Now, at first glance, it
might seem like photo sharing

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.222
is a solved problem.

00:44:08.222 --> 00:44:10.430
After all, there's no shortage
of apps out there that

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.980
are great at keeping you
and your friends and family

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.740
connected, but we
think there's still

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:20.570
a big and different problem
that needs to be addressed.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.434
Let me show you what I mean.

00:44:23.434 --> 00:44:24.100
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.200
- If there's one
thing you know, it's

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.420
that you're a
great photographer.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.020
If there's a second
thing you know,

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.241
it's that you're kind
of a terrible person.

00:44:32.241 --> 00:44:32.740
- What?

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.600
- Yeah, you heard me.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.910
The only photo of the
birthday girl in focus?

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:37.810
Never sent it.

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:39.580
The best picture of
the entire wedding?

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:40.980
Kept it to yourself.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.630
This masterpiece of
your best friend?

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.213
We were going to
send it, but then you

00:44:44.213 --> 00:44:46.240
were like, oh,
remember that sandwich?

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.920
I love that sandwich.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.552
If only something could say,
hey, Eric looks great in these.

00:44:50.552 --> 00:44:51.760
You want to send them to him?

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.590
And you can be like, great idea.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.880
Well, it can.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.030
Wait, it can?

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.530
Yup.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.627
With Google Photos.

00:44:59.627 --> 00:45:00.210
[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:03.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:06.920
ANIL SABHARWAL:
So today, to make

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.040
us all a little less
terrible people,

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.520
we're announcing Suggested
Sharing, because we've all

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.270
been there, right?

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:15.936
Like when you're
taking that group photo

00:45:15.936 --> 00:45:18.707
and you insist that it be
taken with your camera,

00:45:18.707 --> 00:45:20.540
because you know if
it's not on your camera,

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.640
you are never seeing
that photo ever again.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.020
Now thanks to the machine
learning in Google Photos,

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.910
we'll not only remind you so
you don't forget to share,

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.360
we'll even suggest
the photos and people

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.670
you should share with.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.780
In one tap, you're done.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.780
Let's have a look at
Suggested Sharing in action.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.660
I'm once again joined onstage
by my friend, and Google Photos

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.624
product lead, David Leib.

00:45:43.624 --> 00:45:45.944
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.210
All right, so here
are a bunch of photos

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:52.270
Dave took while bowling
with the team last weekend.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:53.870
He was too busy
enjoying the moment,

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:55.750
so he never got around
to sharing them.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.670
But this time, Google
Photos sent him

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.310
a reminder via
notification, and also

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:02.459
by badging the new Sharing tab.

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:04.000
The Sharing tab is
where you're going

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.130
be able to find all of
your Google Photos sharing

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:10.240
activity, and at the top,
your personal suggestions

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.140
based on your sharing habits and
what's most important to you.

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.270
Here is the Sharing
Suggestion that Dave

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:18.340
got from his day bowling.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.980
Google Photos recognized
this was a meaningful moment,

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.890
it selected the right
shots, and it figured out

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:27.490
who he should send it to based
on who was in the photos.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.130
In this case, it's Janvi,
Jason, and a few others

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.380
who were also at the event.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.760
Dave can now review
the photos selected,

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.340
as well as update
the recipients.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.150
Or if he's happy with
it, he can just tap Send.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:41.470
And that's it.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.590
Google Photos will even
send an SMS or an email

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.690
to anyone who
doesn't have the app.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.960
And that way, everyone can view
and save the full resolution

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.180
photos, even if they don't
have Google Photos accounts.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.940
And because Google
photo sharing works

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.730
on any device,
including iOS, let's

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.420
have a look at what
Janvi sees on her iPhone.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.840
She receives a notification,
and tapping on it

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.340
lets her quickly jump
right into the album.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.580
And look at all the photos
that Dave has shared with her.

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.560
But notice here at
the bottom, she's

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.440
asked to contribute the photos
she took from the event,

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.440
with Google Photos automatically
identifying and suggesting

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.000
the right ones.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.110
Janvi can review the suggestions
and then simply tap Add.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.500
Now all of these photos
are finally pulled together

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:30.870
in one place, and Dave gets
some photos he's actually in.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:36.310
Which is great, because a
home for all your photos

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:39.586
really should include
photos of you.

00:47:39.586 --> 00:47:43.280
Now, though Suggested Sharing
takes the work out of sharing,

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.710
sometimes there's a
special person in your life

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:48.640
whom you share just
about everything with.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.750
Your partner, your best
friend, your sibling.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.870
Wouldn't it be great if
Google Photos automatically

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:57.790
shared photos with that person?

00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:01.060
For example, I would love it
if every photo I ever took

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.510
of my kids was automatically
shared with my wife.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.870
And that's why today, we're also
announcing Shared Libraries.

00:48:10.818 --> 00:48:13.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.770
Let me show you how it works.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:21.210
So here, we're now looking
at my Google Photos account.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.070
&gt;From the menu, I
now have the option

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:24.690
to go ahead and
share my library,

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:28.080
which I'm going to go ahead
and do with my wife, Jess.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.960
Importantly, I have complete
control over which photos

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.490
I automatically share.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.920
I can share them all,
or I can share a subset,

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.770
like only photos of
the kids, or only

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:39.480
photos from a
certain date forward,

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.887
like when we first met.

00:48:40.887 --> 00:48:42.970
In this case, I'm going
to go ahead and share all.

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:43.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:46.710
[LAUGHS] We did not meet today.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:49.680
And that's all there is to it.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.460
I've now gone ahead and shared
my library with my wife, Jess.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.250
So, let's switch to her phone
to see what the experience looks

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:58.390
like from her end.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:01.680
She receives a notification,
and after accepting,

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.860
she can now go to see
all the photos that I've

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.020
shared with her, which she
can access really easily

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.000
from the menu.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.800
If she see something
she likes, she

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.510
can go ahead and
select those photos

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:16.040
and simply save
them to her library.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.200
We'll even notify
her periodically

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.780
as I take new photos.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.120
Now, this is great,
but what if Jess

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.580
doesn't want to have to keep
coming back to this view

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:29.170
and checking if I shared
new photos with her?

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:32.690
She just wants every photo
I take of her or the kids

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.360
to automatically be
saved to her library,

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.660
just as if she took
the photos herself.

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.280
With Shared Libraries,
she can do just

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:45.080
that, choosing to autosave
photos of specific people.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.900
Now, any time I
take photos of her

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.680
or the kids, without either
of us having to do anything,

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.910
they'll automatically appear
in the main view of her app.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:57.580
Let me show you.

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.860
Now, I couldn't justify
pulling the kids out of school

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.380
today just to have
their photo taken,

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.902
but I do have the
next best thing.

00:50:06.902 --> 00:50:09.758
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.850
Let me introduce you to
[? Eva ?] and [? Lilly. ?] All

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:19.030
righty here.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.290
So I'm going to go ahead,
take a photo with the girls.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:23.580
Smile, kids!

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.476
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:25.476 --> 00:50:26.776
Wow, fantastic.

00:50:26.776 --> 00:50:28.650
And since this is too
good of an opportunity,

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.150
I'm going to have to
take one with all of you

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.980
here, too, all right?

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.441
[CHEERING]

00:50:31.441 --> 00:50:31.940
Here we go.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.670
Woo!

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.660
Brilliant.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.810
All right.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.380
OK, so thank you, girls.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.540
Much appreciated.

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.650
Back to school we go.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.108
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:46.470
All right.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:49.710
So, using nothing more
than the standard camera

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.960
app on my phone, I've
gone ahead and taken

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:55.080
one photo with my kids and
one photo with all of you

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.430
here in the audience.

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.870
Google Photos is going to
back these two photos up.

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:00.682
It's going to share
them with Jess,

00:51:00.682 --> 00:51:02.640
and then it's going to
recognize the photo that

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.190
has my kids in them
and automatically save

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:08.520
just that one to her library,
like you can see right here.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.436
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.220
Now finally, Jess and I can
stop worrying about whose phone

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.230
we're using to take the photos.

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:23.260
All the photos of our family
are in my Google Photos app,

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:26.230
and they automatically
appear in hers too.

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.210
And best of all,
these family photos

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.340
are part of both of
our search results,

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.100
and they're included in
the great collages, movies,

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.820
and other fun creations that
Google Photos makes for us.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.970
But notice how only the
photos with the kids

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:41.980
showed up in Jess's main view.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.710
But because I shared my
entire library with her,

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:47.860
I can simply go to the
menu, and Jess can now

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.614
see all of the photos, including
the one with all of you.

00:51:51.614 --> 00:51:54.034
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:01.230
And that's how easy sharing
can be in Google Photos.

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.020
Spend less time worrying
about sharing your memories,

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.080
and more time actually
enjoying them.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.150
Suggested Sharing
and Shared Libraries

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:12.030
will be rolling out on
Android, iOS, and web

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.480
in the coming weeks.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.770
Finally, we know
sharing doesn't always

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:18.880
happen through apps and screens.

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.330
There's still something
pretty special about looking

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:24.750
at and even gathering around
an actual printed photo.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:28.300
But printing photos and
albums today is hard.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.020
You have to hunt across
devices and accounts

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.240
to find the right
photos, select the best

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.340
among the duplicates
and blurry images,

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.500
upload them to a
printing service,

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.230
and then arrange them
across dozens of pages.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.900
It can take hours of sitting
in front of a computer

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.060
just to do one thing.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.670
Thankfully, our machine
learning and Google Photos

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:49.890
already does most of
this work for you,

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:51.900
and today, we're
bringing it all together

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.910
with the launch of Photo Books.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:01.650
They're beautiful, high quality
with a clean and modern design,

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.020
but the best part
is that they're

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.020
incredibly easy to make,
even on your phone.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.260
What used to take hours
now only takes minutes.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.310
I recently made a book
for Jess on Mother's Day.

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:16.740
And let me show you just
how easy and fast that was.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.570
First, thanks to
unlimited storage,

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:22.350
all my life's moments are
already here in Google Photos.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:25.350
No need to upload them to
another website or app.

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:28.010
So I'll select a
bunch of photos here.

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.120
And the good news is I
don't have to figure out

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.370
which are the right photos
and which are the good ones

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.830
because this is where
Google Photos really shines.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.650
I'm just going to go
ahead and hit plus.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.732
Select Photo book.

00:53:39.732 --> 00:53:41.190
I'm going to pick
a hardcover book.

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:44.340
We offer both a softcover
and a hardcover.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.010
And notice what happens.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.920
Google Photos is going to
pick the best photos for me

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.650
automatically, automatically
suggesting photo--

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:53.580
40, in this case.

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.490
How awesome is that?

00:53:57.490 --> 00:54:00.490
And it's even going to go ahead
and lay them all out for me.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:03.090
All that's left for me to do
is make a couple of tweaks,

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.990
check out, and in
a few days, I'll

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:08.414
end up with one of these
beautiful printed photo books.

00:54:08.414 --> 00:54:11.246
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.720
And soon, we'll make it
even easier to get started,

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.540
applying machine learning
to create personalized photo

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.737
books you'll love.

00:54:20.737 --> 00:54:22.570
So when you go to Photo
Books from the menu,

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:25.420
you'll see pre-made books
tailored just for you.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.520
Your trip to the
Grand Canyon, time

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.010
with your family during
the holidays, or your pet,

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:33.460
or even your kids artwork,
all easily customizable.

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.130
We'll even notify you when
there are new Photo Books

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:37.591
suggestions.

00:54:37.591 --> 00:54:40.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:43.580
ANIL SABHARWAL: Photo Books
are available today in the US

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.620
on photos.google.com,
and they'll

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.830
be rolling out on Android
and iOS next week,

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:51.755
and will be expanding
to more countries soon.

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:54.605
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.040
I am really excited about this
launch, and I want all of you

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.790
to be the first to try it out.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:04.030
And that's why
everyone here at I/O

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:07.068
will be receiving a free
hardcover photo book.

00:55:07.068 --> 00:55:09.996
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.450
It's a great example of
machine learning at work.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.770
AUDIENCE: [? $10? ?] Take
that photo [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.250
ANIL SABHARWAL: So those are
the three big updates related

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.410
to sharing in Google Photos.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:28.700
Suggested Sharing, Shared
Libraries, and Photo Books.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.810
Three new features built
from the ground up with AI

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.160
at their core.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:37.670
I can't wait for all of you
to try them out real soon.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.400
Now before I go, I want to
touch on what Sundar mentioned

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.910
earlier, which is the way we're
taking photos is changing.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:48.080
Instead of the occasional
photo with friends and family,

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.820
we now take 30 identical
photos of a sunset.

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:55.100
We're also taking different
types of photos, not just

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.150
photos to capture
personal memory,

00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:59.230
but as a way to
get things done--

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.600
whiteboards we want to remember,
receipts we need to file,

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.760
books we'd like to read.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.730
And that's where Google Lens
and its vision-based computing

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:09.710
capabilities comes in.

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:11.570
It can understand
what's in an image

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:13.550
and help you get things done.

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:16.520
Scott showed how Google
Lens and the Assistant

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.330
can identify what you're looking
at and help you on the fly.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:22.310
But what about after
you've taken the photo?

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:24.590
There are lots of photos
you want to keep, and then

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:28.220
look back on later to
learn more and take action.

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.410
And for that, we're
bringing Google Lens

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.120
right into Google Photos.

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.130
Let me show you.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.330
So let's say you took
a trip to Chicago.

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:38.180
There's some beautiful
architecture there.

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.520
And during your boat tour
down the Chicago River,

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.560
you took lots of
photos, but it's

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.660
hard to remember which
building is which later on.

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.930
Now, by activating
Lens, you can identify

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:49.784
some of the cool
buildings in your photos,

00:56:49.784 --> 00:56:51.200
like the second
tallest skyscraper

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.145
in the US, Willis Tower.

00:56:53.145 --> 00:56:54.770
You can even pull up
directions and get

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:56.810
the hours for the viewing deck.

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:59.150
And later, while visiting
the Art Institute,

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:02.180
you might take photos of a
few paintings you really love.

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:04.970
In one tap, you can learn
more about the painting

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:07.130
and the artist.

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.290
And the screenshot that
your friend sent you

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:11.120
of that bike rental place?

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.210
Just activate Lens, and you
can tap the phone number

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:16.642
and make the call
right from the photo.

00:57:16.642 --> 00:57:19.594
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:25.570
Lens will be rolling out in
Google Photos later this year,

00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.810
and we'll be continually
improving the experience

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:30.010
so it recognizes
even more objects

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:32.720
and lets you do
even more with them.

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.032
And those are the updates
for Google Photos.

00:57:36.032 --> 00:57:38.978
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.248
Now, let's see what's
next from YouTube.

00:57:46.248 --> 00:57:49.122
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:57:54.757 --> 00:57:55.840
SUSAN WOJCICKI: All right.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.710
Good morning, everyone.

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:00.930
I am thrilled to be
here at my first ever

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:03.495
I/O on behalf of YouTube.

00:58:03.495 --> 00:58:04.348
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:04.348 --> 00:58:05.324
Thank you.

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.900
So that opening video
that we all just saw,

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:14.980
that's a perfect glimpse into
what makes YouTube so special--

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:19.360
the incredible
diversity of content.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.210
A billion people
around the globe

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:25.870
come to YouTube every
month to watch videos

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:29.110
from new and unique voices.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.210
And we're hard at
work to make sure

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:33.070
that we can reach
the next billion

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:37.360
viewers, which you'll hear about
in a later I/O session today.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.700
We want to give
everyone the opportunity

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.900
to watch the content on YouTube.

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.900
So, YouTube is different
from traditional media

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.940
in a number of ways.

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.230
First of all, YouTube is open.

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:55.810
Anyone in the world can upload
a video that everyone can watch.

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:59.790
You can be a vlogger
broadcasting from your bedroom,

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:03.060
a gamer live streaming
from your console,

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.590
or a citizen
journalist documenting

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:09.880
events live from your
phone on the front lines.

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.820
And what we've seen
is that openness

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.030
leads to important
conversations that

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:19.360
help shape society,
from advancing

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:24.400
LGBTQ rights to highlighting
the plight of refugees,

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:28.270
to encouraging body positivity.

00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:30.910
And we've seen in our
numbers that users really

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:34.540
want to engage with this
type of diverse content.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:39.760
We are proud that last year we
passed a billion hours a day

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:42.670
being watched on YouTube,
and our viewership

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:46.270
is not slowing down.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.220
The second way that
YouTube is different

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:53.050
from traditional media is that
it's not a one-way broadcast.

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:55.390
It's a two way conversation.

00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:58.600
Viewers interact directly
with their favorite creators

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.350
via comments, mobile live
streaming, fan polls,

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:05.980
animated GIFs, and VR.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.400
And these features enable
viewers to come together,

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:14.750
and to build communities
around their favorite content.

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:18.910
So one of my favorite stories
of a YouTube community

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:22.300
is the e-NABLE network.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.450
A few years ago, an
engineering professor

01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:30.700
named Jon Schull saw a YouTube
video about a carpenter who

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:34.420
had lost two of his fingers.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.940
The carpenter worked
with a colleague

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:42.250
for over a year to build
an affordable 3D-printed

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:46.180
prosthesis that would enable
him to go back to work.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.340
They then applied
this technology

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:53.690
for a young boy who was
born without any fingers.

01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:56.270
So inspired by this
video, the professor

01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:01.280
posted a single
comment on the video

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.340
asking for volunteers
with 3D printers

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:09.280
to help print
affordable prostheses.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.840
The network has since grown
into a community of over 6,000

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.000
people who have
designed, printed,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.940
and distributed these
prosthetics to children

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.179
in over 50 countries.

01:01:21.179 --> 01:01:24.173
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:28.664 --> 01:01:31.810
So today, thousands
of children have

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:36.310
regained the ability
to walk, touch, play,

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:39.430
and all because
of the one video--

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:43.000
one comment-- and that
incredible YouTube community

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.800
that formed to help.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.730
And that's just one example of
the many passionate communities

01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:54.380
that are coming together
on YouTube around video.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:56.590
So, the third feature
of this new medium

01:01:56.590 --> 01:02:01.000
is that video works
on-demand on any screen.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.690
Over 60% of our watchtime now
comes from mobile devices.

01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:09.460
But actually our
fastest growing screen

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:12.340
isn't the one in your pocket.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.480
It's the one in
your living room.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:22.070
Our watchtime in our living room
is growing at over 90% a year.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:26.560
So, let's now welcome Sarah Ali,
Head of Living Room Products,

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.430
to the stage to talk about the
latest features in the living

01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:31.255
room.

01:02:31.255 --> 01:02:33.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:35.215 --> 01:02:38.185
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.100
SARAH ALI: Thank you, Susan.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.430
So earlier today,
you heard from Rishi

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.470
about how people
are watching YouTube

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.080
on the TV via the Assistant.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.940
But another way
people are enjoying

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.160
video is through the
YouTube app, which

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.660
is available over half a billion
smart TVs, game consoles,

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.550
and streaming devices.

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:02.430
And that number continues
to grow around the world.

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:04.700
So, when I think
about why YouTube

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.130
is so compelling
in the living room,

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.470
it isn't just about
the size of the screen.

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:12.740
It's about giving
you an experience

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.620
that TV just can't match.

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:19.850
First, YouTube offers
you the largest library

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:21.980
of on-demand content.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.240
Second, our recommendations
build channels and lineups

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.670
based on your
personal interests,

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:31.130
and what you enjoy watching.

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:35.510
And third, it's a two-way
interactive experience

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:38.030
with features like
voice control.

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:41.330
And today, I'm super
excited to announce

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.820
that we're taking the
interactive experience

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:49.400
a step further by introducing
360 video in the YouTube app

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.910
on the big screen.

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:53.870
And you know that
you can already

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:57.800
watch 360 videos on your phone
or in your Daydream headset.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.050
But soon, you'll be
able to feel like you're

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:03.410
in the middle of the action,
right from your couch,

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:06.830
and on the biggest
screen you own.

01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:09.740
Now, one of my personal
interests outside of work

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.940
is to travel.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.070
And one place I'd
love to visit is

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.920
Alaska to check out
the Northern Lights.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.230
So, let's do a voice search.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:22.500
Aurora Borealis 360.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.000
Great.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.249
Let's choose that first video.

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:31.940
And now, using my TV remote, I'm
able to pan around this video,

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:35.270
checking out this awesome
view from every single angle.

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:39.880
Traveling is great,
especially when

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.080
I don't have to get on a flight,
but 360 is now a brand-new way

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.025
to attend concerts.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.860
I didn't make it to Coachella,
but here I can experience it

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:54.010
like I was on stage.

01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:56.650
And to enhance the
experience even further,

01:04:56.650 --> 01:05:01.060
we are also introducing
live 360 in the living room.

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:04.000
Soon, you'll be able to
witness moments and events

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.940
as they unfold in a new,
truly immersive way.

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:11.320
So whether you have a Sony
Android TV, or an Xbox One

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.900
console, soon, you'll
be able to explore

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.140
360 videos right from
the comfort of your couch

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.050
and along with your
friends and family.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.810
And now, to help
show you another way

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:25.480
we're enabling
interactivity, please join me

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.230
in welcoming Barbara McDonald,
who's the lead of something we

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:31.111
call Super Chat.

01:05:31.111 --> 01:05:33.035
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:05:33.035 --> 01:05:35.921
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.690
BARBARA MACDONALD:
Good morning I/O,

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:44.750
and to everybody
on the live stream.

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:48.830
As Susan mentioned, what
makes YouTube special

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:51.170
is the relationships
that creators are

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:53.960
able to foster with their fans.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.110
And one of the best ways to
connect with your fans is

01:05:57.110 --> 01:06:01.040
to bring them live, behind
the scenes of your videos,

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.800
offering up can't-miss content.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.190
In the past year, the
number of creators

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:12.210
live streaming on
YouTube has grown by 4x.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:15.540
This growth is
awesome, and we want

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.920
to do even more to deepen the
connection between creators

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.070
and their fans
during live streams.

01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:27.270
That's why earlier this year,
we rolled out a new feature

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:29.250
called Super Chat.

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:31.260
When a creator is
live streaming,

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:34.630
fans can purchase Super
Chats which are highlighted,

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:36.270
fun, chat messages.

01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:39.280
Not only do fans
love the recognition,

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.070
but creators earn
extra money from it.

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:46.190
In the past three
months since launch,

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:48.230
we've been amazed by
the different ways

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:50.600
creators are using Super Chat.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.960
Even April, our favorite
pregnant giraffe,

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.020
who unfortunately could
not be here with us today,

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:02.270
has raised tens of
thousands of dollars

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:05.440
for her home, the
Animal Adventure Park.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.240
But, OK.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.280
[CLAPPING]

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.571
OK, we can clap for that.

01:07:08.571 --> 01:07:09.071
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:10.364
[LAUGHS]

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.760
But enough talking from me.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.110
We are going to do a live
stream right here, right now,

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:21.470
to show all of you
how Super Chat works.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:25.520
And to help me, I am
very excited to introduce

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.450
top YouTube creators with
9 million subscribers

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:33.830
and over 1 billion
lifetime channel views.

01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:37.662
On the grass back
there, The Slow Mo Guys!

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:40.017
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

01:07:40.959 --> 01:07:42.210
GAVIN FREE: Hello, everyone.

01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:43.210
DANIEL GRUCHY: Wow, hey.

01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:43.940
Happy to be here.

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:45.750
How's it going?

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:47.500
BARBARA MACDONALD:
It's great to have you.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.350
So let's pull up
their live stream.

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:51.680
And just look.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.490
Chat is flying.

01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:56.650
Now, I love The
Slow Mo Guys, and I

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:59.780
want to make sure that
they see my message,

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:02.650
so I'm going to Super Chat them.

01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:03.970
Pulled up the stream.

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:08.740
And right from within live chat,
I am able to enter my message,

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:14.034
select my amount, make
the purchase, and send.

01:08:14.034 --> 01:08:15.530
Boom.

01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:18.890
See how much that
message stands out?

01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:20.600
And it gets to the top.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.879
It's cool, right?

01:08:21.879 --> 01:08:23.420
DANIEL GRUCHY: Yeah,
thanks, Barbara.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.189
It's actually lovely
at the minute.

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:27.606
Although, I feel like there's
a high chance of showers.

01:08:27.606 --> 01:08:29.689
GAVIN FREE: Very local
showers, like, specifically

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:30.455
to this stage.

01:08:30.455 --> 01:08:31.645
DANIEL GRUCHY: Very sudden.

01:08:31.645 --> 01:08:32.144
Yeah.

01:08:32.144 --> 01:08:33.649
BARBARA MACDONALD:
Ooh, I wonder.

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:34.910
I wonder.

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:39.740
Well, because we know developers
are incredibly creative,

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:43.790
we wanted to see what you can
do to make Super Chat even more

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.300
interactive.

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:47.870
So we've launched an API for it.

01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:51.229
And today, we're taking
it to the next level

01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:54.350
with a new developer
integration that triggers

01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:57.380
actions in the real world.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.609
This means that when a fan
sends a Super Chat to a creator,

01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:06.109
things can happen in real life,
such as turning the lights on

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:08.689
or off in the creator's
studio, flying

01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:11.149
a drone around,
or pushing buttons

01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:14.000
on their toys and gadgets.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.840
The Slow Mo Guys are going to
create their next slow motion

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:21.350
video using Super Chat's API.

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:24.800
We have now rigged things up so
that when I send my next Super

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.500
Chat, it will
automatically trigger

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:32.240
the lights and a big horn
in this amphitheater, OK?

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.800
And that is going to signal our
friends back there on the lawn

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.952
to unleash a truckload of water
balloons at The Slow Mo Guys.

01:09:41.952 --> 01:09:42.910

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:43.850
DANIEL GRUCHY: Yeah.

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:44.850
BARBARA MACDONALD: Yeah.

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.193
[LAUGHS]

01:09:46.193 --> 01:09:47.359
DANIEL GRUCHY: That's right.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:50.000
For every dollar, we're going
to take another balloon.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.544
So, more money
means more balloons.

01:09:52.544 --> 01:09:54.210
Although, I did hear
a guy over here go,

01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:55.960
oh, we're going to
really nail these guys.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.530
All right, that's going to
be at least $4 right there.

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:00.050
So, yeah.

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:02.900
Each dollar donated goes to
the causes Susan mentioned

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.660
earlier, the e-NABLE network.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:09.470
BARBARA MACDONALD: OK, so, how
much do you think we can send?

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:12.170
I can start at $1 and go
anywhere upwards from there.

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:13.700
So, it's for charity.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:14.810
How do we think--

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:15.610
$100.

01:10:15.610 --> 01:10:16.994

$500 for 500 balloons?

I can do that.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.350
OK.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.560
Thank you, everybody,
for your help.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.490
So this obviously just
scratches the surface

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:08.780
of what is possible using
Super Chat's open APIs.

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:11.960
And we are super excited
to see what all of you

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.580
will do with it next.

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.220
So Susan, how about
you come back out here,

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.211
and let's check out the

01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:44.850
Thank you, Barbara.

01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:46.860
I'm really happy to
announce that YouTube

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.230
is going to match The
Slow Mo Guys' Super Chat

01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:53.790

100x to make sure

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:56.190
that we're supplying
prosthetics to children

01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:57.840

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.840

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:10.130
So that 360 living room demo
and the Super Chat demo--

01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:12.710
those are just two
examples of how

01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:16.370
we are working to connect
people around the globe

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:18.500
together with video.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.660
Now, I hope that what
you've seen today

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.310
is that the future of media
is a future of openness

01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:27.290
and diversity.

01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:31.040
A future filled with
conversations, and community.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.490
And a future that works
across all screens.

01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:38.010
Together with creators,
viewers, and partners,

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:41.850
we are building the
platform of that future.

DAVE BURKE: Hi, everybody.

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:51.457
It's great to be here
at Google I/O 2017.

01:13:51.457 --> 01:13:53.040
As you can see, we
found some new ways

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.420
to hardware accelerate Android.

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.400
This time, with jet packs.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.840
But seriously, 2 billion
active devices is incredible.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.600
And that's just
smartphones and tablets.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.310
We're also seeing new momentum
in areas such as TVs, and cars,

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:10.740
and watches, and
laptops, and beyond.

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.240
So let me take a
moment and give you

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.290
a quick update on how Android
is doing in those areas.

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:19.370
Android Wear 2.0 launched
earlier this year

01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:22.760
with a new update for
Android and iPhone users.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.250
And with you partners like
Emporio Armani, Movado,

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:30.750
and New Balance, we now enable
24 of the world's top watch

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.190
brands.

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:33.330
Android Auto.

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:36.390
We've seen a 10x user
growth since last year It's

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:40.170
supported by more than 300 car
models and the Android Auto

01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:41.460
mobile app.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.646
And just this week,
Audi and Volvo

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:45.145
announced that their
next generation

01:14:45.145 --> 01:14:48.360
nav systems will be powered by
Android for a more seamless,

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:51.330
connected car experience.

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:52.500
Android TV.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.040
We partnered with over 100
cable operators and hardware

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.530
manufacturers around the world.

01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:02.040
And we're now seeing 1
million device activations

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.790
every two months.

01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:06.270
And there are more than
3,000 Android TV apps

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:07.800
in the Play Store.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.850
This year, we're releasing a
brand-new launcher interface,

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:14.910
and bringing the Google
Assistant to Android TV.

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:17.460
Android Things previewed
late last year,

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:20.670
and already there are thousands
of developers in over 60

01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:23.730
countries using it to
build connected devices

01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:27.090
with easy access to the
Google Assistant, TensorFlow,

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:27.960
and more.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.930
The full launch is
coming later this year.

01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:36.450
Chromebooks comprise almost 60%
of K-12 laptops sold in the US,

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:39.000
and the momentum is
growing globally.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.670
And now, with the added
ability to run Android apps,

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.640
you get to target laptops, too.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.130
Now, of course,
platforms are only

01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:49.530
as good as the apps they run.

01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:53.370
The Google Play ecosystem
is more vibrant than ever.

01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:57.360
Android users installed a
staggering 82 billion apps

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.070
and games in the past year.

01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:03.030
That's 11 apps for every
person on the planet.

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:05.070
All right, so let's come
back to smartphones.

01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:09.060
And the real reason I'm here
is to talk about Android O.

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:12.470
Two months ago, we launched our
very first developer preview.

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:15.509
So you could kick the tires
on some of the new APIs.

01:16:15.509 --> 01:16:17.550
And of course, it's very
much a work in progress,

01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:21.030
but you can expect the
release later this summer.

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:24.540
Today, we want to walk you
through two themes in O

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.620
that we're excited about.

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:30.990
The first is something
called Fluid Experiences.

01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:34.320
It's pretty incredible what you
can do on a mobile phone today,

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.044
and how much we rely on them
as computers in our pockets.

01:16:37.044 --> 01:16:38.460
But there are still
certain things

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.770
are tough to do
on a small screen,

01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:42.570
so we're doing a
couple of features in O

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:44.500
that we think will
help with this,

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.240
which I'll cover
in just a moment.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.470
The second theme is
something we call Vitals.

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:52.710
And the concept here is to
keep vital system behavior

01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:56.550
in a healthy state so we can
maximize the user's battery,

01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:59.560
performance, and reliability.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.310
So let's jump
straight in and walk

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:03.780
through four new
fluid experiences,

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.390
with live demos,
done wirelessly.

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:08.190
What could possibly go wrong?

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:09.030
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:10.530
All right.

01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:12.880
These days, we do a lot of
[? wants ?] on our phones,

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.782
whether it's paying
for groceries

01:17:14.782 --> 01:17:16.740
while reading a text
message you just received,

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:20.310
or looking up guitar chords
while listening to a new song.

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:22.740
But conventional
multi-window techniques

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.420
don't translate well to mobile.

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:27.450
They're just too fiddly to
set up when you're on the go.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:31.520
We think Picture-in-Picture
is the answer for many cases.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.820
So let's take a look.

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:36.210
My kids recently asked me
to build a lemonade stand.

01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:39.750
So I opened up YouTube, and I
started researching DIY videos.

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.490
And I found this one.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.500
Now, at the same
time, I want to be

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.690
able to jot down the
materials I need to build

01:17:45.690 --> 01:17:47.190
for this lemonade stand.

01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:49.950
So to multitask, all I do
is press the Home button,

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:52.440
and boom, I get
Picture-in-Picture.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.910
You can think of it as a kind
of automatic multi-window.

01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:56.910
I can move it out of the
way, I can launch Keep,

01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:58.159
I can add some more materials.

01:17:58.159 --> 01:18:01.110
So I know I need to get
some wood glue, like so.

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:04.110
Then when I'm done, I just
simply swipe it away like that.

01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:05.840
It's brilliant.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.010
Picture-in-Picture lets you
do more with your phone.

01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:10.770
It works great when
video calling with Duo.

01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.810
For example, maybe I
need to check my calendar

01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:15.417
while planning a
barbecue with friends.

01:18:15.417 --> 01:18:17.250
And there are lots of
other great use cases.

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:19.290
For example,
Picture-in-Picture for Maps

01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:22.500
navigation, or watching
Netflix in the background,

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.640
and a lot more.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.560
And we're also excited
to see what you come up

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.290
with for this feature.

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:30.270
We're also making
notification interactions

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:32.340
more fluid for users.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.990
&gt;From the beginning,
Android has really

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:37.080
blazed a trail when it comes
to its advanced notification

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.230
system.

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:41.460
In O, we're extending the
reach of notifications

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.430
with something we call
Notification Dots.

01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:46.650
It's a new way
for app developers

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:49.290
to indicate that there's
activity in their app,

01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:50.940
and to drive engagement.

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.660
So take a look.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.856
You'll notice that the Instagram
app icon has a dot in it.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.600
And this is it
indicating that there's

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.880
a notification
associated with the app.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.589
So if I pull down the
shade, sure enough,

01:19:01.589 --> 01:19:03.046
you can see there's
a notification.

01:19:03.046 --> 01:19:04.440
In this case,
someone's commented

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.270
on a photo I'm tagged in.

01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:09.770
What's really cool is I can
long press the app icon,

01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:13.334
and we now show the
notification in place.

01:19:13.334 --> 01:19:15.750
One of the things I really
like about the Notification Dot

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:18.810
mechanism is that it works
with zero effort from the app

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:19.590
developer.

01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:23.160
We even extract the color
of the dot from your icon.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.500
Oh, and you get your erase
the icon by simply swiping

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.890
the notification like that.

01:19:26.890 --> 01:19:29.490
So you're always in control.

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:32.730
Another great feature in O that
helps make your experience more

01:19:32.730 --> 01:19:34.706
fluid is Autofill.

01:19:34.706 --> 01:19:36.330
Now, if you use
Chrome, you're probably

01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:39.240
already familiar with Autofill
for quickly filling out

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.400
a username and
password, or credit card

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.690
information with a single tap.

01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:47.660
With O, we've extended
Autofill to apps.

01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.160
Let's say I'm setting up a
new phone for the first time,

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.680
and I open Twitter.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.070
And I want to log in.

01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:56.510
Now, because I use twitter.com
all the time on Chrome,

01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:59.850
the system will automatically
suggest my username.

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:00.990
I can simply tap it.

01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:01.770
I get my password.

01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:03.210
And then, boom.

01:20:03.210 --> 01:20:04.110
I'm logged in.

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:05.682
It's pretty awesome.

01:20:05.682 --> 01:20:08.598
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:12.470
Autofill takes the
pain out of setting up

01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:13.970
a new phone or tablet.

01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:15.860
Once the user opts
in, Autofill will

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.870
work for most applications.

01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:20.000
We also provide
APIs for developers

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.840
to customize Autofill
for their experience.

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.120
I want to show you
one more demo of how

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:30.650
we're making Android more fluid
by improving copy and paste.

01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:32.940
The feature is called
Smart Text selection.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.050
So let's take a look.

01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:37.190
In Android, you typically
long press or double

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:38.720
tap a word to select it.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.110
For example, I can open Gmail.

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:41.360
I can start composing.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.210
If I double tap the word "bite,"
it gets selected like so.

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:48.440
Now, we know from user
studies that phone numbers are

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.870
the most copy-and-pasted items.

01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:54.470
The second most common are
named entities like businesses,

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:56.410
and people, and places.

01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:59.889
In O, we're applying
on-device machine learning--

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:02.180
in this case, a [? feed ?]
[? for a ?] neural network--

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.550
to recognize these more
complicated entities.

01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:05.510
So watch this.

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:08.750
I can double tap anywhere on
the phrase, "Old Coffee House,"

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:10.700
and all of it is
selected for me.

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:13.952
No more fiddling around
with text selection handles.

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:16.808
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:20.380
It even works for addresses.

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.512
So if I double tap on the
address, all of it is selected.

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:24.220
And what's more--

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:26.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.312
There is more.

01:21:27.312 --> 01:21:28.770
What's more is the
machine learning

01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:30.940
model classifies
this as an address

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.770
and automatically suggests Maps.

01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:35.724
So I can get directions
to it with a single click.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.140
And of course, it works as
you'd expect for phone numbers.

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.725
You get the phone
dialer suggested.

01:21:39.725 --> 01:21:43.690
And for email addresses,
you get Gmail suggested.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:45.670
All of this neural
networking processing

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:49.180
happens on-device in real time,
and without any data leaving

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:49.810
the device.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:52.180
It's pretty awesome.

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.310
Now, on-device
machine learning helps

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:56.050
to make your phone smarter.

01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:57.940
And we want to help
you build experiences

01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.630
like what you just saw.

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:01.510
So we're doing two
things to help.

01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:03.580
First, I'm excited to
announce that we're

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:06.610
creating a specialized version
of TensorFlow, Google's

01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:08.680
open source machine
learning library,

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.290
which we call TensorFlow Lite.

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:14.620
It's a library for apps
designed to be fast and small,

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:16.960
yet still enabling
state-of-the-art techniques

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:20.030
like [? compnets ?] and LSTMs.

01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:23.560
Second, we're introducing
a new framework at Android

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.380
to hardware accelerate
neural computation.

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:29.350
TensorFlow Lite will leverage
a new neural network API

01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:32.530
to tap into silicon-specific
accelerators.

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:36.880
And over time, we expect to
see DSPs specifically designed

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.120
for neural network
inference and training.

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.160
We think these new
capabilities will

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.160
help power our next
generation of on-device speech

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:49.630
processing, visual search,
augmented reality, and more.

01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:52.120
TensorFlow Lite will soon
be part of that open source

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.640
TensorFlow project, and
the neural network API

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:58.280
will be made available later
in an update to O this year.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.430
OK, so that's a
quick tour of some

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:03.850
of the fluid experiences
in O. Let's switch gears

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:05.470
and talk about Vitals.

01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:07.270
So to tell you more,
I want to hand it over

01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:09.640
to Steph, who's been
instrumental in driving

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.300
this project.

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.276
Thank you.

01:23:11.276 --> 01:23:14.204
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:19.500
STEPHANIE SAAD
CUTHBERTSON: Hi, everyone.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:23.290
OK, so all the features
Dave talked about are cool.

01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:25.690
But we think your phones'
foundations are even

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:29.110
more important--
battery life, security,

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:31.750
startup time, and stability.

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:35.170
After all, if your battery dies
at 4:00 PM, none of the other

01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:37.850
features that Dave talked
about really matter.

01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:41.110
So in O, we're investing
in what we call Vitals,

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:44.440
keeping your phone secure
and in a healthy state

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.740
to maximize power
and performance.

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.400
We've invested in three
foundational building blocks--

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.610
security enhancements,
OS optimizations,

01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:57.610
and tools to help
developers build great apps.

01:23:57.610 --> 01:23:59.320
First, security.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:02.050
Android was built with
security in mind from day one

01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:03.940
with application sandboxing.

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:08.140
As Android has matured, we've
developed vast mobile security

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.280
services.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:13.300
Now, we use machine learning to
continuously comb apps uploaded

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:16.480
to Play, flagging
potentially harmful apps.

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.060
Then, we scan over 50
billion apps every day,

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:26.630
scanning every installed app
on every connected device.

01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:28.690
And when we find a
potentially harmful app,

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:31.120
we disable it or remove it.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.790
And we found most
Android users don't

01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:35.320
know these services
come built-in

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.570
with Android devices with Play.

01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:39.700
So for greater
peace of mind, we're

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.160
making them more
visible and accessible,

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.630
and doubling down
on our commitment

01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:47.320
to security, with the
introduction of Google Play

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.309
Protect.

01:24:49.309 --> 01:24:52.464
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:52.464 --> 01:24:54.380
So here, you can see
Play Protect has recently

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.400
scanned all your apps.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.780
No problems found.

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.920
That's Google Play Protect.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.380
It's available out of the
box on every Android device

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.060
with Google Play.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.070
Second, OS optimizations.

01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:07.070
The single biggest visible
change in O is boot time.

01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:09.630
On Pixel, for example,
you'll find, in most cases,

01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:11.690
your boot time is
now twice as fast.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.630
And we've made all
apps faster by default.

01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:17.240
We did this through extensive
changes to our runtime.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.700
Now, this is really cool stuff,
like concurrent compacting

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.830
garbage collection
and code locality.

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:24.260
But all you really need
to know is that your apps

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.630
will run faster and smoother.

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.460
Take Google Sheets--
aggregate performance

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:32.406
over a bunch of common actions
is now over two times as fast.

01:25:32.406 --> 01:25:33.530
And that's all from the OS.

01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:35.820
There are no changes to the app.

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.940
But we found apps
could still have

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.520
a huge impact on performance.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.750
Some apps were running
in the background,

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:46.340
and they were consuming tons
of system resources, especially

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:47.480
draining battery.

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.670
So in O, we're
adding Wise Limits

01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:53.450
to background location
and background execution.

01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:56.210
These boundaries put
sensible limits on usage.

01:25:56.210 --> 01:26:01.010
They're protecting battery
life and freeing up memory.

01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:04.054
Now, our third theme is helping
developers build great apps.

01:26:04.054 --> 01:26:05.470
And here, I want
to speak directly

01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:07.270
to all the developers
in the audience.

01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:10.690
Wouldn't it be cool if Android's
engineering team could show you

01:26:10.690 --> 01:26:13.150
what causes performance issues?

01:26:13.150 --> 01:26:15.790
Today, we've launched
Play Console Dashboards

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:17.690
that analyze every
app and pinpoint

01:26:17.690 --> 01:26:20.710
six top issues that
cause battery drain,

01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:22.690
crashes, and slow UI.

01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:25.660
For each issue the app
has, we show how many

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:28.510
users are affected and provide
guidance on the best way

01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:29.530
to fix.

01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:33.760
Now, imagine if developers could
also have a powerful profiler

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.790
to visualize what's
happening inside the app.

01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:40.840
In Android Studio, we've also
launched new unified profiling

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:45.010
tools for network,
memory, and CPU.

01:26:45.010 --> 01:26:46.660
So, developers can
now see everything

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.660
on a unified timeline, and
then dive into each profiler.

01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:52.480
For example, on CPU, you
can see every thread.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.910
You can look at the call
stack, and the time every call

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:56.110
is taking.

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:58.240
You can visualize
where the CPU is going.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:01.810
And you can jump to
the exact line of code.

01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:04.060
OK, so that's Android Vitals.

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:07.042
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:10.302 --> 01:27:11.760
How we're investing
in your phone's

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.609
foundational security
and performance.

01:27:14.609 --> 01:27:16.650
Later today, you'll see
Android's developer story

01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:17.730
from end to end.

01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:19.380
Our hard work to
help developers build

01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:21.810
great apps at every stage--

01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:25.570
writing code, tuning,
launching, and growing.

01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:29.070
But there is one more thing.

01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:31.620
One thing we think would
be an incredible complement

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.320
to the story.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.990
And it is one thing our team
has never done for developers.

01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:40.590
We have never added a
new programming language

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:41.270
to Android.

01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:44.180
And today, we're making
Kotlin an officially supported

01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.158
language in Android.

01:27:45.158 --> 01:27:48.581
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:53.970 --> 01:27:59.370
So, Kotlin-- Kotlin is one our
developer community has already

01:27:59.370 --> 01:27:59.910
asked for.

01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:02.790
It makes developers so
much more productive.

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:04.950
It is fully Android
runtime compatible.

01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:07.560
It is totally interoperable
with your existing code.

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.200
It has fabulous IDE support.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.380
And it's mature and
production ready from day one.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:17.700
We are also announcing our
plans to partner with JetBrains,

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:20.580
creating a foundation
for Kotlin.

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:26.250
I am so happy JetBrains CEO,
Max Shafirov, is here today.

01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:29.130
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:38.600
This new language is
wonderful, but we also

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.150
thought we should increase
our investment in our existing

01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:41.720
languages.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.616
So we're doing that, too.

01:28:43.616 --> 01:28:45.740
Please join us at the
developer keynote later today

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.810
to hear our story
from end to end.

01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:49.190
OK, so let's wrap up.

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:52.250
There are tons more features
in Android O, which we don't

01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:53.720
have time to go into today.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.580
Everything from
redesign settings,

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.650
to Project Treble, which
is one of the biggest

01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:59.270
changes to the
foundations of Android

01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:03.590
to date, to downloadable fonts
with new emoji, and much more.

01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:06.080
If you want to try some of
these features for yourself--

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.250
and you do--

01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:10.040
I'm happy to announce we're
making the first beta release

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.140
of O available today.

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.040
Head over to android.com/beta.

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.944
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:22.072
But there's more.

01:29:22.072 --> 01:29:24.700
[LAUGHS] You probably
thought we were

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.740
done talking about
Android O, but, I'd

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.790
like you to hear some
more about Android.

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:31.250
And from that, please
welcome Sameer.

01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:31.750
Thank you.

01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:32.694
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:29:32.694 --> 01:29:35.526
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:37.886 --> 01:29:39.265
SAMEER SAMAT: Thanks, Steph.

01:29:39.265 --> 01:29:40.980
Hi, everyone.

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.870
&gt;From the beginning,
Android's mission

01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:46.430
has been to bring the power
of computing to everyone.

01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:49.170
And we've seen tremendous
growth over the last few years,

01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:51.810
from the high end to
entry-level devices,

01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:55.530
in countries like
Indonesia, Brazil and India.

01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:58.110
In fact, there are now
more users of Android

01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.110
in India than there
are in the US.

01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:03.330
And every minute,
seven Brazilians

01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:05.856
come online for the first time.

01:30:05.856 --> 01:30:08.850
Now, all this
progress is amazing.

01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:10.960
For those of us who
have a smartphone,

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.620
we intuitively understand
the profound impact

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.650
that computing is having
on our daily lives.

01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:19.770
And that's why our team
gets so excited about how

01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:23.860
we can help bring this
technology to everyone.

01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:25.770
So we took a step back
to think about what

01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:29.490
it would take to get
smartphones to more people.

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:31.440
There are a few
things that are clear.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.960
Devices would need to
be more affordable,

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.900
with entry-level prices
dropping significantly.

01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:40.170
This means hardware that uses
less power-packed processors

01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:43.360
and far less memory
than on premium devices.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.050
But the hardware is
only half the equation.

01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:48.360
The software also
has to be tuned

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.720
for users' needs around
limited data connectivity

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.090
and multilingual use.

01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:55.950
We learned a lot
from our past efforts

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.080
here with Project
Svelte and KitKat,

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.100
and the original
Android One program.

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:03.330
But we felt like the time was
right to take our investment

01:31:03.330 --> 01:31:05.080
to the next level.

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.720
So today, I'm
excited to give you

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.000
a sneak peek into a
new experience we're

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.420
building for entry-level
Android devices.

01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:16.830
Internally, we
call it Android Go.

01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:19.390
Android Go focuses
on three things.

01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:22.320
First, optimizing the
latest release of Android

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.900
to run smoothly on
entry-level devices,

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:28.530
starting with Android
O. Second, a rebuilt

01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:31.590
set of Google Apps that
use less memory, storage

01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:33.930
space, and mobile data.

01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:36.570
And third, a version
of the Play Store

01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:38.600
that contains the
whole app catalog,

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.820
but highlights the apps
designed by all of you

01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:44.400
for the next billion users.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.010
And all three of these
things will ship together

01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:51.420
as a single experience starting
on Android O devices with 1

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.225
gigabyte or less of memory.

01:31:54.225 --> 01:31:56.100
Let's take a look at
some of the things we're

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.440
working on for Android Go.

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.590
First, let's talk about
the operating system.

01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:05.040
For manufacturers to make more
affordable entry-level devices,

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.920
the prices of their
components have to come down.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.460
Let's take one example.

01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:12.210
Memory is an
expensive component.

01:32:12.210 --> 01:32:14.250
So we're making a
number of optimizations

01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:17.730
to the system UI and the
kernel to allow an Android O

01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:20.850
device built with
the Go configuration

01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:24.720
to run smoothly with as
little as 512 megabytes

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.790
to 1 gigabyte of memory.

01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:30.660
Now on-device
performance is critical,

01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:33.210
but data costs and
intermittent connectivity

01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:35.910
are also big
challenges for users.

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:38.130
One person put it best
to me when she said,

01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:40.590
mobile data feels like currency.

01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:43.900
And she wanted more control
over the way she spent it.

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.340
So on these devices, we're
putting data management front

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.250
and center in Quick Settings.

01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:51.290
And we've created an API that
carriers can integrate with,

01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:54.680
so you can see exactly how much
prepaid data you have left,

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:58.710
and even top up right
there on the device.

01:32:58.710 --> 01:33:01.050
But beyond the OS,
the Google Apps

01:33:01.050 --> 01:33:03.870
are also getting
smarter about data.

01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:07.590
For example, on these devices,
the Chrome Data Saver feature

01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:10.640
will be turned on by
default. Data Saver

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.740
transcodes content on the
server and simplifies pages

01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:15.640
when you're on a
slow connection.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.265
And, well, now we're
making the savings

01:33:17.265 --> 01:33:19.290
more visible here in the UI.

01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:21.960
In aggregate, this
feature is saving users

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:28.180
over 750 terabytes
of data every day.

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:30.430
I'm really excited that the
YouTube team has designed

01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:34.000
a new app called YouTube Go for
their users with limited data

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.350
connectivity.

01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:38.650
Feedback on the new YouTube
app has been phenomenal,

01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:40.960
and we're taking many of the
lessons we've learned here

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.900
and applying them to
several of our Google Apps.

01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:47.670
Let me show you some of the
things I love about YouTube Go.

01:33:47.670 --> 01:33:50.000
First, there's a new
preview experience,

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.160
so you can get a sneak
peek inside a video

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.950
before you decide to spend
your data to watch it.

01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:56.960
And when you're sure this
is the video for you,

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.330
you can select the
streaming quality you want,

01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:03.170
and see exactly how much mobile
data that's going to cost you.

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:05.510
But my favorite
feature of YouTube Go

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:08.360
is the ability to save videos
while you're connected.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.340
So you can watch them
later when you might not

01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:12.290
have access to data.

01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:14.900
And if you want to share any
of those videos with a friend,

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:17.870
you can use the built-in
peer-to-peer sharing feature

01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:20.600
to connect two of your
devices together directly,

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:23.090
and share the files
across without using

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:26.519
any of your mobile data at all.

01:34:26.519 --> 01:34:29.477
[APPLAUSE]

01:34:30.956 --> 01:34:33.370
But beyond data
management, the Google Apps

01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:35.740
will also make it
easier to seamlessly go

01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.390
between multiple
languages, which

01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:40.870
is a really common use case
for people coming online today.

01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:44.960
For example, Gboard now
supports over 191 languages,

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.340
including the recent addition
of 22 Indian languages.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:50.690
And there's even a
transliteration feature,

01:34:50.690 --> 01:34:52.990
which allows you to
spell words phonetically

01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:56.110
on a QWERTY keyboard to type
in your native language script.

01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:59.530
Now, Gboard is super cool,
so I want to show it to you.

01:34:59.530 --> 01:35:02.350
I grew up in the US, so for any
of my family that's watching,

01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:04.450
don't get too
excited by the demo.

01:35:04.450 --> 01:35:06.030
I haven't learned Hindi yet.

01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:08.680
And I'm sorry, mom, OK?

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.711
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:10.210 --> 01:35:13.570
So let's say, I want to send a
quick note to my aunt in India.

01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:16.720
I can open up Allo,
and using Gboard,

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:19.135
I can type how it
sounds phonetically.

01:35:19.135 --> 01:35:23.400
[HINDI], which means
"how are you" in Hindi.

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.000
And transliteration
automatically

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.440
gives me Hindi script.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.120
That's pretty cool.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.040
Now, let's say I want to ask
her how my I/O speech is going,

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.430
but I don't know how to
say that in Hindi at all.

01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:36.130
I can use the built-in
Google Translate feature

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:40.600
to say, "how is this going?"

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.640
And seamlessly, I
get Hindi script,

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.675
all built right
into the keyboard.

01:35:46.675 --> 01:35:49.537
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:51.810 --> 01:35:54.180
My family is apparently
a tough audience.

01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:56.040
All right.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:58.680
Well, the Google Apps
are getting Go-ified,

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:01.230
what had always
propelled Android forward

01:36:01.230 --> 01:36:03.690
is the apps from all of you.

01:36:03.690 --> 01:36:06.240
And no surprise, many of
our developer partners

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:08.670
have optimized
their apps already.

01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:10.980
So to better connect users
with these experiences,

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:14.130
we'll be highlighting
them in the Play Store.

01:36:14.130 --> 01:36:17.250
One example is right
here on Play's home page.

01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:18.960
To be eligible for
these new sections,

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.000
we published a set
of best practices

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.450
called "Building for Billions,"
which includes recommendations

01:36:24.450 --> 01:36:27.600
we've seen make a big difference
in the consumer experience.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.420
Things such as designing
a useful offline state,

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:33.150
reducing your APK size to
less than 10 megabytes,

01:36:33.150 --> 01:36:36.330
and using GCM or JobScheduler
for better battery and memory

01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:37.950
performance.

01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:40.170
And also in "Building
for Billions,"

01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:43.590
you'll find best practices for
optimizing your web experience.

01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:45.720
We've seen developers
build amazing things

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.939
with new technologies, such
as progressive web apps.

01:36:47.939 --> 01:36:49.980
And we hope you can come
to our developer keynote

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:52.530
later today to learn
a whole lot more.

01:36:52.530 --> 01:36:55.470
OK, that was a quick walkthrough
of some of the things coming

01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:57.210
in Android Go.

01:36:57.210 --> 01:36:59.760
Starting with Android
O, all devices

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:04.140
with 1 gigabyte of RAM or less
will get the Go configuration.

01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:07.140
And going forward,
every Android release

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:09.080
will have a Go configuration.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:12.150
We'll be unveiling much
more later this year,

01:37:12.150 --> 01:37:15.450
with the first devices
shipping in 2018.

01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:17.460
We look forward to
seeing what you'll build,

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:20.820
and how we can bring computing
to the next several billion

01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.110
users.

01:37:22.110 --> 01:37:25.621
Next up-- next up, you'll
be hearing from Clay on one

01:37:25.621 --> 01:37:27.870
of Google's newest platforms
that we're really excited

01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:28.470
about--

01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:29.931
VR and AR.

01:37:29.931 --> 01:37:30.430
Thank you.

01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:31.394
[APPLAUSE]

01:37:31.394 --> 01:37:34.286
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:39.990
CLAY BAVOR: Thank you, Sameer.

01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:43.380
So, Sundar talked about how
technologies like machine

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.050
learning and
conversational interfaces

01:37:46.050 --> 01:37:49.680
make computing more intuitive by
enabling our computers to work

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.240
more like we do.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.850
And we see VR and AR
in the same light.

01:37:53.850 --> 01:37:56.310
They enable us to
experience computing

01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:59.130
just as we experience
the real world.

01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:01.430
Virtual reality can
be transporting.

01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:03.300
And you can experience
not just what

01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.340
it's like to see
someplace, but what

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.410
it's like to really be there.

01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:10.590
And augmented reality uses
your surroundings as context,

01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:13.210
and puts computing
into the real world.

01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:15.460
A lot has happened since
Google I/O last year,

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:18.320
and I'm excited to share a
bit of what we've been up to.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.250
So let's start with VR.

01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:22.260
Last year, we announced
Daydream, our platform

01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.142
for mobile virtual reality.

01:38:24.142 --> 01:38:26.100
And then in October, to
kick-start the Daydream

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.440
ecosystem, we released
Daydream View,

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:30.480
a VR headset made by Google.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:31.740
And it's super comfortable.

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.150
It's really easy to use.

01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:35.190
And there's tons to do with it.

01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:37.230
You can play inside
alternate worlds,

01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:40.070
and games like "Virtual
Virtual Reality."

01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:41.850
And you can see any
part of our world

01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:43.260
with apps like Street View.

01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:47.100
And you can visit other worlds
with apps like Hello Mars.

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.320
There's already a great
selection of Daydream phones

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.069
out there, and we're
working with partners

01:38:51.069 --> 01:38:53.070
to get Daydream on even more.

01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:55.710
First, I'm pleased
that LG's next flagship

01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:59.220
phone, which launches later this
year, will support Daydream.

01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:00.570
And there's another.

01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:04.310
I'm excited to announce that
the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8

01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:07.530
Plus will add Daydream support
this summer with a software

01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:08.300
update.

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:11.120
[APPLAUSE]

01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:13.550
So, Samsung, of
course, they make

01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:15.425
many of the most popular
phones in the world.

01:39:15.425 --> 01:39:17.780
And we're delighted to have
them supporting Daydream.

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:20.930
So great momentum in
Daydream's first six months.

01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:22.761
Let's talk about what's next.

01:39:22.761 --> 01:39:24.260
So with Daydream,
we showed that you

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:26.060
can create high
quality mobile VR

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:27.650
experiences with
just a smartphone

01:39:27.650 --> 01:39:29.260
and a simple headset.

01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:32.090
And there are a lot of nice
things about smartphone VR.

01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.720
It's easy.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.600
There aren't a bunch of cables
and things to fuss with.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.330
You can choose from a bunch
of great compatible phones.

01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:39.540
And of course, it's portable.

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.600
You can throw your
headset in a bag.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.660
We asked, how we take the
best parts of smartphone VR

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:48.390
and create a kind of device
with an even better experience?

01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:51.860
Well, I'm excited to announce
that an entirely new kind of VR

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:55.310
device is coming to Daydream--
what we call standalone VR

01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:56.120
headsets.

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.510
And we're working with
partners to make them.

01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:00.880
So what's a standalone headset?

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.630
Well, the idea is that
you have everything

01:40:02.630 --> 01:40:05.480
you need for VR built right
into the headset itself.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.170
There's no cables, no phone,
and certainly, no big PC.

01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:12.220
And the whole device is
designed just for VR.

01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:14.010
And that's cool for
a couple of reasons.

01:40:14.010 --> 01:40:15.980
First, it's easy to use.

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:19.030
Getting into VR is as easy
as picking the thing up.

01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:21.500
And it's one step
and two seconds.

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.330
And second, presence.

01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:27.260
And by that, I mean really
feeling like you're there.

01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:30.020
By building every part of the
device specifically for VR,

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:32.900
we've been able to optimize
everything-- the displays,

01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.430
the optics, the sensors--

01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:37.820
all to deliver a stronger
sense of being transported.

01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:39.200
And nothing
heightens the feeling

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.570
of presence like
precise tracking--

01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:43.880
how the headset
tracks your movement.

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.820
And we've dramatically improved
tracking with the technology

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:49.520
that we call WorldSense.

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:53.360
So WorldSense enables what's
known as positional tracking.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.640
And with it, your view
in the virtual world

01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.150
exactly matches your
movement in the real world.

01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:00.050
And it works by using
a handful of sensors

01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:02.960
on the device that look
out into your surroundings.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.587
And that means it
works anywhere.

01:41:04.587 --> 01:41:05.295
There's no setup.

01:41:05.295 --> 01:41:07.220
There's no cameras to install.

01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:10.000
And with it, you really
feel like you're there.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.530
Now, just as we did with
Daydream-ready smartphones,

01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:15.530
we're taking a platform approach
with standalone headsets,

01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:18.566
working with partners to
build some great devices.

01:41:18.566 --> 01:41:19.940
To start, we worked
with Qualcomm

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.640
to create a Daydream
standalone headset reference

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.770
design, a sort of
device blueprint

01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:26.360
that partners can build from.

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.060
And we're working closely
with two amazing consumer

01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:32.060
electronics companies to
build the first headsets.

01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:35.952
First, HTC, the company
that created the VIVE.

01:41:35.952 --> 01:41:36.954
[APPLAUSE]

01:41:36.954 --> 01:41:38.120
We're excited about it, too.

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.470
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:42.420
They're a leader
in VR, and we're

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:45.030
delighted to be working
with them on a standalone VR

01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:46.290
headset for Daydream.

01:41:46.290 --> 01:41:48.000
And second, Lenovo.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.940
We've been partners for years,
working together on Tango.

01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:53.820
And now, we're excited
to work with them on VR.

01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:57.550
These devices will start to
come to market later this year.

01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:59.100
So that's the update on VR.

01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:01.830
Great momentum with apps,
more Daydream-ready phones

01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:04.830
on the way, and a new category
of devices that we think people

01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:06.270
are going to love.

01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:08.390
So let's turn to
augmented reality.

01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:11.430
And a lot of us were
introduced to the idea of AR

01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:13.190
last year with Pokemon GO.

01:42:13.190 --> 01:42:15.210
And the app gave
us a glimpse of AR,

01:42:15.210 --> 01:42:17.280
and it showed us
just how cool it

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.700
can be to have digital
objects show up in our world.

01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:23.580
Well, we've been working
in this space since 2013

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:26.010
with Tango, a sensing
technology that

01:42:26.010 --> 01:42:29.910
enables devices to understand
space more like we do.

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.880
Two years ago in 2015, we
released a developer kit.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.670
And last year, we shipped the
first consumer-ready Tango

01:42:35.670 --> 01:42:36.570
phone.

01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:39.420
And I'm excited to announce
that the second generation Tango

01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:43.860
phone, the ASUS ZenFone AR
will go on sale this summer.

01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:47.340
Now, looking at the slides,
you may notice a trend.

01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:49.500
The devices are getting smaller.

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.990
And you can imagine
far more devices having

01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:55.150
this capability in the future.

01:42:55.150 --> 01:42:57.030
It's been awesome to
see what developers

01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:58.350
have done with the technology.

01:42:58.350 --> 01:43:00.060
And one thing we've
seen clearly is

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:02.790
that AR is most
powerful when it's

01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:05.790
tightly coupled to the real
world, and the more precisely,

01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:06.587
the better.

01:43:06.587 --> 01:43:08.670
That's why we've been
working with the Google Maps

01:43:08.670 --> 01:43:11.640
team on a service that
can give devices access

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.450
to very precise location
information indoors.

01:43:15.450 --> 01:43:17.640
It's kind of like
GPS, but instead

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.220
of talking to satellites
to figure out where it is,

01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:22.590
your phone looks for
distinct visual features

01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:25.450
in the environment, and it
triangulates with those.

01:43:25.450 --> 01:43:27.180
So you have GPS.

01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:31.800
We call this VPS, Google's
Visual Positioning Service.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.100
And we think it's going
to be incredibly useful

01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:36.250
in a whole bunch of places.

01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:39.060
For example, imagine you're at
Lowe's, the home improvement

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:41.340
store that has
basically everything.

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:43.860
And if you've been there,
you know it's really big.

01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:45.600
And we've all had
that moment when

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.080
you're struggling to find that
one, weird, random screwdriver

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.126
thing.

01:43:50.126 --> 01:43:52.050
Well, imagine in the
future, your phone

01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:54.270
could just take you to
that exact screwdriver

01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:56.520
and point it out to
you on the shelf.

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.700
Turns out we can
do this with VPS.

01:43:58.700 --> 01:43:59.700
And let me show you how.

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.642
And this is working today.

01:44:01.642 --> 01:44:03.600
So here we are walking
down an aisle at Lowe's.

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.940
And the phone will find
these key visual feature

01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:07.980
points, which you can
see there in yellow.

01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:10.680
By comparing the feature points
against previously observed

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.900
ones, those colorful
dots in the back,

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:16.410
the phone can figure out exactly
where it is in space down to

01:44:16.410 --> 01:44:19.050
within a few centimeters.

01:44:19.050 --> 01:44:22.320
So GPS can get you to
the door, and then VPS

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:25.740
can get you to the exact
item that you're looking for.

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:26.771
Further out--

01:44:26.771 --> 01:44:29.717
[APPLAUSE]

01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:35.840
Further out, imagine
what this technology

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.770
could mean to people with
impaired vision, for example.

01:44:38.770 --> 01:44:41.030
VPS and an audio-based
interface could

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:44.030
transform how they make
their way through the world.

01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:46.730
And it combines so many things
that Google is good at--

01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:49.370
mapping, computer vision,
distributed computing.

01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:50.930
And we think precise
location will

01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:53.390
be critical for
camera-based interfaces.

01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:56.930
So VPS will be one of the core
capabilities of Google Lens.

01:44:56.930 --> 01:45:00.320
We're really excited about
the possibilities here.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.820
So the last thing
I wanted to share

01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:03.320
is something that
we've been working

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.180
on that brings many
of these capabilities

01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:06.890
together in a really
important area.

01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:08.480
And that's education.

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.790
Two years ago, we
launched Expeditions,

01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:13.490
which is a tool for teachers
to take their classes

01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:15.350
on virtual reality field trips.

01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:17.939
And 2 million
students have used it.

01:45:17.939 --> 01:45:19.730
Today, we're excited
to announce that we're

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:22.150
adding a new capability
to Expeditions--

01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:25.922
AR mode, which enables kind
of the ultimate show-and-tell

01:45:25.922 --> 01:45:26.880
right in the classroom.

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:28.338
If we could roll
the video, please.

01:45:28.338 --> 01:45:31.010
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:33.670
- All right, who wants
to see a volcano?

01:45:33.670 --> 01:45:37.206
3, 2, 1.

01:45:37.206 --> 01:45:39.701
- Whoa!

01:45:39.701 --> 01:45:40.990
- Look at that lava.

01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:43.480
Look at that smoke
coming out of that.

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.232
Pretend you're an airplane
and fly over the tornado.

01:45:47.232 --> 01:45:48.360
- That's the top of it.

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.540
- What do you see?

01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:52.240
- It's either a
asteroid, meteorite--

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:54.470
- We're learning
about DNA and genes--

01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:56.040
things that we can't see.

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:59.870
And so, the most exciting thing
for me with the AR technology

01:45:59.870 --> 01:46:02.960
was that I could see
kids get an "aha"

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.659
moment that I couldn't get by
just telling them about it.

01:46:06.659 --> 01:46:08.450
- The minute I saw it
pop up on the screen,

01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:10.200
it made me want to
get up and walk to it.

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.116
- You actually you get
to turn around and look

01:46:12.116 --> 01:46:15.309
at things from all angles, so
it gave us a nice perspective.

01:46:15.309 --> 01:46:16.850
- See if you can
figure out what that

01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:19.970
might be based on what you know
about the respiratory system.

01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:22.430
- I got to see where the
alveoli branched off,

01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:25.670
and I could look inside them
and see how everything worked,

01:46:25.670 --> 01:46:27.210
which I never saw before.

01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:28.770
And it was really, really cool.

01:46:31.626 --> 01:46:37.647
[END PLAYBACK]

01:46:37.647 --> 01:46:39.730
CLAY BAVOR: We're just
delighted with the response

01:46:39.730 --> 01:46:40.563
we're seeing so far.

01:46:40.563 --> 01:46:43.490
And we'll be rolling this
out later in the year.

01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:47.260
So, VR and AR, two
different flavors

01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:50.170
of what you might call immersive
computing-- computing that

01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:52.240
works more like we do.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.460
We think that's a big idea.

01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:57.280
And in time, we see VR
and AR changing how we

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:00.580
work and play, live and learn.

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.020
And all that I
talked about here,

01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:03.880
these are just the first steps.

01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:05.900
But we can see where
all of this goes,

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:07.900
and we're incredibly
excited about what's ahead.

01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:08.852
Thanks so much.

01:47:08.852 --> 01:47:09.804

01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.150
- We wanted to make machine
learning have an open source

01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:17.160
project so that everyone
outside of Google

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.066
could use the same system
we're using inside Google.

SUNDAR PICHAI: It's incredible
[? with ?] any open source

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.030
platform, when you see what
people can do on top of it.

01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:06.540
We're really excited about the
momentum behind TensorFlow.

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:11.170
It's already the most popular
ML repository on GitHub.

01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:13.510
And we're going to
push it further.

01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:16.480
We are also announcing the
TensorFlow Research Cloud.

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.640
We are giving away
1,000 cloud TPUs,

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:22.240
which is 180 petaflops
of computing to academics

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:26.410
and researchers for free so that
they can do more stuff with it.

01:48:26.410 --> 01:48:29.410
I'm always amazed by the stories
I hear from developers when

01:48:29.410 --> 01:48:30.580
I meet them.

01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:32.870
I want to highlight
one young developer

01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:35.595
today, Abu Qader from Chicago.

01:48:35.595 --> 01:48:40.180
He has used TensorFlow to help
improve health for everyone.

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:41.724
Let's take a look.

01:48:41.724 --> 01:48:42.987

[CHATTER]

01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:48.996
- My name is Abu.

01:48:48.996 --> 01:48:50.994
I am a high school student.

01:48:50.994 --> 01:48:52.386
17 years old.

01:48:55.170 --> 01:48:58.660
My freshman year, I remember
Googling machine learning.

01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:00.270
I had no clue what it meant.

01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:01.470
That's a really cool
thing about the internet,

01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:03.640
is that someone's already doing
it, so you can just YouTube it,

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.235
and [CLICK] it's right there.

01:49:05.235 --> 01:49:08.300
Within a minute, I really saw
what machine learning can do.

01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:10.590
It kind of like hit
something within me.

01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:14.490
This need to build
things to help people.

01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:16.560
My parents are immigrants
from Afghanistan.

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.174
It's not easy coming in.

01:49:18.174 --> 01:49:20.340
The only reason we made it
through some of the times

01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:23.910
that we did was because people
showed acts of kindness.

01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:25.980
Seeing that at an early
age was enough for me

01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:28.710
to understand that
helping people always

01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:31.158
comes back to you.

01:49:31.158 --> 01:49:32.820
[INAUDIBLE]

01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:33.810
- How are you?

01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:35.550
- And then it kind of hit me--

01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:38.940
a way where I could actually
generally help people.

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:43.280
Mammograms are the cheapest
imaging format there is.

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:45.960
It's the most accessible to
people all around the world.

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:48.750
But one of the biggest problems
that we see in breast cancer

01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:50.610
is misdiagnosis.

01:49:50.610 --> 01:49:52.530
So I decided I
was going to build

01:49:52.530 --> 01:49:56.070
a system for early detection
of breast cancer tumors,

01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:58.655
that's successful to everyone,
and that's more accurate.

01:49:58.655 --> 01:50:00.300
How was I going to do it?

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.350
Machine learning.

01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:04.620
The biggest, most extensive
resource that I've used,

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:06.320
is this platform
called TensorFlow.

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.790
And I've spent so
many hours going

01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:10.920
really deep into these
open source libraries

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.110
and just figuring
out how it works.

01:50:13.110 --> 01:50:15.180
Eventually, I wrote
a whole system

01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:19.586
that can help radiologists
make their decisions.

01:50:19.586 --> 01:50:20.086
All right.

01:50:20.086 --> 01:50:20.586
- Ready?

01:50:20.586 --> 01:50:21.540
- Yeah.

01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:25.260
I'm by no means a wizard
at machine learning.

01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.140
I'm completely self-taught.

01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:27.950
I'm in high school.

01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:31.470
I YouTubed and just
found my way through it.

01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:33.470
You don't know about
that kid in Brazil

01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:37.560
that might have a groundbreaking
idea, or that kid in Somalia.

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.900
You don't know that
they have these ideas.

01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:42.090
But if you can open
source your tools,

01:50:42.090 --> 01:50:43.830
you can give them a
little bit of hope

01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:48.060
that they can actually conquer
what they're thinking of.

to have Abu and his family

01:51:00.570 --> 01:51:01.470

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.330
Thank you for joining us.

01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:14.150
Enjoy I/O. We've been talking
about machine learning

01:51:14.150 --> 01:51:18.200
in terms of how it will power
new experiences and research.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:21.350
But it's also important we think
about how this technology can

01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:24.560
have an immediate
impact on people's lives

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:28.670
by creating opportunities
for economic empowerment.

01:51:28.670 --> 01:51:33.680
46% of US employers say
they faced talent shortages

01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:38.670
and have issues filling open job
positions while job seekers may

01:51:38.670 --> 01:51:41.700
be looking for openings
right next door.

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:44.390
There is a big disconnect here.

01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:46.310
Just like we focused
our contributions

01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:50.060
to teachers and students
through Google for Education,

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:53.510
we want to better connect
employers and job seekers

01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:57.260
through a new initiative,
Google for Jobs.

01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.930
Google for Jobs
is our commitment

01:51:59.930 --> 01:52:04.070
to use our products to
help people find work.

01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:06.740
It's a complex,
multifaceted problem,

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:09.710
but we've been investing
a lot over the past year,

01:52:09.710 --> 01:52:12.380
and we have made
significant progress.

01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:16.310
Last November, we announced
the Cloud Jobs API.

01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:19.610
Think of it as the first
fully end-to-end, pre-trained,

01:52:19.610 --> 01:52:22.490
vertical machine learning
model through Google Cloud,

01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:24.410
which we give to employers--

01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:29.570
FedEx, Johnson &amp; Johnson,
HealthSouth, CareerBuilder,

01:52:29.570 --> 01:52:32.270
and we're expanding to
many more employers.

01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:34.790
So in Johnson &amp;
Johnson's career site,

01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:39.080
they found that applicants
were 18% more likely to apply

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:43.040
to a job suggesting the matching
is working more efficiently.

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.100
And so far, over 4
and 1/2 million people

01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.340
have interacted with this API.

01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:49.820
But as we started
working on this,

01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:52.730
we realized the first
step for many people

01:52:52.730 --> 01:52:56.580
when they start looking for
a job is searching on Google.

01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:58.760
So, it's like other
Search challenges

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.100
we have worked in the past.

01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:03.890
So we built a new feature
in Search with a goal

01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:06.800
that no matter who you
are or what kind of job

01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:09.500
you are looking for, you can
find the job postings that

01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:11.120
are right for you.

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.370
And as part of this
effort, we worked

01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:18.170
hard to include jobs across
experience and wage levels,

01:53:18.170 --> 01:53:20.840
including jobs that have
traditionally been much harder

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.470
to search and classify--

01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:26.480
think retail jobs,
hospitality jobs, et cetera.

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.210
To do this, well, we have
worked with many partners--

01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:34.490
LinkedIn, Monster, Facebook,
CareerBuilder, Glassdoor,

01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:35.520
and many more.

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:38.070
So let's take a look
at how it works.

01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:40.760
Let's say you come to
Google and you start

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.590
searching for retail jobs.

01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:44.210
And you're from Pittsburgh.

01:53:44.210 --> 01:53:45.110
We understand that.

01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:48.410
You can scroll down and click
into this immersive experience.

01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:52.340
And we immediately start showing
the most relevant jobs for you.

01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:53.400
And you can filter.

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.200
You can choose Full-time.

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:58.160
And as you can see, you
can drill down easily.

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:01.760
I want to look at jobs which are
posted in the past three days.

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.080
So you can do that.

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:06.470
Now, you're looking at retail
jobs in Pittsburgh, posted

01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:09.080
within the last three days.

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:11.660
You can also filter
by job titles.

01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:14.300
It turns out employees
and employers use

01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:16.250
many different terminologies.

01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:20.090
For example, retail could
mean a store clerk, a sales

01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:22.700
representative, store manager.

01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:25.490
We use machine
learning to cluster

01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:28.730
automatically, and so that we
can bring all the relevant jobs

01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:29.900
for you.

01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:32.150
As you scroll through it,
you will notice that we even

01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:33.620
show commute times.

01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:36.710
It turns out to be an important
criteria for many people.

01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:39.530
And we'll soon add a
filter for that as well.

01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:42.330
And if you find something
that's of interest to you--

01:54:42.330 --> 01:54:45.320
so maybe the retail
position [? in ?] Ross.

01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:49.520
And you can click on it, and you
end up going to it right away.

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.170
And you're one click away.

01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:54.110
You can scroll to find more
information if you want.

01:54:54.110 --> 01:54:59.320
And you're one click away from
clicking and applying there.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.670
It's a powerful tool.

01:55:00.670 --> 01:55:04.600
We are addressing jobs of every
skill level and experience

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:05.410
level.

01:55:05.410 --> 01:55:08.750
And we are committed to making
these tools work for everyone.

01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:10.690
As part of building
it, we literally

01:55:10.690 --> 01:55:12.820
talked to hundreds of people.

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:15.730
So whether you are in a
community college looking

01:55:15.730 --> 01:55:19.060
for a barista job, a
teacher who is relocating

01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:22.360
across the country and you
want teaching jobs, or someone

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:24.700
who is looking for
work in construction,

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:26.230
the product should
do a great job

01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:28.420
of bringing that
information to you.

01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:31.084
We are rolling this out in
the US in the coming weeks,

01:55:31.084 --> 01:55:32.500
and then we are
going to expand it

01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:34.900
to more countries in the future.

01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:37.570
I'm personally enthusiastic
for this initiative

01:55:37.570 --> 01:55:40.390
because it addresses
an important need

01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:43.210
and taps our core
capabilities as a company,

01:55:43.210 --> 01:55:45.910
from searching and
organizing information,

01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:49.270
to AI and machine learning.

01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:51.130
It's been a busy morning.

01:55:51.130 --> 01:55:53.740
We've talked about
this important shift

01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:56.620
from a mobile first
to a AI first world.

01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:00.220
And we're driving it forward
across all our products

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:04.960
and platforms so that all of you
can build powerful experiences

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:07.300
for new users everywhere.

01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:09.640
It will take all of
us working together

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:12.970
to bring the benefits of
technology to everyone.

01:56:12.970 --> 01:56:15.580
I believe we are on the verge
of solving some of the most

01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:17.770
important problems we face.

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:18.640
That's our hope.

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:20.219
Let's do it together.

01:56:20.219 --> 01:56:22.260
Thanks for your time today,
and enjoy Google I/O.

01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:25.254
