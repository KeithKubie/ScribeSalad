00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.250
 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.920
The previous segment of this
lecture examined the rules

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.770
that determine which
among competing claimants

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.810
is the author of a copyrighted work.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.580
But occasionally, more
than one person can

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.470
claim to have contributed enough
to a work to be called an author

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.790
and thus, to share in the copyright.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.790
The legal condition that
arises under such circumstances

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.200
is known as joint authorship.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.780
It doesn't happen very often, for
reasons we'll discuss in a minute.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.780
But when it occurs, it has
some important effects.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.880
Each author in such cases is said
to be an owner of the whole work,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.700
not just the part he or she contributed.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.010
Each is free to use the work
or to license others to use it.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.060
If one of the joint authors licenses it
unilaterally and collects license fees,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.910
he or she must give the other joint
author or authors appropriate shares.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.390
If he fails to do so, he's
subject to a suit for accounting.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.940
How much of the revenue does he have
to give the other joint authors?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.170
The presumption is that each one
is entitled to an equal share.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.830
This is true even if their contributions
have clearly been unequal in amount.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.160
However, this presumption
of equality can

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.760
be overridden by an agreement
among the joint authors.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.750
When a joint author dies, his or her
interest passes to his or her heirs,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.520
not to the other joint authors.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.820
In this respect, joint
authorship, in copyright law,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.020
works like a tenancy in common and real
property law, not like a joint tenancy.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.840
The main difference between those two
legal forms is that the latter carries

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.920
with it a right of survivorship
while the former doesn't.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.730
In sum, joint authorship has many
important legal implications.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.000
So when and how does
this situation arise?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.240
The answer with respect to US
law is that a person claiming

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.880
to be a joint author has
to show both of two things.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.750
First, he must show that each of
the people, including himself,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.700
that he asserts share in the copyright
made a copyrightable contribution

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.910
to the final work at issue.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.670
Second, he must show that
all of these contributors

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.950
intended that their
various contributions be

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.840
merged into a unitary whole.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.560
These requirements are usually
construed quite strictly by the courts.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.970
The net result is that most people who
seek the status of joint author fail.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.220
Here's a case that illustrates the
impediments that the law places

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.200
in the path of those who
would be joint authors.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.730
Rent is one of the most famous and
successful musicals of all time.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.920
It was set in and first performed in New
York City, but productions of the play

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.490
have since been staged
throughout the world.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.040
Here, for example, is a poster
from a production in Oregon

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.620
and one from Jakarta.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.620
My daughters used to sing most
of the songs from the play

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.220
when riding in the backseat of my car.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.590
The plot of Rent is loosely
based on Puccini's opera La

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.310
Boheme, which has long
been out of copyright.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.100
It's based on Puccini's work in much the
same rough way that West Side Story is

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.730
based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.070
Set during a period when
AIDS was often fatal,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.340
Rent examines the intertwined lives
of a group of young, poor artists

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.915
and musicians, many of them
living with the disease.

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:56.500
 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.340
The genesis of the
musical is complicated

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.255
and those complications are the
source of the copyright dispute

00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:05.050
that concerns us here.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.530
The narrative is traced in the
slide you see on the screen.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.060
In 1989, Billy Aronson and
composer Jonathan Larson

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.970
began to collaborate on an
adaptation of La Boheme.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.350
In 1991, Aronson withdrew
from the collaboration.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.170
They settled their respective rights
in the inchoate script amicably,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.680
and Larson carried on with
the project by himself.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.310
In 1992 and 1993, James Nicola, who was
then artistic director of the New York

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.540
Theater Workshop-- a small, nonprofit
theater in the East Village--

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.700
expressed enthusiasm about
the script, but Nicola

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.140
urged Larson to permit
the theater workshop

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.620
to hire a playwright or a book writer
who would help Larson improve the story

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.750
line and the narrative
structure of the play.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.950
Larson refused, insisting that
he wanted to do it himself.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.860
In 1994, Larson got a grant to
put on a short run of shows.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.290
Nicola agreed to produce
them at the theater workshop

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.840
and Michael Greif directed them.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.570
The reviews of this initial trial
production of Rent were positive,

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.380
but everyone agreed that the
play still needed lots of work.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.050
Nicola again pressed
Larson to accept some help.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.550
And finally in May of
1995, Larson acquiesced.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.210
The theater workshop, not
Larson, hired Lynn Thomson--

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.840
a professor of advanced play
writing at New York University--

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.680
to serve as a dramaturg.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.050
A dramaturg is someone who assists
in some way in the production

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.480
and development of plays.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.140
The contract between the
theater workshop and Thomson

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.220
indicated that she would receive
a fee of $2,000 in return

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.970
for, quote, "providing dramaturgical
assistance and research

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.960
to the playwright and
director," close quote.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.860
In the summer and fall of 1995, Thomson
and Larson worked closely together.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.640
Thomson came to Larson's apartment
where they worked feverishly

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.040
to revise the script.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.110
Typically, Larson sat at the
computer typing revisions

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.040
while Thomson made suggestions.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.670
Many of the adjustments and
particular lines that she came up with

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.340
found their way into the final script.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.760
This collaboration was highly
successful, at least gauging

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.290
by the final outcome.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.290
The new script was thought
to entail a, quote,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.660
"radical transformation of the show,"
close quote, and was widely celebrated.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.140
The final dress rehearsal
was held on January 24, 1996.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:54.010
Tragically, Larson died that
evening of an aortic aneurysm.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.990
The legal effect of this
catastrophe is that his property,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.960
including whatever copyright interests
he had acquired by that point,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.370
passed to his heirs.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:09.400
Thereafter, Nicola, Greif and Thomson
worked together to tune the script.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.390
The off-Broadway production was highly
praised and it soon moved to Broadway.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.870
And the rest is history.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.220
As the play became ever more
commercially successful,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.390
Thomson became ever more unhappy
with her paltry compensation

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.230
and with the absence of
any credit she received

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.490
on the title page of the production.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.820
The Broadway producers agreed to
pay her an additional $10,000,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.210
but she was still not satisfied.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.470
She asked Larson's heirs for a
share of the author's royalties.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.020
Those royalties were
originally payable to Larson

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.300
and were now flowing to the heirs.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:57.070
The heirs offered her 1% as what
they described as a gift-- not enough

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.600
for Thomson, and negotiations collapsed.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.930
Finally, Thomson brought a copyright
infringement suit against the heirs.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.510
Her principal legal claim was
that her contributions to the play

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.130
were sufficient to render
her a joint author.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.540
As such, she was entitled to a
share of the author's royalties.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.930
She lost at trial and again on appeal.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.560
Why?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.350
It would seem from
this narrative that she

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.800
had contributed nontrivial amounts of
material to the content of the play

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.750
and thus deserved a fair amount
of credit for its success.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.659
Nevertheless in the
court's judgment, she

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.600
had failed to demonstrate
the two conditions that

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.419
are essential to joint authorship.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.570
As mentioned previously,
those two conditions

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.480
are first, that each of
the putative co-authors

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.770
have made independently copyrightable
contributions to the final work;

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.100
and second, that both intended
that their contributions be merged

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:02.350
into inseparable or interdependent
parts of a unitary whole.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.420
The trial court and the Court of Appeals
found, or were willing to assume,

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.440
that the first requirement
had been satisfied.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.260
Specifically, the trial
judge found that, quote,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.760
"There are lines in Rent that
originated verbatim with Ms. Thomson.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.390
I don't think they amount
to 9%, and certainly not 0%.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.430
There's probably enough there that
it is not de minimis" close quote.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.400
It was the second requirement
the tripped Thomson up.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.460
The way that the Court of Appeals
construed that second requirement

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.410
was critical.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.450
Two or more contributors
constitute joint authors

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.420
only if they all, quote, "fully
intended to be co-authors."

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:49.470
In other words, entertain in their
minds the concept of the joint authors.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.870
If any one of them did not have that
intention when the work was created,

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.720
a joint authorship does not emerge.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.980
Applying this standard, the
courts tried to ascertain

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.430
what had been the intention
of Larson and Thomson.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.430
Thomson's intentions were clear enough.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.960
She wanted to be a joint author.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.040
But she had to show that
Larson also had that in mind.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.810
This created an obvious problem.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.160
Larson was dead.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.440
So ascertaining his state of
mind would have been difficult.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.460
More generally, letting the
legal outcome in such cases

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.830
turn on the entirely private subjective
intention of one of the parties

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.710
seems at best an awkward way
of resolving the disagreement,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.830
because it would enable
one contributor--

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.780
by harboring a secret plan not to
create a joint authorship-- to defeat

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.360
the expectations of the others.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.900
To address both of these
concerns, the court

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.970
looked for objective
manifestations of Larson's state

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.560
of mind made before his death.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.390
Those manifestations, it
concluded, all suggested

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.890
that Larson did not
want to be a co-author.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.710
For example, he exercised a veto.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:06.100
In other words, he had final authority
over what lines went into the script.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.820
Another indicator was that the
playbill, over which Larson had control,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.800
described Larson himself
as the author/composer

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.060
and referred to Thomson
only as a dramaturg.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.710
When Larson entered into contracts
with the theater workshop,

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.670
he referred to himself as
the author, and so forth.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.480
These objective manifestations
of Larson's state of mind

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.300
were inconsistent, said the
courts, with an intention

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.880
to share authorship and thus,
fatal to Thomson's claim.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.300
The approach adopted
by the Court of Appeals

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.110
in the Rent case-- which is now
the authoritative interpretation

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.440
of joint authorship in the highly
influential Second Circuit--

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.530
makes it very difficult for a
contributor to a collective work

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.450
to qualify as a joint author.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.870
The reason is that no matter
how much he contributed,

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.350
his claims can be defeated if
any one of the other contributors

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:08.860
did not want to share authorship and
made that desire manifest in some way.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.770
To be sure, if all of the
contributors to a venture

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.320
not only put independently
copyrightable creations into the pot,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.860
but also think about
the legal status they

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.190
want to assume, decide to become
joint authors and say as much,

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.290
then they become joint authors.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:31.040
But if anyone opts out, joint
authorship does not ensue.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.750
Not all US courts handled this
issue in exactly the same way.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.060
In particular, the approach adopted
by the equally influential Court

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.320
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
is somewhat different in emphasis,

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.330
but the net effect of the
Ninth Circuit's approach

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.575
is equally unfavorable to persons
who seek joint authorship.

00:12:49.575 --> 00:12:52.400
 

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.140
Before considering possible
explanations for this hostility,

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.710
I need to finish the story of Rent.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.670
In the end, Thomson was not
left entirely in the cold.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.220
In a coda to its opinion,
the Court of Appeals

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.970
suggested that even though she
failed to qualify as a joint author,

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.220
she might conceivably be able to
assert an independent copyright

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.412
in the individual lines she
had contributed to the script.

00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:21.160
If so, the play could
not be publicly performed

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.390
without either securing her permission
or purging the script of those lines.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.270
Thomson had not raised this theory
at trial, and so the Court of Appeals

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.010
could not resolve it.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:38.190
But the Court of Appeals implied that
she might initiate a second lawsuit

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.530
on this entirely different basis.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.580
She of course did so,
whereupon Larson's heirs--

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.120
weary of this multi-year
fight-- settled the case.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.470
So in the end, Thomson got some
money-- how much remained confidential.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.660
And perhaps equally important to her,
she received credit, not as an author,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.780
to be sure, but as a
dramaturg on the title

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.820
page of the playbill, which
she had not had previously.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.900
But the outcome of this particular
story is not our main concern here.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.110
The key issue for our
purposes is the very high bar

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:22.180
that the courts have set for parties
interested in joint authorship.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.870
So why is the law so hostile to
the creation of joint authorship

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.290
arrangements?

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.270
One possible explanation is
that they are messy in the sense

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.920
that they can give rise to a
confusing pattern of entitlements

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.670
that are costly to unravel.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.710
For example, what if one joint
author grants to a licensee

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.640
an exclusive right to exploit
the work in a particular way

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.140
or in a particular region?

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.660
The example that Melville Nimmer
gives is an exclusive license

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.410
to show a film in a particular city.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:02.320
Then another joint author grants
an inconsistent, also ostensibly

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.510
exclusive, license to
a different licensee

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.480
to show the same film in the same city.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.200
Who has what rights?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.464
In the 2008 Sybersound case, which
involved a more idiosyncratic set

00:15:15.464 --> 00:15:17.630
of facts, the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.170
ruled that the first
licensee does not have

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.450
standing to assert its supposed
exclusivity because allowing

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:28.050
it to do so would, in effect, curtail
the privilege of the second, third,

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.440
and fourth joint authors.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.030
That reasoning may have
some logical appeal,

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.710
but it creates a host
of practical problems.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.650
The general point is that joint
authorship, by fragmenting ownership

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.150
of a copyright, can create
messy and hard to predict

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.670
patterns of legal rights.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.440
It's better, many economists
argue, to keep the legal rights

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.780
over any given resource-- in this
case, a copyright-- consolidated

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.490
in a single person or legal entity.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.620
In real property law, this
attitude underlies impediments

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.680
to the creation of
long-lasting servitudes,

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.890
meaning promises to use or not use land
in a particular way-- promises that

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.110
will bind not only the current
possessor of the land at issue,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.740
but also his or her successors.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.230
In copyright law, the
same attitude might

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.150
account for the
impediments the law creates

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.660
to the formation of joint authorships.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.600
 

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.320
A quite different explanation
emphasizes not the imperative

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.630
of economic efficiency, but the
history of the culture and ideology

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.129
out of which copyright law has emerged.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:46.920
This is an argument
has been developed most

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.400
richly by three historians
and copyright scholars--

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.030
Martha Woodmansee, Jaime
Boyle, and Peter Jaszi.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.610
Those scholars point
out that copyright law

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.710
emerged at approximately the same time
that the movement or ideology commonly

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.040
known as Romanticism took
root first in European culture

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.359
and then in the culture of many other
countries, including the United States.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.869
The scholars contend that there's a
causal connection between these two

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:20.440
developments-- in other words, that
copyright law was powered and shaped,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.420
at least in part, by Romanticism.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.660
One of many ways in which copyright
law bears the mark of Romanticism

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.100
is that the law, like Romanticism,
celebrates individual artists

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.985
and is skeptical of collaboration.

00:17:34.985 --> 00:17:37.890
 

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.370
This argument, if
well-founded, has implications

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.430
that reach far beyond the rules
governing joint authorship,

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.880
so I'll describe it
in a bit more detail.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.900
Woodmansee, Boyle, and Jaszi contend
that until the late 18th century

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:58.630
in Europe, writing was often,
in practice, done collectively

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.680
and neither popular nor elite
culture placed a high value

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:09.410
on the individual artist or author,
nor was innovation especially prized.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.550
Rather, from the Middle Ages
through the Renaissance, quote,

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.280
"Writing derived its value and
authority from its affiliation

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.050
with the text that preceded it--
its derivation rather than deviation

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.060
from prior texts," close quote.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.600
As an example of this
Romantic orientation,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.370
Woodmansee points to the
career of Samuel Johnson.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.130
Johnson, she observes, often
collaborated with other writers,

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.830
spent much of his time preparing
editions of other writers' works,

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.120
was not much interested
in claiming credit

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.570
for the ideas he provided
to other writers,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:51.230
and often took material from
other writers without attribution.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.150
Beginning in the mid 18th century in
both England and continental Europe,

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.680
there was a broad cultural shift away
from this set of attitudes toward one

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.990
that glorified individual
artistic genius.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:10.980
A new Romantic ideal emerged-- a
person who breaks free of the past

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.330
and develops an entirely
new idea, or at least

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.640
reworks existing material
in an entirely new way.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.350
This new ideal could be
found in and was popularized

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:30.530
by the work of Edward Young, Goethe,
Coleridge and above all, Wordsworth.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.210
Here's a passage from an
1815 essay by Wordsworth

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.540
that distills this new notion.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:44.560
"Of genius the only proof is, the act
of doing well what is worthy to be done,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.600
and what was never done before.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.800
Of genius and the fine arts,
the only infallible sign

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.950
is the widening of the
sphere of human sensibility,

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:58.330
for the delight, honor, and
benefit of human nature.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.590
Genius is the introduction of a new
element into the intellectual universe;

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.040
or, if that be not allowed,
it is the application

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.670
of powers to objects on which
they had not before been exercised

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.260
or the employment of
them in such a manner as

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.190
to produce effects hitherto unknown."

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.040
This attitude was certainly
not limited to writing.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.040
During this same period, individual
genius became the ideal in almost all

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.380
fields of artistic endeavour.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.460
Closely connected to that ideal was the
image of an artist or author as aloof

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.630
from the grubby business of
commercial and industrial life.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.820
The canonical image of
the creative process

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:44.010
became that of a solitary writer
or painter alone in the garret,

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:48.860
pouring out his soul on paper or canvas.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.370
Another closely related
idea is that of art

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.135
for art's sake-- disconnected
from both utility and politics.

00:20:56.135 --> 00:20:59.050
 

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.470
During the 19th century, this
collection of attitudes--

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.390
which together form the
heart of Romanticism--

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.610
was reinforced by the
broader ideological current

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.530
known as classical liberalism.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.600
We touched on this topic
briefly in lecture number one.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.670
Among the features of 19th
century classical liberalism

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.550
was a tendency to think of many
aspects of individual and social life

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:27.480
in terms of dichotomies--
sets of opposed polls.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.100
Such dichotomies included public
versus private-- in other words,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:39.420
government versus civil society-- self
versus other, facts versus values,

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.595
family versus market, and-- last
but not least-- art versus industry.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:47.370
 

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:52.560
Copyright law was taking shape
during this same historical period.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.690
It should not be
surprising that copyright

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.150
bears the imprint of these ideas.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.040
At the most general level,
the steady expansion

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.390
during the 19th century of the exclusive
entitlements enjoyed by a copyright

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.150
owner is attributable, at least
in part, to the glorification

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.300
of artists and authors
central to Romanticism.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.450
But many more specific doctrines in
copyright law also seem connected,

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:23.170
these scholars argue, to the
attitudes associated with Romanticism.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.760
Here's one.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.390
You'll recall from lecture number
three that the 19th century witnessed

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:33.960
an abstraction and extension of the
concept of the work to which copyright

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.000
attaches.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.210
Take a novel, for example.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:42.280
As late as the 1850s, the
protection enjoyed by a novel

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.920
was limited to its text--
the sequence of words

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.930
in which was originally captured.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.990
This attitude underlay a judicial
ruling that a German translation

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:59.810
of Uncle Tom's Cabin did not infringe
Harriet Beecher Stowe's copyright

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.840
because generated an
entirely different text.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.140
As Oren Bracha has shown, by
the end of the 19th century,

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.930
the thing to which copyright attached
was understood much more broadly.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.810
Here's a quote from his work.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.400
"At the dawn of the 20th century,
copyright's doctrinal terrain

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.690
came much closer to
the theoretical notion

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.650
of protecting an abstracted
intellectual essence,

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:31.660
irrespective of the many concrete
forms that it could take," close quote.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:36.940
This shift echoes, at least loosely, the
transition from the idea of writer as

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.840
craftsman to the Romantic
idea of writer as genius.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.460
A more intriguing possible
manifestation of the attitudes

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.170
associated with Romanticism
concerns the longstanding trouble

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.550
that copyright law
experienced when trying

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:58.060
to make sense of industrial design.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.340
As we saw-- again, in lecture number
three-- at least in the United States,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.860
the relevant rule is
that a useful article

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.720
enjoys copyright protection
only if-- and only

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.330
to the extent that-- its
aesthetic dimensions are

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.020
separable from its
functional dimensions.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:22.480
That doctrine of conceptual separability
is notoriously difficult to apply.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.490
Keith Aoki, a brilliant
copyright scholar

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.130
who tragically died
prematurely, suggested

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.585
that the roots of that
fraught doctrine lie

00:24:32.585 --> 00:24:34.760
in the dichotomy
between art and industry

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.620
that is characteristic
of Romanticism and was

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.600
reinforced by classical liberalism.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.680
 

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.340
We return, finally, to the
topic of this lecture segment.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.280
The possible connection between the
rules governing joint authorship

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.780
and Romanticism is
probably by now obvious.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.560
Romanticism celebrates the
individual artistic genius.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.720
It would not be surprising that the
legislators and judges who in the 19th

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.180
and earliest 20th centuries
shaped copyright law

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.510
should seek to confer the status and
economic privileges of authorship

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:15.760
upon a single person and should
be reluctant to acknowledge

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.750
the degree to which authors
frequently depend not just

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:25.830
upon assistants who execute their
orders-- as in the Titanic case--

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:29.640
but more importantly, upon collaborators
who contribute meaningfully

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.690
to the content of their
works and thus, arguably,

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.730
deserve some share of the credit and
the associated legal recognition.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.670
 

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:45.380
This contention-- as I say, pioneered
by Woodmansee, Boyle, and Yazsi--

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.370
that copyright laws in
Europe and the United States

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.780
has been influenced
in part by Romanticism

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.070
is lent credence by the contrasts
between the cultural and legal

00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:03.020
traditions in those countries and the
cultural and legal tradition in China.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.570
This contrast has been explored
most provocatively by my colleague

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.790
Bill Alford-- an expert on China
and its intellectual property laws,

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.940
in particular.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.020
Alford's great book--
entitled, ironically,

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:21.330
To Steal a Book Is an Elegant
Offense-- contends, among other things,

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:26.300
that China's resistance to the
adoption of Western copyright law

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.280
is attributable in part to the
absence of a Romantic tradition

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.855
in Chinese culture.

00:26:32.855 --> 00:26:34.730
While culture in Europe
and the United States

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.240
was being reshaped by
Romanticism, China, Alford argues,

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.350
remains steeped in the
Confucian tradition.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.300
Confucianism included,
among many other things,

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.820
a radically different conception
of art and creativity.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:58.010
Here's a passage from Alford's book,
summarizing this Confucian conception.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.410
"The power of the past and its
consequences for possession

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.840
of the fruits of intellectual endeavour
are well captured in the passage

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.540
in the Analects in which
Confucius indicates, quote,

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.180
'The master--'" in other
words, Confucius himself--

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.120
"'said "I transmit rather than create.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.240
I believe in and love the
ancients,"' close quote.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.510
The essence of human
understanding had long since

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:28.240
been discerned by those had gone before
and in particular by the sage rulers

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.760
collectively referred
to as the ancients, who

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.720
lived in a distant,
idealized golden age.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.730
To avail themselves
of the understanding,

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.020
in order to guide their own
behavior, subsequent generations

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.800
had to interact with the past in
a sufficiently thorough manner

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.570
so as to be able to transmit it.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.860
Yet, as Confucius demonstrated in
undertaking to edit the classics

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.180
and to comment on them in the
Analects, transmission-- far from being

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:59.750
a passive endeavor-- entailed
selection and adaptation if it

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:04.590
was to be meaningful to oneself, one's
contemporaries, and one's successors.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.460
The sense of the past's
compelling pertinence,

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.810
and of intellectual endeavour as the
medium through which interaction with

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.200
and transmission of it was possible,
permeated virtually all facets

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.500
of Chinese civilization.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.620
As the noted scholar of Chinese
literature, Stephen Owen, has observed,

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.290
'In the Chinese literary tradition,
the experience of the past roughly

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:30.700
corresponds to and carries the same
force as the attention to meaning

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:36.260
or truth in the Western tradition.'
Thus in classical Chinese literature,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.650
the past survives and warrants
consideration not merely as an obvious

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:45.360
foil for contemporary activity,
but more important, because, quote,

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.830
'the Confucian imperative insists
that in encountering the ancients,

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:55.500
we ourselves must be changed, for
we discover in the ancients not mere

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:02.620
means, but the embodiment
of values,' close quote."

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.300
It should not be surprising that
a country influenced heavily

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.270
by this vision should have been
reluctant to adopt a copyright

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:14.620
system centered on the image of
an individual artistic genius.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.320
And indeed, vestiges of that
resistance continue in China today.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.960
 

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.170
The line of scholarship
I've been discussing

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.500
has an important critical dimension.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.410
Thus far, I've been emphasizing
its explanatory side.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.880
If these scholars are correct,
the impact of Romanticism

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.520
helps us understand how
and why copyright law has

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.000
assumed its current form.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.450
But these scholars also contend
that the law as currently configured

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.010
is misguided-- even perverse.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.700
The image of author or artist
as individual creative genius

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.440
was rarely accurate, they
argue, even during its heyday.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.980
Since the 19th century,
these scholars contend,

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.850
it's become ever less
realistic as an account

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:07.870
of how most copyrighted
works are in fact generated.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.370
The way in which software is
commonly produced, for example,

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:15.920
bears little resemblance to the image
of the painter alone in the attic.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.520
The law, these scholars
argue, clings stubbornly

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.040
to an increasingly outmoded
vision of creativity

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.995
whose inaccuracy causes both
unfairness and misaligned incentives.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:35.280
Not all intellectual property
scholars are persuaded by this thesis.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.950
For example, Mark Lemley-- a leading
intellectual property scholar now

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:43.890
teaching at Stanford-- argues that many
important features of modern copyright

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:48.450
law cannot plausibly be traced to
Romanticism and instead are best

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:52.450
understood as efforts to advance
the kind of utilitarian objectives I

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.010
discussed in the previous lecture.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.720
One such feature is the
work for hire doctrine

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.810
to which we'll return
our attention shortly.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.630
Providing an optimal
pattern of incentives

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.540
for the creation and dissemination
of innovations-- that,

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:15.260
Lemley argues, is what copyright law
is and should be primarily about, not

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.610
celebrating individual artistic genius.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.630
This is an important debate.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.180
It will arise in various
other doctrinal contexts

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.980
we'll examine later in
this lecture series.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.470
By the end of the course,
I hope you're in a position

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:33.000
to make your own judgments
concerning the nature

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.750
and strength of the relationship
between the Romantic cultural movement

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.470
and copyright.
