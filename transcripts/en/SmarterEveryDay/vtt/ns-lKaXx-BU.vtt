Hey it's me Destin, welcome to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.030
Have you ever just sat down and taken a really close look at nuts? I've been doing that for the

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.050
last few minutes, and I've come up with some pretty interesting observations. I mean cashews

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.220
and peanuts have very similar taste and texture, but they're fundamentally

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.390
different. Chances are if you live in the western world, you know exactly what a peanut plant

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.570
looks like, but you probably have no clue what a cashew plant looks like. Why is that?

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.090
Aah so this is what a cashew looks like.
(African) Yeah it is a what a cashew looks like.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.800
(Destin) So is this.. do you eat this part?

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.930
Is this the nut?
-No this one. [...] you need get

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.090
dry. You gon take this and take it inside your fire, so you

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.100
after, there is a food inside, of this. Yeah.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.120
(Destin) What about this? Can you eat this?
-Yeah this one you want to eat it
(Destin) It's a fruit? -yeah

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.280
(Destin) So that's cashew fruit. -yeah
And this is the cashew nut? -Cashew nut yeah

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.330
Aah. -If you want you can plant this. If you plant it, you have a cashew.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.520
So cashew nut, cashew fruit. What does this taste like? Can I bite it? - yeah you can bite it

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.700
Is it good?

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.040
It's very good.. hmm.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.200
Sweet. Very sweet.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.380
I've never seen that before. See I didn't know that there was a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.580
fruit. And these are cashew trees. Yeah I see.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.660
If you don't know what a cashew plant looks like, it's because

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.820
you've never seen one because they don't grow in the climate where you're at.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.010
Like most awesome foods, cashews were introduced to the Europeans

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.180
after the Spanish conquistadors came over, and they discovered it in South America

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.200
and Central America. They discovered cashews, peanuts, chocolate, vanilla, strawberries,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.250
pineapples. Basically everything you need for a good banana split, except

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.280
the cow. I.. I thought it was interesting. Hope you're getting Smarter Every Day. I'm Destin. Bye.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.320
Are you as fast as a rabbit? -nup

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.500
He's as fast as a rabbit? -he's not [...]

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.680
-he was lying down on [...]

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.980
When it's hot they can't move. -Yeah they can move, but you know sometimes..

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.950
They're like squirrels. Do you know

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.090
what a squirrel is. They're like squirrels in America.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.250
We hunt squirrel where I come from. Yep. We eat them.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.410
-it's nice?

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.410
uh No. It's not nice. It tastes bad.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.968
