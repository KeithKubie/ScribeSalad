00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.030
&gt;&gt; Becky Brasington Clark:
Good evening and welcome.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.330
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.630
&gt;&gt; Becky Brasington
Clark: Thank you for that.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.930
Let's try that again.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.230
Good evening and welcome.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.530
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.830
&gt;&gt; Becky Brasington
Clark: Thank you.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.330
My name is Becky Brasington
Clark and I have the privilege

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.440
of directing The Library of
Congress publishing office.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.130
We're delighted to see this
crowd here, particularly

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.430
on such a beautiful day.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.110
After such cold weather that you
actually chose to come inside

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.960
and stay inside for a
while is really a testament

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.360
to your conviction
in this program.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.550
Tonight in celebration
of the 60th Anniversary

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.010
of National Library
Week, we're delighted

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.780
to welcome Dr. Kenneth Breisch,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.830
author of American
Libraries 1730 to 1950.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.880
Dr. Breisch's book is the latest
in the acclaimed Norton Library

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.060
of Congress Visual Source
Book in American Architecture,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.970
Design, and Engineering series.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.120
This series is a project of
the Center for architecture,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.200
design and engineering in
The Library of Congress,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.270
which was established
through a bequest

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.860
from a distinguished American
architect, Paul Rudolph,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.620
to support the library's
preservation of collection items

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.700
in these fields and to
increase public knowledge

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.270
of and access to them.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.390
Following Dr. Breisch's talk,
The Emeritus founding director

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.400
of the center, Ford
Petross (assumed spelling),

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.990
will say few words
about the architecture

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.550
of The Jefferson Building
and give you some insight

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.050
into what you're about to
see on the post lecture tour.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.310
I want to thank, offer a few
thanks before introducing

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.610
Dr. Breisch.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.810
First of all, Nancy
Green [assumed spelling],

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.160
the series editor
at W.W. Norton,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.260
who worked on this series
for many, many years

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.500
and was a real inspiration

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.030
and driving force behind
the books in this series.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.400
And she can't hear us,
because she's not here tonight,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.490
but she knows how much we
appreciate her great work

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.400
on this series.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.920
And also want to thank library
colleagues who came together

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.600
to make this evening possible,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.970
especially Helena
Zincon [phonetic],

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.680
Mary Nakahara [phonetic],
Barbara Natenson [phonetic],

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.190
Ford Petross, Jamal
Forbes [assumed spelling],

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.010
Steve Hersch, Brett
Cronell [phonetic],

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.310
Katherine Blood [assumed
spelling],

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.940
Laura Chipchick [phonetic],
Mary Mundy, Melissa Lindbergh,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.220
Donna Collins, Cheryl
Kennedy [assumed spelling],

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.320
Peggy Wagner, Susan
Rayburn, Amy Hess,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.860
Hannah Friese [assumed
spelling],

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.160
Cheryl Lowe [assumed spelling],

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.460
and Sean Miller [assumed
spelling].

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.180
And I'm sure I"ve missed
a couple of people,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.820
and for that I offer
groveling apologizes.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.500
Finally it's a pleasure

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.630
to introduce our speaker,
Dr. Kenneth Breisch.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.220
Dr. Breisch is an associate
professor in the School

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.880
of Architecture at
the University

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.530
of Southern California.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.310
He's the former director
and founder

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.250
of USC's graduate program
in heritage conservation.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.970
He has taught at CY ARK
[phonetic], the University

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.450
of Delaware, and the
University of Texas at Austin.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.200
He is the author of
Henry Hobson Richardson

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.140
and the Small Public
Library in America

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.500
and the Los Angeles
Central Library,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.440
Building an Architectural
Icon, 1872 through 1933.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.490
We had the privilege of
chatting with Dr. Breisch

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.270
for a few minutes while he
was pre-signing the books,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.510
which are available for
purchase in the back.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.490
And we learned that he
has been kind of obsessed

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.390
with libraries for
many, many years.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.850
And among Library of
Congress employees,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.730
that's a great badge
of distinction.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.510
So without further adieu,
Dr. Kenneth Breisch.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.890
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.590
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Breisch:
Thanks, Becky.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.560
The truth be told, I just like
hanging out with librarians.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:01.230
Well, you've thanked many of
the people I was going to thank,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.600
but I should repeat
at least briefly.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.830
I want to thank you, Becky, and
Ford Petross and Helena Zincon

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.390
in the department of
prints and photographs,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.670
Amy Hess in the publishing
office,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.270
who did an amazing job tracking

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:27.230
down with her eagle eye the
details in terms of the URLs

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.410
for all of the illustrations
which you'll see in the book.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.070
Nancy Green at Norton,
and then Daniel Greenberg

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.930
and Susan Steinhouser,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.960
who actually helped
subsidize the book

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.480
with their foundation
in Los Angeles.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.830
And so I'm very grateful
to them.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.900
And then Katy Horack
[assumed spelling],

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.990
who was one of my
graduate students,

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.470
was a graduate student
many years ago

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.220
when the book was started, who
helped me get going on the book.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.090
This lecture is going to be
very general and just a kind

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.610
of introduction, I think,
to what's in the book.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.980
But also the book itself is
intended as an introduction

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.830
to illustrations
in the departments

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.470
of prints and photographs.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.120
Or the division, I should
say, of prints and photographs

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.790
at The Library of Congress.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.930
And so the images were chosen

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.040
from what they have
in their collections.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.000
Hence, which is a
question I get often,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.520
why the book ends in 1950.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.970
They're now collecting
more images of post 1950

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.370
or post World War II buildings,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.390
but there just were
not enough images

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.420
to really make an
argument for the history

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.660
of post World War II
library buildings.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.270
Additionally, maybe
I should be grateful

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.630
that they didn't
have the images,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.420
because as of now I think there
are almost 17,000 public library

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.230
buildings alone in
the United States.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.950
That includes branch
libraries, large libraries.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.010
And that's not including,
of course, college,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.680
university libraries, et cetera.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.600
So maybe, as I say,
I should be thankful

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.330
that I had an excuse not
to try to deal with that.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.920
But they do have wonderful
resources, and that's one

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.880
of the purposes of the book.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.320
They have the Carol
Highsmith collection.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.810
She's the one who's filling
in now the post war images.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.020
And you'll see some of
those at the end of my book,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.630
beautiful color photographs.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.800
The Detroit Publishing
Company Archives,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.030
the Farm Security
Administration,

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.850
the Gottscho-Schleisner
Collection.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.500
Theodor Horydczak,
I think collection,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.240
if I'm pronouncing
that correctly.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.970
And, of course, the Historical
American Building Survey

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.540
and many others that
I used as a source

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.840
of reference for this book.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.080
I can't see exactly, but
that should be right, yes.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.630
I'll trust that we're on
the right slides here.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.640
It's especially a privilege,
I think, to be speaking

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.890
about libraries in The
Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.060
Thomas Jefferson, as you
know, believed fervently

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.060
in public education and
education as the foundation

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.140
for American Democracy.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.710
And one of the primary focuses

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.960
of his philosophical program was
the founding of the University

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.070
of Virginia as a public
educational institution.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.610
And the centerpiece
of that campus,

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.120
of that enlightenment inspired
campus, was the rotunda

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.090
or the library replacing
what actually in Europe

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.390
and the United States,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.600
that's the early colleges,
had been the chapel.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.430
So it reflects his, as I say,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.180
enlightenment interests
in education.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.940
Libraries of course extend far,
much further into the past than,

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.030
of course, Jefferson, back to
the legendary of course Library

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:22.240
of Alexandria 300 BC in the
Tolamase [phonetic] and then

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.610
up through the Middle Ages

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.660
in the next Kodex
Amiotus [phonetic],

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.900
which shows Ezra
writing the law.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.340
This was published in
the late 16th Century,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.640
as I think you can see.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.550
I find it really fascinating

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.280
in that the fundamental
requirements

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.580
of the library have really
changed very little over time.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.600
This could almost
be a computer carol,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.780
except that there
are books there.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.520
But you have to have ample
storage for your collections,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.470
depending upon the size, a quiet
comfortable well lit hopefully

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.650
place to read or now to
access your computer,

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.510
although I still read.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.250
And then as libraries became
larger, of course stations

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.550
or desks for the distribution of
books or the charging of books

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.430
for the distribution of
information to library patrons.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.760
And then as we know at The
Library of Congress a variety,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.820
a great variety of spaces

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.690
for administrative activities
sorting books, repairing books,

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.650
and just bureaucratic work
in many different ways.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:43.450
So libraries can
really come in any kind

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.780
of size, shape, or form.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.690
We have Roy's wonderful library.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.610
Ansel Adams was commissioned

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.910
to document the internment camp
during World War II at Manzanar,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:03.140
where there were 100,000
Japanese, or 10,000 at Manzanar,

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.760
but interned during the war.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.240
Roy Tucano [phonetic]
actually was the editor

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.680
of the camp newspaper,
and this is his library

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.240
which you can imagine was
very, very precious to him.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.230
And I find it fascinating
too, that while Ansel Adams,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.370
a great American photographer,
was recording the architecture

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:30.160
in the camp that he zeroed in
on this small but, as I say,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.300
very precious kind of
collection of books.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.800
This, of course, is a private
collection and it's one

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.890
of a variety of different types
of libraries that are talked

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.190
about the in the book.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.700
The Loganian Library, which
you can see here, I think,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.990
is in a way a descendant
or related

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.280
to Benjamin Franklin's Library
Company of Philadelphia,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.750
which he founded in 1731.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.570
But James Logan's library
was a private collection,

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.120
probably the largest or nearly
the largest in the country

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.310
at the time numbering
some 2,600 volumes.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.490
And he built this small
building to house it.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.310
It's the first actually,
I think,

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.900
purpose built public library

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.400
or library building
in the United States.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.230
He made his money
in the fur trade.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.570
He was a close associate
of the Penn family,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.100
one of the wealthiest
people in the country.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.740
But he allowed scholars
and others into the library

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.190
to use the collection.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.400
It's one, of course, of dozens

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.420
of private libraries
here in Washington.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.540
The Folger-Shakespeare
Library, for example.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.830
But the Morgan Library,
The Huntington Library

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:53.000
in Los Angeles, all of
which are private libraries

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.310
that housed collections that
were accumulated by individuals

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.630
who loved books and then for
the most part opened them

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.650
up to scholars and the public.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.880
But these libraries, to me,
remind me often of a quote

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:16.030
in Alberto Manuel's book,
The Library at Night,

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.100
which if you don't know it,
you should, in which he writes

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.210
in the introduction, "No one's
stepping," and this could apply

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.510
to many, many libraries,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.310
but especially these
research libraries, I think.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.060
"No one's stepping for the
first time into a room made

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.580
of books can know
instinctively how to behave.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.100
What is expected?

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.400
What is promised?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.780
What is allowed?

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.650
One may be overcome by horror
at the clutter or the vastness,

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.790
the stillness, the
mocking reminder

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.610
of everything one doesn't
know, the surveillance.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.940
And some of that overwhelming
feeling may cling on even

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.240
after the rituals and
conventions are learned,

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.960
the geography mapped, the
natives found friendly."

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.160
I feel that way about
my research often,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.310
and the natives are always
found friendly eventually.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.050
But it can be intimidating
certainly

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:21.040
to enter a foreign territory
and foreign libraries.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.900
The book also has a chapter
on The Library of Congress.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.450
We'll be fortunate
today to see parts of it

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.400
that I haven't seen actually and
that many people haven't seen.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.210
But as you probably know,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.010
I think you're all nadens
[phonetic] of the Library

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:43.620
of Congress, but it was
founded in 1800 by legislation,

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.360
by Congress, and then
burned in the War of 1812,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:57.400
in 1814 actually, and owes
it resurgence in large part,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.130
at that time, to Thomas
Jefferson again, who in 1815,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.680
in debt as he often was,
sold his library of some five

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.980
or six thousand books.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.050
Some of them have survived
to The Library of Congress.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.960
There was grumbling on the
part of the Congressmen

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.890
as to why they would be spending
money, especially on books

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.050
that they couldn't read because
many were in Latin or Greek

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.930
or other, French even,
foreign languages.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.570
Things don't change much,
I guess, in some ways.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:31.500
But that forms the core
of a real research library

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.930
for Congress, the government,
but also other individuals.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:44.860
Eventually in 1851, a
new structure was built

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.490
in the library to
house the books.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.150
This is by Thomas Eustic Walter.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.820
It was a fireproof
iron construction,

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.340
because there had been a second
fire just previous to this

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.770
in which many of Jefferson's
books actually were

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.000
unfortunately destroyed
as well as other books.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.760
This served as The
Library of Congress really

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.120
up until it was replaced by this
building, which began actually

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.330
to be contemplated
in the early 1870s,

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.630
the proliferation of books.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.270
And the Copyright Act, which
required books to be placed

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.810
in The Library of Congress,

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.780
meant that this small library
was very quickly outgrown

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:27.350
so that in 1873 Congress
authorized a competition

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.080
for the new Library of Congress.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.880
Here you can see an entry
by Alexander Este actually

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.840
in the collection and
prints and photographs.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.200
There are dozens and
dozens of these drawings.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.450
This will have to
do for an exterior.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.390
It's the late 19th Century.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:51.050
You can imagine every eclectic
style was submitted by good

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.370
and not so good architects.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.470
The idea though, was to model it

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.950
on the British Museum
Reading Room.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:04.800
And most of the entries had a
rotunda or circular reading room

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.880
at the center of the collection.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.180
This is by John Frazier.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.610
These are just examples.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.560
The next is a detail.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.670
I think we're lucky we got what
we got, and not this perhaps,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.270
but this was his proposal
for the reading room

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:24.230
which ultimately as designed by
Smith, Myer and Pelts beginning

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.470
with their final designs.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:31.170
They actually entered the
early competition in 1888,

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.980
resulted in the reading
room that we have today

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.340
that you're all familiar with.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.010
But it really only forms a
central focus of the library.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:48.110
Something we'll see today are
the stacks that open up around

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:53.630
that library, stacks there
were designed to hold millions

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.560
of books, one of the largest
libraries at the time.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.530
And also a very modern library

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.840
with equipment designed
by Bernard Green.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.960
Conveyor belts, pneumatic tubes
to convey orders from patrons

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.170
to librarians in the
shelves or in the stacks,

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.840
and then they would be
loaded onto conveyors

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.410
and delivered back
to the delivery room.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.060
So I find that interesting
as well, when we talk

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.840
about modern technology
in the library,

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.620
that it's really not all
that new to some extent,

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.220
although they didn't have
computers certainly at the time.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.610
There are other types
of libraries

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.610
that form their own
chapters in the books.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.420
Society Libraries.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.950
These were private libraries
that were actually founded

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.870
by individuals who pooled their
money, often paid an annual

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.800
or monthly fee to be
members of the library.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.030
This is The Redwood Library
in Newport, Rhode Island,

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.690
the earliest surviving
building related

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.860
to a Society Library sometimes
called Athenaea [phonetic].

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.940
Sometimes they were in
basements of churches.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.970
Other times they
did have buildings.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.690
But these were put together,
as I say, by individuals.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.010
Not just men, but women as well.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.830
Women, as we move
into the 19th Century,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.720
became the great
readers and reading clubs

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.460
and library clubs actually
formed the foundation

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.760
or the basis for many

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.670
of the public libraries
in the United States.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.750
They were dissolved in the
collections given to the city

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:31.380
or the public library when
that became available.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.720
And public libraries form
a major focus of the book.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.960
As I say, we're just
skimming the surface here.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.490
Here from a book recording the
reception of George Peabody

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.440
at The Peabody Institute
in 1856.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.250
George Peabody was an
American financier in London,

00:18:53.250 --> 00:19:02.850
actually a patron of Morgan as
well, who in 1852 gave $20,000

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.900
to his native village of
South Danvers in 1868,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.700
renamed Peabody,
Massachusetts in his honor.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.830
He arrived in 1856.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.330
And all of the children
led him through the town

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.720
with processions and speeches,
and a great celebration.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.210
This happened dozens
and dozens of times all

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.860
across the United States
in the 19th Century.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.140
The public libraries
were very often endowed

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.610
by wealthy individuals who gave
money back to their communities

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:37.570
with mixed motives, I
suppose, but it did establish

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.460
by 1900 some 500
library buildings,

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.940
public library buildings
in the United States.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.880
These grew in size.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.600
Here the Peabody
Institute in Baltimore,

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.960
one of the great hall libraries
and one of the only ones

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.590
that survive actually.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:05.000
Great cast-iron structure again
to be fireproof built in 1855.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.210
There were others such as
The Boston Public Library,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.790
the first one before
the one we know today,

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.900
which you can see here, which
was also a hall library.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.380
These are primarily reference
libraries, academic libraries.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.670
The books were fenced off.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.110
The librarians would get them
for you, but you could read them

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.610
if you had the proper
introduction often

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.120
in the center of the room.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.000
The Boston Public Library
has a whole other history,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.440
however in the basement was
a public lending library

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:40.530
where it was decided that they
would lend books free of charge

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.340
to any citizen of Boston.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.520
There was a lot of
debate about that,

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.150
whether they'd ever
see the books again,

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.820
whether they'd come back
filthy or with diseases.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.320
There was even debate about
closing off the lending library

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.030
at one point because the workers
were all coming in unshowered

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:06.910
and quite odiferous, I
guess, smelly at the time.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.030
Justin Windsor, the
long-time librarian,

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.330
the founding librarian

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:15.080
at The Boston Public Library
argued strongly against that.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.220
He said put in a new ventilation
system, which they did,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:23.110
and so it remained a
great public library.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.790
The second library in Boston,
which you can see here,

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.770
of course marks the end of the
19th Century or the beginning

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.310
of what's often referred to
as The American Renaissance,

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:41.660
a new or neo-classical revival
that swept across the country.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:46.380
Did you show the
reading room already?

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.750
Yeah, okay, that's fine.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.050
You saw the reading room.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.350
It actually was modeled

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.380
on the Bibliothec Juan
[foreign language] in Paris,

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.340
but you can see that even here

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.710
in the United States it became
even more sort of neo-classical

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.060
than this French library
of the mid 19th Century.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.000
There were smaller
public libraries as well.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.520
Henry Hobson Richardson,
out of Boston,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.260
really created an important
prototype in part based

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.560
on the Bibliothec Juan
[foreign language].

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.690
I don't have a pointer, and
even if I did you can leave

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.090
that there for the moment.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.210
You can see that the book
wing actually derives

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.390
and is an Americanized
kind of version

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.500
of the Bibliothec
[foreign language].

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.140
Book wings for storage areas,
up until this time they were

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:35.720
at the back of the building as
just rooms for storing books.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.840
Richardson rotated it around
so you could identify this

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.050
as a library as well
a public library

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.750
with a grand kind of entryway.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.200
Richardson was working in
the later 19th Century.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.760
By the end of the century,
smaller libraries also.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.460
Just an example of his impact,
and then the next one, I guess.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.570
By the late 19th Century
and early 20th Century,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.270
small libraries too
were taking on a neo-

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.050
classical kind of format.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:13.260
This is a beautiful little
building in a very small town

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.360
in Massachusetts; in
Conway, Massachusetts

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.650
up in the northern
part of the state.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:24.060
It's a great surprise to find it
at the end of the Main Street.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.400
It was built by Marshall Field,
who was born in Conway and,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.500
of course, moved to Chicago

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.100
and founded the great
department store empire.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.950
And he gave this back
to the community.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.630
It's by Shepley,
Rutan and Coolidge,

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.930
who were the successor
firm to Richardson.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.730
But you can see how the
style shifted at this point.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:47.480
And the plan itself
begins to take the form,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.220
although it will become more and
more open in the 20th Century

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.160
of typical small public
libraries in the first decade

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.190
or two of the 19th Century with
the reading rooms to either side

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.230
of a central charging
desk or librarian's desk.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.770
There were larger
libraries as well

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.400
that reflect this
new neo-classism,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.260
but also the growing
importance of public libraries.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.920
The Boston Public Libraries
have kicked things off,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.980
but then of course we have the
great New York Public Library

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.150
by Carrere and Hastings designed

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.290
by its librarian,
John Shaw Billings.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:30.120
Reading room covers actually
a quarter acre of space,

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.260
and was set atop
in the next slide.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.830
You can see from the back, set
atop the stacks which had all

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.070
of the same kinds of
conveyor belts and tubes

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.430
and other things, but now
the books could just rise

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.440
up to the central delivery
area in the library.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.980
But again I find it interesting
this faces, of course,

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.810
the park, Bryant Park.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.550
But you can identify this
immediately as a library,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.400
because you can recognize, if
you know what you're looking at,

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:07.110
the stacks that are an
integral part of the library.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.650
In New York, it was joined
in the early 20th Century

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:18.670
by over 60 branch libraries
actually in around 1901.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:24.110
Andrew Carnegie gave the
city 5.2 million dollars

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.090
to build 67 neighborhood
libraries,

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.550
which really became the
focus of his attention.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:33.960
He wanted to educate the working
classes and Americanize them.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.980
He had probably mixed
motives as well.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.160
But the branch libraries were
a big part of his program,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.530
but not of course the only part.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.630
Everybody knows Carnegie
Libraries.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.330
Oh, there's Mr. Carnegie.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:54.910
And then the next, oh, which
marks the beginning really

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.510
of his library building program.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.960
He began in 1886
to build buildings

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.740
in his steel mill towns.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.090
Again as a giving
back to the community,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.090
but also placating the
workers' homestead.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.090
Some of you know perhaps
now because of the library,

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.780
but because of the strike,
a very violent strike.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.000
This was built shortly
afterwards and it was intended

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.130
as a community center
that was an auditorium,

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.610
a swimming pool, a library.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.910
And then the next, Marion the
Librarian would probably be

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.540
appalled, but a pool
hall as well,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:33.780
which did not become a
regular part of his program.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.010
As he began to offer
money for the construction

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.180
of public libraries to any
community in the United States

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.660
which would agree to fund
the library, the maintenance

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.890
of the library and
perpetuity at 10 percent

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.290
of the cost of the building.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.660
So if he gave $10,000
for a building,

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.480
there had to be legislation
to make sure

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:04.300
that there was $1,000 a year to
buy books and to pay salaries,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.350
and maintain the building.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.900
Carnegie was a great
believer in self help.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.790
He wasn't going to
give you everything.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:17.390
He wrote an essay, a famous
essay in 1889 called Wealth,

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:22.910
in which he argued that you
could help but people had

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.510
to help themselves ultimately.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.500
And they did, and they helped
themselves to his libraries,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.620
I guess, Nebraska up there.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.670
They spread all across.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.970
&gt;&gt; Iowa?

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.010
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Breisch:
I'm sorry, yeah, Iowa.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.410
That's one that should be there.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:44.710
Spread all across the
country due to his largest.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:51.260
Between 1889 and 1900, he
endowed 37 new library buildings

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.730
in the United States including
the old Washington Public

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.130
Library, which many of you
know, which I think is going

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.220
to resurrected finally, I hear.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.100
And then by 1917, the
outbreak of the war,

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:10.930
when his program ended, he
had built 1,679 libraries

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:15.460
in the Unites States spreading
in large part this kind of neo-

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.360
classical style to
these small communities

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.350
where these buildings
really stood

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:26.770
out as monumental structures
within the community as symbols

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:32.320
of culture and learning as well.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:39.120
So in some ways perhaps,
you know, Carnegie led.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.190
His endowment led to things.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.920
He didn't really
expect necessarily,

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.610
but it spread the public
library movement all

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.480
across the United States.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.030
And through his personal
secretary,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.460
modern library design.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.330
James Bertram, in 1911,
who actually answered all

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.170
of the correspondence
from everybody

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.880
who asked for a library.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.050
As I say, almost
1,700 were built.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:11.350
There are dozens of reels
of microfilm at Columbia

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.640
of his correspondence
that survived.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.770
It's actually quite
amusing sometimes.

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.850
He and Carnegie were
great believers along

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:23.010
with the librarian, Melville
Dewey, in spelling reform,

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.520
which you can perhaps
see on this slide.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.600
But he published this short
pamphlet, in which he said

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.300
that these diagrams were
intended to be suggestive rather

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:40.060
than mandatory for communities
that wanted to build libraries.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.180
Nowhere do they say they
should be classical,

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.500
but that was the style at the
time for a number of reasons

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.730
that we don't have
time to go into.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:53.190
But ultimately his
goal was, as he says,

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.340
to obtain for the money the
utmost amount of effective,

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.490
and that's not a misspelling,
accommodation consistent

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.710
with good taste in building.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:08.390
And his correspondence
follows that, that scheme.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.930
But it introduced this
idea of the open plan

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.230
for the public library.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.460
So that the librarian from the
central charging desk could keep

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.490
an eye on everybody in the
library as well as the books

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.040
at the rear of the building,
depending on the size.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:30.710
Carnegie also endowed many
academic libraries including the

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.980
Tuskogee Institute Library,
which you see here designed

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:40.110
by the professor of architecture
there, Robinson Robert Taylor.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.960
Here a view of Carnegie
with Booker T. Washington

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:51.100
and others celebrating
that particular library.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.400
So academic libraries
are another story.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.600
We saw the exterior
of the rotunda.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.760
One of the ideas of
the book is to look

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.400
at the different configurations
and planning of libraries,

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.910
which you could get some
sense of tonight perhaps.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.810
Here is a circular library,

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.210
which Jefferson designed
as a rotunda.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.930
Or the first library at Harvard,
what was the largest library

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.300
in the country at the
time, Gorhall at Harvard,

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:25.090
which was designed to
hold 100,000 books.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.480
The Boston Atheneum,
another private library,

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.820
was almost equivalent.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.920
Josiah Quincy, the
president at the time,

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.440
for some reason celebrated this
and asked that it be designed

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:44.080
in the gothic style saying
that it was designed somewhat

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.990
in the form of the chapels
of many Catholic churches.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.410
And I've never been
able to figure

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.200
out why Protestant
Harvard would be interested

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.630
in Catholic churches, but
you can see here an example

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.520
of a hall library
and the exterior.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.360
It looks like a gothic church.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.280
Academic libraries, of course,

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.670
led the way in terms
of expansion.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.530
One of the largest earlier
libraries was The Sterling

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.730
Memorial Library at Yale.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.030
James Gambell Rogers,

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.010
who designed many
other buildings there,

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:20.970
here you can see how
he displays the size

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:25.890
of the 5 million volume
collection this was intended

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.910
to hold in 16 tiers
of metal stacks,

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.570
which again are indicated on
the exterior by this great kind

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.420
of tower, I guess, to compete

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.960
with Harvard probably
in terms of size.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.120
The section on libraries
ends with Frank Lloyd Wright,

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.860
who did design not just the
Guggenheim, but the Roux Library

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.840
at Florida Southern
College in Lakeland,

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.580
which you can see here
just before the war.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.330
The reading room is fascinating.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:04.290
The reading room
is the next there,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.590
which again is centralized.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:11.430
Actually perhaps even, although
Wright would deny it, I'm sure,

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:15.400
a kind of reflection of
Jefferson's library at Virginia,

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.020
although much more
organic and lyrical

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.620
than the classicism
of Jefferson.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.370
Great drama, sweeping
curbs in the interior.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:30.600
So that really kind of
covers the focus of the book.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.900
There's an afterward.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.370
I felt it necessary
to include some

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.410
of the late great masterpieces,

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:41.750
almost all photographed
again by Carol.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:46.640
There's, of course, the
great Beinecke Library

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.910
to hold the Beinecke Collection
of Rare Books at Yale.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:55.030
Louis Kahn's Phillips Exeter
Academy again look back

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.760
to the hall library
tradition, but with a great kind

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.320
of explication of the
structure of the building,

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.890
really incredible interior.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.470
And then finally
we can end with one

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:11.560
of the recent again
masterpieces,

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.680
but a new experiment in
terms of library design.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:21.620
The Seattle Public Library, by
Rem Koolhaas, which is designed

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.560
by a series of ramps
which sort of spiral

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.550
up in a rectangular way from
what he calls the living room

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:36.900
through a series of bookshelves
and computer spaces designed

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:42.290
to hold 1.4 million volumes.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.110
It opens up looking out
over the City of Seattle,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.180
especially from the tenth floor

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.900
where the reading
room is located.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.790
Again really in the tradition
of The Boston Public Library

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:57.230
in some ways, but of
course in a very modern

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.830
and progressive kind of style.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:03.900
So that's sort of it,
for a kind of overview.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.300
If you have questions, I
don't know if we have time

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.160
for questions because
we have tours lined up.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.960
Did I get through it?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:22.040
[ Background Conversations ]

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.670
&gt;&gt; The whole library actually.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.970
It's not so much
the whole library.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.230
It's sort of later,
modern planning.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.530
But, yeah, that would
be part of it.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.390
The librarian could keep
an eye on everything.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.500
But it was a style
that actually developed

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.220
in the early Renaissance period.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.570
The Ambrosian Library
in Milan was one

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.750
of the first hall libraries.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:46.300
I think it was just a
way of stacking the books

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.550
around the reading room, as much
as anything, and enclosing it.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.320
And collections were
beginning to grow.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.330
So they needed more space,

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.440
especially for The Ambrosian
Library, which was one

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.070
of the largest at the time.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:00.600
But it became one of
the early typologies

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.650
for American Public
Libraries, which you can see

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.970
in the book after,
you know, 1860 or so.

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:11.130
Any other?

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.930
Yes, ma'am.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:19.420
[ Background Conversations ]

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.510
In terms of form,
yes, to some extent.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:25.750
But we were the great library
builders, really, I think.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:29.520
The idea, and maybe this doesn't
quite answer your question.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.190
But the idea of the public
lending library was invented

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.710
in the United States,
and it's one

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.420
of the great inventions along
maybe with National Parks

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.380
that we gave to the
world, I suppose.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.960
European Libraries are
much more restrictive.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.420
And, of course, in more
autocratic countries, you know,

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.860
the rulers didn't want people
reading books, you know.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.060
So there wasn't a
proliferation of libraries.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.450
There were academic libraries,

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:59.470
like the Bibliothec [foreign
language] for students.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:00.770
They're even suspicious of that,

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.860
because the students
would take to the streets.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.900
But for the most part,
collections were private

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.710
and so not on the same scale.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.660
You know, there are
some exceptions,

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:18.850
but I think we really developed
this whole idea of the library

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.640
as really the centerpiece not
just of, you know, learning

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.720
and democracy, but of
culture and community

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.680
which is something I
didn't talk a lot about.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.470
But it's kind of interesting

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.150
that public libraries
are returning

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.870
to the idea of the Athenaea.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.410
They never really gave it up.

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:41.550
But these are places for
showing films, for story hour

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.370
for younger patrons,
but for lectures

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.730
and other community
kinds of events as well

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.920
as now computer access.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.850
Any other?

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:58.850
&gt;&gt; How many of the libraries
have you seen personally?

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.450
Me? I don't know.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:02.750
I lost count, lost
track long ago.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.180
I've been doing this
for way too long.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.740
It's just they all blend
together after a while,

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.360
maybe like mush in my head.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.660
I don't know.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:16.370
A lot. But as I say, there are
now, you know, almost 17,000

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.320
of these little guys around.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.230
So I've a long way to
go, although I may turn

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.840
to other things one
of these days.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.070
Is there another?
