FRED SAUER: Let's see.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.270
So how viable or recommended
would it be to build a backend

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.902
service for mobile apps around
Google Cloud Endpoints?

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:09.358
MANDY WAITE: All right.

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:09.814
OK.

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:13.920
So I think really that's
probably the biggest use case

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.658
for Cloud Endpoints, building
mobile backends.

00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:19.770
And when we say backends, again,
we're talking about the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.646
general sense of it,
rather than the App

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.000
Engine sense of backends.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.590
If you want to build an
application that will provide

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.910
resources and services that
are consumed by mobile

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.100
devices, then Cloud Endpoints
will do that for

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.365
you out of the box.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:35.250
I think pretty much we covered
most of that in the slides.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.407
But the documentation's pretty
extensive, both for Java and

00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:39.124
for Python.

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:41.285
So if you want to find out more
about how to use Cloud

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:43.590
Endpoints, you can
check that out.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.370
And there's also a Google I/O
talk last year, wasn't there?

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.880
FRED SAUER: There was, yes.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.650
MANDY WAITE: So you can
actually get a lot of

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.450
information from the
Google I/O sessions

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.590
from previous years.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.780
FRED SAUER: Very good.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.170
All right.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.770
Your turn.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.020
MANDY WAITE: My turn.
