00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:10.722
In Islamic culture, 
geometry is everywhere.

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:16.294
You can find it in mosques,
madrasas, palaces and private homes.

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:22.141
This tradition began in the 8th century CE
during the early history of Islam,

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:26.710
when craftsmen took preexisting motifs
from Roman and Persian cultures

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.208
and developed them into new forms
of visual expression.

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:35.159
This period of history was a golden age
of Islamic culture,

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.044
during which many achievements 
of previous civilizations

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:40.740
were preserved and further developed,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.522
resulting in fundamental advancements
in scientific study and mathematics.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:50.860
Accompanying this was an increasingly
sophisticated use of abstraction

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.979
and complex geometry in Islamic art,

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.740
from intricate floral motifs
adorning carpets and textiles,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.887
to patterns of tilework that seemed
to repeat infinitely,

00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:06.340
inspiring wonder 
and contemplation of eternal order.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.135
Despite the remarkable complexity
of these designs,

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.380
they can be created 
with just a compass to draw circles

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.953
and a ruler to make lines within them.

00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:20.936
And from these simple tools emerges 
a kaleidoscope multiplicity of patterns.

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:22.746
So how does that work?

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:25.370
Well, everything starts with a circle.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.946
The first major decision 
is how will you divide it up?

00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:34.222
Most patterns split the circle
into four, five or six equal sections.

00:01:34.222 --> 00:01:37.964
And each division gives rise
to distinctive patterns.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:41.810
There's an easy way to determine
whether any pattern is based on fourfold,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.129
fivefold,

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:45.001
or sixfold symmetry.

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.215
Most contain stars surrounded
by petal shapes.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:51.074
Counting the number 
of rays on a starburst,

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:53.117
or the number of petals around it,

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:56.626
tells us what category 
the pattern falls into.

00:01:56.626 --> 00:02:00.315
A star with six rays,
or surrounded by six petals,

00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:03.468
belongs in the sixfold category.

00:02:03.468 --> 00:02:08.531
One with eight petals is part
of the fourfold category, and so on.

00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:11.228
There's another secret ingredient
in these designs:

00:02:11.228 --> 00:02:13.418
an underlying grid.

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:16.044
Invisible, but essential to every pattern,

00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:21.190
the grid helps determine the scale
of the composition before work begins,

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.569
keeps the pattern accurate,

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.700
and facilitates the invention 
of incredible new patterns.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.813
Let's look at an example of how these
elements come together.

00:02:30.813 --> 00:02:35.983
We'll start with a circle within a square,
and divide it into eight equal parts.

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:39.161
We can then draw a pair
of criss-crossing lines

00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:41.895
and overlay them with another two.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.528
These lines are called construction lines,

00:02:44.528 --> 00:02:46.902
and by choosing a set of their segments,

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:50.711
we'll form the basis 
of our repeating pattern.

00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:54.508
Many different designs are possible
from the same construction lines

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:57.307
just by picking different segments.

00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:59.457
And the full pattern finally emerges

00:02:59.457 --> 00:03:04.428
when we create a grid with many
repetitions of this one tile

00:03:04.428 --> 00:03:07.330
in a process called tessellation.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.856
By choosing a different set 
of construction lines,

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.752
we might have created this pattern,

00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:14.225
or this one.

00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:17.243
The possibilities are virtually endless.

00:03:17.243 --> 00:03:21.037
We can follow the same steps
to create sixfold patterns

00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:25.083
by drawing construction lines
over a circle divided into six parts,

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:29.931
and then tessellating it,
we can make something like this.

00:03:29.931 --> 00:03:33.458
Here's another sixfold pattern
that has appeared across the centuries

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:35.531
and all over the Islamic world,

00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:41.239
including Marrakesh, Agra, Konya
and the Alhambra.

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:49.437
Fourfold patterns fit in a square grid,
and sixfold patterns in a hexagonal grid.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:53.282
Fivefold patterns, however,
are more challenging to tessellate

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:57.487
because pentagons 
don't neatly fill a surface,

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:00.421
so instead of just creating 
a pattern in a pentagon,

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:04.084
other shapes have to be added
to make something that is repeatable,

00:04:04.084 --> 00:04:08.129
resulting in patterns that may seem
confoundingly complex,

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.881
but are still relatively simple to create.

00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:16.886
Also, tessellation is not constrained
to simple geometric shapes,

00:04:16.886 --> 00:04:19.681
as M.C. Escher's work demonstrates.

00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:22.189
And while the Islamic 
geometric design tradition

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:25.782
doesn't tend to employ elements 
like fish and faces,

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:31.912
it does sometimes make use of multiple 
shapes to craft complex patterns.

00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:36.260
This more than 1,000-year-old tradition
has wielded basic geometry

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.489
to produce works that are intricate,
decorative and pleasing to the eye.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.317
And these craftsmen prove just how
much is possible

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:51.030
with some artistic intuition, creativity,
dedication and a great compass and ruler.
