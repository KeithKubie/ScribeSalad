00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.110
 
it's always interesting to talk to

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120
it's always interesting to talk to
 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.270
it's always interesting to talk to
neuroscientists about genius I mean we

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280
neuroscientists about genius I mean we
 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.700
neuroscientists about genius I mean we
use the word genius all the time we can

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710
use the word genius all the time we can
 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.950
use the word genius all the time we can
call Picasso a genius or Ernst and a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960
call Picasso a genius or Ernst and a
 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.730
call Picasso a genius or Ernst and a
genius or your five-year-old a genius if

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740
genius or your five-year-old a genius if
 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.189
genius or your five-year-old a genius if
he's particularly good at his arithmetic

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199
he's particularly good at his arithmetic
 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.220
he's particularly good at his arithmetic
but for a neuroscientist you know you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230
but for a neuroscientist you know you
 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.960
but for a neuroscientist you know you
you must be thinking about this in terms

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970
you must be thinking about this in terms
 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.250
you must be thinking about this in terms
of the brain what's going on in the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260
of the brain what's going on in the
 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.650
of the brain what's going on in the
brain of a genius so I'm curious like

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660
brain of a genius so I'm curious like
 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.069
brain of a genius so I'm curious like
for you what is the word genius mean

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079
for you what is the word genius mean
 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.310
for you what is the word genius mean
genius calls to mind the questions of

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320
genius calls to mind the questions of
 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.680
genius calls to mind the questions of
individual differences as a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690
individual differences as a
 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.100
individual differences as a
neuroscientist we always think of the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110
neuroscientist we always think of the
 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.060
neuroscientist we always think of the
brain as being the source of our

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
brain as being the source of our
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.959
brain as being the source of our
characteristics our personality our

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969
characteristics our personality our
 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.229
characteristics our personality our
talents and genius is on the scale of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
talents and genius is on the scale of
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.979
talents and genius is on the scale of
talents that relationship between the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989
talents that relationship between the
 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.630
talents that relationship between the
neural circuitry of the brain and how

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640
neural circuitry of the brain and how
 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.209
neural circuitry of the brain and how
the brain is organized it works and how

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219
the brain is organized it works and how
 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.330
the brain is organized it works and how
we actually behave and what talents we

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340
we actually behave and what talents we
 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.130
we actually behave and what talents we
have is really the essence of

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140
have is really the essence of
 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.349
have is really the essence of
neuroscience so it's kind of about the

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:07.359
neuroscience so it's kind of about the
 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.179
neuroscience so it's kind of about the
diversity of the wiring you're saying I

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189
diversity of the wiring you're saying I
 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.649
diversity of the wiring you're saying I
mean that you have different kinds of

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659
mean that you have different kinds of
 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.199
mean that you have different kinds of
wiring that lead to different levels of

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:13.209
wiring that lead to different levels of
 

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.330
wiring that lead to different levels of
talent in different areas well it's an

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340
talent in different areas well it's an
 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.160
talent in different areas well it's an
interesting question we really don't

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170
interesting question we really don't
 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.859
interesting question we really don't
know what it is about our brains that

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869
know what it is about our brains that
 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.289
know what it is about our brains that
makes your brain different than my brain

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299
makes your brain different than my brain
 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.330
makes your brain different than my brain
the truth of the matter is most of our

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340
the truth of the matter is most of our
 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.109
the truth of the matter is most of our
brains are pretty similar and the subtle

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119
brains are pretty similar and the subtle
 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.830
brains are pretty similar and the subtle
differences in anatomy and structure of

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840
differences in anatomy and structure of
 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.669
differences in anatomy and structure of
the brain oftentimes result in very big

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679
the brain oftentimes result in very big
 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.879
the brain oftentimes result in very big
differences in who we are how we think

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:38.889
differences in who we are how we think
 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.370
differences in who we are how we think
and what our talents are so it gets very

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380
and what our talents are so it gets very
 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.010
and what our talents are so it gets very
complicated very fast and the best

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020
complicated very fast and the best
 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.639
complicated very fast and the best
answer is we really don't know there's a

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649
answer is we really don't know there's a
 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.379
answer is we really don't know there's a
review but do we have any hunches maybe

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389
review but do we have any hunches maybe
 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:52.289
review but do we have any hunches maybe
like I mean could it be well I'm just

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299
like I mean could it be well I'm just
 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.019
like I mean could it be well I'm just
thinking like could it be a question say

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029
thinking like could it be a question say
 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.859
thinking like could it be a question say
of you know a thicker layer of neurons

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869
of you know a thicker layer of neurons
 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.989
of you know a thicker layer of neurons
here or a stronger connection between

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999
here or a stronger connection between
 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.599
here or a stronger connection between
two regions there I mean do we have a

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609
two regions there I mean do we have a
 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.999
two regions there I mean do we have a
sense of what what might be underlying

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009
sense of what what might be underlying
 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.669
sense of what what might be underlying
like these sort of extreme cases like

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679
like these sort of extreme cases like
 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.559
like these sort of extreme cases like
you know what what you know what we

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569
you know what what you know what we
 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.990
you know what what you know what we
should be leaving looking for it's clear

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000
should be leaving looking for it's clear
 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.699
should be leaving looking for it's clear
that there's not a simple answer to that

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709
that there's not a simple answer to that
 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.680
that there's not a simple answer to that
question that the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690
question that the
 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.900
question that the
with the thick cortical layer isn't

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910
with the thick cortical layer isn't
 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.710
with the thick cortical layer isn't
necessarily the brain that is the most

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
necessarily the brain that is the most
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.380
necessarily the brain that is the most
talented brain but I think that it's

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390
talented brain but I think that it's
 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.540
talented brain but I think that it's
worth going back and thinking about a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550
worth going back and thinking about a
 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.190
worth going back and thinking about a
little bit what is genius

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
little bit what is genius
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.600
little bit what is genius
because it means different things to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610
because it means different things to
 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.460
because it means different things to
different people and perhaps even in

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
different people and perhaps even in
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.100
different people and perhaps even in
different times in our life or when I

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110
different times in our life or when I
 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.820
different times in our life or when I
think of genius I think of the creative

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830
think of genius I think of the creative
 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.640
think of genius I think of the creative
person the person who changes the way we

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650
person the person who changes the way we
 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.640
person the person who changes the way we
think the person that has an impact

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650
think the person that has an impact
 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.190
think the person that has an impact
often times that that lasts long after

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
often times that that lasts long after
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.030
often times that that lasts long after
the person is passed on and that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
the person is passed on and that
 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.040
the person is passed on and that
creative seed is something that's very

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050
creative seed is something that's very
 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.140
creative seed is something that's very
difficult for neuroscientists to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150
difficult for neuroscientists to
 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.810
difficult for neuroscientists to
understand it's not like this one little

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820
understand it's not like this one little
 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.000
understand it's not like this one little
part of the brain that makes us creative

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010
part of the brain that makes us creative
 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.100
part of the brain that makes us creative
mm-hmm it's something about how the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110
mm-hmm it's something about how the
 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.620
mm-hmm it's something about how the
whole brain works together right it is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
whole brain works together right it is
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.960
whole brain works together right it is
it is tricky and I mean geniuses are

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970
it is tricky and I mean geniuses are
 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.020
it is tricky and I mean geniuses are
sort of by definition rare and and you

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030
sort of by definition rare and and you
 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.110
sort of by definition rare and and you
know when you're working as a scientist

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120
know when you're working as a scientist
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.150
know when you're working as a scientist
you don't like rare I mean you like to

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160
you don't like rare I mean you like to
 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.290
you don't like rare I mean you like to
be able to look at a whole bunch of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300
be able to look at a whole bunch of
 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.090
be able to look at a whole bunch of
people a whole bunch of brains and look

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100
people a whole bunch of brains and look
 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.820
people a whole bunch of brains and look
for things in common so I mean people

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830
for things in common so I mean people
 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.979
for things in common so I mean people
have tried to look at Albert Einstein's

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989
have tried to look at Albert Einstein's
 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.050
have tried to look at Albert Einstein's
brain to figure out what his genius is I

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060
brain to figure out what his genius is I
 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.729
brain to figure out what his genius is I
mean what do you think of that kind of

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739
mean what do you think of that kind of
 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.250
mean what do you think of that kind of
work well actually I think it's a little

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260
work well actually I think it's a little
 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.080
work well actually I think it's a little
misguided to tell you the truth that

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090
misguided to tell you the truth that
 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.410
misguided to tell you the truth that
looking at the anatomy of a brain it's

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420
looking at the anatomy of a brain it's
 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.290
looking at the anatomy of a brain it's
very difficult to understand much of the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300
very difficult to understand much of the
 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.800
very difficult to understand much of the
function but I think that we don't have

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810
function but I think that we don't have
 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.650
function but I think that we don't have
to think of genius as being something

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660
to think of genius as being something
 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.270
to think of genius as being something
that is rare I think we can imagine that

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280
that is rare I think we can imagine that
 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.170
that is rare I think we can imagine that
there's a little genius in all of us all

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
there's a little genius in all of us all
 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.560
there's a little genius in all of us all
of us really yes we're all creative you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570
of us really yes we're all creative you
 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.390
of us really yes we're all creative you
for example you're one of the most

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400
for example you're one of the most
 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.640
for example you're one of the most
creative science writers that there is

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650
creative science writers that there is
 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.030
creative science writers that there is
well but I'm not going to like thank you

frontier I mean why do we think we need

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310
frontier I mean why do we think we need

to go to the moon or to Mars it's

to go to the moon or to Mars it's
 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.740
to go to the moon or to Mars it's
because we're human and we want to know

genius is just an extreme version of

that but it represents us as humans in a

very fundamental way so in a way it

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979
very fundamental way so in a way it
 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.100

might be actually more interesting to

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110
might be actually more interesting to
 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.969
might be actually more interesting to
compare all of us as a species to other

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979
compare all of us as a species to other
 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.120
compare all of us as a species to other
species and look at how our brains are

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130
species and look at how our brains are
 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.560
species and look at how our brains are
working or how they're different and

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570
working or how they're different and
 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.879
working or how they're different and
what the things that we can do with our

what the things that we can do with our
 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.520
what the things that we can do with our
brains compared to chimpanzees or

yeah actually I think that that's a very

yeah actually I think that that's a very
 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.300
yeah actually I think that that's a very
logical extension of what I've just said

logical extension of what I've just said
 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.060
logical extension of what I've just said
that that it's very unique among species

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070
that that it's very unique among species

are mm-hmm it's really the essence I

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590
are mm-hmm it's really the essence I
 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.020
are mm-hmm it's really the essence I
think of who we are as humans
