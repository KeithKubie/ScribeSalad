00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.493
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So you're pretty proficient at this point at multiplying polynomials

00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:07.333
together. And then of course simplifying what you get. But if we can work from

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:11.415
having two binomials. Binomials are just polynomials with two terms in them. We

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:15.309
can work from having those multiplied together to having something that looks

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.692
sort of quadratic. We should be able to start with something quadratic and work

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:24.371
backwards, to having binomials multiplied together. And the problem with Grant,

00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:28.637
we're trying to go that direction. So let's say we have some simple quadratic

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:32.894
expressions, like x squared, plus 5x, plus 6. Can we figure out how to factor

00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:37.022
this, based on patterns in the above equation? The x squareds correspond

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:40.975
directly, and the 6, and the ab, are both constant terms, so they must go

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:45.407
together. If this middle term, the 5x and ax plus bx that are going to be a

00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:49.464
little bit more tricky. So let's focus on this part of the term.
