00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.460
Okay, so a little history: if you are younger
and you're watching this, you may notice

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.300
that when you go to the video store or, Hell,
if you still go to any video stores,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.390
you'll see a lot of Disney sequels like
Cinderella 2 or The Little Mermaid 2 or

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.570
Lion King 2. The reason for this is
that there was a time when hand-drawn

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.160
animation was dying; I mean, okay, you could
argue it's not really around much

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.700
anymore especially cinematically, but
Disney was losing it big time. Most of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.399
their films were not making money so
they did a lot of direct to DVD sequels

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.210
and most of them were pretty bad. This
is worth mentioning because one or two

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.560
actually made it to the big screen and
in this case, it's Return to Neverland, the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.480
sequel to one of Britain's most beloved
children's stories. When it came out, it

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.930
was panned. The critics hated it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.850
everybody said its just another direct to
DVD movie just thrown on the big screen

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.840
given a little bit more budget, it's a
waste of time. So, that's the movie I was

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.649
waiting to see and, honestly, I don't think
that's what I got. Okay, it's not great but

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.979
it was actually a little better than what
I was expecting kinda sorta...

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.069
Okay, well, it's years later.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:23.780
Wendy is grown up and has a family of
her own, but unfortunately it's during

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.729
wartime. Oh yeah, we're going there. Not
only is Wendy's husband going off to war

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.049
but it also looks like that her children, one
being the main character Jane, are about

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.880
to get sent away because of the bombings.
Jane has forced herself to grow up

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.069
faster than most children because of the
obvious situation. While Wendy still tries

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.950
to tell stories of Peter Pan and
imagination, she just can't seem to get

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.060
into him anymore and understandably so.
But that all changes when one night

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.569
Captain Hook returns, kidnaps Jane, and
takes her to Neverland mistaking her for

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.200
Wendy but Peter Pan finds her and saves her
and thus she tries to figure out how to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.579
get back home using her logic and not
really knowing how to use her

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.130
imagination. So, the lost boys had to
learn how to be more reasonable even

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.130
allowing a first lost girl and she has
to learn how to be playful and creative

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.150
all while avoiding the evil grasp of the
pirates. The major criticisms that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.430
everybody makes about this movie is that
it didn't need to exist and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.319
they're right, this doesn't need to exist; the
first Peter Pan is fine exactly how it

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.209
is both the book and the play hint that
there's other adventures that go on but

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.829
it's not something we always necessarily
need to know. I guess for me though I

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.319
grew up with a show called Peter Pan and
the Pirates. It's a show not a lot of

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.909
people know about but it was damn good.
It explored Neverland, it explored the

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.849
characters and they treated it very very
seriously.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.790
Yeah, did that need to exist? No, but I
would have missed out on all these great

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.090
adventures. Return to Neverland kinda has
a similar feel, except in the Disney

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.389
universe. It is still clearly the Disney Peter
Pan and the Disney Captain Hook. In fact, the

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.290
voices they got to replace them are
amazing. They sound just like the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.150
original actors but that doesn't mean
anything if there isn't a good story to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.889
go along with it and this story... yeah, has a
little bit of the liar revealed elements

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.519
to it but it doesn't focus on them that
long and all the other elements they

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.340
kinda take from the original book. For
example, there's a scene where Jane says

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.129
she doesn't believe in fairies I sorta
rolled my eyes and said "oh yeah, well we

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.239
all know that this is because of the
first movie..." wait a minute, they didn't

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.229
do that in the first movie. We also have
the manipulation of Hook with Wendy

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.750
except this time it has to be Jane but
this was a great scene too because it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.030
showed that Hook could be very clever; he
wasn't just a dumb pirate who waved his

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.500
sword around, he actually did have a
little bit of a mind and the struggle

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.599
Jane goes through is a very
understandable struggle you see the war

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.669
they show you some of the grittiness. I
mean, okay, not too far; they don't show the dead bodies

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.639
or anything but they show it's tough.
She isn't just a stick in the mud you

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.540
completely understand why she has this
mindset and why it's hard for her to

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.909
imagine things. Heck, why its even hard for her to be happy. Now, with that said, there are

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.919
definitely are things you can complain
about. For example, they have pop songs

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.759
oh yeah and they really don't fit.
This one song that the Lost Boys sings that

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:11.000
sounds like a traditional Disney song but aside
from that all the songs are sung by pop

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.939
singers and their early 2000s pop singer
so they had that scratchy voice that's supposed

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.359
to sound tortured and it sounds like shit.
It sounds like shit, it's awful, it's

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.820
distracting, it's a slap in the face
every time there's supposed to be an

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.779
emotional moment. I hate it when they do
this with Disney films, especially ones

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:31.430
that take place at a long time ago and
in fantasy land so you just hear this

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.550
incredibly dated 2000s song and UGH it hurts
every time you hear it. Also the voice

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.950
actress for Jane is kinda hit and miss;
sometimes she really gets the lines

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.010
right and other times it sounds a little
forced. But it's nothing too distracting.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.729
There's also some weird changes that I
never quite got, like instead of a

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.240
crocodile they have this giant octopus
or squid something like that and now

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.300
he's the thing that chases Captain Hook.
It's funny and it still animated well

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.199
but why didn't they just do the crocodile?
They just say he's gone but why? This

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.800
octopus thing does the exact same thing
I don't get why they need to switch it

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.810
out. But for the most part, what they do is
switch out or keep in is actually kind

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.190
of welcomed and besides that's not the
focus the focus is on Jane interacting

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.750
with the lost boys and trying to get
back her childhood

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.860
which, yeah sounds a little familiar, right? I guess if
you do have to compare these two I would

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.530
say Hook is the better movie but I don't
know for a sequel to Disney's Peter Pan

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.600
this is kind of exactly what I would
expect. It has some really nice imagery

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.260
like when Hook is taking Jane to
Neverland this ship is flying through

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.930
London it looks amazing. There is a wonderful
scene at the end where young Peter Pan

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.410
meets grown-up Wendy and it plays out
exactly how it should play out it's not

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.850
too emotional but it's not too simple
either it's kind of how I think of the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.930
movie. If you're looking to find problems
with it you won't find any shortage you

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.820
can definitely find things that don't
quite work or maybe you've seen in other

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.470
movies and such but if you legitimately
want to see a sequel to Peter Pan and

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.400
you want to know what happens, I think
this is a very delightful adventure. I

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.150
was really surprised I was not expecting
to like this film I thought I was gonna

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.250
hate it like all the other critics did but I
actually kind of enjoyed it. It's not

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.540
grand or epic but it's simple and nice.
Did it need to be made? Probably not but

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.790
since it does exist I think its fine.
I think kids can watch it and get a lot

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.370
of laughs and adults can watch it and enjoy
some of the more emotional moments. It felt

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.220
like the people making it enjoyed the
subject matter and weren't forced into

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.729
doing it. They appreciated the magic and
the imagination and the humor and the

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.160
artwork and they want to do something
very similar and in my opinion, they succeeded.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.450
I guess it's not a favorite for a lot of Disney
fans but for me I have no problem believing in

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.670
fairies with this one.
