00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.800
Imagine it’s 1957 and you’re a high-ranking
official with the British Army, responsible

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.820
for keeping the West free from Soviet aggression.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.550
At your disposal you have a great arsenal,
both conventional and nuclear, as well as

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.890
teams of brilliant scientists at the Royal
Armament Research and Development Establishment

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.500
constantly proposing ideas for new, more effective
weapons.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.190
One of your areas of greatest strategic concern
is the possibility that the Soviet Union might

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.150
make inroads sufficiently into Western Europe
to bring its advanced rockets and bombs within

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.180
range of the British Isles.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.789
Recall that during World War II, Germany bombed
the snot out of Britain with tens of thousands

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.170
of bombs dropped from Luftwaffe aircraft,
as well as more than 10,000 long-range V-1

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.240
and V-2 cruise and ballistic missiles shot
from sites in France and the Netherlands.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.030
Deciding that the best way to keep the Soviets
from your doorstep is a scorched earth policy,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.310
to “deny occupation of the area to an enemy
for an appreciable time,” you choose from

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.630
all your options that blowing any invaded
areas in West Germany to smithereens using

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.430
nuclear weapons is the best alternative.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.220
After all, this not only destroys enemy troops
and denies them access to valuable infrastructure,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.520
but also makes the area around the explosion
uninhabitable for some time after.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.450
Not content to rely on gravity bombs or missiles,
your crack team concludes that nuclear landmines

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.450
(that could either be placed on the surface,
buried or even submerged in rivers and lakes)

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.450
are the way to go.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.390
You settle on a 16,000 pound tub that resembles
an enormous boiler from the outside, but inside

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.549
hosts a large nuclear warhead and two firing
units, with the design partially based on

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.270
your country’s first operation nuke- the
Blue Danube.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.329
With a predicted yield of ten kilotons, each
bomb would create an estimated crater of 375

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.060
feet across for a surface blast and 640 feet
if detonated 35 feet below ground.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.930
Versatile, the device could either be detonated
by timer (capable of being set as far as eight

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.220
days in advance), directly with a wire from
up to 3 miles away, or simply detonated automatically

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.460
if any of several anti-tampering devices were
activated.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.239
Sold!

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.010
blur-peacockThis is exactly what happened.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.110
In July of 1957, the British Army Council
order 10 of these so-called Blue Peacock nuclear

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.110
landmines.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.080
However, the designers of the bomb foresaw
a problem.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.709
The bomb’s sensitive components had to be
kept at a certain temperature, far above the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.209
average of mid-Europe in winter.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.790
They also had to be kept at that temperature
for potentially several days after an invasion

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.849
and subsequent deployment of the nuclear mines.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.460
At this point the boy-wonders floated a couple
of options for warming the device.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.080
By far the most interesting proposal was to
place a coop filled with chickens and seed

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.190
inside the bomb before deploying it.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.069
The chickens could survive in such conditions
for at least a week- plenty of time for enemy

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.390
troops to approach after the nuke was deployed.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.490
And, critically, the chicken’s body heat
would maintain the proper temperature, while

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.190
the coop itself would (hopefully) keep them
from pecking at the delicate equipment inside.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.769
Perhaps realizing how absolutely ridiculous
the chicken idea is (although not the only

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.180
viable bird-brained bomb idea to come out
of this era- or, more likely, realizing the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.910
risks of nuclear fallout on neighboring, allied
populations (and political fallout once West

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.420
Germany realized what the British had done
to their homeland, invaded or not), in February

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.410
of 1958, the MoD Weapons Policy Committee
scrapped the project.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.049
However, two inert prototypes were retained,
and one still exists today, although the public

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.769
remained blissfully unaware of it until 2004,
when Operation Blue Peacock was declassified

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.650
and included in a National Archives exhibition.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.340
Given that the exhibit opened on April 1st
and a critical suggested component of the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.379
nuclear mines was chickens, more than a few
people thought that Blue Peacock was an elaborate

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.420
joke – forcing the National Archives to
put out an official statement that while “it

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.280
does seem like an April Fool . . . it most
certainly is not.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.110
The Civil Service does not do jokes.”
