00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.606
Go the physics and engineering sections of a technical schools library, and

00:00:03.606 --> 00:00:08.355
you'll see a huge amount of information on a wide variety of phenomena. Beyond

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.450
drag, lift and stretch there are many other properties we could simulate.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.210
Friction, applied force, flow, elasticity, tension, normal force, turbulence,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.546
spring force, heat transfer, gravity, trust and so forth. Computing these is

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:25.280
done by what's called a dynamic solver. What you're seeing on the screen now

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.566
are a number of different simulations done for all sorts of phenomenon. A few

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:32.936
of these are computed at interactive speeds, some are created offline. In

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:36.380
either case, the rendering is separate from the physical computations.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.020
Typically, the way solvers work is that a tiny timestep is chosen for the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.323
simulation, often smaller than the time represented by the frame. The effect of

00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:46.745
forces in the scene are computed for this sliver of time and objects are

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:52.335
modified. This process is done again and again, time slice by time slice. Small

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:56.095
steps help avoid various types of errors. The area of physical simulation is

00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:59.732
wide ranging and users can have different goals. An engineer or scientist may

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:02.660
be making a visualization of a particular process and so the simulator is

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.632
aiming to be as realistic and true to the physical world as possible. If

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:10.668
interactive speeds are not needed, then time slices can be exceedingly small,

00:01:10.668 --> 00:01:15.465
and mostly dependent on how much compute time the user wants to spend. The

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:18.435
other major area that uses simulation, is for generating what I call plausible

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:23.108
animations. These animations are not required to be physically correct. Rather

00:01:23.108 --> 00:01:26.009
their goal is to look reasonable to the viewer. Just as we don't pick up on

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.194
reflection maps not having perfect correct reflections, there are plenty of

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:34.085
errors we don't notice or can rationalize away. Though using physical

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:36.875
principles for the creation of effects normally gives the most realistic

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.530
results, for interactive rendering we often have to make significant

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.254
simplifications. There are also simulators for phenomena that are not based on

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:47.809
physics. For example, flocks of birds in flight, traffic in a city, and crowds

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:50.864
of people walking inside a building are all systems that can be simulated with

00:01:50.864 --> 00:01:55.489
some basic rules. The artist can also guide the simulation as desired, perhaps

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.810
having characters run towards a particular location and jostle for position.
