LUC DE BRABANDERE: Good morning,
good afternoon.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.550
Creativity is all my life.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.790
I'm doing this job for the
last 40 years, and as an

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.180
amateur for 20 years.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.200
And when I was 40 I went
through what's called a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.420
midlife crisis, but probably
you don't know what it is--

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.820
it's when you ask yourself,
OK, what about

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.600
the second half time?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.920
And then I decided to turn
my passion into a job.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.780
And that's how I'm here today,
so it was a good decision.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.930
So I run probably, maybe
1,500 brainstorms.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.260
This And today I
have strange--

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.010
not strange, but some
observations.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.030
And probably one that
is particularly

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.190
striking is this one.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.790
If you take this expression,
creative thinking, in the end

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.200
the key word is not creative.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.900
I'm convinced the keyword
is thinking.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.840
Creativity is not a byproduct,
but it's a subset of something

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.380
much more sophisticated
called thinking.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.360
So my 15 minutes before handing
over to Alan, my 15

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.560
minutes is not about
creativity.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.410
It's about thinking.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.290
And I'm convinced that if
thinking process is better

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.040
understood, it's for
profit for any

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.430
kind of creative session.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.380
So what is to think?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.060
What is to think?

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.620
And let's start with
this observation.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.320
If a father or a mother tells
somebody, I'm thinking about

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.700
my children, this is true.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.030
If the CEO of a bank tells a
journalist, I'm thinking about

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.930
my clients, this is not true.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.730
Because it's impossible.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.900
Probably you are in the
same situation.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.170
If somebody at Google says, I'm
thinking about the users,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.040
it's not true.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.800
At least it's not true
the same way as for

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.850
a father or a mother.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.590
When you think about your user,
because of course you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.892
do, what do you do?

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:23.880
AUDIENCE: Generalize.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.331
LUC DE BRABANDERE: You--

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.581
AUDIENCE: Generalize.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.540
LUC DE BRABANDERE: I prefer
another words.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.290
You simplify.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.610
There is no other choice.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.340
The CEO of a bank, if he wants
to think about the market, he

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.850
has to segment the market--

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.560
seven, eight, nine segments.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.385
And generalization and
simplification are more or

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:43.850
less synonymous.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.840
And this is a good
start for today.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.560
If you want to think about
anything you have to simplify

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.250
this particular thing into
categories, segments,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.710
clusters, boxes--

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.940
because of course there's
a lot about boxes now.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.550
And it's probably the key word
of the whole process, to

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.420
remember that at any time when
we think, we simplify.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.030
I'm going to use this
for maybe four

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.730
words and two arrows.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.190
In front of you, you
have the world.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.080
The world is moving, uncertain,
diverse, complex,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.160
and partly hidden.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.890
But you see about the world.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.110
You are here and you want to
think about the world.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.540
And you made the point, in
your mind you only have

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.610
simplification.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.240
So I put here, simplification.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.170
Most of the time when
we tell about a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.050
situation, this is simple.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.830
We should say it's simplified
because nothing is simple.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.430
And if you take for example a
rainbow, you have the rainbow

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.560
with a million colors--

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.486
in your mind, seven colors.

00:04:07.486 --> 00:04:11.667
You have a million clients, in
your mind, eight, seven, four

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:13.260
categories, et cetera.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.220
We have simplifications.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.120
So if you take the metaphor,
thinking is to play, and I

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.269
like this metaphor--

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.130
this is the playground.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.180
That's where it happens.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.840
And of course a game
has rules.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.950
And the rules of thinking are
not that sophisticated.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.980
It happens here.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.630
So you immediately realize it
goes in both directions.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.960
And I'm going to simplify, of
course, with two arrows.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.730
One is here and the
other is here.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.770
When you think, either you are
here or you are there.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.850
Let's take the CEO
of the bank.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.420
He has segmentation, seven
categories, he can call

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.960
Ogilvie and other advertisers
and say, OK,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.260
I have seven segments.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.670
You should talk to those people
differently, et cetera.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.020
He is here.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.150
The starting point is a
simplification, seven boxes.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.380
And then he works a lot.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.850
So go, go, et cetera.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.220
But he's definitely here.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.340
To me, this arrow is
more important.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.000
And those two arrows correspond
to keywords in

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.850
philosophy.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.345
This deduction and this
is induction.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.640
And of course, completely
different.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.330
Deduction is when you move
from the idea, the

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.520
simplification.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.940
An idea is a simplification.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.350
When you move from the idea
to the world, you deduce.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.830
You want to go on vacation
in Belgium, it's a

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.640
simplification.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.735
You can call, and say
cheap airline, et

00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:01.510
cetera, so this deduction.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.010
I'm convinced one day there
is going to be completely

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.280
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.960
I don't see any reason why it
shouldn't be like that.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.950
Today you have still
some problem.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.840
But OK, this is not
a challenge.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.440
The real challenge is here.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.200
How do we simply the world?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
How do we simplify?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.520
Because this is the world and
you are king of the algorithm,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.260
of course you don't have
algorithm here.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.010
You have what we call
heuristics.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.590
It's a way to find.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.260
But what's a heuristic?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.450
If you lose your key,
how do you find your

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.370
key back with a heuristic?

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.240
Yesterday I was--

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.610
no, this is heuristics.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.870
Finally you've got your key.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.440
But it's not an algorithm.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.990
There is no certainty.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.110
So this is algorithm,
this is heuristic.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:04.570
And next step is to realize that
deduction can be perfect.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.690
If you do it twice, you have
twice the same result.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.110
Induction cannot be perfect.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.030
Why?

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.940
Because a perfect induction
would require an infinite

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.100
amount of time.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.820
Because you have to
embrace the whole

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.910
world, the whole world.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.430
And this is of course
not possible.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.800
Because first, most of
the world is hidden.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.340
Sometimes you are in contact
with the reality of the world.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.430
When you interview somebody, for
example, there is nothing

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.490
between the person
and yourself.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.790
At the end of the 30
minutes, you have a

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.460
simplification in your mind.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.130
This person's good,
not good, bad.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.780
You're doing simplification.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.200
But this is, in the end,
maybe the exception.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.830
Most of the time what
do you have here?

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.560
Simplifications of
other people--

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.400
if you have reporters, a
newspaper, any kind of book--

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.890
they are all someone else's
simplification.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.940
So even world et cetera.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.240
So the induction cannot be
perfect, because it's not

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.400
rational to be 100% rational.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.000
Which is a bit striking.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.110
If you want to buy your next
vacation, and then you say,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.850
OK, I'm going to go next
vacation with full, 100%

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.790
rational procedure, you'll
never go on vacation.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.130
Because you need to embrace the
whole, what's the market,

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.200
all possibilities.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.950
One day you say, OK,
I got to Belgium--

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:40.929
just an example.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:45.770
And it means that when you
induce at a given time, you

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.320
have to give up rationality.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.240
There is no perfect way to
guarantee the simplification

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.960
is the best one.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.650
On this side, you only
have hypothesis.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.440
A segmentation is
a hypothesis.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.830
All the segmentation do
exist, and there is no

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.150
algorithm to show--

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.010
of course you can make some
trial and error, but you could

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.020
never achieve certainty.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.860
So let's make a little
exercise around this.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.830
I'll have two little
sentences.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.290
And I will not finish the
sentence, and I will ask you

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.280
to finish rapidly.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.580
OK, ready?

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.600
Sentence number one--

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.330
an example of a car is?

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.170
AUDIENCE: A Nissan.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:30.290
LUC DE BRABANDERE: A Nissan.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.540
Perfect.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.830
[FRENCH], sorry, second--

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.386
Nissan, is Renault, and Renault
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:40.386 --> 00:09:42.320
OK, so this wrong.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.490
Second sentence--

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.032
the car is an example of?

00:09:47.032 --> 00:09:48.420
AUDIENCE: A vehicle.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.710
LUC DE BRABANDERE: Vehicle.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.300
AUDIENCE: Transportation.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:50.750
LUC DE BRABANDERE:
Transportaion.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:56.320
The care is an example of--

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.570
engineering.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.450
Genius, the car is an
example of a big

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.420
problem in the near future.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.200
The car is an example of
something I'd like to drive.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.240
You have understood
the whole thing.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.770
Look what happened.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.540
First sentence, an example
of a car is a Nissan.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.140
It took a millisecond,
not a big deal.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.920
So you could say a Renault,
Ferrari, Mercedes, Audi.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.930
What happens?

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.230
You're starting point
is a simplification.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.820
In your mind, what is a car?

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.260
And you go down to the world.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.700
And you have a Renault and
Nissan, it's not a big deal.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.960
No discussion, no room for--

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.180
[FRENCH].

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.943
Look at the other sentence.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:46.240
The car is an example of--

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.980
what came first?

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.340
Vehicle.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.450
OK, fine, this is called
comfort zone.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.530
Because it's a no risk answer.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.860
It's the souvenir of
an old deduction.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.874
An example of a vehicle is
a car, the car is an

00:11:00.874 --> 00:11:02.290
example of a vehicle.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:07.190
OK, so no discussion, no risk,
no danger, nothing.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:12.190
But if you realize that the
second sentence can receive a

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.220
lot of different answers--

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.820
so I gave some rules.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.230
So then you said transportation,
then you said

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.410
engineering, and whoo-- and you
say the car is an example

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.280
of a word with three letters,
and et cetera.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.180
So I summarize--

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:35.520
it means that here we should
remember at any time there is

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.990
a lot of freedom here.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.930
In this arrow you don't have
room for creativity.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.150
You are down to the example
of cars, Nissan, OK, good.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.230
You can improve the Nissan.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.360
But the real creativity
happens here.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.230
When you remember that this
can be organized in a

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.970
completely different way.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.820
Just an example, and then
I hand over to Alan.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.870
This is the cafeteria.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.390
Imagine--

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.300
let's look at, I'm
going to simplify

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.520
the story of Starbucks.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.570
I don't know those people, never
worked there, so just

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.380
the way I see it.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:24.004
The first idea is, OK, I'm going
to make good coffee and

00:12:24.004 --> 00:12:25.390
sell it everywhere.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.610
The idea is the coffee,
and then you go down.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.820
And then you have Starbucks and
Starbucks and so, you have

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.080
different coffee with
a lot of ch-ch-ch.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.390
OK, but you're stuck
in the coffee.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.890
What could happen
with Starbucks?

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:47.610
Imagine, you ask people, could
you please see your business

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.230
without using the word coffee?

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.090
No, we're coffee, come on.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:58.350
Let's try your business without
using the word coffee.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.480
One answer could be,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.330
We have the largest office in
the world, if you add all

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.050
Starbucks, probably you have
the largest office.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.260
So it means that you take the
world of Starbucks and

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.480
suddenly, you move from the idea
of coffee, which is here.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.710
You move to the idea of
office, like this.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.270
And then you can have--

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.610
if you think, my business
is not about

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.200
coffee, I'm an office.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.130
I rent square meters
or square feet.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.110
So I compete with others.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.810
You can have completely
different idea.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.310
Not the cappuccino, you
could say, OK, I'm

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.420
going to put a printer.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.780
Or I see it like this.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.130
And I read recently that in
St. Petersburg and Moscow,

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.990
there is a new concept
for cafeteria.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.470
Everything is free,
but the time.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.430
Probably you're aware, and
probably now it comes.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.630
But this kind of idea never
comes if you have in your mind

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.590
one box for coffee.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.890
Because it's not possible.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:08.090
And so it's all about the
freedom you have to look at

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.910
the world in front of
you, your market or

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.330
competitor, et cetera.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.210
And to build other
simplifications.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.540
Coffee is a simplification.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.620
Office is a simplification.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.723
But that the beauty is
to do this, voila.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.870
I hand over to Alan for more.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.840
This is what I used in the
last century, so I

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.610
feel better with this.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.170
ALAN INY: I'm going to keep
referring to it, but I'm going

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.130
to put it here.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.250
Because in this century
we also have this.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.420
Luc gave you a beautiful model,
a beautiful box--

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.140
I could put box here as
another synonym--

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.380
for how thinking works.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.140
And creativity is what we're
going to come to now.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:57.750
Creativity is essentially this
process here, the idea of all

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.630
of this arrow, everything that
happens here, this is the

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.420
invitation to be creative.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.380
It's giving you the invitation
to not just say that a car is

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.440
a vehicle or mode of
transportation, which is of

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.590
course not wrong, but to
actually go beyond that.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.930
And to say a car is something
you like to draw, or something

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.250
you like to ride in with your
second cousins on your way to

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.570
a baseball game, or
whatever you want.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.130
Anything, you have the
invitation to go

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.270
as far as you want.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.730
And if box is another word for
what comes here, then this is

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.500
an interesting thing.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.180
Because for 50 years,
we have been told,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.900
think outside the box.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.550
Just go in a room, take a plate
of cookies, gather a

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.610
bunch of people.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.840
Think outside the box.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.160
Solve all your problems.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.570
And yet when I ask executives,
whatever the industry or

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.790
wherever around the world,
have you had

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.010
creative session lately?

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.910
Have you had a brainstorm?

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.670
Everybody says, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.230
But are you really happy
with the results?

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.110
Are you satisfied with it?

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.910
People tend to say no, it was
a little bit frustrating.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.930
We didn't get exactly where we
wanted to get to, et cetera.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.720
And one of the reasons for that
is that thinking outside

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.160
the box is simply
not sufficient.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.680
No matter what we do, we're
going to use a lot of boxes.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.060
We have a lot of boxes that
process and help us interpret

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.960
the world in front of us.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.780
Everything we do is
governed by boxes.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.040
It's unavoidable.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.450
So thinking outside the box,
to stick with the cars, is

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.870
like telling you don't
drive on the highway.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.400
But it's not telling you if
you should take the side

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.530
roads, or take a helicopter, or
use a video conference, or

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.760
something else instead.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.560
So think outside the box gives
you absolutely no direction

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.870
for where to find the new one.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.950
And that of course is the point
of "Thinking In New

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.600
Boxes," and the book that is
available at the back.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.190
And so what I'd like to do is
really take you through this

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.660
five step process for thinking
in new boxes that is outlined

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.480
in the book.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.490
I will do so very quickly.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.650
And I will do so without using
classic consultant BCG type

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:03.480
slides like this one, starting
after this one.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.750
So the first step is doubt.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.160
The first step is doubt.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.010
And what do I really
mean by doubt?

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.800
The whole point of doubt is to
actually start by identifying

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.390
some of your current boxes
and challenge them.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.290
And that is a step that so
many people often miss.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.220
If somebody walks straight
into a room and

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.680
says, we need new ideas.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.950
Think outside the box.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.430
Then they're jumping straight
to this idea of divergence,

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.560
getting a lot of ideas
on the table.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.680
And that's fine.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.710
I have no problem with the
traditional brainstorm.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.480
It's just that you can't
start there.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.640
You have to prepare.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.800
You have to be ready.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.850
And you have to start
with doubt.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.590
And I'll give you a couple of
examples of what I mean.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.310
In fact, I'll give you an
example, forget the slides,

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.240
from two days ago.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.570
Luc and I, celebrating
our launch, 8

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.700
o'clock in the morning.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.230
We needed to go for a coffee.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.160
Not Starbucks, in this
case actually--

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.370
we went across the street to
another coffee shop that was

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.580
right there.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.650
And at the register, instead
of a tip jar, there were

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.890
actually two tip jars.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.200
And in between the two tip
jars there was a piece of

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.330
paper that said, which TV
family do you prefer?

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.600
The Huxtables from "The Cosby
Show" or the Tanners from

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.160
"Full House"?

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.690
And there was an arrow pointing
to each tip jar.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:26.200
Now, I thought to myself
this is fantastic.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.750
This is a new box.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.090
This is a complete re-conception
of what the tip

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.090
jar can be.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.180
Because people who probably feel
very strongly about it

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.560
would be more inclined to leave
a tip in one of the two

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.110
jars, based on that, right.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.880
And you could tell, actually--

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.890
perhaps it will or won't
surprise you, I don't know--

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.730
but the Huxtables jar
was much fuller.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.010
So I thought, how interesting.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.910
May I please take a picture?

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:47.850
I took a picture.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:48.440
I tweeted it.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.630
I went and sat down.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.950
Then I actually went back there
and started talking to

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.140
the ladies behind the
register, and

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.870
asking some more questions.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.270
Because being a consultant, I
wanted to learn more about the

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.280
actual data.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.620
And it turns out, OK, they
change the question every day.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.590
And most importantly, the amount
of their tips went up

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.140
by 50% since they did this.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.120
So the idea of taking your
mental box of what is a tip

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.420
jar-- they could've gone their
whole lives without actually

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:17.900
changing that.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.740
You can go through life saying
a tip jar is a tip jar.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.540
But they had a completely new
box, a new hypothesis, a new

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.110
idea for what the tip
jar could be.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.250
And it had a dramatic impact
on their particular world.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.520
Now this is not necessarily the
invention of penicillin,

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.140
or the iPhone, or whatever you
want, but it is a game

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.800
changing thing.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.820
It fundamentally changed
their particular world.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.690
And whatever the problem is that
you're facing, the best

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.890
way to get at it is to challenge
some of your

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.090
existing boxes.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.070
And the best way to challenge
them, to doubt them, is to

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.310
actually start by identifying
some of them.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.580
And I want to show you a few
cartoons that kind of explain

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.560
why that is.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.840
Because if we accept that all of
our boxes, all of our ideas

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.940
are simply working hypotheses
that we arrive at through

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.650
induction, we have to
challenge those.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.990
Because to paraphrase Immanuel
Kant, we don't see

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.480
the world as it is.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.900
We see the world as we are.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.150
In other words, we each see
the world through our own

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.450
boxes, through our own lenses.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.640
And this is Immanuel Kant's
favorite cartoon--

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.850
would have been.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.680
Here's another example.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.980
When we see something, whether
it's an optical illusion, or

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.090
whether it's an image, or
whether it's calculations, or

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.820
whether these perceived
limitations--

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.450
like when there's a new idea,
oh, the boss will

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.310
never go for that.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.350
We can't do that.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.440
Our competitor tried that
and it doesn't work.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.850
All of these things,
we have to doubt.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.230
We have to foster doubt.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.400
And I'll give you a quick visual
example, even though

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.430
this is true in really serious
business situations as well.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.720
So what is this?

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.440
You look at this, and you say,
well, this is George W. Bush

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.090
upside down.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.910
And then you just go back to
whatever you're doing and

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.740
that's fine.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.450
In a split second, your mind
says this is George W. Bush

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:10.940
upside down.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.710
And now to save you the trouble
of going like this, I

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.580
flip it for you.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.730
And you see that somebody
has actually

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.940
Photoshopped this thing--

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.720
the mouth in particular,
and the eyes as well.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.390
And they have cleverly,
not cleverly--

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.550
I mean, let's be clear.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.220
You can do this for the Queen,
or Obama, or whoever you want.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.510
It's not a political statement,
of course.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.950
But somebody has Photoshopped
this.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.570
But here's the interesting
thing.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.780
If you go back and look at this
again tomorrow, or even

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.770
now, your mind immediately says,
oh, it's George W. Bush

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.900
upside down.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.800
Now you're staring at it.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.650
You're starting to notice
the mouth and the eyes.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.740
But immediately your mind jumps
to these conclusions

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.480
because the brain is lazy when
it processes information.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.040
And when we go through this
process of seeing something in

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.940
the world in front of us and
trying to find a box for it,

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.300
we immediately go for the
simplest solution.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.920
And 99.9% of the time,
that's fantastic.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.040
It's usually helpful.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.820
It's usually correct.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.250
And it's an amazing benefit
of being human that many

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.860
companies, including Google,
have tried to replicate.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.890
Think IBM trying to have a
computer that plays chess, or

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.920
a computer that plays Jeopardy!,
and all the stuff

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.970
that you guys do.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.720
It's an amazing thing of trying
to replicate what the

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.300
human brain actually does
just like that.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.630
But, occasionally, the human
brain is misleading.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.780
And the more we allow ourselves
to challenge our

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.050
instincts, to doubts these
boxes, and recognize that

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.050
maybe this group that we've
always thought of as our

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.980
customers could be broader
or narrower.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.630
And maybe the way that we've
always looked at this

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.370
particular segment, or the
strategy that we've always

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.150
held, might be open
to reinvention--

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.690
these are the kinds of things
that we need to doubt.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.040
Another example, what's this?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.060
12, 13, 14.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.170
This is what most of us
would normally say.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.570
And if I were to show you this,
you would very naturally

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:13.470
say, A, B, C. Nobody's going to
say A, 13, C or 12, B, 14

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.120
on the other one.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.070
But again, there's often more
than one correct way to

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.940
interpret something.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.310
The context always matters.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.750
And you may think this is just
a silly visual exercise.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.850
It's just as true in business.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:33.690
I'll give you an example, the
annual report of maybe not

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.870
Google because you have some
fun stuff, but the annual

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.230
report of a typical Fortune
500 company.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.660
You open it.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.810
The first page is what?

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.080
A letter from the CEO.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.290
Now I am going to oversimplify,
because that is

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.210
what I do, and tell you that
there are only two possible

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:56.810
letters from the CEO that can
appear there, basically.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.290
Number one, dear shareholders,
the results this year have

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.720
been excellent thanks to some
fantastic strategic decisions

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.220
that we made ba bum
bum bum bum.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.850
Number two, dear shareholders,
the results this year has been

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.680
quite disappointing because of
volcanic ash, terrorism,

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.000
recession, and all of
the other stuff

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.340
that's out of our control.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.850
We'll try and do better
next time.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.540
So you're never going to have
a letter with the exact same

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.860
financial results inside that
says, dear shareholders, we

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.500
had fantastic results because
we were really lucky.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.340
And we hope that holds.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.570
Or dear shareholders, we had
disappointing results this

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.930
year because we screwed up a
little bit and we did some

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:37.900
stupid decisions.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.810
But we're going to really
do better next year.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.450
We promise, trust us.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.300
You're not going to have that.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.140
But even if the numbers are
exactly the same, if your

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.050
customer research or trends
about what's happening in the

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.750
world are exactly the same,
there are multiple ways to

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.050
interpret it.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.060
So this is not just a 12,13,
14 silly example.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.870
It's important and relevant
in the business world.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.800
This is another example of the
context being really important

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.090
and how our minds jump
to conclusions.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.340
This one might take
a few seconds.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.400
That's doubt.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.070
Always start by challenging some
of your existing boxes,

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.520
some of your existing
perspectives.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.140
Because once you do that,
the rest is relatively

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:19.810
straightforward.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.640
When I say explore, for example,
this is the stuff

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.150
that we generally
know how to do.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.400
We can go and look at the 23 top
mega trends impacting our

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.950
space, or a massive customer
survey of 2000 people, or

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.380
competitive intelligence,
or network analysis.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.140
Whatever it is, we generally
know how to do that.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:41.220
But just be careful to
always maintain the

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.030
atmosphere of doubt.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.400
Just checking--

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.510
always be careful to keep this
atmosphere of doubt alive and

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.390
challenge the way you're looking
at these things.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.100
Look at them with
fresh lenses.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.130
That's the best advice for
this explore phase.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:59.080
OK, so once we doubt, once we
explore, we have to think

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.260
about the future.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.030
And in trying to think
creatively about the future

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.990
there will always be surprises,
like this.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.410
There will always be what are
called wild cards, black

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.060
swans, there's a lot
of words for them.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.960
These high impact but low
probability events that are

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.810
very obvious in retrospect.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.040
And the reason these
are so important--

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.620
not just in this example, but
volcanic ash or Gates giving

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.750
all his money to developing
world, stuff like that--

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.400
the reason these are so
important is because when we

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.590
think about the future, we have
a very natural tendency

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.830
to do it based on the past.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.400
And there's a lot of very
famous examples of this.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.910
The funnest one for today, of
course, is Steve Ballmer

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.980
saying in 2007, there's no
chance that the iPhone is

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.020
going to get any significant
market share.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.650
But there's hundreds
of those quotes.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.930
Margaret Thatcher saying in
1969, I don't think there will

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.090
be a woman prime minister
in my lifetime--

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.150
any of these things.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.660
We are not good at predicting
the future and we are

00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.840
overconfident.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.820
All the more reason that when we
explore, when we gather all

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.480
of these facts about the world
in front of us, we need to

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.670
keep this feeling of doubt.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.340
So once we do that, once we
go through the process of

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.060
identifying and challenging some
of our existing mental

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.940
models, then we can go into
the creative process.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.910
And this is the stuff, in terms
of divergence, getting a

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.220
lot of ideas on the table
without judgment.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.790
Quantity is good.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.620
Because whatever the criteria
are that you've set for what

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.250
is a good idea, there are going
to be some that exceed

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.530
the hurdle and some
that don't.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.640
And so Linus Pauling, a double
Nobel Prize winner, said the

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.870
best way to have a good idea
is to have a lot of ideas.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.610
And many people like Edison
and others would certainly

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.590
subscribe to that.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.550
Edison was a big believer in--

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.230
when somebody asked him, are
you going to give up?

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.510
You've been working on the
light bulb for so long.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.540
He famously said something like,
well, now I know 999

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.580
ways that it doesn't work.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.490
He didn't give up.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.000
And he had a whole pile of
inventions, as well.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.740
I won't go too much into that,
but the main point again--

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.470
divergence, get a lot of
ideas on the table.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.390
Convergence, select among them,
the prioritization.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:09.300
By the way, never try and do
both of them at the same time.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.460
The most frustrating thing in
any creative process is when

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.250
some people in the room are just
listing a lot of ideas,

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.920
and other people in the
room are picking them

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.960
apart one by one.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.420
And it's just thoroughly
frustrating for both sides.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.490
You've probably been in both.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.450
So there's a time
for divergence.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.570
There's a time for
convergence.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.540
Remember that you will have no
way of knowing a priori, no

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.680
way of knowing upfront, which
are the more incremental

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.978
ideas, like the two bladed razor
and the three bladed

00:28:35.978 --> 00:28:38.268
razor and the four blade razor,
or the iPhone 3, 4, 5,

00:28:38.268 --> 00:28:42.385
et cetera and which are the
truly transformational ideas,

00:28:42.385 --> 00:28:45.465
like the original iPhone and
penicillin and the Model T

00:28:45.465 --> 00:28:46.780
Ford, and all the rest of it.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.580
So you have to get it
all on the table.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.630
And also you have no way of
knowing a priori which are the

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.080
good ones and which
are the bad ones.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.040
So again, quantity first.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.800
Divergence first.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.940
I put in here a few of my
favorite type questions.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.160
I know that our time is a little
bit limited and I want

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.550
to leave time for Q and A. So
I'm not going to dwell on

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:11.840
these, just to say there is an
infinite number of ways to ask

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.980
fun questions in a creativity
workshop.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.890
If you go in and just say, how
can we be more creative?

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:17.900
How can we grow?

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.230
How can we cut costs?

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.480
We need more ideas to double our
size, or whatever it is,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.430
you're not really likely to
get interesting things.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.390
If you try and change
perspective, make it more

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.460
visual, reformulate the question
in a fun way--

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.010
then you are much, much more
likely to get much more

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.110
interesting results.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:39.050
If you are trying to cut costs
in creative ways then don't

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.540
just say what are some ideas.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.390
Say how would executives
at Ryanair do this?

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.170
If you're trying to think about
the customer experience

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.720
in fun ways, how would
executives at Disney do this?

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.170
What would a joint venture
with the New York Times

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.750
possibly lead to?

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.520
What sorts of things would I
have thought of if I were on

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.830
my first day out of college?

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.840
Or what sorts of ideas would
my grandmother think of?

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.450
All these kinds of what if type
questions help push us

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.090
outside of our existing boxes
and help us find new ones.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.130
That's the point.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.980
And there's no shortage
of ways to do that.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.540
So the last step then
is to reevaluate.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.310
And this kind of takes
us back to doubt.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.790
This is about always remembering
that no good idea

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.280
is good forever.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.100
And that applies again, to
penicillin, the Model T Ford,

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.190
and anything else.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.750
No good idea is good forever
because the world keeps

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.490
changing around us.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.040
And you can say, maybe in some
industries it might last for

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:35.610
five years.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.840
And in other industries a good
idea can last for 20 years.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.900
That's all fine.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.680
But one thing's for sure, in
today's world business cycles

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.980
are getting shorter across
all industries.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.110
The lifespan of a good idea is
getting shorter and shorter

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.770
almost everywhere.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.970
And this just makes creativity
even more important than it

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.360
ever has been before.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.080
So remember that no good
idea is good forever.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.710
Henry Ford, famously, no matter
how amazing the Model T

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.920
was, when General Motors and
others started changing, and

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.510
coming up with higher end cars,
and lower end cars, and

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.910
all the rest--

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.160
different color cars--

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.200
his famous quote, of course, was
my customers can have any

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.030
color car they want, as
long as it's black.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.340
He refused to change.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.010
He was a fantastically
innovative guy, but he was

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:20.950
still human.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.570
And all of us go through life
with blinders on, wedded to

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.840
our existing models.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.090
And so the more we can force
ourselves to go back to doubt,

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.010
to challenge that this Model T,
which has sold 15 million

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.820
units, and even today is one
of the best selling cars of

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.090
all time, is going to be
a good idea forever.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.860
Challenge those perspectives.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.120
One more example, just from the

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.170
business world, is Reuters.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.390
Now in the last few
years it was, of

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:47.990
course, acquired by Thomson.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:51.450
But quite interestingly, its
core box has stayed exactly

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.820
the same for 160 years.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.900
Reuters, we think of their box
as stock price delivery or

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.900
news delivery.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:05.210
Now, they were founded in 1851
by Julius Reuter in what was

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.810
then Prussia, now Germany.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.500
And their original,
overarching box--

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.520
what is our mission?

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.470
What is our goal?

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.290
To deliver the news
and stock prices.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.250
At the time, it was from Europe
to the United Kingdom.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:22.480
How did they do it in 1851?

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:27.150
They had a fleet of carrier
pigeons to get the news and

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.060
stock prices across the
English Channel.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.660
And so the interesting thing
about Reuters is that over the

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.140
last 160 years, of course
they've had to reinvent

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.740
themselves fundamentally, they
moved eventually to the

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.480
telegraph and they piloted
it and they

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.740
competed against others.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.030
And then they went to radio
technology, and eventually in

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.620
the last few decades to
satellites and the internet

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.560
and fiber optic, all
the rest of it.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.420
In other words, in order to keep
doing exactly the same

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.700
thing, they had to fundamentally
reinvent

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.530
themselves no less
than five times.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.280
And at any point, in any of
those transitions they could

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.270
have been beaten by
a competitor.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.690
But the only reason they
survived is because they were

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.300
constantly willing to
reevaluate, to doubt, to

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.500
challenge the fact that the way
things have been done so

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.760
far will always work.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.740
No good idea is good forever.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.920
And we don't like it when
we have to change our

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.450
perspective.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:25.940
When someone forces us out of
our existing box, like Henry

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.590
Ford we sometimes
go into denial.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.410
We don't like to change.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.380
We have to allow ourselves
to do so.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.690
We have to foster a culture
where that sort of thing is

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:34.660
encouraged.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.336
And at least when you
look at the--

00:33:37.336 --> 00:33:39.840
I don't know what it's actually
like to work here,

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.570
but everybody's perception is
that this is the type of

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.260
culture where that sort of thing
is, in fact, encouraged.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.830
Where people are encouraged to
challenge the status quo and

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.190
think about things
differently.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.730
That's the perception on surveys
and in the media.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.550
You can tell me after whether
it's true or not.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:58.200
But that's everybody sense
in the outside world.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.060
So a quick poll, multiple
choice question.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.810
Which of the following is
absolutely essential for a

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.110
successful brainstorm?

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:14.000
A big plate of cookies, the
latest technology, a fresh

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.239
setting, a new perspective,
coming up with new ideas, or

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:20.489
none of the above?

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.909
Who says A?

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:26.100
Well, OK.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.880
You have awesome food in
the cafeterias here.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.510
That's great.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.870
Who says B?

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:31.709
Who says C?

00:34:31.709 --> 00:34:37.170
OK, who says D?

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.250
And who says E?

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.340
OK, so a lot of D's and E's, and
maybe one person on A, B,

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.870
C. And I will just tell you
one last quick story then,

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:51.880
about why for us, at least, in
this particular box the answer

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.350
is in fact E. And why it is
possible to be very, very

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.310
creative and have an amazing
creative session without

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.770
coming up with a single
new idea.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:06.310
An example, Bic, the French
company founded after World

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:12.310
War II by Marcel Bic, for 30
years they made only pens.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.040
So imagine then, it's the
'70s, 30 years later.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.530
And you have the executive
team thinking

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.670
about how to grow.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.270
We need to grow.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:23.250
We need new ways to grow.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.770
And some of the executives Holly
will say, maybe we can

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.200
make these four color pens.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.360
And Henley might say, we
need erasable pens.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.800
We could do erasable pens.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.240
And we could refillable pens.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.350
And we could do branded pens
that say Sheraton or Hilton on

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.910
them, or whatever you want.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:46.180
And then you suddenly say, we
could do lighters, or razors.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.600
The immediate reaction from your
colleagues is bound to

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.610
be, what a crazy idea.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.920
We're a pen company.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:00.630
And yet with 40 years of
hindsight we all now know that

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:04.210
they made a lot of money off
of lighters and razors.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.910
So what happened?

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:06.800
What had to happen?

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.130
Each of the executives in the
room had to change their box

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:15.300
from we are a pen company to
we are a disposable plastic

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.250
consumer goods company,
or some such thing.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.880
It doesn't roll off the tongue
in the same way.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.800
But it's OK.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.120
We are a plastic
goods company.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.230
And if that is your box, then
lighters and razors are a

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.450
perfectly logical idea.

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.610
They're perfectly reasonable.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.750
And in fact it did open
the door to all sorts

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.030
of things for them.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.580
Now that doesn't mean that
erasable pens and all the

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.870
other ideas were bad ideas.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.090
They were just more incremental
ideas, like the

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.110
two bladed razor and the three
bladed razor that came after.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:49.110
But the truly transformational
ones require a change in box.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.970
But here's the most
interesting thing.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.490
Gillette was already
making cheap

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.380
disposable plastic razors.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.700
The lighters existed, too.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.590
In other words, they opened the
door in a creative way to

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.760
all sorts of new possibilities
simply by changing one of

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.480
their boxes on this side.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.700
Nothing changed on this side.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.740
They didn't actually invent
something new.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.170
They were very creative without
coming up with a

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.760
single new idea.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.580
So that's the point.

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.090
Creativity is about changing
perspective.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.930
It's about changing
your boxes.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.690
And it can be the box for how
you look at your company,

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.340
yourself, your customers,
your competitors.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.330
It can help you with a midlife
crisis, or changing an

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.250
organization design, or
whatever you want.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.960
It doesn't only have to be about
new product development.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.780
Creativity is about changing
perspective.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.810
And so that is a good
way to end, with

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:38.920
one last visual thing.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.770
So we, using our quick
heuristics, can immediately

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.110
decide what this says.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:49.320
Whereas a computer, like
Watson or any sort of

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.060
artificial intelligence, would
look at all the possible

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.880
permutations in a deductive way
of what this could say.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.700
We immediately look
at that and say,

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.820
well, it says, be creative.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.620
In a split second, right?

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:04.720
And yet, we have to
always doubt.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.560
Be creative, but always doubt.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.940
So that is the sort of lightning
version of the five

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.870
steps to "Thinking in New
Boxes." It's about philosophy,

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:15.700
and how we think.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.430
But it's also about practicality
and how we can

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:21.210
actually make this happen
in the business world.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.680
So be creative, but
always doubt.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.640
So thank you very much.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.103
We have a chunk of time for
questions, I think.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.940
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering
about the doubt part.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:39.212
How do you figure out, or
apply that to, sort of a

00:38:39.212 --> 00:38:40.140
complex problem, right?

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.710
Do you start doubting
everything?

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.440
Do you start doubting every
foundational idea that has

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.460
come before it?

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.420
Where do you--

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.700
where is it effective
to doubt?

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.950
Or what is it effective
to doubt?

00:38:55.157 --> 00:38:57.400
Well, you're matching,
so you both--

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.460
you wore your matching
outfits today.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.050
ALAN INY: Yesterday, too,
by coincidence.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.612
AUDIENCE: You've spent a lot
of time together, I assume.

00:39:06.612 --> 00:39:07.770
LUC DE BRABANDERE: So probably
the first thing to do is to

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:11.212
give a good definition
of what is to doubt.

00:39:11.212 --> 00:39:16.070
To doubt is not a kind
of bad feeling.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:22.190
It's about, remember, at any
time that here, you only have

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.110
simplifications.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:27.920
So that's to doubt.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.460
I like to tell, great
managers never

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.600
hesitate and always doubt.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.830
So if you're a manager, and
somebody asks you, the client

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.360
doesn't pay-- send a reminder.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.780
The machine is broken--

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:41.590
call the company.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.510
You don't hesitate.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:47.740
But you should remember at any
time that if it's possible for

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:53.270
you not to hesitate, it is
because one day you select one

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.730
simplification, a strategy,
you're going to do this.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.910
And doubt is on the
other side.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.960
It's just a reminder.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:07.532
It's just, we are built with
simplification in our mind,

00:40:07.532 --> 00:40:08.030
assumption.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:11.430
And to doubt is from time to
time to challenge those

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.710
assumptions.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:17.320
So to answer your question, the
first thing to I believe,

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.080
is to list your assumptions.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.010
And sometimes they
are unconscious.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.780
We always said this,
why [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.960
Maybe we can do that
differently.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.880
So you know what I mean?

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.880
ALAN INY: Let me add
to that and give a

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.420
business example as well.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.390
Because I think this idea of,
identifying as many of your

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:39.110
assumptions--

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.210
and of course you can't change
them all at the same time.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.060
That's when you would
become sort of a

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.070
caricature of a good manager.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.440
You can't change everything.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.770
But imagine 40, 50 years ago,
all of the airlines are the

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.200
sort of traditional Pan Am,
British Airways type.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.060
And there's no such thing yet
as a low cost airline.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.010
So what are the very specific
assumptions and constraints

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:00.740
that have to change?

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.150
Well, we have many types of
planes to serve different

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.160
definitions.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.390
We have one type of plane,
because it's cheaper.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.730
We go to the main airports
in each city.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.170
We are going to go to
secondary airports.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.510
We have assigned seating.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.410
We have open seating.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.130
We have all-inclusive pricing.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:17.700
We have unbundled pricing.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.680
We use travel agents.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.510
We don't use travel agents.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.180
All of these things, to be very
specific about what your

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.950
existing assumptions and boxes
are, and then figure out which

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.750
ones of them you're very
deliberately going to change,

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.620
which constraints you're
going to break--

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.870
that's what we mean by doubt.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.000
What else?

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.645
AUDIENCE: One of the challenges
that comes to my

00:41:40.645 --> 00:41:43.318
mind is [INAUDIBLE] the velocity
of execution rate.

00:41:43.318 --> 00:41:47.886
We live in a world with this
[INAUDIBLE] pressure, we have

00:41:47.886 --> 00:41:49.170
to get things out.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:54.550
So this sounds great, but I'm
wondering if you have any tips

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:57.620
on making it more practical,
sellable.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.868
Let's say you want to start
doubting, or like the person

00:42:00.868 --> 00:42:02.118
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:08.130
You have to give yourself time
and space to allow for that

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.610
exercise to happen.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.730
Have you faced that in
your discussions?

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:20.390
And what has worked for you to
encourage and get people to

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.030
actually say, aha, we need
to take this on.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:27.170
LUC DE BRABANDERE: Part of the
answer is called scenario.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:30.630
So part of the future
you can more or less

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.540
expect, based on forecast.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.430
The other part [INAUDIBLE],
including the ash of volcano,

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.320
there's no way to make
any kind of forecast.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:45.340
So we recommend to increase
preparation.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.630
And so if you take uncertainty
on the right side of my

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.080
[INAUDIBLE], the other
side of the

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.870
simplification is called scenario.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.490
In this particular case,
a set of scenarios.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.900
So there is a way to disseminate
the language of

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.480
uncertainty.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:07.770
We did that, maybe fifty times
in company, just like this

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:12.220
habit, to live with
uncertainty in

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.120
your mind, like this.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.450
And so now you're thinking of
the best way to do that, using

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:18.940
this method.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:23.660
ALAN INY: So I agree with the
idea of using scenarios to

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.630
embrace uncertainty.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.250
Because even if our natural
tendency is to try and

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:30.270
eliminate it, if we realize that
we never can, then let's

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.140
embrace it.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.320
But on the more individual
level, in terms of how to

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.910
foster doubt, how to set this
up in organizations, my best

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.820
suggestion is that sometimes
these kinds of thought

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.900
exercises, like describe your
company without using the most

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:48.760
obvious words like coffee,
like Luc tried earlier--

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.380
there's a lot of these that
can be done in 10 minutes.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.680
There's a lot of these that can
be done by shutting the

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.650
laptop, taking a white piece of
paper, or a flip chart, or

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:59.780
a blank document, whatever
you want.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.190
And just thinking
a little bit.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.330
You don't need to take eight
hours and methodically list

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:06.900
all of your assumptions,
though over

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.200
time that can't hurt.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.730
But to be very quick and
specific about it, you can

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:11.980
still make some progress.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.220
What else?

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:21.100
Please.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.690
AUDIENCE: Apart from the tip
jar example that you gave,

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:28.830
what is one of the most
interesting new boxes that

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:34.190
you've seen on the fly?

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.580
LUC DE BRABANDERE: My answer
would be Google.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:44.145
Because when you started, the
box, the simplification was,

00:44:44.145 --> 00:44:47.010
we're going to build
a search engine.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.720
And so for a couple of years
that was the main vision.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.270
So we have to do this.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:57.160
But imagine that nobody would
have changed that?

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.620
Today, no Google anymore.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.505
It's because one day you had
this famous meme, let's manage

00:45:03.505 --> 00:45:05.980
the information of the world
or something like that.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.840
That's one of the most beautiful
examples I know.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:13.140
Otherwise, no Google in
the world, definitely.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.700
And probably you have more.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.750
But that's an example
I very often give.

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.290
ALAN INY: I saw a curved
escalator a

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.530
couple of days ago.

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:28.270
Sixth floor, down to the
fifth floor, like this.

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:30.760
Just in terms of ones I
see on the fly, right?

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.510
Not the big, the Google-- all
of these are fantastic

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:35.250
example, sure.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.950
But like the tip jar, something
I just happened--

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:40.910
I was at the Bloomberg
building.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.950
And a curved escalator,
it was fantastic.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:44.780
And very expensive,
by the way--

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.514
I asked about that,
too, afterward.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.450
AUDIENCE: Another question.

00:45:56.382 --> 00:45:59.606
You had an interesting example
of Bic and the pens, and how

00:45:59.606 --> 00:46:02.830
they redefined themselves from
a pen company to a disposable

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:03.822
plastics company.

00:46:03.822 --> 00:46:07.790
And I'm wondering, have you
seen companies go through

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:09.310
multiple iterations?

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:13.718
So you redefine yourself
once, are they stuck

00:46:13.718 --> 00:46:15.710
with this new box?

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.694
Have you seen companies go
through this multiple times?

00:46:19.694 --> 00:46:21.686
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:21.686 --> 00:46:23.890
LUC DE BRABANDERE: Reuters
was a good example.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:25.430
Reuters.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:27.180
ALAN INY: Reuters is a good one
in the sense that, even

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.540
though they kept their big
overarching box of we are

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.010
this, they changed fundamentally
all of the

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.520
underlying mechanics of
how they did that.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.280
So that's a good example
in some sense.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.490
LUC DE BRABANDERE: A lot
of good examples.

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:49.405
Dannon, Dannon used to
be a glass company.

00:46:49.405 --> 00:46:54.040
[INAUDIBLE], just glass,
manufacturing bottles.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.530
And one day they said, OK, we
should focus on the contents.

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:05.890
And then after decades of being
a conglomerate, like

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:09.040
Nabisco, or whatever, known
for making food, quality

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.960
food-- they switched
their box again.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.660
Instead of good food, they
switched to food

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.110
that's good for you.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.370
And they sold off their beer
division, they sold off their

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:18.360
cookies division.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.340
And now all of us know them as
water, and yogurt, and baby

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.150
food, I think.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.610
So now they focus on healthy
food that's good.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.610
Again, these multiple
switches do happen.

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:32.470
Tends to not be year after
year after year.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.170
But it's fun when it does.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:42.716
AUDIENCE: Reading about Pepsi
and what happened when the CEO

00:47:42.716 --> 00:47:46.612
decided that they wanted
to focus more on

00:47:46.612 --> 00:47:48.070
making healthier products.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:50.500
And he tried it for
about a year.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.497
And then there was a lot of
shareholder push back, and

00:47:53.497 --> 00:47:53.902
they said don't do it.

00:47:53.902 --> 00:47:56.332
And then he had to
switch back.

00:47:56.332 --> 00:47:58.640
I'm asking, was that
the wrong idea?

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.100
Or could he have done it
in a way that worked?

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.730
ALAN INY: I'll give you another
example along those

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:04.130
lines, as well.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.620
Because--

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.410
take Netflix.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:10.470
In many ways, a fantastic
new box at first.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:14.610
Changing, essentially killing
the video store, video rental

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:18.000
in a store business, and
replacing it with a new box of

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.760
DVD rental by mail.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.870
OK, new box, 10 years, millions
of subscribers,

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:24.270
excellent--

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:25.050
then what happens?

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:28.150
Just like in the example you
said, they changed a little

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:31.320
bit too early for their
customers by trying to split

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:35.270
into two with the streaming
business as well as the mail.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:36.350
And there was a huge outcry.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:40.680
They lost hundreds of thousands
of subscribers and

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.810
shareholder value and all the
rest, very upsetting.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.590
They recovered.

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:48.870
And now, who two years ago
would have predicted that

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.670
Netflix would have award-winning
original

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:53.050
television programming?

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:55.820
This is an extraordinary
new box, and

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.890
actually decent stuff.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:01.240
And so really again,
continuously reevaluating and

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.840
rethinking some of
these things.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.900
But you're right.

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.450
The main takeaway from what you
said is that there is a

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:08.390
right moment for any change.

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:09.660
And sometimes it'll
be too early.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.260
Sometimes it'll be too late.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.160
The most obvious example,
to me, is YouTube.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:18.060
If somebody had invented that
a few years earlier there

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.980
would never been enough
bandwidth.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.150
Nobody had enough bandwidth.

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:24.770
Not enough people had high speed
internet in their homes,

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.430
is what I'm trying to say, for
it to be very successful.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.840
And of course, if they had
invented it a few years later,

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.210
someone else would have come
up with something.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.720
And it would be called
something else.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.180
So it is a question of timing.

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.170
You're quite right.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:39.360
And Netflix, YouTube, and the
example you said are all good

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.810
examples of that.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:42.950
It's about what is the right
new box and when?

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:51.750
Good, well, thank you very
much for having us here.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.850
And we're available to stick
around and talk more.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:58.610
Sign books if anyone takes them,
and really, it's lovely

00:49:58.610 --> 00:49:59.400
to be here.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.200
[APPLAUSE]
