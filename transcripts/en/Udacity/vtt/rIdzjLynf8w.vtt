00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When we calculate error with multiple measurements, we're focused on precision.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's talk about what precision is. Let's say this is you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You're a pretty tall person, you know you are about 2 m tall but you're really curious

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
about exactly how tall you are, so you ask your doctor,  Doctor, how tall am I?"

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
She says, "Well, your height is 2.00 meters. You can trust me; I'm a doctor."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"Okay," you say, "Can you do that measurement again just so I can feel confident about the measurement?"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"Sure, no problem." She does the measurement again. She finds, "Well, you have a height of 1.20 meters.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
"I did the measurement and I'm a doctor. You can trust me.  "

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You're a little confused so you say, "Well, why don't you make that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
measurement again, I just want to be sure."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"Well, I did the measurement a third time like you asked, and I've found your height.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It is 2.80 meters.You could trust me. I am a doctor."

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now my question--do you trust your doctor?
