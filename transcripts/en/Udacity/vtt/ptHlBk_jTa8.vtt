00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.719
Course support. You have a few ways of accessing

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.030
support while taking these courses on Udacity through Georgia

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.680
Tech. Your course forum is going to be your primary

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.000
channel for getting support. The forum we used is called

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.210
Piazza. You can check it out on piazza.com. After

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.982
you enroll and are registered in a class, you'll

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:22.754
be able to access a special course forum dedicated

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:25.460
to you and your classmates taking the class at the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.079
same time. You will sign up to join your

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.691
course forum by email, from the instructor or your

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:34.550
TA. You should get this email by the first

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.390
day of the semester. After you're signed into Piazza, you

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.490
can access the forum through a link next to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.002
the course viewer in the classroom. You can also navigate

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.580
directly to piazza.com and access your courses that way.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.490
I'll walk you through the forum later in this lesson.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.860
Each class has its own private forum on

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.590
Piazza for each semester. Only the course staff and

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.474
your classmates have access to this forum. Your

00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:02.740
course staff includes the instructor of record for the

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.896
course, the head TA, and additional TAs. On

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:09.557
Piazza they're all categorized as instructors. So while you're

00:01:09.557 --> 00:01:12.481
taking your course if you ever have questions about

00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:15.677
content or logistics, please post your question in the

00:01:15.677 --> 00:01:18.465
forum for the course staff and your classmates to

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:21.936
help answer. You can also post privately to the course

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:25.358
staff, again, on Piazza they're called instructors, if you're

00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:29.770
not comfortable sharing your question with the entire class. For

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.930
example, if your question includes sensitive information or code

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.080
that you're not sure you're supposed to share with classmates.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.630
I'll show you how to do this in the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.680
next few videos. For now, just know that this option

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.420
is available. Your TAs for the course will

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.910
also be available through office hours. These office hours

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.714
should be held every week. Typically we'll use software

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:53.336
like Google Hangouts and On Air to enable live

00:01:53.336 --> 00:01:57.440
video conferencing. You'll get more information on how

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.715
to access the office hours, and how to set

00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:02.720
up for them in each class. Finally, you can

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.420
always reach out to your course staff by email.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.892
Each course will have its own support email address, which you can find in

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:14.640
the course material section of the class on Udacity. If you can't find this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.710
email address, just email us at gt-support@udacity.com.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.241
And we will redirect you. If you've

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:27.850
questions regarding academic advising, registration, admissions, payment,

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.958
or other Georgia Tech administrative or program inquiries,

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.303
please email Georgia Tech directly at omscs.cc.gatech.edu

00:02:36.303 --> 00:02:36.799
