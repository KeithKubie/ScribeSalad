00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're basically there. We need to install some object let say that was Benjamin Franklin's idea.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I think you could probably tell me what property this object ought to have

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
if we want it to get struck by lightening or to sort of discharge these clouds

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in order to prevent the lightening from hitting the building.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So using everything we know about electricity, should the object we install here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
should it be tall or should it be short.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Also should it be conducting as in should charge be allowed to flow along it or should be an insulator.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Should it be grounded or should it not be grounded?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is the sort of thought process that I'm sure Benjamin Franklin

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
went through when solving this problem.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For each of these options, can you select one of the two radio buttons. Good luck.
