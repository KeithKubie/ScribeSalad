00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:09.727
We already know that the world is made of things,

00:00:09.727 --> 00:00:11.024
things like cats

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:12.464
and macaroni salad,

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.317
and macaroni salad is made of things

00:00:14.317 --> 00:00:15.326
like mayo

00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:16.186
and mustard

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:16.988
and celery,

00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:18.817
which are all made of molecules.

00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:20.099
As we'll see, these molecules

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.638
are made of the same stuff,

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.688
just mixed together in different ways.

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:25.185
Let's go back to our macaroni salad.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:27.238
We've already unmixed things physically

00:00:27.238 --> 00:00:28.349
as much as we can.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.520
Now, we'll go further and unmix things chemically

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.111
by breaking some bonds.

00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:33.567
Many larger, complex molecules

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:36.236
are just a bunch of smaller molecules bonded together

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.467
like building blocks.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.309
Here, again, macaroni salad provides a nice example.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.477
If you look at the pasta,

00:00:41.477 --> 00:00:43.555
you'll notice it's made of a lot of this stuff,

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.439
starch,

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.719
which is this molecule,

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.274
otherwise known as amylose.

00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:48.607
Turns out, if you break some bonds,

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:51.267
amylose is made up of smaller molecules

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:53.566
of glucose, a simple sugar.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.002
If you take a bunch of these same glucose molecules

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.841
and rearrange them in a different way,

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.320
you get cellulose,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.186
which is what plants are made of.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.996
So, while this piece of pasta made of amylose

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:06.519
and this wooden spoon made of cellulose

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.774
look vastly different,

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:09.917
they're both essentially made of the same molecules,

00:01:09.917 --> 00:01:11.558
just stuck together differently.

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:13.677
This type of breaking apart and recombining

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:15.876
is what goes on when you digest food.

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.333
The complex proteins found in the foods we eat,

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.476
like carrots and eggs,

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:20.879
can't be used by our bodies

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.440
because we are not carrots or chickens.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.438
What we can use are the smaller molecules

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:27.107
that make up these proteins,

00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:28.245
the amino acids.

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:31.077
During digestion, our bodies break these proteins up

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:32.236
into their amino acids

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:34.357
so they can be rearranged and put back together

00:01:34.357 --> 00:01:36.268
to make human proteins.

00:01:36.268 --> 00:01:37.640
But let's keep breaking bonds.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.917
All molecules are made up of atoms bonded together.

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.637
If some molecules are building blocks,

00:01:42.637 --> 00:01:44.437
atoms are the building blocks

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.920
of the building blocks.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.689
And you'll notice that with the molecules

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:48.879
from macaroni salad,

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.903
the same six types of atoms keep showing up:

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:52.677
carbon,

00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:53.190
hydrogen,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.837
oxygen,

00:01:53.837 --> 00:01:54.605
nitrogen,

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:55.273
phosphorus,

00:01:55.273 --> 00:01:56.188
and sulfur,

00:01:56.188 --> 00:01:57.965
or CHONPS.

00:01:57.965 --> 00:01:59.091
There's a few others,

00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:02.647
but the big six is what macaroni salad is made of.

00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:04.038
If we went a step further,

00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:05.767
we could use these same atoms,

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:06.768
recombine them,

00:02:06.768 --> 00:02:08.160
and make other stuff

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.105
like gasoline

00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:10.439
or sulfuric acid,

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.189
methane,

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.557
and nylon.

00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:14.230
It's all made from the same elements

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.877
that make up macaroni salad.

00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:17.026
So, to recap,

00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:19.037
everything is made of atoms.

00:02:19.037 --> 00:02:22.022
They are the stuff that things are made of.

00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:23.517
Atoms are grouped together in different ways

00:02:23.517 --> 00:02:24.966
to form molecules.

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:27.556
These molecules are constantly being combined,

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:28.270
broken apart,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.477
and recombined.

00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:30.773
They get thrown into mixtures,

00:02:30.773 --> 00:02:31.602
separated,

00:02:31.602 --> 00:02:32.356
remixed

00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:34.316
over and over and over again.

00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:35.941
The stuff that things are made of

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:38.041
is always in flux;

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.357
it's always changing.

00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:42.395
Macaroni salad is only macaroni salad for a short time.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.286
You eat it,

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:44.767
some of it becomes part of you,

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:46.717
the rest eventually goes into the ocean

00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:48.772
and gets eaten by other animals that die,

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.880
and after millions of years, they turn into oil,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.639
which is where gasoline comes from.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.686
And that's why gasoline and macaroni salad

00:02:54.686 --> 00:02:56.102
are not that different -

00:02:56.102 --> 00:02:57.684
they're both made of the same stuff,

00:02:57.684 --> 00:02:59.316
just one tastes better.
