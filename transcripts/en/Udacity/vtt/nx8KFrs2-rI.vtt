00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.300
So how do you feel?

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.490
HTTP is weird, isn't it?

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.339
But it is the foundation
of the web as we know it.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:05.580
And the knowledge
you just gained

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.560
is invaluable and will
help you understand why

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:09.419
things behave the way they do.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.240
Before we dive into
HTTP/2, though,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.580
we should talk about
encryption in HTTPS.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.070
It is a highly
misunderstood topic

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.539
and has a reputation
of being only

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.179
for enterprise organizations
and e-commerce sites.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.519
That is definitely not correct.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.185
So grab a drink.

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:23.620
It's much simpler
than it sounds.
