00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.690
The first one of course is not a functional property because condition two is not fulfilled.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.320
All computer programs are computer programs.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.400
There is no computer program that is not a computer program.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.950
Of course, this sounds a bit silly but it's actually

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.270
the only example I could think of where this condition here is violated.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.730
A program always returns one already is a functional property.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.590
First of all, it describes how output relates to the input

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.420
namely output doesn't care about the input and is always one

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.560
and property two is also always satisfied.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.750
For example, there are computer programs that I could write that always return two

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.800
and property two is fulfilled for all the other three as well, so I won't even mention it anymore.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.550
A program solves vertex cover?

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.400
Yes, definitely that describes an input-output behavior, how output relates to the input.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.170
Is a computer a virus? I would say yes, this is a functional property.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.750
Now, it is a bit debatable if saying it is a computer virus

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.220
already described sufficiently how the output relates to the input

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.420
but I would say that probably any definition of a computer virus that you would give me

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.470
would in some way describe what the computer virus is doing.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.450
So, it might ignore anything that receives and overwrite your hard disc,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.020
so put something in the memory, or it might lock your screen.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.850
So, I would say here, the input-output behavior is variable

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.510
depending on how you define computer virus but it is always defined.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
Now, the final one that is a bit of a tricky one saying that

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.480
a program only requires linear time is not a functional property

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.770
because that does not describe how the output relates to the input.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.060
It is the property of the program but it is not a functional property

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.910
because it doesn't ask what does the program do

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.700
and what does the program do is actually this relationship here.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.690
It only asked how fast that the program are doing that.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.200
This is something that is a little more tricky to figure out,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.290
but basically, any time that you ask can a program do X

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.920
that will be a functional property that you are asking for

00:01:49.920 --> 99:59:59.000
at least in almost any of the cases.
