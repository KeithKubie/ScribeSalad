00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.810
So what I would like to tell you about is a generalization of both MDPs and

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.050
repeated games, that is, that goes by the

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.460
name of Stochastic games, also sometimes Markov games.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.890
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.790
&gt;&gt; I like the name Marcov game better, but I used Stochastic game because

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.440
that's what people call it and sometimes

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.860
it's good to use words that other people

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.750
use. And what what Stochastic games give us is a formal model. For multiagent

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.990
reinforcement learning. In fact, I like to think of this in terms of an analogy.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.220
Which is something like MDP is to RL

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.100
as stochastic game is to multiagent RL. It's a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.100
formal model. That let's us express the sorts of

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.135
problems that take place in this formalized problem setting.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.080
&gt;&gt; Hm. That sounds very promising.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.330
&gt;&gt; Cool. Alright so let me let me give

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
you a, I'll start off by explaining it in

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.700
terms of an example and then I'll give a

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.340
more formal definition because you know, I can't not.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.520
So so this is a little game played between A and B. Oh, I should

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.200
have it between smooth and curly, but At

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.470
the traditionally it's played between A and B.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.720
&gt;&gt; Mm, and sometimes it's good to use the words that other people use.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.440
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've heard that. I wouldn't say it quite

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.740
that way. So this is a three by three grid

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.710
each of the players can go north, south, east and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.270
west. And can stay put if that's helpful. And the,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.900
the transitions are deterministic, except for through

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.436
these, these walls here which are called semi-walls.

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:22.712
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:24.270
&gt;&gt; So these thick lines represent walls that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.430
you can't go through, the thin, wall, lines

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.690
just represent cell boundaries, but this kind of

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.290
dashed line here is a semi-wall, and that means

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.680
If you try to go through that, say by going north from, if A goes north

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.650
from this position, then 50% probability A will

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.390
actually go to the next state, and 50% probability

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.930
A will stay where A is. So, the goal is to get to

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.630
the dollar sign. And if you get to the dollar sign you get

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.520
a hundred dollars. So if we ignore A for a second, what should

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.010
B do to minimize the number of steps necessary to get the reward.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.390
&gt;&gt; Go left, and then go up and go up. Oh,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.580
I'm sorry. Go west, and then go north and then go north.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what should A do ignoring B?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.072
&gt;&gt; Go east and then go north and then north.

00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:05.292
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:10.829
Unfortunately these guys live in the world together, and

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:16.722
what happens is, they can't occupy the same square. And as soon as

00:02:16.722 --> 00:02:19.622
somebody reaches the dollar sign the game ends and the other

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:23.980
player, if the other player hasn't reached the dollar sign, gets nothing.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.480
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.280
&gt;&gt; So now there's a little bit of contention.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.540
&gt;&gt; So what happens if A and B both try to go,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.720
to the same square at the same time?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.690
&gt;&gt; Let's say that we flip a coin and one of them gets to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.050
go, first and then the other one will bounce off of the first one.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.330
&gt;&gt; But that's not a problem when it comes to reaching the money.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
&gt;&gt; But it's not a problem, yes, right, so

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.764
the money is kind of like a money pit.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:49.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't think that's what a money pit is, but okay.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.190
&gt;&gt; And so they can dive in and they

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.480
both get the money, because they're in the money pit.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.390
&gt;&gt; I like it.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.850
&gt;&gt; So what do you do if you're A?

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.970
How do you play this game? Oh! Let's think of another thing. Is, can you think

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.820
of what, what it might mean to, to have a Nash Equilibrium in a game like this?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.330
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's an interesting question. It would

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.760
mean, well, it would mean, well, what do you

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.800
mean, what would it mean? It would mean

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.670
that, neither one of them would want to deviate.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.590
&gt;&gt; It would mean a pair of strategies for the two players.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.310
Now the strategies are now multi-step

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.560
things that say, they're like policies, right?

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.824
&gt;&gt; So...
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:16.824 --> 00:03:21.120
&gt;&gt; Like it's a pair of policies, such that neither would

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.630
prefer to switch. So can you think of

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.610
a pair of policies that would have that property.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.680
&gt;&gt; Well, no I'm not sure. I was trying

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.252
to think about that. I was thinking that kind

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:34.690
of, if I were a nice guy what I would want to do is I would want us both

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.410
to try to go through the, the semi walls,

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.020
and if we both go through the semi-walls we just

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.720
go up again and then we, we hit the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.090
dollar sign at the same time. And that's very nice.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.970
&gt;&gt; So okay, good. So that,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.040
that seems like a cooperative kind of strategy, right?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.065
Where they're both you know, 50% oh I'm sorry,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.780
25% of the time both will get through,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.185
both will go to the goal together. Hooray. But...

00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:58.050
&gt;&gt; 25% of the time neither one will get through and

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.150
then we're in the same place we were before, so that's okay.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.590
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.590
&gt;&gt; The problem is the other 50% where one

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.620
of them gets through and the other one doesn't.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.410
&gt;&gt; Right, so what do, what you do if

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.030
you make it through and the other one doesn't?

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.080
&gt;&gt; What do I do, if I get through, and

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.050
the other one doesn't? Well if I am only going to

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.850
do this the one time then I just keep

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.160
going and get the dollar, and the other person loses.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, alright, so what this works out to

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.550
be, is that A is going to get to the

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.080
goal. 2 3rd's of the time, and B is going

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.500
to get to the goal 2 3rd's of the time.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.690
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.600
&gt;&gt; So, alright, so if that's the case, if

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.980
I say, okay, A, that's what you should do, B,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.720
that's what you should do. Then is there a

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.070
way that either A or B can switch strategies and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.530
do better?

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.120
&gt;&gt; Well, if B, for example, decides to go west and then go up, what happens?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.170
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a good question. B will now make it to the

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.540
goal a 100% of the time, and A will only make it to the

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.650
goal 50% of the time. So B has an incentive to switch to

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.140
that, to this strategy if we tell them to both go through the semi-wall.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.320
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.780
&gt;&gt; So that wasn't a Nash Equilibrium. B would wanted switch this new policy.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.060
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.260
&gt;&gt; Is this a Nash Equilibrium?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.990
&gt;&gt; No. Wait, is it? No. Because, why doesn't A just choose to go west east?

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.560
&gt;&gt; Well, would, would A do better on average by switching to this strategy?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.260
&gt;&gt; Well let's see. no, actually. Oh, no,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.710
no, you said half the time they go through.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.440
&gt;&gt; So half the time you flip a coin. So half the time I don't make it.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.660
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.750
&gt;&gt; But half the time I do.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.080
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.680
actually, it looks the same.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.200
&gt;&gt; It looks the same. That's right.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.790
&gt;&gt; And B would go from 1 to one half.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH] So, it, A doesn't have an incentive to

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.220
do it, but B is hoping very much that A doesn't do that.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.630
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.650
&gt;&gt; So so, yeah. So that, so there's one Nash Equilibrium

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.330
where B takes the center. Another one where A takes the center.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.040
I guess if, if they do, if we do this coin

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.330
flip thing, it, it works out this way. If it's the case

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.100
that if they both if we change the rules here. So

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.800
that if they collide, neither of them gets to go. Then go,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.080
both trying to go to the center is not a Nash equilibrium

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.700
anymore, because you can do better by actually going up the semi-wall.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.630
&gt;&gt; Right. And so if we, if, if collision means nobody

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.400
goes through, then, suddenly, you'd want to do the other thing.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.960
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.460
&gt;&gt; Or one of you goes through the semi-wall and one goes the direct way.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.400
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.450
So we can see that there's a bunch

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.940
of different Nash equilibrium here, sorry, Nash equilibria

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.540
here. And that it's not so obvious how you'd find them, but it is at least

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.790
clear that they exist and they have a

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.580
different form than what we had before, because

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.770
they're not policies instead of these otherwise simplified

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.630
just you know, choose this row of the matrix.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.226
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:38.260
&gt;&gt; Cool. Alright. So let's think about how

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.860
we might learn in these kinds of environments.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.930
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay, I like that already.
