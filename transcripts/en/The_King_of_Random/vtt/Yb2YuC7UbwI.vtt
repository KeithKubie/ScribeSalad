00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.959
Hey guys welcome back, thanks for joining me today on the king of random our experiment today is something

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.989
I'm very excited to try because it's something I've wondered about for a long time

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.360
I've often wondered how different things would burn in a vacuum chamber, but it's really hard to get something ignited inside there

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.820
You can't really have a blowtorch because there's no way to turn it on and it's adding fuel which is gonna make vapors and you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.639
Can't really light matches inside because you can't reach in while it's a vacuum

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.580
I think the Soraa scorcher is the perfect solution for that the focus light from the solar scorcher will add heat inside the vacuum chamber

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.569
But no fuel or anything with mass so it should work to light things on fire

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.418
The question is what happens after they start burning so the purpose of today's video is to see if we can cook

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.529
Marshmallows in our simulated outer space after we're finished with the marshmallows

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.899
We'll probably try throwing a few more things in the vacuum chambers

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.939
See what happens if you burn them without any air or pressure of course to be using the solar scorcher we need sunlight

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.129
So let's head outside. We've got a vacuum chamber. We've got a solar scorcher and now that we're outside. We've got some good sunshine

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.339
Let's see how marshmallows cook in outer space in a jar oh

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.780
There's our marshmallow already growing

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.289
They grow up so fast oh

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.770
And now it's collapsing back down again

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.699
All right this little jar pulls a vacuum pretty fast

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.979
We go our gauge is saying that we have about 26 inches of mercury of negative pressure in there so now

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.409
Let's see if we can cook our marshmallow

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.490
through the glass

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.949
All right, I can focus it more than that but I'm sure that would just burn the marshmallow right away

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.550
I'm trying to see if I could get kind of a nice cooked surface on it

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.979
You know what just to make sure that it is doing something

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.649
I am gonna focus in a dot and see if the marshmallow burns. Oh

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.040
Yep, it burns

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.459
Look at that smoke it didn't like travel anywhere. Just kind of just hanging around in the same spot

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460
Let's do that again for some more smoke

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.839
That's a neat little effect, and now it's like falling to the bottom

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.679
I kind of thought it would just instantly fill the whole container since the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.199
container has no air in it and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.509
Now the dark spots on the marshmallow are burning more than the light spots because they absorb more of the heat

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.419
Focus off of those a little bit think I'm getting a pretty good result if I almost focus it into a point

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.899
You know what that's too much fun. I'm just gonna make a lot of smoke

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.429
That's so funny the way it just like shoots up like that it's so fun a

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:39.358
Smoke is settling at the bottom. I guess the smoke has mass and there's nothing else for it to rise above

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.560
So it just stays at the bottom make some more

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.689
Think now I'm mostly just burning splattered marshmallow on the side of the glass all right, let's repress your eyes

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.509
Oh, it smells like marshmallow it smells like burnt marshmallow

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
That's the funkiest looking oh

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.310
That is so weird the crystallized sugar kind of holds its shape, but the rest of the marshmallow doesn't at all

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.729
So it just kind of collapsed around the burned portions

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.000
It's so sad looking almost like a weirdly

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.869
Large piece of popcorn well, I'm gonna eat it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300
Mmm. There's like burnt sugar

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.229
There you go using sunlight to cook marshmallows in our simulated outer space the result is that while you can cook them?

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.250
It's very slow

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.190
it's very hard to do evenly and the heat doesn't distribute through the marshmallow very well at all, so you just get kind of a

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.379
Shrunken raisin husk of a marshmallow with a little bit of cooked parts on it

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.699
However the solar scorcher is putting heat through the glass into the vacuum chamber

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.069
So let's try some other things in there and see how well they burn to protect the glass of a vacuum jar

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.679
I've got a piece of styrofoam of an inch thick and some foil I'm just gonna wrap the foil around the styrofoam and use that

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.380
To put stuff on while I burn it the first thing. I'm gonna try burning is some matches obviously in a vacuum

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.940
There's not going to be any oxygen of pressure

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.709
But hopefully the match heads will still at least ignite a little bit when they're hit with the heat from solar scorcher

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.359
And hit this first match here see what happens with concentrated sunlight

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500
Not a whole lot

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.350
Smoke flew off of it, but it didn't flare up even a little bit. I thought that some

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.270
Like I thought we would see it burning a little bit more than that let's try this next one

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.469
See the smoke looks. Oh there goes faster

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.499
So there is a fast point where it goes off. That's something all right one more

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.380
There it goes

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.600
The texture on that is pretty interesting. It doesn't look anything like a normal burned match

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.739
It's like I dip it in glue and then stuck a bunch of sand to it or something

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.450
Next up was try lighting a little bit of firework fuse the match heads had a really hard time lighting

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.819
So I'm not sure if the fuse is going to be able to pass its ignition

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520
down the line

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.840
Kind of here it

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.459
It's still burning it's burning slower than normal

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.619
But it is burning all that smoke is really thick Oh

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.299
Saw some movement down at the bottom. I think the fuse got short enough that it's burning started propelling it around on the bottom

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
Launched itself off

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.279
That a nice smoke spot on our lid

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.090
Fuses make a lot of smoke apparently wow

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.340
There's a little bit of remnants in there, but for the most part the fuse is gone

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.540
So I think it burns slower than normal, but it did burn good to know

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.259
Well, that's so thick look at the difference of this

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.140
What I've wiped it off

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.039
Very big smoke that builds up on the walls if you smoked a lot

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.309
We're gonna try and one-up that by just lighting off some of our colored smoke powder

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.740
Normally the smoke powder has a chain reaction if you ignite just one part of it and the whole thing will get lit I kind

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.139
Of don't think it's gonna work that way with this stuff

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.809
We're definitely getting smoke that parts for sure see if it keeps itself going at all

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.800
Nope, it's gone out pretty much completely and for whatever reason it keeps spraying the smoke right at the glass

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.599
It makes it harder to heat up. This kind of cool. You can see the whole focus point

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.300
through the smoke though oh

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:11.700
Yeah, look at that and see that our glass focus from the solar scorcher definitely starts burning it definitely gives off smoke it

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.600
Just won't burn the rest of it in a chain reaction

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.560
I

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.340
Have here some of our zinc and sulfur rocket fuel which we showed you how to make in a previous video and launch pan rockets

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.249
With I'm gonna see if I can like this with the solar scorcher in the vacuum chamber

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
I

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.709
Like the smoke powdery, it it reacts

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.790
But it doesn't have the ability to have the super fast reaction than we would expect oh

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.079
Oh, that's zinc oxide or sulfide

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.030
It reacted we can't see any of it because its covered in smoke

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:54.720
But it reacted definitely took a lot more heat check this out Green Smoke on the side of the container

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.479
And we have really no idea what happened we have a slow-mo camera

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.080
We can look at that, but I think it's just gonna get obscured in slo-mo

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.420
That looks pretty gnarly

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.990
Check that out

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.790
He zinc sulfide

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.419
Formed in a vacuum. That's a much larger

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.380
Structure than we were getting we just lift this off by itself

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:29.429
I talked about how the smoke from the fuse was fairly opaque, look at this like you can't you can't see through that at all

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.430
There's a solid

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.090
block of powder

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.250
There is one more thing

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:41.160
I want to try and that's igniting thermite in a vacuum, now thermite should provide its own oxygen

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.819
And so it shouldn't matter if there is any in there already. Let's find out

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.290
Tiny little spark

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.540
That's interesting

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.220
Oh! kind of got a reaction going a

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.540
Few little beads formed and fell into the bottom of the cup. I thought I was gonna start more of it, but oh

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.089
We got a chain reaction a little one a short little

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.290
fairly boring for thermite reaction hey it did light

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:23.020
That's the progress we wanted there you have it simulated outer space really stops a lot of stuff from burning

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:28.239
It was tough to get our marshmallows to cook evenly we could get them to burn and we got some really cool smoke patterns flying

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.030
Off of it

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.010
Matches didn't really want to burn very well

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.189
Fuse burned very slowly and put off a lot of smoke our colored smoke powder would make colored smoke

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.729
But only as long as the focal point from the fernell ends was really pointed right at it

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.729
Eventually we did get our rocket fuel to light that was kind of cool

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.640
It made some green smoke, which stained the side of our vacuum chamber

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.469
But it wasn't nearly as energetic or fast of a reaction as we normally get and then we tried lighting thermite

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.870
Which we got some reaction out of we got some cool sparks

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.950
We did eventually get it to react and form a little puddle of iron at the bottom of our miniature pot

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.629
But it wasn't nearly as exciting as if you just light it in a normal pressurized oxygen-rich environment

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:07.179
If you ever find yourself floating around in outer space definitely don't try and cook anything and tell you're back in a pressurized environment

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.990
Probably be the least of your worries

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.400
Thanks for joining us for this experiment today, and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.410
It's a monster marshmallow and

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.549
It's dying hmm. I think it's cooked

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.030
Yeah, you can see it from the top that works pretty well

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.200
Hey guys, it's grant here, I just want to pop in and say hello

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.330
You guys are wonderful Nate, and I are incredibly grateful for the way. You keep supporting us, so that's pretty much

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.969
It just want to give you a quick. Thank you. I'll see in the next video
