1
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.550
Yeah.
Don't make a strain with nothing for trinity.
Queens broke man,

2
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.940
tinge it Kelly.
Mel told the drill in the beauty chemo.

3
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.800
Those were the days I remember we used to be closed and I was not cold.

4
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.160
This went,
I remember slipping in December,

5
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.120
two feet of snow kit as the east coast at black ice civilize the rat bite that

6
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.740
was slick is fully understood.

7
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.690
I had to come from the Hood Doing The pee wee Herman the smurf before the phones

8
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.550
truck.
The black truck slower,
didn't happy all works.

9
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.600
Thought he was the former belly levels.

10
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.780
That was whatever hip hop forever kept my Brady Yo one 98 of BLS had a pre

11
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:59.610
pubescent liberty gift when Niggas never hit me spit.

12
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.840
My little brother tried to warn him I was a tornado coming from inside like the

13
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.750
office storm and Toma pops about it.

14
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.120
He gave us tickets to that whilst down flick.
Double trouble with charter,

15
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.660
which was the proudest,
I've never had a summer job.
Sweeping leads,

16
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.860
socks to my knees.
Homing shorts cutoff.

17
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.960
Lee's I work a day in my bike's wiping away your brace.
The off the paper,
man.

18
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.010
I'm just trying to say ranch big radio takes slowing down mode where the lights

19
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:26.730
go bad or be dead.
I've got a freeze them today.
Ice Cold in the freezer.

20
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.690
Leda of staring at the speaker so I can have eight olds deeper clean in my

21
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.840
sneakers with the bristles up with two crusts,
so more on the tissue string.

22
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.683
Soper,
Lord,
I

23
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.660
ain't got nothing to do with Bowles school.
New School don't.

24
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:44.160
South West Coast,
east coast.

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.600
This will allow us to south things in our San is cave.

26
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:53.030
Is that NAS?
Yeah.
Nas versus Justice Mashup.

27
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.540
This is our thing.
Nope.

28
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.150
<v 1>Who's got some of my favorite lyrics?
Nice.
Yeah,
that backward saw shit.</v>

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.130
I like the backwards songs.
The cleverest,
you know,
he's like a guy.

30
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.800
It'll you know.
You've been some lyrics that just make you go,
whoa.

31
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.680
Didn't expect that.
Totally.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the podcast.

32
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.400
We started off in a very strange five today.

33
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.520
Is that me chewing gum or is that you chewing gum?

34
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.460
No one was chewing gum by the way last week.
We apologize.

35
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.620
It was Eliza slash jurors dog and her sweet little dog.

36
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.270
We wanted to chill the dog out,

37
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:37.271
so he gave the dog this little raw hide toy and a homeboy was going to work

38
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.670
while the podcast,
what's going on?
And it sounded like someone snapping gum.

39
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.650
That's not what it was.
Yeah,
we're sorry about that shit was just a dark.

40
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.200
If it's a dog,
isn't it?
A little bit less annoying and it's totally annoying.

41
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.880
Well,
no,
it's less than less than knowing about it's yeah,

42
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.770
because if it's a person like,
oh,
assholes,
just chewing his fucking gum.

43
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:55.580
That's so rude.

44
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.930
So it wasn't like people were being rude to you were just being to a dog.

45
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.580
Just imagine the sounds of a fleshlight and it's so much better just being used.

46
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.910
That's worse than a dog.
No,
this is worse than a dog.
Brian.

47
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.780
Fuck is wrong with you.
Not for the ladies.

48
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.620
The ladies would like to think that more than adults showing probably.

49
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.180
All I'm trying to say is no one was chewing gum.
I'll try to say,

50
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.730
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Brendan Walsh,
please welcome Brendan Walsh to the podcast.

51
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.073
Hi everybody.

52
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.610
Fresh at a Texas bitches fresh out at fucking Austin.

53
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.640
Austin,
Texas is such a strange place,
man.

54
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.650
Just one like super hippie spot in the middle of this really conservative kind

55
00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:43.300
of fucking,
you know,
drag black guys behind trucks.
Yeah.

56
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.100
Lot of that shit going on outside of that,
you know,
I mean,

57
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.880
I love Dallas and I love Houston and I loved the cities in Texas,

58
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.100
but like there's a big difference between Austin and ally

59
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.010
<v 2>and everywhere else.
Like in even he,
I'd say Houston,</v>

60
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.820
but like any,
like Houston has a cool part of their town.

61
00:04:01.821 --> 00:04:04.820
There's like a little part of the city that's,
that's kind of okay,

62
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.130
but any other place,
like just imagine for a second living in Dallas,

63
00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:10.964
like,
yeah.

64
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.180
Or any other place in Texas at Austin is just so different for,

65
00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:19.630
not just for the state.
I mean,
for the country.
It's like,
it's a unique,

66
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.530
<v 1>cool place to live.
It's a weird vibe,
right?
It's really always fascinated me.
Um,</v>

67
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.480
w w w when,

68
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:29.350
when towns like get a vibe like San Francisco in the 60s I would've loved to

69
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:33.350
have seen what that was like.
Oh,
I think about that a lot.
Oh,
do you?
Yeah.

70
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.780
Like documentaries on it.

71
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.170
That must have been so strange before acid was illegal and yeah,

72
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.630
<v 2>I watched the,
um,
the end of hair last night,
uh,
you know,</v>

73
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:49.631
the movie hair and just the last scene I was hanging out with my friend Henry

74
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.170
Phillips.
Do you know Henry?
Yes.
Um,
and yeah,
I dunno.

75
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:57.680
He showed musician guy.
Yeah.
Music.
He's not played with Doug.
Yeah.

76
00:04:57.681 --> 00:04:59.880
He played on Dosey.
Um,

77
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.110
<v 1>something to take the edge off.
So one of my favorite one.
Yeah,
it's a great one.</v>

78
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.590
It isn't.
He did it very rhythmically together.
They work great,
you know?

79
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.190
<v 2>Yeah.
It's funny when Doug,
and this is obviously,
you know,
second hand,
but,
uh,</v>

80
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.580
I've heard it from both of them.
When they first started hanging out,

81
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:19.990
like Doug Knew Henry was a guitar comic and didn't see as act for years because

82
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:23.140
he was afraid.
He was like,
well,
if I see her act,
it's guitar comedy,

83
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:27.210
it's going to suck.
I want to be friends with you anymore.
And,
uh,

84
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.140
but then when he say Henry's hilarious.
I mean,

85
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:31.870
I dunno if you're familiar with his stuff,
but uh,

86
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.660
<v 1>I'm not too familiar with it,
but that is a funny thing man.</v>

87
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.000
It's really hard to be friendly with someone who's not funny.

88
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.620
<v 2>Yeah.
And they were,
yeah,
they were crawling around a lot.
So Doug was like,</v>

89
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:45.420
I don't even want to see it.
That's funny.
Yeah.
But Henry's great.
He actually,

90
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:46.560
while we were talking in the car,

91
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:50.730
he has a movie called punching a clown that he made.
It's hilarious.

92
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.570
And it's uh,
it's how you can get it on Netflix or whatever.

93
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.190
Do they have a Netflix streaming?
I don't think on streaming

94
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.000
<v 1>dam,
but uh,
but it's definitely,
you know,
word by copying.
Yeah.</v>

95
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.990
By the way,
before we get started,
I don't have anything invested in the movie.

96
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:10.640
I have to thank our sponsor.
The fleshlight is,
it is an actual sponsor.

97
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.500
Yeah,
I've heard that too.
Don't put the rubber Dick on him.

98
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.350
He always creeping people out with the rubber Dick.
They made a rubber duck,

99
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:20.720
but no one's,
fuck this.
You don't have to worry about it.
But check it out.

100
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.410
If you've ever felt one of these things before,
uh,
no,
fill it.

101
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.830
That's like some serious tech that's supposed to be a butthole,

102
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.170
some serious technology man.
Yeah.
That's pretty weird.
I mean this is Dave.

103
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:36.050
Dave figured out masturbation.
They got that shit nailed.
Yeah,

104
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.920
that's pretty fucking sporty.
It's great if they just keep making these,

105
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:42.410
I think the evolution of the masturbatory devices over,

106
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.770
I mean this is good and enough.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.

107
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.080
Maybe some sort of a self self cleaning jammy might be pretty good.

108
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.940
Iphone charging dock.
Hey,
I phone on Verizon today.
Yes.
Did you hear about that?

109
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.570
Good.
Five phones coming out on Verizon.
Oh,
I heard something last night.

110
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.220
The only thing that sucks is it's not international.
So like if you go somewhere,

111
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:03.590
like if you go to England,
tried to use it.
It's not gonna work.

112
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.650
And indeed an invoice.
Yeah,
you can't use,
but you know.

113
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:09.260
And how often does that come up is I come up for you a yeah.
Hey,

114
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:11.420
I'm on the phone.
Hey,
you want to go get something to eat tonight?
Yeah.
Hold on.

115
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:14.030
Let me look online and find out a good ref.
Oh,

116
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.620
and you do it right while you're talking,
huh?

117
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.610
And you do it right while you're talking.
You do on a t and T.
Oh,

118
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:20.450
I do it all the time.

119
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.410
Or you're like talking to somebody listened to Pandora or something.
Well,

120
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.280
on one hand,
can you just hang up the phone on the other hand,

121
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.950
that is kind of cool to be able to do that.
Yeah.

122
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.490
Do you use a headset or something?
Well,
a car Bluetooth you.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.

123
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.870
You're driving while you're doing this.
No,
like,
like at a suck.

124
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.350
Complicated.
The texting you fuck,

125
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.820
you're out there risking lives like stop lights installed.
Only it's top ones.

126
00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:47.660
Yeah.
You got to discipline yourself son.

127
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.840
Dude in the traffic out here is a little bit different than most places.

128
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:53.570
Most of the time you're sitting here going two miles an hour,

129
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.590
you know it's still,
it's dangerous texting.
You can go two miles an hour.

130
00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:00.900
Dangerous Fred Lights.
You didn't see it in time spying.

131
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.990
You like you don't do it at all?
No,

132
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.380
I don't allow myself to because I'm worried about hitting somebody,
man.

133
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:08.050
I'm worried about being irresponsible.

134
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.130
Definitely when you're on the highway going 55 miles an hour,

135
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:12.950
I'm not just doing it.
I just won't look at it.
You know?

136
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.150
I'll take phone calls and I can make phone calls with my,
my car makes,
you know,

137
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.730
does Bluetooth so you can actually tell it to depress,

138
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:23.740
press a button and say call Brian and just talk through your stereo.
Yeah,

139
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.650
that'll do.
But I'm not fucking texting.
That's crazy.

140
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.110
I've seen people do it.
I've,

141
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.060
I've had people do it while they were driving and I was a pastor and I asked him

142
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:35.090
to stop.
I'm like,
man,
you can't do that.
That's,
that's too crazy.

143
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.860
Like that's like you're,
you're,
you're like riding a motorcycle on one leg.
Right?

144
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:43.130
You might get away with it,
but this shit might end to ugly man.

145
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.420
Put the fucking phone down.

146
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:47.690
You're typing with two hands and controlling the steering wheel with your

147
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.600
pinkies.
It's a 2000 pound piece of machinery at your time.

148
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.220
As more like for new designs,
like a race car.

149
00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:57.470
That's like a stripped down car with licensing.

150
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.600
I don't know how much cars with 4,000 now do all that to miles per hour.

151
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.560
You could probably do it right way and that's what you need.

152
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.340
Allow the traffic in La.
I hear you man.
I just,
when I'm in my car,
so something,

153
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:15.000
there's a guy named Tony Vee from Boston and he taught me this and he was,

154
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.790
he was a comic comic from Boston,
excuse me.

155
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.610
And he was traveling from Boston to New York a lot.
He was driving like,

156
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.220
who's going like all the time,
like a couple of times a week,
you know,
it's like,

157
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:28.380
what's he doing?
Half hours?
Oh,
the Aaron back.

158
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.290
And he was going back and forth and back and forth and I,
and I said,

159
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:32.450
doesn't that drive you crazy?

160
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.550
Like how do you not go nuts when you're fucking drive?
And he goes,
well,

161
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:38.460
you know what?
The way I look at it,
I get in the car,
I just goes,
then I say,

162
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:40.620
this is what I'm doing now.
I'm driving my car.
It's like,

163
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:43.000
I'm not going to freak out about it because I'm just going to keep doing it and

164
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.680
do it all the time.
Just it's all in how you approach it.
And I went,
wow,

165
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.380
that's such a fucking smart way of looking at it.
And I,

166
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:53.340
it like forced me to rewire the way I look at certain things.

167
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.360
You know,
like bull shit,
that's boring.
Travel,
air travel,
you know,

168
00:09:57.361 --> 00:09:59.880
you can really bum yourself out and going,
fuck,

169
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:02.730
I'm getting a fucking point and you just know what's ahead of you and just get

170
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:04.790
zen.
Just [inaudible]

171
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.360
<v 2>kind of attitude with the driving.
I drove a lot when I first started,
you know,</v>

172
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.280
doing the road and um,

173
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.650
I had driven from Austin to la or San Diego a bunch of times and that's like a

174
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:20.280
20 hour drive and I would just do it,
you know,
drive,

175
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.750
do it straight through most of the time.
Um,
but it's just like,
you know,

176
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:28.620
it's like,
all right,
well I'm going to be in the car for a couple days.
Yeah.
And,

177
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:32.190
uh,
I just want to get there.
I mean,
I'm a fucking,
I'm an animal behind the wheel.

178
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.280
<v 1>Do you worry about the whole fucking speeding aside?
I don't,</v>

179
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.430
I don't speed like crazy.
No,

180
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:42.870
I'll do like just right around 10 miles over the limit.
Just done their crazy.

181
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:44.790
There's like a little gambling thing you do.
There is,

182
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:47.460
you see people with past you and you're doing that and it's like,

183
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:49.080
well that guy's doing a fucking hundreds.

184
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.640
So like nobody's going to pull me over here.

185
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.810
Certain people on the highway just go,
this guy should not be driving man.

186
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:57.450
How many times you've been in the hind when you see some dude just weaving in

187
00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:01.560
and out of traffic with that need for speed bag bag.
You know,

188
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:04.690
inside that guy's car is pride.
Sounds like Wu,

189
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.920
like he's probably one of those like guy that prints out his card that like,

190
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:12.730
you know,
like need for speed drifting.
He probably drifts around zip a lot.

191
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.510
Sometimes it's just douche bags,
man.
Well it's people.

192
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:18.700
Everybody's the most important fucking thing in the world.
Like,

193
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.640
like when you see cars fucking parked in parking lots and they're not like when

194
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:27.570
people totally crossover to spaces like real assholes.
But like

195
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.360
<v 2>if they're like kind of not between the lines,
right.</v>

196
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.900
It's like what are you in such a hurry for?

197
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.910
Like I always straighten my car out and fucking make sure you're not going to

198
00:11:36.911 --> 00:11:37.744
fucking

199
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.660
<v 1>the point.
Is this like the most boring conversation line though?</v>

200
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.720
There's this fine line between being a courteous driver in getting stuck behind

201
00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:49.660
a monkey.
Yeah.
You know,
sometimes you just see some dude,

202
00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:52.970
you're like all these fucking dummy,
you don't even know what you're doing dummy.

203
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.050
You're fucking panicking.
You're locking up the street.
Okay.

204
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.400
Do I go around this guy?
Fuck Ya.
Just go.
Yeah.
No.

205
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.590
Sometimes you have to make that move to cause otherwise it just be back there

206
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:05.590
going really it's just took 10 minutes longer cause you're retarded.

207
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.740
I gotta be behind you.
You fuck.

208
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.230
That's why there needs to be something that feature where you can just shoot

209
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.620
that guy like a text message using his license plate number or something like,

210
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:17.890
like fuck you.
I hate you.
Speed.
Here's my ball.
Ideally,
Brian,

211
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:21.220
the utopia would be that they would no longer exist and we would use robots,

212
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:24.130
right.
Targeted to blame.
Those people wouldn't exist anymore.

213
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:26.020
We would have a fully enlightened society.

214
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:29.740
We would be able to really go into the ghettos and revive the school systems

215
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:32.410
there cause we wouldn't be afraid of having poor people around all the time.

216
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.800
Kill them off now.
We would be fine,
man.
We'd be utopia.

217
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.720
We wouldn't be afraid anymore.
That's the idea,
Brian.
I know.

218
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.270
Not supposed to shoot them text messages.
That's shit's not going to help.

219
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:46.480
Their stupid.
Well we've got to do is stop making stupid people.

220
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.130
We've got to help those people not be stupid.

221
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:51.460
Therefore their children won't be stupid and there'll be no more stupid people.

222
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.510
That shit is all possible.
Yeah.
Are we just think,
well,

223
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.600
I mean it's already possible,
but metal dude though.

224
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.590
The genetic dude where you go like this guy,
no matter what,
this is that guy,

225
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.610
he's fucked.
He's just working on three cells of a nine cell battery.
He's just,

226
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.610
he just doesn't,
it's not all there.
He's not that.

227
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.050
There's not much going on up there.

228
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.240
There's a lot of people that are just like that.
Like you have to,

229
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.270
some guys have big Dick sometimes.
Some guys do not.

230
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.320
Some guys have super powerful brains,
I'm guys do not.

231
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.750
Some guys have brains that suck.
You know?

232
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.750
That's an unfortunate part of life and it's not even that you're,

233
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.680
you'll have down syndrome where you have a disease.
You're just Donald.

234
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.870
Some Jack has,
there's a spectrum.

235
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.460
Unfortunately there's a biological spectrum of people and it includes brains,

236
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.990
you know?
Yeah.
I mean you need kind of like,

237
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.660
we need some people to deliver pizzas and filled potholes there.

238
00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:49.030
Almost two right now.
Right now you do.

239
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:52.630
Until we figure out how to make robots that can do everything,

240
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.950
then you don't need people anymore.
Now need people doing any nonsense things.

241
00:13:56.951 --> 00:14:00.280
You just need robot repair people.
That's all you need.
Right?

242
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.460
I can't wait for that repair guys.

243
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.700
That'll be every like when you're watching Maury Povich the see those

244
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:09.460
commercials for like a robot repair call.

245
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.000
I had this joke that I used to do about the two things you'll never see the same

246
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:17.650
time is marijuana being legal and jet packs because society would crumble

247
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.180
because there would be no work if he had jet packs and you'd have to,

248
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.880
you know like you have to break things down.
It's very important.

249
00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:28.300
You don't have too much fun.
You want to keep society rolling.

250
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.040
Brian will tell you that.
Right?
Brian's right.
Brian's just 100% fun.

251
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.050
I am fun.
So this iPhone,

252
00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:38.920
the problem is you're not going to be able to do calls and get online at the

253
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:42.580
same time.
She won't be able to do that.
To me that's a pretty big deal for me.

254
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.380
I'm a very data,

255
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.410
very multitasking iPhone user and at least I want that option where Tiffany,

256
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.740
I have Verizon and I have a palm pre plus and it's great.
But yeah,
I mean I've,

257
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:57.110
I've noticed,
you know,
doing,
trying to do things on that.

258
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.210
You know when I'm on the phone and the iPhone on the t eight t and t was the

259
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:06.200
ship,
the iPhone would be the greatest thing ever.
But 18 cheese just sucks.

260
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:10.250
It's so hard.
Yeah.
It's going to be so much nicer.
I don't have an iPhone,

261
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:15.110
but I don't know anybody who can get reception anywhere,
like where they live.

262
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:17.870
Like my old,
this is what happens man.
When we have a UFC,

263
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:21.950
there's like 18,000 people in the arena.
Yeah.
Before anyone's there.

264
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.850
I can use my iPhone,
I can get online and go on my Twitter can check things out,

265
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.180
but when as soon as the arena fills up,
it's dead.
It's useless.

266
00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:32.600
You can't get along.
I tried to Twitter what from my phone like,

267
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.420
like when things happen in between rounds,
I can't do it now.

268
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:37.670
Imagine half of that arena if not more,

269
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:42.320
leaving that arena to go to the Verizons arena and then your,

270
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.980
your cell phone would work better,
right?
Yeah.
That's what the biggest problem is,

271
00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:49.140
is overcrowding on towers and the hands.

272
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.830
Do you think that that's going to happen the same way with Verizon is at the

273
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:54.830
same sort of a system because how much I think it's good.

274
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:58.700
I think it's going to dilute the cell phones coverage out completely.
You know?

275
00:15:58.701 --> 00:15:59.330
It's going,

276
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.030
it's not going to be everyone on 18 t just so they can have an iPhone.

277
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:04.460
It's going to be kind of more,
you know,
diluted.
Right.

278
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:08.060
But what I'm saying is do you think that Verizon is going to get over burdened?

279
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.060
Can they have first capacity at first?
I bet yes.

280
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:13.480
There's going to be a lot of problems.
So we just,

281
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.180
I bet you'll watch Verizon's network deteriorate at least for in the first

282
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:18.590
couple of months during,
uh,

283
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.330
during south by southwest a couple years ago,
nobody's,

284
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.860
I worked in the whole town,

285
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.920
Boston cause 150,000 hipsters all with iPhones come to town where there's all

286
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.210
right and you just couldn't get ahold of anybody and that so ridiculous.

287
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.720
You guys were forced at south by southwest to go like caveman.
So I have Timo,

288
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.730
you're fine.
Yeah,
I have a,
I have a blackberry,

289
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.770
but I couldn't get ahold of anyone.

290
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.710
I used to have a 18 t blackberry and I thought,
you know,

291
00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:50.300
this is just the way waste coverages.

292
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.750
And then I got a Verizon one and driving around La,

293
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:56.670
like all the spots that he used to drop off.
It doesn't drop off though.
Yeah.

294
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.970
That to me is fucking gigantic.

295
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.270
That's the most important thing I gotta be able to talk to,

296
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.970
going to be able to talk to and I can't talk to you.
And if the phone cuts out,

297
00:17:04.971 --> 00:17:08.480
that's number one to me.
Yeah,
I phones are way better than blackberries,

298
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.750
but for me it's most important things.

299
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:14.330
I got to be able to definitely know that I can get ahold of you,

300
00:17:14.331 --> 00:17:18.020
that I can get a get a signal that's annoying as fuck to me when there's a lot

301
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:21.130
of dead zones when you can't keep an important conversation when you're driving

302
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.360
somewhere,
but you still have to have an important conversation.

303
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.760
I can have those conversations in my car with Verizon,

304
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.550
but all those problems are 90 a lot of it is from overcrowding,

305
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.790
the cell phone towers.
Is that true?

306
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:36.130
Because what I heard is that GSM has a harder time switching towers.
Well,

307
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.850
it would be true if that if you drove the same place every single day and it

308
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:44.150
happened at the exact same place while you're on the phone every single time it

309
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:46.640
does to me,
it happens to me.
There's there,
to me,

310
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:49.710
there's one place that I know of where you just go down this little loop and you

311
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:50.220
lose service

312
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.390
<v 3>for a second and that's the only place I can let I remember every single time.</v>

313
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:55.224
But other than that,

314
00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.510
it's so random from from me driving to legends drive it to the Jujitsu Gym.

315
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.770
Right.
There's a few places where it just always cuts out every single time.
Yeah.

316
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.030
But with Verizon it doesn't

317
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.910
<v 4>boring as fuck in conversations is pretty cool.</v>

318
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:14.040
It's like a couple of guys hanging out on their break fucking loading dock,

319
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.610
techno version talk.

320
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:22.611
What's amazing is how many people who are all like on Verizon or an on ATNT want

321
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:25.920
you to be on it too.
You know those assholes like,
come on man.

322
00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:29.160
Get with sprint bro.
Look at this.
I got this phone man.

323
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.920
It's good.
It's good for minutes though.

324
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.220
<v 3>If you know like you have minute to minute calls</v>

325
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.100
<v 4>rollover Mindy and it's true and stuff like that.
That's true.</v>

326
00:18:37.101 --> 00:18:39.260
You could look at it.
I mean that's a smart way of looking at it,
right?

327
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.200
Some people want to be on the same team as you.

328
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.630
<v 3>Yeah.
When you have at and t,
if you don't use like 50 minutes the next month,</v>

329
00:18:44.631 --> 00:18:47.900
do you keep that 50 minutes and then it's onto your minute collection and you

330
00:18:47.901 --> 00:18:51.980
can collect them.
You know I just have unlimited,
right?
Yeah.
You can do that too,

331
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.620
which is you're paying probably extra than you really need to.

332
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.300
<v 4>I guess.
If you looked,
let me throw my hat into the ring here.</v>

333
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.900
T-Mobile,
it's like a stripper strugglers all have that.

334
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:10.210
You really don't.
I prefer number all.
Fuck yeah,
that's a stir.
But that's like,

335
00:19:10.211 --> 00:19:12.850
Hey,
I only works everywhere.
Got Cricket.
Wait,

336
00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:15.680
so like now I got cricket.

337
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.230
Wha what is,

338
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.970
what is t mobile like fucking skank phone.
It is a weird one.

339
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.500
It's a weird one.
Yeah.
Horizon is,
you're a a,
you know,
no nonsense person.

340
00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.240
That's like an okay to lose the signal.

341
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.950
That's coke and Pepsi and you're drinking RC.
Got It.

342
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.890
So you don't even have the iPhone and you got this shitty service or no,

343
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:47.440
it's good.
I don't have any t mobile's no problems.
I know where,
yeah,
like it all.

344
00:19:47.441 --> 00:19:50.870
It always works and it's like I don't pay that much.
No,
no.

345
00:19:50.871 --> 00:19:53.480
I actually would go with t mobile before there was spring.

346
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.390
Probably my touch.
It's like basically the iPhone.
Yeah.

347
00:19:59.770 --> 00:19:59.981
Yeah.

348
00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:04.981
Keep telling yourself that probably got a bunch of Apis to radio shack version

349
00:20:05.081 --> 00:20:09.070
of Atari or something that'd have been close.
See iPhone five years ago.

350
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:13.260
Check this out.
Look.
Well,
this is an older model.
That fucking phone is.
That's,

351
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.020
that's the,
that really is like some crazy leap of technology.

352
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.020
I never thought it was at first,
but then I realized as time went on,

353
00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:22.930
when you start dealing with the applications,
then you realize like,
Whoa,

354
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:26.830
this is like the most insane little device ever.
Yeah.
This is not just a phone.

355
00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:31.210
I can hold this fucking thing up to a speaker and it'll tell me what the song
is.

356
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:35.200
And also like,
I just put,
I know like way ghetto,

357
00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:39.910
I just discovered the,
well angry birds,
you know,
that fucking video game?
No,
no.

358
00:20:39.911 --> 00:20:44.500
But like I was,
yeah,
I've,
I'm,
whatever.
I just,
I never fuck with that shit.

359
00:20:44.501 --> 00:20:47.830
And somebody showed it to me recently,
I was like,
oh,
this is fun.
But

360
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.250
<v 2>the fact that like,
you pull the bird back with your screen,
like,</v>

361
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:56.170
just the fact that it's like this thing knows like how far and how hard to pull

362
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:57.370
this like rubber band.

363
00:20:57.371 --> 00:21:01.540
Like how do they know where that is on the screen and it's alien technology,

364
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.180
right?
Yeah,
yeah.

365
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.310
<v 1>It's like,
you know,
at a certain point in time,</v>

366
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:09.730
people look at things and they just go,
how did this ever get thought up?

367
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.850
You know,
and really does seem like it's alien ship.

368
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:17.640
<v 2>It's gotta be something.
Because how did we make the leap from,
like,</v>

369
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.020
when I was a kid,

370
00:21:19.021 --> 00:21:24.021
there were fucking rotary phones and then now there's this,

371
00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:26.910
I'm 37 and like,

372
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.470
I was using rotary phones and like,
you know,

373
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.600
uh,
we,
we didn't have a microwave.

374
00:21:33.601 --> 00:21:38.250
It's like if you wanted to make a potato when I was like eight years old,

375
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.850
you'd have to block out like 40 minutes and make a fucking potato.
Right.

376
00:21:41.851 --> 00:21:46.110
I have to fucking fake that shit.
Yeah,
and when like microwaves were just like,

377
00:21:46.111 --> 00:21:48.600
oh,
here's this new thing and I don't know

378
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.220
<v 1>for that.
I remember that.
Of course,
you know when I was,
I'm,</v>

379
00:21:52.221 --> 00:21:54.710
I'm 43 when I was a kid,
there was no little self.

380
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.840
There was no answering machines.

381
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:58.830
Rather even you couldn't even get ahold of somebody if you just,

382
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.230
you got a call when it was like an emergency or you're trying to call it radio

383
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:05.110
station you're trying to do to rotate rotary dial and you're like,
hey,

384
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.850
you're like trying to force it to go faster.
How crazy is caller id?

385
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:12.010
The first time I saw caller id I was like,
whoa.

386
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:15.520
They can tell you who's calling like a little digital readout.

387
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:17.620
It's like a separate standalone device.

388
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.030
It would read the number as it was calling in.
Would it say it out loud?

389
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.930
Call from three to three one,
one six and you're like,
whoa.

390
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:27.670
We are in the fucking future.

391
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.670
<v 2>I had when I was in Austin when everybody was getting the the caller id boxes,</v>

392
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.150
I guess,
I don't know if I had to change the number into my name or something.

393
00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:37.080
Either way I got,

394
00:22:37.081 --> 00:22:40.500
I found out you could get listed as whatever you want in the white pages.

395
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.930
So I told him my name was Guy Chinese.

396
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.340
So every time when I called on my friends it just,
it's a Chinese guy,

397
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.680
some Chinese guy called cause it does last name first.
Right.

398
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.180
And uh,
yeah that's just,
that's something I was reminded of recently

399
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.430
<v 1>when you look at the phone,
when,
when an iPhone,</v>

400
00:22:59.431 --> 00:23:01.770
like when you get a phone call and it's coming in and you see that full

401
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:05.520
resolution photo of the person.
Oh yeah,
let me see their name over it.
It's like,

402
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.690
I don't think we realize how fucking crazy that idea really is.

403
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.430
The idea that you're able to send photos and images to each other for stream

404
00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:15.130
video,

405
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.490
<v 2>but touchscreen is like,
yeah,
that was my mom.
Like I don't,</v>

406
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.270
how does that iPad for,
how does that Shit fucking work?

407
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:24.380
And how did that just happen?
All of a sudden an

408
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.270
<v 1>exponential,
you know,
advances in technologies.</v>

409
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.560
Like one guy figures out one thing that applies to something else and they all

410
00:23:30.561 --> 00:23:33.500
get in together and then they come up with a better one and then it builds from

411
00:23:33.501 --> 00:23:33.861
there.

412
00:23:33.861 --> 00:23:37.430
And there's so many fucking people working on this shit all over the world.

413
00:23:37.431 --> 00:23:41.620
I mean,
and w you know,
technology begets better technology.

414
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:44.990
It just keeps going and going and going and going.
And it's at a fever pitch for,

415
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.040
I got an apple

416
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.170
<v 3>TV and I don't know if you've seen this,</v>

417
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:51.100
this little blue little box that you hook up to your TV and it's already okay,

418
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.140
I fucking love it.
And like,
and I have an Xbox,

419
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:58.250
I have a ps three of all that shit.
But this thing is so perfect.

420
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.200
And what's cool about it with your iPhone,

421
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:03.470
like if you're sitting there and you want to search for a movie on Netflix or

422
00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:04.760
iTunes or something like that,

423
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.540
you just connect it with the remote application and just sit there and use your

424
00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:12.920
iPhone as like the best remote ever.
It's perfect.
So you can use it,
uh,

425
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.070
you can connect to like this slide shows what's cool.
If you have a flicker,

426
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.710
your iPhone connects as a wireless remote.
Right.

427
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.220
And if you have any videos or photos or anything on your phone,

428
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:26.210
you just press play and it will transfer it to your TV and your sound system.

429
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.990
So like I was watching like videos I've filmed and just transferred it to my,

430
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.170
and you're watching it on TV?
Yeah,
from my oven or,

431
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.260
or I wanted to use my iTunes on here,
so I transferred it to holy Shit,

432
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:41.640
like wireless and share other computers.
My old roommate had the,
yeah.
And uh,

433
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.160
I could,
yeah,

434
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:46.700
there's a setting in and I could play all my iTunes and shit through the TV,

435
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.570
through the TV.
And what's also cool is that a,
if you have a flicker account,

436
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:54.200
it connects to your photos and you can do like the last 200 photos.

437
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.720
So I have like,
if you've ever been in my flicker,

438
00:24:56.721 --> 00:25:00.830
just random photos and it makes like these cool collages as like a screensaver

439
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.970
while you're listening to music.

440
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:06.470
So it's just like this tripped out slideshow from all your last 200 flickers and

441
00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:10.790
it's,
it's crazy.
Like there's pictures of you and then there's pictures of like,

442
00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:14.570
you know like Jody as balls and just mixed into like this collage.

443
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.900
It's bad ass and you can do it to anybody.
So I could do it two years.

444
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.870
Like I can type in a,
yeah,
at Joe's flicker account.

445
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:25.520
So then it does a slideshow of all your photos.
Like are your last 200 bad ass.

446
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.570
What the fuck is going on?
Love it.
I don't know.
I'm still upset.

447
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:33.270
You guys told me I have a Dorky,
a cell phone charger.
Not,
no.

448
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:37.360
I mean it is a park.
That fellow,
you're going to be fun.
It is a fair fee.

449
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.260
You actually do have a track ball on it.
I know.

450
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.340
Gotta realize balls are so 2000 so I'm really,

451
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:47.720
I'm so not a technology guy.
Like I don't,
I don't know.

452
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:51.650
I don't feel the need.
Like when new shit comes out,
I know you're like,
yeah,

453
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.790
I didn't know it and I just,
I don't know.
I can like,
this is crazy.

454
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.240
That's like fuck,
I don't even like do you drink scholastically?

455
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.780
You're rendering Scott,
you're much more logical.

456
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.840
I mean realistically just stay,
you don't pay attention as much.

457
00:26:05.841 --> 00:26:10.280
Stay a bit behind the curve and just to fucking,
it's plenty.
Yeah.

458
00:26:10.281 --> 00:26:13.490
And then people who are like,
who get all the new shit,
they'll be like,
oh wait,

459
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:17.450
you don't have an iPod?
I'll give you one here,
take this.
You know?

460
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:20.270
And you're like,
oh cool.
And then I have like a first edition Ipod,

461
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:23.750
but it's the coolest thing I ever own.
That's awesome.

462
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.200
You're completely true.
Because I give all my shit away to like,

463
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:31.070
like my friends like Duncan Duncan has got like a whole entertainment system was

464
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:35.450
just like old printers and oh wow.
LCD screens.
And Duncan's got my old iPhone.

465
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.830
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh that's right.
He was talking about that the other night.
They,

466
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.920
him and Natasha just moved in up the street from me.
So hanging out Ford your,

467
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:44.250
that's

468
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.310
<v 4>right.
We're already working it out free.
Go get your freak on.</v>

469
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.360
Me and Dunkin are gonna Double Team Natasha get mayor.

470
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:53.610
Qt involved in isn't a beautiful,

471
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:56.910
that you work with comedians and you can say things like that.
No one gets upset.

472
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.990
So we'll see.
We'll see.
But this is,
if this was a,
you know,

473
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.920
a group of plumbers at some sort of talk about double teaming,
someone's wife,

474
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.350
not really,
not really that funny,
but comedians where,
you know,

475
00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.640
he just accept it for the front of most part.
Well,
first of all,

476
00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:17.430
you know when to say it and how to say it.
Right.
You know,

477
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.950
but there's a lot of people that aren't comics that was,
say it,

478
00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:23.550
and you'd be pissed probably in the drama back.
And I just that to your,

479
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:27.570
what about your wife?
And you're be like,
what?
Well,
you gotta talk about banking,

480
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:31.670
someone's wife,
you've got to really know him.
Good.
Yeah.

481
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.020
He can't just fucking,
you know,

482
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.610
crack jokes about that to some guy who don't know,
you know,
it's gotta be after,

483
00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:38.971
you know,

484
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:42.600
I've been around you and the wife for 10 years and you haven't tried to fuck her

485
00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:46.390
yet.
Right.
You could be some crazy person.
Yeah.
Yeah.

486
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.120
Cracking jokes and making everybody uncomfortable.
Yeah.

487
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.340
I always think it's weird when you find out like somebody that you think you
are,

488
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:54.480
that you do know fairly well,

489
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:57.630
and then you touch on something weird where it's just an innocuous joke about

490
00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:01.710
like,
oh,
I heard your mom has big tits or whatever,
and you're like,
hey,
fucking,

491
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.100
no,
no,
I'm not down with that mom shit.
You're like,
Whoa,
wait what?

492
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.140
You're rational about every other thing.

493
00:28:07.141 --> 00:28:12.060
But then there's like this weird line that can be crossed.
Yeah.

494
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.420
Well there's people that are looking for you to cross a line all the time too.

495
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.720
Oh yeah.
Fucking outta line,
bro.

496
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:23.390
There's those Adeline guys that are looking to say that it's unacceptable.
Yeah.

497
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.890
Did you see that documentary about bank ski or Banksy Banksy exit through the

498
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:31.650
gift Shag exited a gift shop?
No,
I didn't.

499
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.860
I saw the preview and it didn't compel me.
It's a pretty interesting,

500
00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.370
it's good though.
It's good.
It's fun.

501
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.480
It's one of those things that you're going to look at at least la a little bit

502
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:40.500
different now.
Like,

503
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.520
like there's so many things that you just don't even notice like that Andre the

504
00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:46.860
giant,
a symbol that's everywhere.

505
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.960
It shows the guy that makes that and what he does and how he's been doing and

506
00:28:50.961 --> 00:28:52.530
he's been doing it through,
you know,
everywhere.

507
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.790
And it just shows also like all these street work.

508
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.040
When the guy does that comes out and says that,
can't they arrest him?
Um,

509
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.360
I mean because they consider that like when you put those images all over the

510
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:05.630
place like that,
they consider that they probably could.

511
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.770
I probably could handle ism say,
but maybe unless they catch you red handed,

512
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:13.440
like you could go around all day and say,
yeah,
I put that up there.

513
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.450
But really if there's no roof,
I mean,

514
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:18.020
how are they going to prove that you did it?
What your second session,

515
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.270
if you're an artist,
here's your work.
Where's,

516
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.330
here's this first original sketches.
Yeah,
I did.
Um,

517
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.510
I put myself on a billboard in silver lake.

518
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.170
I was driving home from the airport and I saw there was a top chef,

519
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.730
the new season for top chef,

520
00:29:32.731 --> 00:29:37.731
like last season was in Washington DC and they had all the contestants standing

521
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.950
in like the reflecting pool at the Washington monument on this billboard.

522
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.710
<v 2>And when I was driving past that,
I just thought like,</v>

523
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.770
it'd be funny as shit if there was just some other,

524
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.000
if you just added another cast member,

525
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:54.810
some weird dude and I had just seen that exit through the gift shop and you
know,

526
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.790
they get these big things printed up real big.
It can't goes.
I was like,

527
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.970
oh I can get it printed up.
And I called and was like,

528
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.830
they do adhesive vinyl at Kinko's.
He make it as big as you want.
So I put on,

529
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.690
I put on like a fedora and a chef's shirt like everyone else was wearing.

530
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:12.790
It had a big pot and was like stirring it.

531
00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.240
I had my friend take a picture and I had to print it up real big at Kinko's.

532
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:17.890
And then,
um,

533
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.000
and then I rented a ladder from Home Depot and climbed up on the roof of the

534
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:25.420
seven 11 and fucking stuck myself.

535
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.040
If I could email it to you.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
I have some fun.

536
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.990
But the thing is I,
my guy is like half the size.

537
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:39.610
I'm way smaller than them.
I,
well one of them I miss,
uh,

538
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.710
I caught,
well,
I uh,
I missed judge.

539
00:30:44.711 --> 00:30:48.790
I did misjudged the size of the billboard slyly but I did want myself to be

540
00:30:48.791 --> 00:30:50.410
smaller because I was going to put myself,

541
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.100
like I was in the background of the reflecting pool.
I can be a pot,

542
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.710
but when I got up there I couldn't reach up high enough.

543
00:30:56.711 --> 00:31:01.210
So it's just like the cast of people.
Did you worry about falling?

544
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.850
No,
it was on the roof of a seven 11.

545
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:08.830
So I just had to get up onto the roof and then use another like an eight foot

546
00:31:08.831 --> 00:31:13.810
ladder to get up to the board.
Dude,
that's so cool.
That's hilarious.

547
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.950
Yeah.
I can pull it up on,
no,
you get in trouble for this though.
We should,

548
00:31:17.951 --> 00:31:21.670
we not told it's done.
It's over.
Like they took the billboard down.
Right.

549
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:25.210
But it was somebody else's ad.
Well you know what I want to,

550
00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:30.220
I was at a party and there was an executive producer for the show who heard

551
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:34.720
about it and thought it was hilarious.
Well,
so they,
they gave the green light.

552
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.370
I have to get it out of my email.
No,
well they just,
I mean it was already there.

553
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.580
Yeah.
I mean it's not like you're ruining it.
[inaudible] it's so creative,

554
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.760
you know,
it was pretty fun.
That's a genius.
And um,
yeah,
I guess I can't,

555
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.070
I won't sell out the people who helped me,
but,
uh,

556
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.950
me and the guy too was like my lookout.

557
00:31:53.951 --> 00:31:55.990
Like I had a guy on the corner just to see,

558
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:59.290
cause it was at a busy intersection and just,
he was,

559
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.860
I had my headphones on with my cell phone.
He was just over there,
just like,

560
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:04.420
all right,
there's no cops,
no car.

561
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:09.100
Like he was just there to tell me if cops were coming.
Um,
but we both,

562
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:11.620
like after we did it,
we both agreed.

563
00:32:11.621 --> 00:32:14.440
Like I haven't felt that kind of like excitement.

564
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.780
It was like it was a feeling that I haven't really felt since like 15 or 16 but

565
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:23.500
just real mischief like oh my kid cotton.
Right.
I don't know.

566
00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:27.670
There was a certain like cause we weren't like drunk or high or like there was a

567
00:32:27.671 --> 00:32:30.880
certain kind of innocence and like fucking Oh man,

568
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:33.070
I haven't felt like that in a while.
Like that was like,

569
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.530
cause like if you get caught too,
like what's going to happen?

570
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.630
The Co like especially you're sober,

571
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:41.110
you're not high and the cop's like what are you doing right?

572
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.010
You're like well I just,
yeah I know.
I just put my picture on there.
That's,

573
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.250
I don't know.
You know,
I'm a fucking idiot.
I guess.
What are you,
what that right.

574
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:49.960
Let's get this over with like,

575
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.660
cause if you're not wasted or anything right then what do they get you with to

576
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:56.170
get you with private vandalism?
Like wait,

577
00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.050
you're pretty sure I talked to my friends in that it's pretty serious.

578
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:02.220
If it crossed a lot of money to fix well board,

579
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.530
it's not like people that have sprays like sprayed the side of buildings and it

580
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:09.870
costs a lot to repair and she has like,
it can be really expensive yet.

581
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.680
Well I think there's a,

582
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.420
<v 3>the big difference between graffiti I guess and like what like bank scaler and</v>

583
00:33:15.421 --> 00:33:17.070
then all these like street artists,
guys,

584
00:33:17.071 --> 00:33:20.850
these guys are actually making like pieces of art that are okay better with the

585
00:33:20.851 --> 00:33:23.380
graffiti guys.
Do some patchwork.
But you know,

586
00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.540
these guys do some stuff that where people want that graffiti so bad,

587
00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:31.500
they'll buy the wall of that building and for millions of dollars,
you know,

588
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.180
I mean that's how big these guys,

589
00:33:33.181 --> 00:33:36.220
his art and the cool thing about this movie is that it shows how they

590
00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.490
<v 2>do that.
How they sell you the wall of a building.
Uh,</v>

591
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:43.780
they would loosen adopting a highway thing.

592
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.230
So we're going to take this fucking building and they'll take the wall off or a

593
00:33:47.231 --> 00:33:51.110
piece that,
of that part of the building.
Wow.
Yeah.
This is a,

594
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.280
I've never even heard of that.
Yeah.
What this,
watch his documentary.

595
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.960
That's a billboard that I never got to a or that's the thing I was going to put

596
00:33:58.961 --> 00:34:03.880
on the billboard within 10 foot by four foot wieners sticker.
Uh,

597
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.800
there were these ads for,

598
00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.040
I don't know what it was like urgent care or something and the whole billboard

599
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:15.041
is just the blue billboard with white writing and that like font that said my

600
00:34:15.401 --> 00:34:17.940
blank hurts my blank liners.

601
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.460
So we're going to put,
we're going to fill it in with,
yes.

602
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.520
They're just said billboards in time.
Winner hurts.

603
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
It was in November and like I was on the road and I got back and saw either way

604
00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:35.140
I saw the billboard was like,
let's do that.
It was like that time,

605
00:34:35.141 --> 00:34:36.280
it was like mid November.

606
00:34:36.281 --> 00:34:40.240
It rained for like two weeks almost every night it rained so we couldn't do it

607
00:34:40.241 --> 00:34:42.490
cause it's a big stick or we couldn't do it when it was raining.

608
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:47.410
We didn't want to do it on a Friday or Saturday because it was a busy kind of,

609
00:34:47.411 --> 00:34:51.490
there was a bar right there.
Right.
Either way,
the night when we were finally,

610
00:34:51.491 --> 00:34:54.760
it wasn't raining.
We were going to do it.
They took the billboard down.

611
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:58.660
We missed it by literally a few hours.

612
00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:01.290
Can't you just find like a switch and eager billboard?

613
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.570
There's no more than a million or something.
Well yeah,

614
00:35:04.571 --> 00:35:07.630
I mean we have the sticker.
You could put wieners somewhere else.

615
00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.740
Well I can also just spray paint over it and make it into something I like.

616
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:16.060
I've been keeping my eyes out and easy to access billboards.

617
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.140
Yeah,
you should put it on like,
like you know,
like I don't know.

618
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.990
Or Wiener abortion clinic,
a billboard or something.

619
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.650
We'll see.
Wavy.
You've seen a board.
I could planned parenthood.
We're like,

620
00:35:28.651 --> 00:35:32.080
oh my gosh,
look at
abortion clinics.

621
00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.380
Or how about make the planned parenthood one wear to like the woman's looking

622
00:35:35.381 --> 00:35:38.240
down at her belly.
You know something about,
yes.
Don't

623
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:42.930
<v 3>be Scott Wiener on her stomach or something.
Yeah,
I don't know.
Well I just,</v>

624
00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:46.050
I've been thinking of like,
Oh I need to find a use for the winner sticker.

625
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:48.660
But it's like I can just paint over it like you can still.

626
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:53.550
So now I'm looking to see,
cause it's 10 feet by four feet.
That's a lot of vinyl.

627
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.940
That's fun.
Next time you do that,
let me videotape it.
Okay.
That'd be hilarious.

628
00:35:56.941 --> 00:36:00.750
Guys are both going to jail.
I'll do it.
Anyway.
This documentary,
it's,

629
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.910
here's the important part about it.
It's about this,
uh,

630
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.500
what's made an exit through the gift shop.
Yeah.
It's this camera guy.

631
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:12.180
He fucking is this crazy French guy that just tapes everything and he has boxes

632
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:15.900
and boxes and boxes and boxes of tapes,
you know,
of mini DV tapes.

633
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.800
And then one day he was like,
Borden is,
he was like,

634
00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:22.740
I might do like when the become an artist like this,

635
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.810
he ended up doing this show and you know,

636
00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:28.650
selling art for thousands and thousands of dollars and just pretty much proved

637
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:33.140
that like is art,
what is art?
This guy hired two people,

638
00:36:33.141 --> 00:36:36.840
other people to do all his artwork and what things and sculptures and stuff.

639
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.460
So it wasn't even him doing the art.

640
00:36:38.461 --> 00:36:42.210
He was hiring people to do all these pieces of art and then became an artist

641
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:44.730
from that.
And it's like,
it kind of like,

642
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.410
that's what the point of the movie was like how crazy that journey is or what,

643
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.800
what is art?
You know,
there are different,
um,
opinions on the movie too.

644
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:56.510
A lot of people think the whole thing is just some banks he hoax where it really

645
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.670
made all that are,
he's got guy,
the camera guy was fake.

646
00:36:59.671 --> 00:37:03.660
Like this is all just a big put on.
I see that.
And it could be,
I mean,

647
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.470
and then there's other theories where it's like,
oh,
well that guy was real.

648
00:37:07.471 --> 00:37:11.280
But that was all just banks.
He's are,
I don't know,
but it's all,

649
00:37:11.281 --> 00:37:14.910
it's such a great documentary.
I fucking love that.
Dot.
Good.
Yeah,
that good.

650
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.720
It's good.
Netflix streaming too.
So watch it on your iPhone on the shitter.
Do.

651
00:37:18.721 --> 00:37:21.630
There's too many things to watch.
I just saw a Winnebago man.

652
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.280
Have you seen that though?
That's that guy who was the salesman.
Yeah.

653
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.660
Illusional Shit,
mother fucker.
I want to say that.
Well,

654
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:31.020
there's a documentary about him.
Yeah,
they went and found him.
He was pretty,

655
00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:34.740
it's good.
It's,
it's a good documentary.
Yeah.
Wow.
It is.

656
00:37:34.741 --> 00:37:39.090
It was pretty interesting about this guy.
Well,
no,
I mean it's funny.

657
00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:40.950
They show all those old clips,
you know,

658
00:37:40.951 --> 00:37:44.490
of him all the outtakes of him losing his shit and uh,

659
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.260
so the guy tracks him down and he's like,
this is very kind of zen dude.

660
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.070
And he like hangs out with them for a day and he gets home and starts getting

661
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:57.240
all these weird messages from him.
Like was that was a fucking put on like,

662
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.350
like the guys kind of nutty and angry.
It's just an interesting documentary.

663
00:38:01.351 --> 00:38:04.640
It's just the guy.
Then the guy like,
yeah.
I don't know.

664
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.950
I'm confused when the bad guy.

665
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.280
So he calls them back and says that that was a put on.
He's like,

666
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.580
that wasn't really me.
I'm fucking like,
he's got problems and he's angry.

667
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:19.620
He's just like kind of,
yeah,
he's a little nutty,
but it's good.

668
00:38:19.621 --> 00:38:23.490
It's actually,
yeah,
it's weird and tuck because yeah,
it's a good documentary.

669
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:27.990
Just,
it's,
there's a lot of nutty motherfuckers out there.
How about this?

670
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:32.070
Crazy guy that went nutty and Arizona.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know much about it.

671
00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:34.950
I mean,
I know what happened,
but I don't,
I haven't been reading as

672
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.570
<v 5>they talked to his classmates,
classmates were terrified of him.</v>

673
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.710
Thought he was going to shoot people.
How old was,
he was fairly young.
22.

674
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.320
Youtube video,
23.
[inaudible] youtube videos freaked me the fuck out.

675
00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:51.280
Posted their,
there's complete disconnect in his youtube videos.

676
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:55.480
It's like he's just not making any sense whatsoever.
It's just weird,

677
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.150
strange just pile of words.

678
00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:03.160
Hotpot Korea strange.
Very strange.

679
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:07.270
Was he just like isolated from society and you have like family or friends or

680
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:11.320
family who lived with his parents?
I believe he was just really crazy.

681
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:16.230
Obviously there's some sort of a serious mental imbalance and he um,
you know,

682
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.180
just went nuts and you know,
people are blaming it on Sarah Palin.

683
00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.540
Sarah Palin had these,
um,
these,
uh,
this website,

684
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.690
which she had all these people that we were targeting.

685
00:39:25.691 --> 00:39:28.540
Like we've got to get rid of these people in your district campaign against
them.

686
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.570
And she had like targets on them.
They're like little bulls eye target.

687
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.670
They were in a gun sites.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Gun sights.

688
00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:39.610
That's the right word.
Not Targets.
That would be what you would hit.
Right?
Yeah.

689
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.270
Um,
but the,
the whole,
the whole thing behind it,
you know,

690
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.460
it's just such a fucking strange debate,
you know?
Well,
it's like,

691
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.550
yeah,
you really do have a certain responsibility.

692
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:55.760
You've got to recognize that the shit you're saying is flammable,
you know,

693
00:39:55.761 --> 00:39:57.460
and not everybody's going to be able to handle it.

694
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.910
And there's a certain amount of nuts out there that if you put certain thoughts

695
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:01.570
in their head,
yeah,

696
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.900
they might do something really fucking crazy and they haven't done it before.

697
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:07.500
You might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.
No.

698
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.000
You go putting bulls eyes on people or,
or you know,

699
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.240
gun sights on people and there's somebody out there that might just,
that's it.

700
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.630
That's all they need.
And they go,
yeah,
it's not as a,

701
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.220
your fault that they're that fucked up.
Absolutely not.

702
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.000
But you've got a certain amount of fucking responsibility when you're in the

703
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:25.730
public eye in a position like that.
Crazy bitches.
You know,

704
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.270
someone's got to talk to her so he's going to let her know.

705
00:40:28.271 --> 00:40:30.100
Like you can't encourage violence.

706
00:40:30.101 --> 00:40:34.900
You can't do that because you know that you're in a bad or all your people are

707
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:38.050
savages.
Yeah.
All right.
You know your people.
Look,

708
00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:43.060
I would guarantee they think that 41% of Americans believe that the earth is

709
00:40:43.781 --> 00:40:47.530
less than 10,000 years old.
This is a recent Gallup poll.
41% it's,

710
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:52.090
I can't like I,
I'm so shut off.
Like,
I mean,
it's so disheartening.

711
00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:52.960
It's scary,
right?

712
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.400
But think about those people that they can vote just like you and I can,
oh yeah.

713
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.890
Sarah Pailin.
If she,
if she connects,
you know,

714
00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:04.270
with those people and she rides this wave of retards,
like that's,

715
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:08.320
the numbers are very high.
It gets real spooky.
I think 10 years from now,

716
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:11.710
like there's going to be a president in office that makes George Bush like look

717
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.280
like a fucking genius and Sarah Palin like we're not that far away.

718
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:19.630
Things are being diluted so much and people were just being dumbed down and

719
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:21.430
dumbed down like I'm dumped out.

720
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.370
I used to be able to tell you a hundred phone numbers.

721
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.890
I know my mom's phone number.
I could probably,

722
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.420
I probably know five phone numbers now and that's stretching it.

723
00:41:31.421 --> 00:41:34.070
It's probably more like three.
Um,
I told

724
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:34.670
<v 2>him,</v>

725
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:38.900
but people but least like generations who were just being born with never having

726
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:40.190
to learn a phone number,

727
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:43.160
never having to retain information because they have Google and they have,

728
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:47.330
it's like,
yeah,
in 10 years,
if there is a 10 years,
uh,

729
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.870
there'll be Sarah Palin for president.
Well like,
I mean,
yeah,

730
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:54.520
there's going to be someone like her,
just some fucking Pallone

731
00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.680
<v 6>you,
it's like,</v>

732
00:41:55.681 --> 00:41:59.730
it's real obvious that we're moving in a direction where things are becoming

733
00:41:59.731 --> 00:42:03.540
more complex and things are becoming more technologically advanced.

734
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:07.710
But at the same time people are getting so fucking soft.

735
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.920
It's almost like there's two races going on.
You know,
there's a race,

736
00:42:10.921 --> 00:42:15.921
the d evolution race where we just fucking dissolve into some blob like creature

737
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:20.940
and you know,
the higher form where,
where they figure out how to,
you know,

738
00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.860
abandoned the ego and transcend the human body and download consciousness into

739
00:42:25.861 --> 00:42:28.200
computers and shit like that.
I mean that's the,
these,

740
00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.390
there's two directions that are going at the same time.

741
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:35.460
People are devolving to the fattest laziest cons in the world,
live in America.

742
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.190
And then at the,
at the same time,
you know,
and,
and you know,

743
00:42:38.191 --> 00:42:40.260
America's supposed to be one of the biggest first world countries,
right?

744
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.070
That at the top of the heap and the,
when the country's fat,
when the,

745
00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:46.110
when there's money and there's technology that the,
the,

746
00:42:46.111 --> 00:42:49.140
the evolution is a at a fucking staggering pace.

747
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:54.300
<v 2>Well,
it's why I feel like the,
uh,
you know,</v>

748
00:42:54.301 --> 00:42:55.980
the people who are evolving,

749
00:42:55.981 --> 00:42:59.340
like it's just all these people like the Sarah Pale and type people,

750
00:42:59.341 --> 00:43:03.240
the people who were behind that,
that's like,
they're just,
they're cleaning,

751
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:08.160
they're clear speed bumps in their tools.
Like there,
it's easy to,

752
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.240
I don't know,
manipulate.
Like,
it's like there's a,

753
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:17.390
some kind of a power that doesn't want like people to be like,

754
00:43:17.491 --> 00:43:20.430
it's easier to control people.
They stay stupid.
So it's like,
well,

755
00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:21.540
there's never gonna be,

756
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:25.750
<v 6>but they want it.
They want it to,
they want to be controlled.
I mean,
people get,</v>

757
00:43:25.751 --> 00:43:28.900
it's good,
comforting.
That's what it is.
It's fucking comforting.
You know,

758
00:43:28.901 --> 00:43:31.990
when you,
when you have a certain box that you'll think in and that's it.

759
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.760
There's no thinking outside that box.

760
00:43:33.761 --> 00:43:37.510
Jesus is right here and there's nothing above that,
right.
Bump down there,

761
00:43:37.511 --> 00:43:39.880
that box that says,
I have to think anymore.
You're done.

762
00:43:39.881 --> 00:43:42.490
You have much more resources at your disposal.

763
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.860
You don't have to think about shit.
So for a lot of people,

764
00:43:44.861 --> 00:43:48.250
it's like a managing the mind tool.
You know,
for a lot of people it's like,

765
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.320
for them,
it's like you,
you questioning any of their shit,
it's like,

766
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.360
you're fucking up my mind model.
Right.
You know,
and they get angry at you.

767
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.273
You're making me,

768
00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.630
Jesus are angry because like their days are just filled with sexual repression

769
00:44:01.631 --> 00:44:04.600
and guilt and fucking,
you know,
it's like so crazy.

770
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.600
<v 2>Yeah.
So that that's,
they need to channel all that towards a,</v>

771
00:44:09.601 --> 00:44:12.210
you know,
some fucking dreadlock guy

772
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.810
<v 6>just in a cat in the hat hat fucking yeah,
you got to meet that guy.</v>

773
00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.570
He's got something for you.
You might,

774
00:44:19.571 --> 00:44:23.320
you might want to make a separate trip making him in the parking lot.

775
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:24.550
I'm just cut the bigger bag.

776
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.210
I'm bummed this record store by my house is closing down and it's like,

777
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.520
I don't even think you can go to a record store anymore,

778
00:44:30.521 --> 00:44:32.210
but it you go stores like a horse's

779
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.840
<v 4>Bro.
Yeah.
Okay.
I took me to fucking horse.
Yeah.</v>

780
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:41.790
Yeah.
As now.
I like,
I like it though too.
I like going to record stores.

781
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:45.480
I like go on a video store is still like,
I don't have Netflix.
Like Oh,

782
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:49.020
I can't do video anyway.
I don't know.
I like kind of,
part of it is just like,

783
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:51.220
I'm just going to go goof off like I did in high school.

784
00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:54.540
Like go to a fucking record store,
get by and I'm just,

785
00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:58.350
I don't even know what I'm here for.
Let's see.
Let's browse like,
let's like,

786
00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:02.580
let's find some gem.
But like with Netflix,
like,
all right,
while I'm ordering,

787
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.560
you know,
a few good men and you know,

788
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:07.290
I have this queue of everything that's coming to be my entertainment for the

789
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:11.360
next and I tune same thing.
It's like,
oh well let's just walk around Amoeba,

790
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.170
look through the discount,
lps and God,
you'll just,
yeah,
it's like,

791
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:16.771
Oh wow,

792
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:21.771
this is fucking some shit I never would've thought of to buy me was a fantastic

793
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:24.790
place for that.
That's a great place.
You know,

794
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.570
I like going through a video stores too.

795
00:45:26.571 --> 00:45:29.640
I like going and looking like in the horror section,
like crazy shit.

796
00:45:29.641 --> 00:45:33.750
You got in here though.
It never heard of.
You tweeted about,
um,

797
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:38.050
that devil movie.
I think that at night Shambhala and I want to see that man.

798
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.570
I was pleasantly surprised.

799
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.680
A lot of people got angry with me on Twitter after I said that they get angry at

800
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:47.180
me.
They didn't like it.
Fucking movies suck.
Cock.
Now I want to see it.

801
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.850
We've got a violet.
I tried to read it last week,
but I was with a girl.

802
00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:54.270
Fucking girls don't like scary movies.
You're dating the wrong girls.

803
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.250
The girls that are willing to date Brian loves scary movies.
They're all,

804
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.190
well then maybe that says a lot because I think I day pretty cool girls.
Yeah.

805
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:06.060
But yeah,
maybe I've never been with a girl that's in this third.
Yeah.

806
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:10.290
They never want to see scary movies.
Any girl I've ever been involved with,

807
00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:14.190
I think,
hm.
I fucking loved caring movies.
Oh,
I love him too.

808
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.430
Fangoria I don't,
I don't like them.
You know what?

809
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:21.960
I would love every movie about an animal that eats people and they're trying to

810
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:25.210
fight it off.
You don't like that goes to the darkness.
Cleveland.

811
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.600
Keep making more versions of the ghost of the doctor.

812
00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.320
So I just want lions that eat people.
Maximum overdrive was pretty sweet.

813
00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:33.600
I remember that one was a big green Goblin.

814
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:38.100
Fucking cars came to life and tried to run over Emilio Estevez Yeah,

815
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:41.010
I love that.
And I remember this,
and I also liked to,

816
00:46:41.011 --> 00:46:45.180
DC did the based on a Stephen King Book.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
it was,
no,

817
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.560
it wasn't a book.
It was his first screenplay.
No,

818
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.270
it was the first movie he ever wrote specifically for the screen like that.

819
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.400
Maybe one of my second favorite horror movies was Christine's.

820
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.380
I just like cars and cars come in hardcore maybe shit.
I love the whole,

821
00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:03.480
the change in the dude or is this real nerdy guy and then he gets this car and

822
00:47:03.481 --> 00:47:06.960
then also in the car,
like fucking turns him into this bad ass.
Cool.

823
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:11.210
Motherfucker was super confident and yeah,
that was always a little creepy man.

824
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.920
Get a website.
It's fantastic to,
his books are great.

825
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:17.190
Like I read it a Shitload of Stephen King books in high school,

826
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:21.270
especially when he was doing coke back in those days,
the blackout days,

827
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.760
he really doesn't remember a lot of the books that he wrote.

828
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.220
Like the Tommy knockers,
one of my favorites.

829
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.310
He doesn't even remember writing that.
I don't think I read Tommy.
That's a man.

830
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.400
That dude was just,

831
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:35.430
he was just pounding here doing lines and just write in the craziest shit ever.

832
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.190
Was He in creep show?
Like he acted in class?
Yeah,
I got it.
Gets covered in the,

833
00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:43.560
and he was dead.
His acting was so funny that faces,
he made it.

834
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:48.160
It's so weird to watch that scene.
He's crazy.
It's funny man,

835
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:50.530
because I remember when I was a kid and I would tell people that I would,

836
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:54.220
I would read Stephen King,
they almost like dismiss you as like,

837
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:56.520
you're not real serious about your writing.
Right.
You know,

838
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:59.680
why aren't you reading Dosha Yefsky or something,
you know,

839
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:02.560
why don't you read it and you know some,
some,
uh,
classic novels,

840
00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:07.561
no fucking killer clown that comes out of the fucking drain and kill you the

841
00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:12.280
shit.
I love those fucking books,
man.
I'm good.
They're fun.

842
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.570
They're exciting.
But,
but you know,
yeah.
People haven't let any mock you.

843
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:20.830
They would mock you your mind.
Yeah,
but it's like chicken.
It's fucking,
he's good.

844
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:23.920
That's why he's popular.
Like bill,
I fucking,
I like Billy Joel,

845
00:48:23.921 --> 00:48:27.160
like an ironic Billy.
Joel's fucking great.
You know,

846
00:48:27.161 --> 00:48:28.690
and it's like I love old Billy Joel.

847
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:31.750
We've talked about this in the podcast a bunch of times.
Really a bunch of times.

848
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.780
I'm glad people are talking about,
yeah,
I'm a fat tire.

849
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:36.760
Cause when I was a kid I loved Billy Joel.

850
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:40.030
That stuff that he started making like uptown girl and all this.
I was like,

851
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:44.110
well yeah,
there's some clunkers there buddy.
The uptown girl.
Yeah,

852
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:47.200
that the Shin of phase like piano man.
Dot.

853
00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:49.210
It's like some of the greatest songs ever.
Yeah.

854
00:48:49.211 --> 00:48:52.030
Well the stranger is like a great album,
great album.

855
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.900
That's almost every song on there as a fucking hit and they're all good.

856
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.290
52nd streets.
Good glass houses is kind of,

857
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:03.760
that's when it started to make the turn into the more kind of poppy,
I think.

858
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.300
Pressure.
Great Song.
Great Song.
Yeah.

859
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.990
He's a bad mother fucker.
She,
yeah,

860
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.970
but then you know that all their stuff,

861
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:15.940
I couldn't hang with that uptown girl type shit and I was like,

862
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:20.190
what are you doing?
Raped one of my heroes.

863
00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:24.460
Some mad with the clues to do that wasn't bad.

864
00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.520
I liked that song.
I thought it was good.
You know,
it always,
it was kind of,

865
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:32.050
he kind of went into this like Doo wop 50s kind of thing,

866
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:37.080
but there was like a thing in the 80s to where the 50s kind of were cool again.

867
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.010
Like was that back to the future?

868
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.090
I guess maybe back to the future made it like that and still rock and roll to
me,

869
00:49:43.091 --> 00:49:47.590
man,
that's a good pop song.
I doesn't,
doesn't bother me.
The uptown girl,

870
00:49:47.591 --> 00:49:51.220
even uptown girl shouldn't even bother me.
It's the guy wasn't love.

871
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.050
You've got some supermodel Posi.
Yeah,
she just let them go crazy.

872
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:57.840
If you're paying an Elle Macpherson before that was he?
Yeah,

873
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.320
he was just on Howard stern recently.
Bad motherfucker.
He is,
yeah.

874
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:07.270
He really fucking told in some talent almost fucking his casting couch.

875
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.190
It was like an ugly John Mayer,

876
00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:16.570
John Mayer and Danny Devito that a kid you will ever watch.

877
00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.300
Do you fall Danny Devito on Twitter?
I just saw what the,

878
00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:22.860
I don't want to see his toe anymore.
Come on man.

879
00:50:22.861 --> 00:50:25.310
Look at his tone is Danny Devito.
I know what happened.

880
00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.280
They stuff is telling somebody.

881
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.151
<v 1>I will look at it.</v>

882
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:33.890
Respect just once in a while it was a fucking legend and just going to show you,

883
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.370
so you got to look at it.
I love Danny Devito.
I,
it's like kidding.

884
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.140
If you were in front of that,
um,

885
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:42.380
who was that fucking guy that got caught with a shotgun in the bank?

886
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.420
What's that fucking go live from the Larry Sanders show?
Yeah.
Rip.
Rip.
Torn.

887
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:51.050
Ripped.
Yeah.
Trip torn.
Ripped.
Torn.
Yeah.
Is that his name?
Yeah.

888
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:55.700
I feel like that's a gay guy.
That's real.
Taylor.
The guy was crazy.

889
00:50:55.701 --> 00:50:59.650
Mustache at the end of the jackass movies.
Yeah,
I saw that.

890
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.010
<v 3>Funniest Shit last night.</v>

891
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:04.220
And this is so old and I'm sure all I know you probably haven't seen,

892
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:05.360
but you've probably seen a million times.

893
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.340
Have you ever seen the old Yogi bear that the original artists of the old ren

894
00:51:10.341 --> 00:51:11.580
and Stimpy,
he's uh,

895
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:17.110
was hired by cartoon network to Redo a hour of Yogi bear.
It.

896
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.110
They just make Yogi bear fucking crazy and booboo goes,

897
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:26.030
turns into is like raging bear instead of being a nice guy becomes like a real

898
00:51:26.031 --> 00:51:26.864
bear.

899
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:31.670
John Cricket Volusia guy and he's like sick with rabies and then he grabs yogis

900
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:35.570
wife and they like start making out with like these trippy tongues is the most

901
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.840
fucked up Yogi bear ever and I was sitting at home stone last night and I'd,

902
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:42.560
if I was a normal Yogi bear just started watching.
I was like,

903
00:51:42.561 --> 00:51:46.940
what the fuck is wrong with Yogi?
It's trippy.
You Go,

904
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.180
it's amazing that that Hanna Barbera let their character,

905
00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:54.020
which is it used to be a kid's cartoon character into the hands of a written

906
00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:55.070
stipulation.
Awesome.

907
00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:58.440
<v 1>Maybe.
Maybe they lost money in the financial crisis that trinal.
Yeah,</v>

908
00:51:58.441 --> 00:51:59.480
I don't know.
It's so it's called,

909
00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.920
it's called [inaudible] has had a bar there and call them stupid theory

910
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.370
tightening there called booboo goes wild.

911
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:09.000
Is Hanna Barbera really an entity anymore?
Do they still make cartoons?

912
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:13.410
Cartoon Network,
right?
Hanna Barbera,
I mean did they just sell their cartoons?

913
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.480
When are they,
did they produce them anymore?

914
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.200
I think they combined with the cartoon network or something like that.

915
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.420
Now they are the cartoon network.
Like it's the same.

916
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:22.350
I think it's probably like Vaya con,

917
00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.530
you know how strange is it when you watch those old cartoons?

918
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:27.540
Like when you watch with the super violent ones,

919
00:52:27.541 --> 00:52:31.410
a super violent bugs bunny ones with shooting each other and Daffy duck's bill

920
00:52:31.411 --> 00:52:35.550
would get shot around backwards.
Right.
Shot in the fucking things.
But yeah.

921
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.470
You know it's like,
but now you could,

922
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:41.370
you see it's a weird thing because you can still show those cartoons,

923
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.330
but you can't make a cartoon like that now.
It can make or are they just like,

924
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.790
I mean,
are there,
they would never hear that.
I mean if you did it,

925
00:52:47.791 --> 00:52:50.610
it would be some crazy shit that you would have to have and like,
you know,

926
00:52:50.611 --> 00:52:51.350
maybe south park,

927
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:55.890
they're like Ren and Stimpy on the Simpsons where they kind of do that in within

928
00:52:55.891 --> 00:52:58.530
a cartoon.
[inaudible]

929
00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:03.400
itchy and scratchy guys like these shows are for,
for adults,

930
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.170
the Flintstones and I,
that's what I grew up with.
His Flinstones.
That was a,

931
00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.750
that was like a version of the honeymooners right there.

932
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.650
We're trying to do in cartoon,
Yogi and Booboo.

933
00:53:13.651 --> 00:53:16.790
We're kind of like a version of the honeymooners to really,
yeah,

934
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:18.660
I know Ralph Kramden.
Yeah.
Yeah.

935
00:53:18.661 --> 00:53:22.460
It was such a fun pairing that they tried to Redo it a bunch of different times.

936
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:25.520
SNAGGLEPUSS was a faggot.
Bryan,

937
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:28.080
<v 4>Texas state's lift,
even</v>

938
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:33.960
droopy dog and booboo had the same voice.
Yeah,
that's right.

939
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:37.410
He was an actor.
Brian wasn't necessarily gay.
Yeah.

940
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.720
Just cause you get off the stage to the left doesn't mean you're gay.

941
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:47.180
And then that was the of to Murgatroyd flavor slept even.

942
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:52.980
That was kind of a certain type of celebrity back then in the 60s and stuff like

943
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:57.780
you had like Liberace.
And who's The guy?
What's his fucking name?
Paul.

944
00:53:57.781 --> 00:54:00.280
When Paul Lynn.
Yeah.
I love got to do,

945
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:05.850
yeah.
It's funny.
It was an unspoken thing.
Move always.

946
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.090
People have always loved gay people and you know,
in entertainment,

947
00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:12.430
I've always been the gay guy that America loves.
You know,

948
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.840
there's always been a few of them,
but they never talked to a kid's cartoon.

949
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:19.770
It must've been so terrible for gay people back then to just not be able to be

950
00:54:19.771 --> 00:54:23.550
out about it at all because it's not like today where you could just be walking

951
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:26.190
around with your boyfriend and Elton John Cause bring his boyfriend to some

952
00:54:26.191 --> 00:54:27.810
dinner and they could hold hands.

953
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:30.900
You know Ricky Martin is on the cover of people magazine.
Him and his boyfriend,

954
00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:33.120
you know they both have their babies together and they're holding hands and
shit.

955
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:36.170
Like that's all cool.
You could not do that in the 1950s man.

956
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.970
That was not possible.
It was an unspoken thing.

957
00:54:38.971 --> 00:54:42.210
Even if you looked like the gayest mother fucker that ever walked the face of

958
00:54:42.211 --> 00:54:43.780
the earth,
like Liberace.
Yeah.

959
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.400
You would have a billion people insisting that you are straight person.
Yeah.

960
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:51.750
Why aren't you married yet?
Oh Man.
Shows and stuff.

961
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.300
They would always ask you,
I haven't met the right woman.

962
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.950
Did you see the kid's cartoon?
There's a kid's cartoon called adventure time.

963
00:54:58.951 --> 00:55:02.340
Have you ever seen that?
Which is a straight up lol LSD trip.
Everyone.

964
00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:05.500
Every episode is just take mushrooms and that's what the cartoon is.

965
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:07.140
One of my initial question was,

966
00:55:07.141 --> 00:55:10.500
why do you think it is that they were allowed to show violence like that back

967
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:13.530
then,
but now we can't because that's lacking that shit at all.

968
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.440
Cause back in the day it was cowboys and Indians,
you know,
it was always,

969
00:55:16.441 --> 00:55:19.100
you're grown up with a gun in your hand and you're the bad guy in Greer,

970
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.610
the good guy,
like a war kind of thing.
I think it was more acceptable back then,

971
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.630
war and all that.

972
00:55:24.631 --> 00:55:28.350
Because you grew up during World War One and World War Two wars going on right

973
00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:31.020
now it's closer to home money.
Those two,

974
00:55:31.021 --> 00:55:36.021
like it's funny to watch a guys face blow up and then it's all black and black,

975
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.920
you know,
fucking his hair is all.

976
00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:42.340
They came back and that's fun but is coming off the top of them.
Yeah.

977
00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:43.530
That's the funniest shit ever.

978
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:48.870
But then I guess people started suing people because their kids like hit their

979
00:55:48.871 --> 00:55:53.100
fucking one kid,
another kid with a frying pan.
I have heard of that happening.

980
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.640
I have heard of a kid that hit a kid with a frying pan because he thought that

981
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:59.520
he could do that because of cartoons.
Yeah.
It's called huges watch your kids.

982
00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:02.940
You Lazy cunt.
He's picking up a frying pan.
Don't want,

983
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:04.320
I'm swinging at the four year old.

984
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:08.040
I just wanted to see the head boner of the head.
Boehner that used to pop up.

985
00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:12.330
It was like a longer that came out of your mind God doing,
when were the birds?

986
00:56:12.331 --> 00:56:16.430
Birds would fly around that big fucking love.
Whoever.
Tree branches and girl

987
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:22.800
smoking trees.
Those fucking shows were great man.
Yeah,

988
00:56:22.801 --> 00:56:24.040
I think it's just funny when you

989
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.960
<v 3>like saw a guy like the three stooges,</v>

990
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:28.990
you know you have a solid and curlies acting up and you just saw them in the

991
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:30.640
head.
The word question though,

992
00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:32.930
<v 6>how come it's okay to watch those now?</v>

993
00:56:32.931 --> 00:56:36.260
Like you could have those now in the cartoon network with all these explosions

994
00:56:36.261 --> 00:56:37.160
and all this shit is going on,

995
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:40.490
but you could not make a new cartoon like that for kids.

996
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:43.470
<v 3>I don't know man.
Cause like,
I'm like I was saying,</v>

997
00:56:43.471 --> 00:56:46.730
I've been watching these cartoons lately.
They're fucking crazy now.
You know,

998
00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:50.180
there's literally,
it's a lot.
I mean,
GI joes a lot different than it was back

999
00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.320
in saying,
don't ask,
don't tell shit going on

1000
00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:59.000
chest hair.
Duke has chest now digs,

1001
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:03.030
Duke has chest hair and do chest hair.
Now you're,

1002
00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:07.680
you're like the Paul into this show.
He is.
He's straight as fuck too.

1003
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.900
He's fine.
You can see it online.
I saw a clip of him.
Um,

1004
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.900
he used to be on Hollywood squares all the time.
Yeah.
And the,

1005
00:57:15.901 --> 00:57:19.720
the question the guy asked me,
he goes,
so Paul a,
when a,
uh,

1006
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.190
when a man falls off of a boat,
they say man overboard.

1007
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:27.900
What do they say when a woman falls off a boat and he goes full speed ahead.

1008
00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:36.440
Full speed ahead.
So funny too.

1009
00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:40.650
I want to listen to Poland has a Halloween special that's supposed to be insane.

1010
00:57:40.651 --> 00:57:42.030
It's hard to get a copy of it,

1011
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:46.380
but it was like 1976 maybe you did this Halloween special for cvs.

1012
00:57:46.381 --> 00:57:48.510
It's supposed to be insane.
Really?

1013
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:48.950
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1014
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:52.790
That I knew from Boston who was one of those gay guys and never really would say

1015
00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:55.610
he was a gay guy on stage who talked about his girlfriend on stage,

1016
00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:59.120
but he was really gay guy.
Very fascinating character.
But he uh,

1017
00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:04.130
he said first time I ever saw with John,
I was like,
oh,
when's it going to heal?

1018
00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:09.520
I can't actually said that.
And when's it going to heal?
Yeah.

1019
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:13.150
<v 3>Don't trust anything that bleeds.
Was she on her period?
Because then that could,</v>

1020
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.350
I don't know.
Yeah,
no,
I know.

1021
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.320
<v 6>Yeah.
No.
Yeah,
fine.</v>

1022
00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.220
<v 3>It's a weird,
it's a weird hole.
Yeah.</v>

1023
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:25.820
I was out with this girl the other day that had,

1024
00:58:25.821 --> 00:58:28.700
she doesn't like wearing underwear and she has a hole in her pants,

1025
00:58:28.701 --> 00:58:31.250
right with her pussy is,
and you don't notice it until like you,

1026
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:34.190
she sits down and she doesn't cross her legs and uh,

1027
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:38.660
see some pubes are just right there and it's ridiculous.

1028
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:42.400
Her Pussy,
he's got like pollutants.
Yeah.

1029
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.990
I go running up and printing cloth and I go,
why?
Why do you have that excuse?

1030
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.770
I just like these jeans and it's kind of cool.

1031
00:58:48.771 --> 00:58:53.380
You get to Eric [inaudible] against the fucking pussy out there rubbing against

1032
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:58.240
the park bench.
Shit.

1033
00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:02.960
Plastic seat at Mcdonald's.
It's like homeless dude.
Just fart all Mrs. Rodriguez.

1034
00:59:02.961 --> 00:59:06.960
It appears you have pigeon shit inside your vagina.
Any idea how this happened?

1035
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.080
The black hole.

1036
00:59:12.081 --> 00:59:15.250
It's trying to suck dicks in there and anything else that's close.

1037
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.780
He'll take their cat litter.
That prison shit.
It's like a shop vac.
Yeah,

1038
00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:20.840
just shot back for,

1039
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.570
<v 4>that's your vagina's just sucking in pigeon shit and Piss and shit.</v>

1040
00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:31.280
ACORNS got acorns.
Pussy,

1041
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:34.370
Vaginas,
flyers.
The heard she's cute.

1042
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.960
Bird stuck up their flyers that were stuck under people's names.

1043
00:59:37.961 --> 00:59:42.620
Shields and they,
I'm on the fucking ground.
It's all stuck.
Postcard size.

1044
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:45.620
You should go to jail if you make flyers you fuckhead.
Yeah.

1045
00:59:45.621 --> 00:59:49.450
You know I was thinking about making a website cause I just got another one on

1046
00:59:49.451 --> 00:59:52.280
on my street too.
And it's some for some computer thing,

1047
00:59:52.281 --> 00:59:55.610
but I want to make a website of like don't support these companies like every

1048
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:58.880
race.
That fucking annoying to me man.
Because now I have to take,

1049
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:02.420
I don't want to litter because now it's my responsibility to put it on my car.

1050
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.980
Yeah,
you fucking shit head.
I'm not getting you.
You're not cleaning my carpet.
No.

1051
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.530
Clean my fucking carpet.
No,
I'll call everyone else before the fucking nuisance.

1052
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:16.400
Who put a thing under my windshield wiper.
Now I got to deal with,

1053
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:18.980
I got to throw your trash to get our business out there.

1054
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.380
Isn't it funny you don't ever get attacked by one?

1055
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:25.240
You get attacked by six like you know,
usually it's not just one little flyer.

1056
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:28.750
If you get one little fly,
you get them on your side windows.
Also Different Co,

1057
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.770
what's the name?
You know what?
It might be the same company.

1058
01:00:30.771 --> 01:00:33.560
I'm wondering how many people like hire a service to go spam.

1059
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:36.890
I mean there must be some sort of service that the flyers and it must be right?

1060
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:38.720
Yeah,
it's like some kind of street team.

1061
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.860
Some guys on roller blades and a fucking mail sack shoulder bag.

1062
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.440
Make a deal with a bunch of different businesses and say,
hey,

1063
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:49.730
we'll print up little cards for you.
I'll,
we'll go out on my street team.
Yeah.

1064
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:51.560
Some dude's we pay four bucks an hour.

1065
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.370
There was a street team that was like part of the,
when I had a,

1066
01:00:55.371 --> 01:00:59.370
a CD at Warner brothers,
it was my first CD and they,
there was like a,

1067
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.510
a marketing budget and part of the marketing budget was a street team or going

1068
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.370
out and putting fucking,
they're gonna vandalize,
right?
Yeah.
Put on the,

1069
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.750
put the stickers on the handout.
People,
you know,

1070
01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:12.040
hand out posters and shouldn't put them on walls and handout CD packets.

1071
01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:17.050
Like your spam little cards down at the coffee shop postcards or your picture on

1072
01:01:17.571 --> 01:01:21.920
them.
Is that,
is that the one with the,
uh,

1073
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:25.910
where the two guys are working out and start but fucking you guys,
Bryan County.

1074
01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.140
Yeah.
It's me and my friend Bryan cone.
Yeah,
I've heard that.
Um,

1075
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.990
they play that on Sirius a lot actually.
Yeah.

1076
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.680
Howard still plays that are oh yeah,
that's right.
It was Howard.
Yeah.
Thank you.

1077
01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:38.970
Our,
uh,
it is,
uh,
that was,
uh,

1078
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:42.080
the one thing that I would have happened was that we made a CD or I made a c d

1079
01:01:42.081 --> 01:01:46.010
and I wanted to make a sketch that it was so fucked up.
You can only hear,
it

1080
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.100
wouldn't be funny to see why she's guys really fucked each other.
No,

1081
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:57.470
but there's something funny about it was so ridiculous because there's always

1082
01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:01.400
guys like if you're around any people that are like real body builder type

1083
01:02:01.401 --> 01:02:02.234
people,

1084
01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:06.380
once they start complimenting each other on different portions of their body,

1085
01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:08.850
like you crossed this weird line,

1086
01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:10.450
like you might as well just start kissing each other.

1087
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.390
Rise section it couple of years.
It's weird,
man.

1088
01:02:14.391 --> 01:02:16.870
They start talking about your adults man.
The way they're coming in,

1089
01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.160
they just fucking delta.
Amazing.
Just a

1090
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.620
<v 1>align pro from the pack to the Delt.
That's,</v>

1091
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:25.470
that's beautiful symmetry right there.
You think so?
You think so?

1092
01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.590
I've never had that talk in my life.
Oh Man.
It's a weird,

1093
01:02:28.591 --> 01:02:30.690
the bodybuilder talk is weird talk man.

1094
01:02:30.691 --> 01:02:33.390
When did you sit next to a dude and all of a sudden you realize he shaves his

1095
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:37.190
legs and you go,
Oh,
snap side.
Yeah,
it's going on up here.

1096
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:41.190
Yeah.
I'm so distant from that.
I don't know.
It's a weird thing man.

1097
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.760
I'm trying to develop my calves,
man.
I'm,
I want avoid getting the implant.

1098
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.240
But yeah,
just trying to,
you know,
try to bulk them up a man.
It's hard.

1099
01:02:48.241 --> 01:02:50.910
I'm super set in of doing a lot.
We think about my calves,

1100
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.680
so there's like a dude who's on his knees.
[inaudible]
it's,
you know,

1101
01:02:55.681 --> 01:03:00.390
it's not as bad as you think,
man.
It looks small,
Bro.
I'm telling you,

1102
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.770
they're not that bad bro.
You know,
Frank Zane at very small calves

1103
01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.090
just want to suck her cock.
That's what they really want to do.

1104
01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.700
They want to just dive on in there.
Yeah.
Or they just,
yeah.

1105
01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.600
We had those guys in high school that were really concerned about their bodies

1106
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:16.381
and working out.

1107
01:03:16.381 --> 01:03:20.070
So to the months that there was this one guy that had those Popeye calves where

1108
01:03:20.071 --> 01:03:23.160
it was just like this huge bubble.
And there's like a 16 year old kid.

1109
01:03:23.161 --> 01:03:27.060
You'd just be like,
I don't even wear pants up,
man.
What's wrong with this guy?

1110
01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:29.420
Some people just have cats like that.
My Dad,

1111
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:32.880
my dad has these giant calves and he doesn't work out at all.
It doesn't do shit.

1112
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:36.630
He's fucking big.
Like they're twice as big as one.
It's just like his,

1113
01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:40.880
his natural,
crazy calves.
It's a dead kind of has big calves like that soft.

1114
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:44.550
Some people just have one weird soft.
Yeah.
My Dad a soft milky.
Like

1115
01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.350
some people just have frequent leg muscles.
Man.

1116
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.810
They're like probably got some lot of neanderthal in them,
you know?
Yeah.

1117
01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:56.400
So Paul had some freak leg muscles.
Yeah,
that's what I'd think.

1118
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:59.380
<v 7>All right.
Yeah.
All right.</v>

1119
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.190
<v 1>This podcast is also sponsored by marijuana.
[inaudible].</v>

1120
01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.780
The tangents were going off calf muscles,

1121
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.770
fucking neanderthals and shit.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
But your sketch,

1122
01:04:13.771 --> 01:04:16.950
that's how we started on that.
What did we start off with?
The your CD,

1123
01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:19.420
the thing where you Brian Count fucking banging each other.
Yeah.

1124
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.780
There's something gained about being really into your body,

1125
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.610
but the reason why it starts those,
because chicks like it.
That's what happens.

1126
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:31.380
Boys value the boys find out that it makes other men jealous when they have

1127
01:04:31.381 --> 01:04:34.050
muscles and the girls like it,
so then they get obsessed with their body,

1128
01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:37.140
but then somewhere along the line or spending too much time with other dudes,

1129
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:39.840
you know,
spotting them while they're squatting,

1130
01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:43.740
yelling in your ear and just grunting and there's just a pleasure.

1131
01:04:43.741 --> 01:04:45.910
All the pleasure chemicals are connected to this one.

1132
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:48.030
Then you find like when you're getting laid,

1133
01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:52.170
you're checking yourself out more in the mirror.
When you check your bag in,

1134
01:04:52.171 --> 01:04:56.000
you know that's got happen,
right?
Well that's like never done.

1135
01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.640
You got to check out some of you like you want to check out looking at my penis

1136
01:04:59.641 --> 01:05:04.170
going in there.
Right there.
Right there.

1137
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:05.943
<v 7>Hmm.</v>

1138
01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:09.310
<v 1>I want the lights out.
I don't want to see anything.
That's a creepy one.</v>

1139
01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:10.720
They went the lights out.
Yeah.

1140
01:05:10.721 --> 01:05:12.580
I've only had a couple of girls ever in my whole life,

1141
01:05:12.581 --> 01:05:14.590
so they want the lights totally out.
I'm like,
what?

1142
01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.770
We can't even look at each other.
Yeah.
That's of the phone.

1143
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.650
Now I've got to get an infrared camera for this room.

1144
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:25.651
That was something that was some Boston Catholic guilt shit stuck in some poor

1145
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:30.970
chicks head or the Catholic yet.
Kind of like the lights and little logo.

1146
01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.200
I don't like it.
Right.
You don't like,

1147
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:35.740
we don't like when it's bright and I like it like a,
like maybe a TV.

1148
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.870
A fluorescent lamp.
Well,

1149
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:42.400
as long as you can clearly make out body shapes and shit.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

1150
01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:48.760
Clearly.
Look at each other.
Why don't we go?
Why are we all looking at,

1151
01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:52.540
she was nothing wrong with banging in the daylight either,
Huh?
Yeah.
No,

1152
01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:55.540
I like the morning sex to the best sex.
Oh,
the Catholic guilt.

1153
01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:59.140
That's what I were you brought up Catholic?
Yeah,
me too.
For a little bit,

1154
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:01.930
but not from my all.
First grade was the last,

1155
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.670
the last of it I went to a Catholic school.
It was so horrible that,
um,

1156
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.320
my parents were getting divorced at the same time.

1157
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:11.170
They sent me to this Catholic school and I went from nothing.

1158
01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:13.360
I didn't go to kindergarten anywhere.
I just went right to first grade,

1159
01:06:13.361 --> 01:06:17.040
first grade Catholic school,
just fucking crazy nun.

1160
01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.210
She was so evil.
Her crazy,

1161
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.930
so evil and so vindictive and mean and you know,

1162
01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:25.190
and just intimidating to children.
Yeah.

1163
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:29.740
That any ideas that I had about religion just stopped dead right dead straight

1164
01:06:29.741 --> 01:06:33.130
there.
I was like,
there is no way this bitch is talking for God.
I'm like,

1165
01:06:33.131 --> 01:06:36.310
this is all craziness,
but these are all crazy people.
When you're around them,

1166
01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:38.440
you feel terrible.
You got to get the fuck away from them.
And I,

1167
01:06:38.441 --> 01:06:41.710
you can see the hypocrisy and see the anger and see the hear the shit that they

1168
01:06:41.711 --> 01:06:44.980
were talking about when they were,
you know,
when the priest was on stage talking.

1169
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:48.280
And the difference between that and the way they were acting like this is like,

1170
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:51.280
this is insanity.
Like this is a tech torture colony.

1171
01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:53.710
You're just fucking kid's heads up.
It is.
Yeah,

1172
01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.100
<v 2>it does.
It fucks you up.
I did it for eight years,</v>

1173
01:06:56.101 --> 01:06:58.980
first through eighth grade and when I was in second grade,

1174
01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:03.060
this is one of the most fucked up things.
I was in second grade and I was in the,

1175
01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:03.330
um,

1176
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:08.330
they do like that passion play that it's like this thing they do around Easter

1177
01:07:08.821 --> 01:07:12.990
where like a bunch of kids you put on a little play or whatever.
And uh,

1178
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.530
so I was like in whatever this chorus thing,
and one of my friends,

1179
01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:21.770
Jimmy was an apostle and we're at rehearsal in church and uh,

1180
01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:25.110
they're playing some music and there's some like acoustic guitar in the,
in the,

1181
01:07:25.111 --> 01:07:28.530
in the song.
So I tried to get Jimmy's attention.
I get his attention and go like,

1182
01:07:28.531 --> 01:07:32.400
Eh,
like make believe I'm seven,
you know,
and uh,

1183
01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.180
and then sister Diane,
this woman starts like stops.

1184
01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:37.650
Everything starts screaming at me.

1185
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:41.970
<v 1>This is God's house.
You don't behave like that in God's house.</v>

1186
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:44.090
Wa like,
yells at me,

1187
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:46.900
<v 2>embarrasses the shit,
makes me feel like shit.</v>

1188
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.170
I go home and she's doing it right when my mom's coming to pick me up too,

1189
01:07:50.171 --> 01:07:52.900
which is also like,
oh great.
My mom.
See me getting screened at,

1190
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:54.970
cause I got in trouble a lot,
but either way.

1191
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:59.971
So I go home next day I'm back in school and somebody comes to class or like

1192
01:08:01.121 --> 01:08:03.550
sister Diane wants to or she comes and she's like,

1193
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.830
oh sister Diane wants to see you in the hallway.

1194
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.880
And I walk out of the class seven years old.
And I even remember too,

1195
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:10.571
when I'm walking out,

1196
01:08:10.571 --> 01:08:14.260
I did look a funny dance to try to make one of my friends laugh or yeah,

1197
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:17.000
make one of my friends,
as soon as I get out in the hallway,

1198
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:21.090
she grabs me by my tie and like picked me up and she's like,
if you,

1199
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.110
you don't do that in God's house.
This is a day later.

1200
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:28.780
She's like screaming at me about what I did in church,
the knife,

1201
01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:32.930
a little air guitar.
I just,
yeah.
And I like just burst into tears.
Like,

1202
01:08:32.931 --> 01:08:35.900
I mean I'm seven,
somebody just,
I forgot about the whole fucking incident.

1203
01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:40.310
It's the next day.
And she grabs me and gets in my face and,
and yeah,

1204
01:08:40.311 --> 01:08:43.580
it makes me cry and I have to go back into my class.
I'll fucking,

1205
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:46.430
everybody could tell her crying.
That's crazy.

1206
01:08:46.431 --> 01:08:50.630
I'm glad I didn't grow for a bunch of fucking dykes who are not die.
I'm not,

1207
01:08:50.690 --> 01:08:54.080
whatever lesbians.
Third,
a lot of lesbians are nice.

1208
01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.510
They're issue is that the,
first of all,

1209
01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:58.940
they've committed to something completely and totally irrational.

1210
01:08:58.941 --> 01:09:00.590
And by the time you become a certain age,

1211
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.590
you start to realize that and you have to shut off parts of your brain in order

1212
01:09:03.591 --> 01:09:08.060
to live this crazy,
you know,
semi monastic lifestyle.
Well,
they're living a lie.

1213
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:11.030
Like they really want to look each other's pussies,
but they're like,
well,

1214
01:09:11.031 --> 01:09:14.540
we're going to go to health.
We do that.
So we need to again,

1215
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:18.770
like channel this fucking energy.
Oh,
that kid just fucking spit on the ground.

1216
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:19.191
Let's go.

1217
01:09:19.191 --> 01:09:23.630
Like beat the shit out of him with a ruler and make them say prayers and Neil on

1218
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:27.380
chalk and all kinds of weird shit they made up.
Yeah.
And,
you know,

1219
01:09:27.381 --> 01:09:29.780
and there's a lot of people that there's defendant and they say,
Hey,
you know,

1220
01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:32.690
my church was not like that and we were doing okay.
I believe you.

1221
01:09:32.691 --> 01:09:34.370
And I'm not saying that it's all like that,

1222
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.840
but God damn a lot of look across the board,
the weird,

1223
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:40.160
some people went through a good Catholic program and it was okay,

1224
01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:41.150
but they maybe even,

1225
01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:43.820
they're willing to tolerate a lot of shit that you and I wouldn't,

1226
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:46.070
there's a certain amount of rules that you just say,

1227
01:09:46.071 --> 01:09:48.380
well that's the way the rules are.
And for a lot of people they're like,
hey,

1228
01:09:48.381 --> 01:09:50.510
why fight the rules?
But for most comics,

1229
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:54.320
most people who have the mind of a comment,
you know,
it's like this real stupid,

1230
01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:55.910
what does this rule?
Why is this here?
Yeah,

1231
01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:58.040
well was six school squashes all that shit?

1232
01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.860
Well and they don't tolerate silling like,
you know,
like,

1233
01:10:00.861 --> 01:10:03.140
cause I wasn't a fucking like given teachers,

1234
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:07.970
I wasn't like one of those kids like fuck you.
Right.
I just was like,
yeah,

1235
01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:12.260
just trying to make my friends laugh and like I didn't give a fuck about what

1236
01:10:12.261 --> 01:10:13.190
they were talking about.

1237
01:10:13.191 --> 01:10:17.270
I just wanted to make my friend John laughed with this fucking picture I drew or

1238
01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:19.010
face I'm making or a penis.

1239
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.000
It produces people draw a lot of decks always guilty and joyless.

1240
01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:28.010
That sort of predicts producers or are there a lot of guys like us who fucking,

1241
01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:32.180
I mean I've been thinking about actually reading that war of art book too.

1242
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.130
Not that they really talk about it in there,

1243
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:38.570
but I'm starting to recognize like I like I think I am kind of fucked up.

1244
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:42.230
Like it seems cliche like to be fucked up from this Catholic shit that was

1245
01:10:42.231 --> 01:10:45.860
crammed down your throat when you're a kid.
But it's like yeah I think I do.

1246
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.630
I am kind of fucked up from that.

1247
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:51.770
Like there are certain kinds of like insecurities and like,

1248
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.190
cause I got in trouble for fucking goofing off all the time and now my whole

1249
01:10:55.191 --> 01:10:57.550
life is goofing off your professionally.

1250
01:10:57.551 --> 01:11:01.910
Then I feel guilty about it or like do you really?
Yeah.
Like,
I feel.

1251
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:05.630
Yeah.
How do you feel guilty?
Do you feel guilty?
Like,
Hey,

1252
01:11:05.631 --> 01:11:08.150
this isn't like a legitimate way to make a living.

1253
01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:12.080
You should be do somebody like what do you feel guilty about?
Well,
I'll,
um,

1254
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:16.680
sometimes,
well this is kind of a whole different can of worms,

1255
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:21.600
but I do think that this,
it's like it's really self absorbed,

1256
01:11:21.601 --> 01:11:26.601
self serving selfish kind of like 90% of my brain powers thinking about me and

1257
01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:28.200
what I'm doing,
you know?

1258
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.460
And so I do think it's kind of an empty existence sometimes.
It's like,
well,

1259
01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:34.950
you know,
maybe you should just be helping people,
you know,

1260
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:39.480
like actually really doing something instead of fucking worrying about,
you know,

1261
01:11:39.481 --> 01:11:44.250
taping the fucking set on a TV show,
like four minutes of jokes.

1262
01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:47.580
Um,
but also like I,
yeah,
I just like,

1263
01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:53.190
I know there's like kind of a weird kind of fear of success I think I have from

1264
01:11:53.191 --> 01:11:56.530
it too,
where it's like,
cause I'm always like saying,
well I'm not good enough.

1265
01:11:56.531 --> 01:11:59.190
Right?
Because everybody was telling me I'm a fucking idiot when I'm a kid.

1266
01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:02.460
And then the knock it the fuck off and now it's like,
oh,

1267
01:12:02.461 --> 01:12:05.340
like there's weird kind of,
it's a mixed bag.
Like,

1268
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:08.000
<v 5>yeah,
you feel like you're fighting against it all the time.</v>

1269
01:12:08.001 --> 01:12:09.140
Like you're swimming up river

1270
01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:11.970
<v 2>or I'm playing chicken with something,
you know,
where it's like,
you know,
Oh,</v>

1271
01:12:11.971 --> 01:12:15.300
here's where I want to be.
Or here,
you know,
like yeah,

1272
01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.670
playing chicken with success or whatever where it's just like,

1273
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.770
oh right when I'm getting to it,

1274
01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:23.250
I'm gonna fucking flinch because I don't have the fucking balls or the,

1275
01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.470
you know,
confidence or,
you know,

1276
01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:28.920
shit that was kind of tried to be shaken out of me when I was a kid.

1277
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.790
<v 5>Yeah.
I think that's a real valid point,
man.
I think,
you know,</v>

1278
01:12:31.791 --> 01:12:34.880
especially seeing little children growing up now,
you know,

1279
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:37.970
being around my daughters and and seeing how they evolve,

1280
01:12:37.971 --> 01:12:41.420
like as little human beings and how you're programming your input shapes out

1281
01:12:41.421 --> 01:12:43.580
their confidence shapes the way they do things.

1282
01:12:43.581 --> 01:12:48.230
Like I've seen my little daughter change from being scared to be around kids to

1283
01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:52.580
being like really social.
They're like a short period of time.
Like,
like fearless,

1284
01:12:52.581 --> 01:12:57.290
like dives into groups of kids and starts playing and it's really like us slow

1285
01:12:57.291 --> 01:13:01.700
metamorphosis of just just communicating with her and showing her,
you know,

1286
01:13:01.701 --> 01:13:04.850
how to,
how to be around people and what's fun and you know,

1287
01:13:04.851 --> 01:13:08.720
just like getting to Kinda like give them a framework of how to think about

1288
01:13:08.721 --> 01:13:12.770
things.
But the framework that you get from the Catholic school is so jacked.

1289
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:18.020
It's so your bad guilt,
you're terrible person.
You're in near legitimate person,

1290
01:13:18.021 --> 01:13:21.950
you're going to Shane,
your parents,
you're shaming God.
It's all this like Fox,

1291
01:13:21.951 --> 01:13:23.070
you suck.
It's all,
it's,

1292
01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.080
it's just this terrible fucking over overpowering suppression feeling,

1293
01:13:28.401 --> 01:13:30.080
you know?
That's crazy.
Cause my,
my,

1294
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:33.320
my whole religion growing up was completely a hundred percent different than

1295
01:13:33.321 --> 01:13:36.800
that.
Kind of says you just go Sunday and what,

1296
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.500
what kind of his teaching Christian Lutheran.
Lutheran.

1297
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:41.390
But it was more like mellow.
It was like,

1298
01:13:41.391 --> 01:13:44.330
so here's what we believe and let's just talk about it.
Cool.

1299
01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.510
You didn't go to the like a Lutheran school or no,
no.
I just went to,
I folks

1300
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:52.960
<v 2>weren't like crazy religious.
Like I had to go to church on Sundays up until,</v>

1301
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:56.350
you know,
I was 14.
Oh.
Like when they were like,

1302
01:13:56.351 --> 01:14:00.100
I'm not fucking arguing with you anymore or do whatever you want.
But uh,

1303
01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:02.830
my folks weren't like super religious.
This is all the school shit.

1304
01:14:02.831 --> 01:14:07.690
Like these nuns and priests and,
yeah.
Well it's,

1305
01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:12.040
I mean,
yeah,
the,
nobody's cracking any fucking case saying the Catholic

1306
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.010
<v 1>fucking religions fucked up.
I mean,
yeah.
Well the,
you know,</v>

1307
01:14:15.011 --> 01:14:17.350
it's just interesting that I've talked to so many different people that have

1308
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:19.870
gone through some sort of a troubling religious background.

1309
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.970
Ari Shaffir with Judaism.
Yeah.
Like a hurry was like a serious practitioner.

1310
01:14:24.971 --> 01:14:29.770
We'd read the Talmud like 12 hours a day and you know,
he was living in Israel.

1311
01:14:29.771 --> 01:14:33.520
I mean,
like you went deep with it.
[inaudible] you got to call her on the line.

1312
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:36.730
It's not going to work in here anyway.
There's no signal in here.

1313
01:14:36.731 --> 01:14:41.210
It will sound terrible.
It's Doug Stanhope is you want to try?
I'm getting,

1314
01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:45.600
oh wait,
my bars just went away.
Yeah,
there's not much signal up yet.

1315
01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.060
We could fucking stripper ass phone.

1323
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:16.010
People are going to get your phone number,

those guys who interviewed you on the Internet.
They just,</v>

1329
01:15:29.751 --> 01:15:32.870
some dude just showed up at your house and you gave him the directions to your

1330
01:15:32.871 --> 01:15:33.704
house.

1331
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:41.480
Wow.
And you didn't know nothing about this dude?

1332
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:45.380
<v 8>No.
No.
I just kept ignoring it until he said</v>

1333
01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.300
I shouldn't be there sometime in the morning.
I hope to run into you,

1334
01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:54.080
but to keep great break.

1335
01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.080
<v 1>Douglas,

1343
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:28.350
I think he makes it through sheer force of will and weed.

1344
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:32.260
<v 8>He's going to come up with 20 celebrities,</v>

1351
01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:08.490
Celebrity Rehab coming back off clean and sober to talk to the flunkies.

Did you watch the celebrity rehab?
I know you have.

1355
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:21.750
You've tweeted about doctor drew.

1356
01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:38.860
Have you been watching this year with the check that fuck tiger woods.

<v 8>She's,</v>

1359
01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:50.690
<v 4>it's not even close.
It's like people's moms and shit.</v>

1360
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.970
It's like some cigarettes mom and some dudes are rich.

And then the girl who fuck tiger woods who was just addicted to love.

1364
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:11.620
It's fucking fantastic.

1365
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:19.090
Are you in La again?
Are you,

1366
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:23.323
<v 8>Okay.</v>

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.690
<v 4>Alright brother later talk to you later

That was powerful.</v>

1370
01:18:34.691 --> 01:18:36.670
Doug Stanhope live via speaker phone.

1371
01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:39.550
It's the first time they've ever attempted this on the podcast.

1372
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:44.170
We've never done a speaker phone to a microphone.
Cell phone,

1373
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:46.870
impromptu conversation.
That was pretty good for,
yeah,

1374
01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.300
I mean we're talking about him earlier and stuck standing health.

1375
01:18:49.301 --> 01:18:51.940
How could you ever get anything better than that?
You're always getting,

1376
01:18:51.941 --> 01:18:55.930
he's always gonna nail it.
Yeah,
he's always good.
It's consistent.

1377
01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:00.670
Except one time when I called in to a Seattle station instead of him over,

1378
01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.430
he was out of the country and Oh yeah,
you were doing that for awhile.

1379
01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.320
That was only did it once or twice.
Maybe.
Yeah,
we had heard about that.

1380
01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:12.070
That you had done some interviews for pretending to be him.
Yeah,
cause he was,

1381
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:17.230
I forget.
Oh he was out.
I think him and like Andrist and Shaw craft.

1382
01:19:17.231 --> 01:19:19.750
They was like going to be out in the woods or something and there was no

1383
01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:24.100
reception.
Oh yeah.
That thing they used to do that.
There wasn't the desert party.

1384
01:19:24.101 --> 01:19:28.750
It was some other thing.
I forget what the fuck,
but either way,
Hennigan,

1385
01:19:28.751 --> 01:19:30.160
his manager called,
Oh,

1386
01:19:30.161 --> 01:19:34.120
do you want it to anyone you want to do a phone in for dog?

1387
01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.310
<v 3>Andrew's Irish,
he's Scottish.
She's Scottish.
Jimmy never met Brian.</v>

1388
01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.930
I don't mind that.
I must have,
did you ever see the video?
I put up a Doug,
uh,

1389
01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:46.410
where he couldn't make it to an interview at a car show.
So I put up,

1390
01:19:46.411 --> 01:19:51.380
hit some local comic in San Francisco and he played the role of Doug Lee.

1391
01:19:51.381 --> 01:19:53.080
He had sunglasses on and a hat.

1392
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.210
And it was so funny because the guy was just saying the most ridiculous thing.

1393
01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.580
So I'll just such a fun guy to know because he's like,

1394
01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:04.800
he's really doing everything that I,
you know,
he's supposed to be doing.
You know,

1395
01:20:04.801 --> 01:20:07.980
like guy gets a vasectomy,
you know,
he lives in

1396
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.220
<v 4>a fucking crazy yellow house in the middle of nowhere.
He goes on the road,</v>

1397
01:20:12.221 --> 01:20:14.520
he doesn't go to the comedy clubs and steady books,
things on his own.

1398
01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:16.410
Very rarely going to comedy clubs,
books,

1399
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:19.200
things on his own and rock clubs develops his own following on the Internet

1400
01:20:19.201 --> 01:20:22.860
becomes subtle.
Totally self sufficient.
Yeah.
He's really doing it,
you know,

1401
01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:26.670
he's doing it the perfect way.
I mean,
that's really Doug,
you know,

1402
01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.240
there's no expectation.
You know who he is.
He's a genuine dude.

1403
01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.580
Have you been to his place?
No.
We're going to go for the super bowl.

1404
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:40.530
He's having a party.
I going to work super bowl weekend.
It's a UFC.
That's right.

1405
01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:44.040
Yeah.
We bet on that too.
I want,
I can fly in on Sunday.
They,

1406
01:20:44.050 --> 01:20:47.750
I could fly from the UFC to you guys at my ex.
Be Fun.
That would be fun.
Yeah.

1407
01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.760
Where's,
how far away is it from an airport?

1408
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:54.720
Tucson airport I think is an hour,
hour and a half,

1409
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:57.630
two sides of crazy ass play.
So that's where that kid came from.

1410
01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:01.110
That's where the shooter,
that's a wild west baby.
There's a,

1411
01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:06.260
there's a hotel there called the hotel congress in Tucson and they have a very

1412
01:21:06.931 --> 01:21:11.790
stuck and I performed there.
They have a,
um,
it's a cool performance space,

1413
01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:16.470
but it's like this old timey hotel,
like a deal injures somebody got captured.

1414
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:18.460
There are stuff that are slipped.
I don't know.

1415
01:21:18.461 --> 01:21:22.680
There was two song of view we'd do shows.
This is at the,
at that place.

1416
01:21:22.681 --> 01:21:26.760
I have this form there twice with Doug.
Oh,
so no shows in Tucson.
That's cool.

1417
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:31.860
Wow.
Does living in Arizona,
you have like more of an Arizona following now?

1418
01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:35.120
Does he have a lot of people that way?
It's a weird little town he lives in now.

1419
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:39.330
It doesn't perform in his town.
Right.
He's done a show I think.
Really?
Yeah,

1420
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:44.250
like lawn or to suck him.
Rick Shapiro.
Well,
I mean fuck,

1421
01:21:44.251 --> 01:21:47.220
we just had them on the phone.
It gets all these stories better than me.

1422
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.630
He told me,
I think,

1423
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:52.520
I think we was saying once about how it would be kind of weird if,
you know,

1424
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.400
they all saw,
I was like,

1425
01:21:53.401 --> 01:21:56.790
abortion joke and then he has to run into at the supermarket,
you know,

1426
01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:00.870
he has these,
there's um,
some of his neighbor's neighbor,

1427
01:22:00.871 --> 01:22:05.390
Dave and Evelyn are just like two regular Evelyn works at the Safeway.

1428
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:09.300
Dave works for Frito lay.
They're just like super nice people,

1429
01:22:09.301 --> 01:22:14.190
but they're like regular.
It was regular as can be.
And uh,
and they're like,

1430
01:22:14.191 --> 01:22:17.280
yeah,
Doug's best friends.
But they,
it's like,

1431
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:20.160
I don't think they've seen too much of what he'd like.

1432
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.640
They know that he's like a comedian and I think he said he showed Dave some

1433
01:22:23.641 --> 01:22:25.860
stuff and he's like,
oh yeah,
that's,
you know,

1434
01:22:25.861 --> 01:22:30.700
but they're calling them neighbor Dave neighbor Dave.
Yeah.
If you read dozens,

1435
01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:31.543
a,

1436
01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:36.330
I think neighbor Dave was just in the hospital for something and Doug was doing

1437
01:22:36.331 --> 01:22:38.670
one of those things where he's getting people to send them weird stuff.

1438
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:41.850
Doug does not get the credit enough credit.
It just doesn't,

1439
01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.800
it doesn't for just genuine human beings respected across the bull.
Yeah,

1440
01:22:46.801 --> 01:22:50.340
no,
I agree with that.
That's not what I mean.
I mean,
he should be,

1441
01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.590
he should be stadium enormous.
Yeah.

1442
01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:56.970
He should be like one of the biggest guys ever.
I mean,
yeah,
it's,
it's,
there's,

1443
01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:59.850
there's like,
I don't know what it is.
It's like for me,

1444
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.470
if you wanted to construct,

1445
01:23:01.471 --> 01:23:04.890
if you wanted to construct the comedian that I could go to see as a lifelong

1446
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.040
standup comedian.
Yeah.

1447
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.120
<v 5>You know,
Turkestan a perfect guy.
Yeah.
No,</v>

1448
01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:12.430
I'm going to hear some crazy take on something that I either a agree with or I

1449
01:23:12.431 --> 01:23:16.020
could see his point and it's,
he takes me into a place I didn't see common.

1450
01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.410
It's hilarious and it's all well thought out and it's all constantly evolving

1451
01:23:20.411 --> 01:23:23.980
and it's all always interesting.
It's always real and it's like,

1452
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:27.130
God damn that is stand up fucking comedy like that.

1453
01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:30.370
That's the real shit right there.
Yeah.
There's not many people like him,

1454
01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:33.400
like seeing a Doug Stan hope showed that I can think of.

1455
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:36.930
There's so many countries,
a few comics man,
where I'm always like,
Whoa,

1456
01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.270
how come the whole world doesn't know about Nick Depaulo?

1457
01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:43.420
Well you ever seen Nick Depaulo kill?
I've never seen,

1458
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:47.770
I've never seen nick live outside of a like Montreal short.

1459
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.270
Let me tell you something.
When I was coming up,

1460
01:23:49.271 --> 01:23:51.460
when I was in like 1988 when I was doing open mic nights,

1461
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:56.020
Nick Depaulo was a couple of years ahead of me and he was just a fucking killer.

1462
01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:56.973
Even then,

1463
01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.990
like he always had like sick timing and great writing and uh,
I went to see him,

1464
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:05.470
uh,
Shit.
It was a couple of years ago.
He was doing one of the late night shows.

1465
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.880
What are you doing there in Brendan Walsh?

1466
01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.000
Can Lean back that I was trying to get them to stick up.
Okay.

1467
01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.900
We'll take this is panicking yet.
Anyway,

1468
01:24:14.370 --> 01:24:18.850
I hadn't seen him and fucking forever and I almost forgot how funny he was.

1469
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:20.950
He just destroyed,

1470
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:23.980
destroyed and everything's got that fucking Boston thing going on.
You know,

1471
01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:28.900
everything's got that fucking Boston accent that hadn't,
this is talking about,

1472
01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:33.570
uh,
people in,
in Katrina not getting rescued.
He goes,
uh,

1473
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.900
maybe I know where to find it.
If you could fucking spell.
He goes,

1474
01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:39.280
it doesn't say on the roof Hep,
you want some happen,

1475
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:43.960
zip your mouth and add water.
It's like,
I'm totally paraphrasing and nick,

1476
01:24:43.961 --> 01:24:46.750
have you hear that?
I apologize for butchering your joke.
I'm sure I did,

1477
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:49.480
but I was just like,
this motherfucker's so funny.

1478
01:24:49.481 --> 01:24:54.170
He's just like so that that hard Boston style.
Funny to just Pam,

1479
01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:58.800
Pam.
Yeah.
A lot of good guys came out of that.
Yeah.
I'm hoping that with the,

1480
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:00.710
the new media,
with,
you know,

1481
01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:03.970
the Internet's and podcasts and shit like that.

1482
01:25:04.090 --> 01:25:07.810
I'm hoping that there's going to be some people that would get reintroduced to a

1483
01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:11.350
whole new group of humans.
But there's a lot of people like that,
like,
you know,

1484
01:25:11.351 --> 01:25:14.620
like there's a lot of comics that for whatever reason they just,
you know,

1485
01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:15.610
people lost touch with them.

1486
01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:19.060
They disconnected with them because they didn't get on Twitter and they haven't

1487
01:25:19.061 --> 01:25:22.060
done anything on comedy central and a long time and people just sort of forget.

1488
01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.200
It's still good.

1489
01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:28.270
Still go to fall between the cracks or it's,

1490
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.040
some kids get tired of it too.
You know?

1491
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:33.040
Some dudes gives just get tired of performing good tired of writing and then

1492
01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:35.140
they fade off.
That's,
that's a possibility too.

1493
01:25:35.370 --> 01:25:37.170
<v 9>Yeah.
And a lot goes.
I mean,
you know,</v>

1494
01:25:37.171 --> 01:25:41.130
if you get a reputation as being a fucking pain in the ass or head or,

1495
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:45.240
or a crazy person,
like,
yeah,
then nobody's gonna,
you know,
they're like,
Eh,

1496
01:25:45.241 --> 01:25:49.470
it's easier to give this guy a show who doesn't drink and shows up on time.

1497
01:25:49.471 --> 01:25:51.480
Who cares if he humps a stool for a fucking hour?

1498
01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.080
I'm not talking about anybody in particular.
I'm just saying that like,

1499
01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.920
I know what you mean there.
Some really,
I mean like rouse Shawn Ross,

1500
01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.960
one of the funniest dudes on the planet.
Like,

1501
01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.260
what are you gonna do with them though?
You know,
like

1502
01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:08.810
<v 4>I,
nobody wants to babysit.
I'm on the road,
right?
Yeah.
He's,
he's trying that.</v>

1503
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:12.380
He's totally clean this shit up.
I mean,
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
that sounds like Scott,

1504
01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.980
he's just got so many health problems too.
That's the problem.

1505
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:19.100
But he would get pretty like,
you know,

1506
01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:23.390
a lot of clubs that that he would work at that I'd be afterwards you're like,
oh,

1507
01:26:23.391 --> 01:26:24.800
what did you hear about what Ross did?

1508
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.700
Who was here and he could be a handful when he's drinking.

1509
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:32.210
I guess there's always a dude,
this is always a Pablo Francisco story.

1510
01:26:32.211 --> 01:26:36.620
There's always
crazy.
I don't know him the best.

1511
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:41.060
I will say nothing.
Everybody has an insane story about him.
Like everybody,

1512
01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:44.780
anybody who's met him for two seconds,
fucking,
he's got such good energy.

1513
01:26:44.781 --> 01:26:48.200
That guy,
he's always got this friendly,
happy energy.
You know?
I like it.

1514
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:51.710
I remember at the other day when we were at the Improv where you there where he,

1515
01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:54.980
I was talking to him before a show or something and he goes outside.
He's like,

1516
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:59.230
you do a lot of videos and these are real conversation.

1517
01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.860
It was like,
I have a conversation with Pablo and you won't,

1518
01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.920
you won't even know if you're really talking to,
right.
Yeah.

1519
01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.990
It's like talking to robocop

1520
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.460
Tuesday night.
That's the way he talks.
Well,

1521
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:14.750
he'll just sometimes go into character and just start.
Oh,

1522
01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:19.210
he's just having fun and it's really funny.
There's certain

1523
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.360
<v 6>mean,
you know,
it's so funny man.
Just certain comics just have good energy.</v>

1524
01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:25.240
You can just be around them.
There's other guys that even if I funny,

1525
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.961
even if they're funny,

1526
01:27:25.961 --> 01:27:28.800
just like let me just keep the fuck away from you until you go on stage.

1527
01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:30.210
Then I'll watch it in the back and then I'll get

1528
01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:32.080
<v 4>the fuck away from you when you get off stage.</v>

1529
01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:36.620
I envy those guys with that positive like where everybody in the room's 20%

1530
01:27:36.621 --> 01:27:41.510
happier that like that dude showed up cause I can be moody and it's like,

1531
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.360
well you know what I mean?
Like it's like,
oh why aren't I always just like,

1532
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:49.030
Hey let's have fun and laugh all the time.
But sometimes I'm like,
man,

1533
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:50.260
if you could do it all over.
Yeah.

1534
01:27:50.290 --> 01:27:51.070
<v 6>Again you would.</v>

1535
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:53.770
If you were an old man on your death bed and someone said to you,
listen,

1536
01:27:53.771 --> 01:27:56.800
I can make you 20 again.
You can be living the party all over.

1537
01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:58.390
You'd be pro comedian,

1538
01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:01.330
stand standup comic out there running around telling jokes,

1539
01:28:01.331 --> 01:28:04.360
having a good fucking time,
making people laugh right now.

1540
01:28:04.361 --> 01:28:08.700
What do you think you would be ecstatic ripped for?
Or You'd be like,
fuck man,

1541
01:28:08.701 --> 01:28:12.250
I'm ready to go meet God.
Yeah,
I'm turn to the next dimension.

1542
01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:15.040
You're gonna make me live this stupid material life over again.

1543
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:17.530
They get inside of Malcovich so he could see it two ways.

1544
01:28:17.531 --> 01:28:19.210
But I think if you did want to go back,

1545
01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:20.780
I mean you would really appreciate the fuck out.

1546
01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:21.560
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1547
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.890
well I think about that all the time that there is going to be a last fucking

1548
01:28:24.891 --> 01:28:28.370
day and like,
you know,
it's like,
Whoa,

1549
01:28:28.371 --> 01:28:32.960
you're not really fucking going to nuts.
It's,
it's,
you know what,

1550
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:34.150
we're in a weird

1551
01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:36.250
<v 6>Tom because right now life,
you know,</v>

1552
01:28:36.251 --> 01:28:39.490
the expectancy is getting longer and longer because there's supplements and

1553
01:28:39.491 --> 01:28:41.860
exercise and taking care of your body and you know,

1554
01:28:41.861 --> 01:28:44.440
medical treatments and making sure that people are,
you know,

1555
01:28:44.441 --> 01:28:47.380
that you get checkups on a regular basis so they catch anything that's fucked
up.

1556
01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.580
You know?
And when,

1557
01:28:48.581 --> 01:28:51.070
when when people start to live longer and longer and longer right there and then

1558
01:28:51.071 --> 01:28:52.630
they start inventing new things.

1559
01:28:52.631 --> 01:28:55.750
When they start getting into like gene technology and getting into,
you know,

1560
01:28:55.751 --> 01:28:59.140
Myostatin inhibitors for your body and you know,
different forms of,
you know,

1561
01:28:59.141 --> 01:29:02.010
nanobots to eradicate and it's going to be

1562
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.720
<v 1>some crazy shit in our lifetimes.
They could easily extend the,
you know,</v>

1563
01:29:06.730 --> 01:29:10.290
the average lifespan to like,
you know,
maybe even like 150 years.

1564
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:13.590
The average wealthy guy or she imagined trying to talk to some 20 year old
bitch.

1565
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:18.591
When you're 150 you're 115 you still look like you're 30 like you're 150 years

1566
01:29:18.661 --> 01:29:20.190
old.
But for whatever reason,
like thank you.

1567
01:29:20.191 --> 01:29:25.191
Like keep your body like Stallone style fully prepared and then you're like 150

1568
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:26.760
and to try and talk to some chicks,

1569
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:30.480
she's like 20 I've noticed lately as 130 when you were born,

1570
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:35.070
could you imagine that conversation?
She 150 year old dude,
you know,

1571
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.840
you know the best.
Oh,
I can't,
I mean I can't even hang out with 24 years.

1572
01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.800
The worst is when friends have girlfriends and like I have some friends that are

1573
01:29:43.801 --> 01:29:46.290
like in their late thirties and they'll have a girlfriend that's in their young

1574
01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:48.030
20 [inaudible] and then all of a sudden you're,

1575
01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:50.130
you're all hanging out together and you know,

1576
01:29:50.131 --> 01:29:54.690
and like the conversation takes us left,
turns into walls and it just spins out.

1577
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:58.080
It's like,
why are you letting her hold the steering wheel?
Man,
this is,
you know,

1578
01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.090
we were having a great conversation and all of a sudden what?

1579
01:30:00.091 --> 01:30:03.900
Bang or into the rocks just cause you're fucking plow and are like I don't come

1580
01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:06.780
into the bedroom and tried to fucking hang out.
You're,
I don't know,

1581
01:30:06.781 --> 01:30:09.570
I've tried to think of a good analogy but it's like the only reason she's here

1582
01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:12.930
is because you like fucking,
you know,
bouncing around your fucking Dick Talk.

1583
01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:16.890
Well I understand,
you know,
giving it a try.
You know what,

1584
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.300
let's to hang out when you're going to be with are cool as long as they're not

1585
01:30:21.301 --> 01:30:22.134
obnoxious

1586
01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:26.210
<v 3>about dating a girl really young is like when,
when you date like a 22 year old,</v>

1587
01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.590
they haven't seen a lot of the movies that you know are guaranteed.
Awesome.

1588
01:30:30.710 --> 01:30:33.230
So if you want to have a good night,
my canvas just,
you know,
has some Hawaiian,

1589
01:30:33.231 --> 01:30:37.550
has some steaks and then we're going to watch uh,
you know,
name,
movie here,

1590
01:30:37.551 --> 01:30:39.560
you know,
like just like 80 or something,
you know,

1591
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:43.380
she would be like having a great night.
So it's so cool.
Cut Back.
Cause I,

1592
01:30:43.381 --> 01:30:44.650
I love that.
Where did she,

1593
01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:48.600
like I was robbing the cradle bitch and try to come up with reasons why they

1594
01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.420
could not.
It was a girl who didn't know who gene Hackman was recently.

1595
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:53.610
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

1596
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:57.790
<v 3>Really?
And I was like,
yeah,
I mean yeah,
she didn't know who gene Hackman was,</v>

1597
01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.060
but I guess it's understandable because it's like,
oh yeah,
you,

1598
01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:02.510
you were born in like 1990.

1599
01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:05.830
My friend that I brought last night didn't know who Dan Akroyd was last night

1600
01:31:05.831 --> 01:31:08.050
and I was trying to show her pictures a day and acronym like you've seen

1601
01:31:08.051 --> 01:31:10.600
Ghostbusters,
right?
And she's like,
no,
what's Ghostbusters?

1602
01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.290
<v 1>It's such a weird thing for guys.</v>

1603
01:31:12.291 --> 01:31:14.290
If a guy's a single guy and he's like real shit.

1604
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:17.540
If a guy who's like in his late thirties I right and you're,
you're,

1605
01:31:17.630 --> 01:31:20.900
you're looking for a check.
If you,
you can go one or two ways,

1606
01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:24.450
you can either go really young where you got to kind of almost babysit him.
Well,

1607
01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.530
you've got to kind of look,
reteach him life and you know,
hang,
I mean,

1608
01:31:27.531 --> 01:31:30.900
how many times wait for that in the break up with you in five years or yeah.

1609
01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:34.200
That,
that could be it.
Or you know,
or you can go your age,
right?

1610
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:37.700
And when you go your age,
what a fucking risk that is.
Yeah.

1611
01:31:37.730 --> 01:31:41.000
You know what's cool about the young girls to 36 year old check.

1612
01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:43.730
There's some bitterness involved in that package.

1613
01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:47.440
Most of the time someone's angry at somebody and someone left somewhere and some

1614
01:31:47.441 --> 01:31:48.500
would promise me something.

1615
01:31:48.501 --> 01:31:50.840
And there was some money that was supposed to go up there and we were going to

1616
01:31:50.841 --> 01:31:55.340
buy a house together and my car still under his name and Eh,

1617
01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:59.500
yeah.
Desperately want to get their claws in someone because they know like this,

1618
01:31:59.560 --> 01:31:59.980
you know,
I'm

1619
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:00.970
<v 9>sure he's right around the car</v>

1620
01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:04.870
<v 5>corner and they've been hurt before,
so they're,
they're defensive,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

1621
01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:06.530
I mean,
some of them pulled together and you know,

1622
01:32:06.531 --> 01:32:08.990
they'd take yoga classes and they get their shit together and they'd go to

1623
01:32:08.991 --> 01:32:12.140
crossfit and all of a sudden they're reading books and taking healthy.

1624
01:32:12.141 --> 01:32:14.340
There's this 36 year olds that are happy to be saying,

1625
01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:17.690
I'm not saying they're all tiny things.
All of them were,
I mean,
we're,
we're,

1626
01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:19.290
we're doing is,
you know,

1627
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:23.120
I'm not saying if it's you out there and you fit this profile,
don't get upset.

1628
01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:23.920
Yeah.

1629
01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:28.300
<v 9>Well I think that it is,
it's ty,
I really sympathize with women.</v>

1630
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:29.920
Like they do have a lot of fucking,

1631
01:32:29.970 --> 01:32:34.000
a lot more problems than we do and they can get,
it's unfortunate.
Well,
yeah,

1632
01:32:34.001 --> 01:32:36.970
they can get pregnant and you're stuck with some like some guy who just banged

1633
01:32:36.971 --> 01:32:38.230
you on night,
then you have it.

1634
01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:41.590
He's connected to him forever and then you need him financially guides.

1635
01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.210
I don't even want to talk about it cause it makes me sad.
It,

1636
01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.450
it's just bums me out that like,
ah,
fuck that shit.
Just,

1637
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:48.850
it's ridiculous that it's still okay

1638
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:51.950
<v 5>works that way.
It should be so clear whether or not we,</v>

1639
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:56.990
we have babies or not as good as my kid screaming ground quiet please.

1640
01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:02.150
Anyway.
Um,
it should be so clear.

1641
01:33:02.151 --> 01:33:06.410
It shouldn't be just some random loads sneaks through and,
and in pregnancy you,

1642
01:33:06.411 --> 01:33:10.700
it should be like so super duper clear.
There should be like,

1643
01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:14.000
it should be difficult.
We should make it more difficult to have babies.

1644
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.880
<v 9>It's easy to put plan B in a person's breakfast though,</v>

1645
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:22.300
but killing them Brian,
you've disrupted the cycle.
But to kill,

1646
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:25.310
even if it's two sounds,
just cook them breakfast and you know,
no life.

1647
01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:27.020
But to finish that thought though,

1648
01:33:27.021 --> 01:33:31.340
it's like I can understand girls wanting like getting desperate around like

1649
01:33:31.341 --> 01:33:35.960
majorities because it sucks at,
it sounds shitty to say,
but they're just,

1650
01:33:35.961 --> 01:33:40.430
they fall off the sexual radar and like dude's fucking,

1651
01:33:40.431 --> 01:33:43.670
she's don't,
for whatever reason,
like they just can keep,
you know,

1652
01:33:43.671 --> 01:33:47.390
they can leave their 55 year old wife for 32 year old chick and

1653
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:48.783
<v 5>as long as the man,</v>

1654
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:52.240
but then only represents a position of power where the woman feels attracted to

1655
01:33:52.241 --> 01:33:53.260
him cause he can provide,

1656
01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.410
it's almost always that 55 year old broke dudes aren't worth shit.

1657
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:59.500
But a 55 year old guy with a Ferrari,
you can get some 20 year old posts.

1658
01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:04.810
Just a decent job.
You know,
like a guy who makes 150 grand a year or something,

1659
01:34:04.811 --> 01:34:08.740
you know,
or yeah.
Yeah.
It's possible.
If he's a good guy,
you know,

1660
01:34:08.741 --> 01:34:12.160
find a solid check that's in her thirties and it's usually doesn't work the

1661
01:34:12.161 --> 01:34:15.520
other way around,
but the wife is kind of screwed,
you know,
it's harder for,

1662
01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.970
you know,
there was a video that was online that I was talking about and it's,

1663
01:34:19.170 --> 01:34:22.630
it was on Twitter and I put it up there and it's really horrendous to watch.

1664
01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:23.770
It's really hard to watch.

1665
01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.040
It's this guy getting conned by these Nigerian scammers.

1666
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:32.170
You got conned out of $300,000 he's not a rich guy.
It was his,
his pension,

1667
01:34:32.171 --> 01:34:34.000
everything you ever saved his entire life.

1668
01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:36.580
And he got conned into thinking that this porn star,

1669
01:34:36.581 --> 01:34:38.930
they put pictures of this porn star on,
you know,

1670
01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:41.590
send him all these emails and photos of her that this was her,

1671
01:34:41.591 --> 01:34:43.540
that he was communicating with her.
And then she needed money.

1672
01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:46.930
And at one point in time he was giving her $1,600 a day,

1673
01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:48.880
was going to these Nigerian scammers.

1674
01:34:48.881 --> 01:34:53.770
He flew to London 14 times on 14 separate occasions to meet her,

1675
01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:55.960
but never got in contact with her.

1676
01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:59.690
Like he would literally fly all the way to London and go,
what the,
where is she,

1677
01:34:59.691 --> 01:35:04.130
what the fuck?
What the fuck?
[inaudible]
14 times,
14 times.

1678
01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:08.180
He kept doing it,
kept doing it.
He was so convinced that this girl was real.

1679
01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.600
Like somehow or another the,
they had him so convinced and they had like the,
the,

1680
01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:14.630
the,
the email logs,
you know,

1681
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:17.720
they're the show and how they went back and forth and they just scan this

1682
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:20.030
motherfucker and they just robbed.
What point is,

1683
01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.220
I don't know what I was saying on Twitter.
I was like,

1684
01:35:22.221 --> 01:35:27.221
this is just like a limping Willdabeast getting eaten alive by Hyenas.

1685
01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.950
This is what it is.
This is some weak minded,
crazy person,
you know,

1686
01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:34.700
who's gotten old and gotten a bit soft,
you know,
a little senile.

1687
01:35:34.701 --> 01:35:37.280
I mean it happens.
Old People lose their grip on reality.

1688
01:35:37.281 --> 01:35:40.370
This guy was like deep in his sixties it looked like and then then all of a

1689
01:35:40.371 --> 01:35:45.110
sudden they just locked a hold of his brain and rekindle that spark of romance.

1690
01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.720
Just the the thought that may be,
it could be real.

1691
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:50.390
And this is 23 year old fucking super hot porn.

1692
01:35:50.391 --> 01:35:54.830
Pornstar really was in love with this old dope because he was senator $1,600 a

1693
01:35:54.831 --> 01:35:58.850
day.
I mean this guy was like,
it happens.
It happens.
You never know man.

1694
01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.590
I'd like to do that.
I don't take some take a chance.
Socks a day.
Well,

1695
01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.780
I don't know.
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta go to Thailand.

1696
01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:07.370
That's what you've got to do with this.
Why?
I understand.

1697
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:11.930
If you want to want to find it,
I'm gonna go find a girl.
Appreciates a man,

1698
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:15.200
a man of culture.
Gotta leave Barea chicks are hot there.

1699
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:16.640
And then vice guide to the barrier.

1700
01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:20.900
Get one of those hookers out of the $1 hookers.
We'll do it like a dollar.

1701
01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:25.400
Like something crazy like that.
Crazy that,
yeah,
that place is fucked up.

1702
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:26.930
Libraries.
The scariest place on earth.

1703
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:32.480
Once force fields are invented,
then I'll go there.
Yeah,

1704
01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:36.110
they need to put that thing under that Stephen King Dome Dome that covers the

1705
01:36:36.111 --> 01:36:36.570
whole city.

1706
01:36:36.570 --> 01:36:39.650
Just drop that mother fucker right down on top of that and keep everybody inside

1707
01:36:39.710 --> 01:36:42.860
the Simpsons movie.
Yes.
Let them on the beach.
Yeah,

1708
01:36:42.861 --> 01:36:46.040
you need to lock everybody in there.
That's what the fuck is going on there.

1709
01:36:46.041 --> 01:36:49.640
It's a former slave colony.
You know for people that don't know about Liberia,

1710
01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.100
this,
there's a,
there's a documentary called the V.

1711
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.420
There's a show called a website called vbs.tv and vbs.tv.

1712
01:36:56.421 --> 01:36:58.580
They produce the vice guide to travel and it was just,

1713
01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:03.200
and see if there's is insane videos when there's so many of the websites a

1714
01:37:03.201 --> 01:37:06.260
little difficult to sift through.
It's Kinda,
it's Kinda Netflix streaming,

1715
01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.520
Netflix streaming,
streaming Watson,
Liberia one.
It's fucking fantastic,
man.

1716
01:37:10.521 --> 01:37:15.521
You don't realize how insane life is over there and on a daily basis they're

1717
01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:19.880
dealing with something that's out of the most insane apocalyptic movie of all

1718
01:37:19.881 --> 01:37:23.720
time.
If you were living in the camps [inaudible] yeah.

1719
01:37:23.721 --> 01:37:26.340
If you were living the way these people were living you literally,

1720
01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:29.690
you mean you might as well be living around wild dogs.

1721
01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:33.290
You might as well be.
What'd you do to,
I don't know.

1722
01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:37.320
My microphone just went crazy.
Some of these people are there,
you know,
there,

1723
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.480
there's wildness to them.
You know,
there's some scary shit going down.

1724
01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:45.110
A lot of cannibalism,
a lot of mutilations.
You know,

1725
01:37:45.111 --> 01:37:47.180
there's a lot of war going on.

1726
01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:51.690
There's this one dude that we'd call himself general buck naked thing.
Yeah.

1727
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.350
Fuck man.
And he's going to,
that's,

1728
01:37:54.351 --> 01:37:57.060
you watch that and you know as soon as the UN leaves,

1729
01:37:57.061 --> 01:38:00.540
that guy's going to take off that preacher uniform and it's,

1730
01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.070
he's going to be a war lord again.

1731
01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:06.830
<v 3>Oh yeah.
So I mean he was drinking innocent blood from babies before war.</v>

1732
01:38:06.831 --> 01:38:07.640
He's not

1733
01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.170
<v 5>yes.
Just [inaudible] lines and kill a kid,
bring them back,</v>

1734
01:38:12.171 --> 01:38:15.350
kill them and eat parts of their heart.
Like what the fuck man.

1735
01:38:15.351 --> 01:38:19.070
Did you imagine that scene?
I can imagine if you saw that video online,

1736
01:38:19.071 --> 01:38:21.890
would you click that link?
That is the ultimate question.

1737
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:27.200
If there was a video of them killing every time I learned my lesson very early

1738
01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:29.960
on.
You have it out there though.
I don't want to see it either.
But there must be,

1739
01:38:29.961 --> 01:38:31.070
if these guys have really done it,

1740
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:35.240
it's amazing that this guy is just running around,
you know,
preaching,
you know,

1741
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:38.300
it's really kind of incredible.
Especially,
I mean,
he knows,
he's like,

1742
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:42.920
he knows how to survive.
He's a fucking,
uh,
what's the word I'm looking for?

1743
01:38:42.921 --> 01:38:47.780
Not a sociopath.
Well,
he's a sociopath,
but like,
no more than any politician.

1744
01:38:47.781 --> 01:38:51.450
Like no more than Dick Cheney or,
you know,
it's just so unfortunate,
man.

1745
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:54.950
And you gotta you gotta think this,
this whole situation is so fucked.

1746
01:38:54.951 --> 01:38:59.060
It's going to take like hundreds of years to clean up because the life is so

1747
01:38:59.061 --> 01:39:02.140
chaotic for these poor people.
And they grow up in this environment,

1748
01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.450
their program like that and their program to deal with war.
And there's,
you know,

1749
01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.610
11 and 12 year old kids with guns,
machine guns,

1750
01:39:07.630 --> 01:39:11.240
they really all like wild animals.
They're crazy.
You know,
they're living,

1751
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.700
they're not,

1752
01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:15.020
won't worried about death because everybody dies around them all the time.
Yeah.

1753
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:18.110
It's a really,
really spooky,
spooky environment.

1754
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:20.480
And I don't think people realize it's even going on.

1755
01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.900
And you know they didn't go in America.
Yeah.
I didn't know.

1756
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:28.400
I didn't know were so soft here.
Soft as puppy shit poppy shit.

1757
01:39:28.401 --> 01:39:31.310
In a hot summer day,
man,
when the real shit hits the fan.

1758
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:34.820
That's one of the reasons why I moved to Colorado for a while.

1759
01:39:34.821 --> 01:39:38.450
I was convinced I want to go apocalyptic period where I was convinced that La

1760
01:39:38.451 --> 01:39:41.320
was just going to fall apart.
It's still as well.
Yeah.

1761
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:45.590
I mean there's a musical chairs,
right?
Yeah.
The music just hasn't stopped fucking

1762
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:46.191
<v 3>sunset.</v>

1763
01:39:46.191 --> 01:39:49.490
The other day there was a bar fight that turned into a full on riot and they

1764
01:39:49.491 --> 01:39:52.820
closed down sunset.
Yeah.
You tell me about that.
You were there.
What happened?

1765
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:55.340
Was that the down the street at the comedy store but things,

1766
01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.060
there's a guy on Twitter called away whoa daily or something like that.

1767
01:39:59.061 --> 01:40:02.460
He just pretty much sits there with the police scanner and just talks about she

1768
01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:05.870
is West Hollywood.
West Hollywood.
Yeah.
Anyways,

1769
01:40:05.871 --> 01:40:09.620
we were sitting at the comedy store and suddenly like hundreds of just cop cars

1770
01:40:09.621 --> 01:40:13.460
going by super fast and just helicopters and everything.
We're like,

1771
01:40:13.461 --> 01:40:14.990
what the fuck is going on?

1772
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:18.620
So I started looking at Twitter and instant information of Twitter,

1773
01:40:18.621 --> 01:40:21.130
which is brilliant,
you know,
so,
uh,
yeah,

1774
01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.130
I started as a bar fight and then somebody started throwing things at like a

1775
01:40:25.131 --> 01:40:27.560
sheriff,
uh,
like bottles and stuff.

1776
01:40:27.561 --> 01:40:31.580
And then it became like some kind of a weird small right where they just shut

1777
01:40:31.581 --> 01:40:35.100
down all like this big group of bars and went with like,
you know,
canisters,

1778
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:39.540
tear gassed.
And it just turned into huge.
Wow.
Isn't this reception?
Um,

1779
01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:43.700
which bar it was by at?
It was by the Roxy and you know,

1780
01:40:43.701 --> 01:40:47.720
like the rainbow and all that hard rock section.
Uh,
it was all about,

1781
01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.550
it was right by there and it just like,

1782
01:40:49.551 --> 01:40:54.310
people have videos on the Internet of like what was going and just getting shot

1783
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:58.990
<v 9>at.
And my friend Katie,
uh,
he,
uh,
came back with a canister,</v>

1784
01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:02.920
one of the smoke guns that was shot in his direction or something where the

1785
01:41:02.921 --> 01:41:07.900
rainbow is.
Yeah.
They just,
it was crazy.
There's some weird videos of,
uh,

1786
01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:10.210
of people filming on their iPhones and stuff.

1787
01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:11.890
<v 6>Dude.
Why,
you know,</v>

1788
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:17.220
how come alcohol and and men alcohol and men mix so badly,

1789
01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.560
but no one ever,

1790
01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.220
I mean no one ever tries to seriously to shut alcohol down from bars,

1791
01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.100
but would a,

1792
01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:27.440
would a terrible convert combination alcohol and men trying to get pussy.

1793
01:41:27.650 --> 01:41:29.240
So like the worst combination ever.

1794
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:33.500
It's amazing that fights don't happen every single night constantly when you're

1795
01:41:33.501 --> 01:41:34.220
at a bar.

1796
01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.980
It's amazing that you can get through a lot of bars without ever fighting.

1797
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.120
<v 9>That's why you just need a bottle of Jaeger meister.
Yeah.</v>

1798
01:41:40.121 --> 01:41:44.500
I mean I avoid the man's place where if there's any kind of meat head

1799
01:41:44.501 --> 01:41:48.730
contingency that's not a bar I can go to.
Cause I got a fucking

1800
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:51.550
<v 6>tricky meat has,
can be tricky.
A lot of them don't mean any harm,</v>

1801
01:41:51.551 --> 01:41:55.030
but they're used to this fucking way of behaving and Dick slapping each other

1802
01:41:55.031 --> 01:41:57.960
and pissing on each other's legs and doing stupid shit.
You know,

1803
01:41:57.970 --> 01:41:58.810
they think it's funny.

1804
01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:03.760
<v 9>Well,
people pick me out too.
Like I have,
uh,
punchable face or something.
Like,</v>

1805
01:42:03.761 --> 01:42:07.720
I mean I've gotten,
it's just,
you know,
since we're a beard,
I haven't had any,

1806
01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.270
<v 6>nobody can get away with it.
That's all it is,
is a lot of it,
you know,</v>

1807
01:42:11.271 --> 01:42:13.000
when it comes to those situations,
it's just your,

1808
01:42:13.001 --> 01:42:16.610
you unfortunately ran into an asshole that's looking to pick on someone.

1809
01:42:16.670 --> 01:42:19.640
<v 9>Yeah,
yeah.
It is aggression and there's,
yeah,
I can I,
yeah,</v>

1810
01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.750
terrible give off whatever vibes of like this guy super nonconfrontational or

1811
01:42:23.751 --> 01:42:27.440
something like,
you know,
so I don't even want to be in a position cause like,

1812
01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:31.680
yeah,
like,
and the guys are like you like,
I mean you're in goods,

1813
01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.650
your big dude.
Like it wouldn't,
we're both grown men.
Like it wouldn't be like,

1814
01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:41.370
like I feel like if a guy like you beat the shit out of me,
it should,

1815
01:42:41.371 --> 01:42:44.510
it should be viewed as like the guy was kicking a puppy down the fucking stairs.

1816
01:42:44.511 --> 01:42:48.590
Like it's not a fair,
like a lot of full man like that.
Like,
you know what I mean?

1817
01:42:48.591 --> 01:42:52.460
I don't have fucking forearms.
Like I'm not a man,
you know?

1818
01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:56.810
I mean exercise.
What would it be like?
It'd be,
well,
I can't fight.
I like,

1819
01:42:56.811 --> 01:43:00.100
you know,
I'm not,
yeah,
I can probably do 10 pushups or something.
Wow.

1820
01:43:00.190 --> 01:43:01.023
It's born me.

1821
01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:05.720
<v 6>Any guy that chooses to look for a guy to beat up by Todd as a piece of shit and</v>

1822
01:43:05.721 --> 01:43:08.600
she's missing the whole point of doing martial arts in the first place.

1823
01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:12.950
The whole point of exercising is it'd be free of all the unnecessary instincts

1824
01:43:12.951 --> 01:43:15.000
of the body.
You know,
the pent up rage that you makes.

1825
01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:18.650
You want to yell in your car and you know,
gives people road rage and you know,

1826
01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.960
it makes people,
you know,
say insane shit on the Internet.

1827
01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:22.940
I mean all that just pent up shit.
Yeah.

1828
01:43:22.941 --> 01:43:26.360
The idea of martial arts and exercise is supposed to be that you get all that

1829
01:43:26.361 --> 01:43:28.670
stuff out so he could be a much more relaxed.

1830
01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.770
<v 9>Well the guy doesn't have to know karate beat me up.
I mean,</v>

1831
01:43:31.771 --> 01:43:35.070
any kind of dude with big douchebag,
any big asshole

1832
01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:39.030
<v 6>video you need to own up.
So it's the worst things ever,
man.
There's no need.</v>

1833
01:43:39.031 --> 01:43:42.450
We can disagree on things.
I'll go over here.
You go over there.
Thank you.
Sorry.

1834
01:43:42.451 --> 01:43:43.710
Bye.
I don't need to win this.

1835
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:48.260
<v 9>I was just,
I just don't even get worked up about shit.
Like,
I'm so easy to like,</v>

1836
01:43:48.261 --> 01:43:52.070
it's like,
all right,
you're right.
I'm wrong.
I'm a faggot.
Like what you,
I don't,

1837
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.840
<v 6>I'm not necessarily top of it.
Not being adduced to you.
Don't be induced to me.</v>

1838
01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:59.300
Let's just skate through.
I mean,
I can get mouthy though.
Like,
you know some,

1839
01:43:59.301 --> 01:44:00.650
some dudes can,
man,
it's,
I've,

1840
01:44:00.651 --> 01:44:04.190
I've been with friends that got drunk and then they say stupid shit to people

1841
01:44:04.191 --> 01:44:05.450
and like,
hey,
hey,
hey,
hey,

1842
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:09.710
you're starting something that I'm a part of now and this might be the wings of

1843
01:44:09.711 --> 01:44:13.730
the butterfly.
Fucking start the hurricane.
Yeah.
Settle the fuck down out.
Yeah.

1844
01:44:13.770 --> 01:44:16.140
<v 9>Well,
I know.
Yeah.
I don't do that very,</v>

1845
01:44:16.141 --> 01:44:18.330
but it's like you have somebody who's fucking with me.
I can,

1846
01:44:18.331 --> 01:44:20.430
I know how to push buttons too.
So

1847
01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:23.040
<v 6>yeah.
That's what causes a problem.
If they can't push buttons back,</v>

1848
01:44:23.041 --> 01:44:27.000
then they get frustrated
because they can't match wits with you.

1849
01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:29.370
They say something stupid.
Yeah.

1850
01:44:29.371 --> 01:44:32.070
You have the perfect comeback with a perfect timing.

1851
01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.640
You're professional comedians in a fair at all.
And then they just want to yell,

1852
01:44:35.641 --> 01:44:39.480
fuck you,
kick your ass.
What's funny now?
Funny Man.
Yeah,
yeah.

1853
01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:44.460
What have you become?
What have you become and what have you done?

1854
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:49.020
So we're going to have to get you into some neural linguistic programming to try

1855
01:44:49.021 --> 01:44:52.950
to refocus your brain and get rid of this Catholic school guilt bullshit,
man.

1856
01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:57.120
Yeah.
Well we got together,
if you ever looked into something like that,

1857
01:44:57.210 --> 01:44:58.320
I don't really,
John Heffrons,

1858
01:44:58.321 --> 01:45:01.000
Ron's a big fan of that in neuro linguistic programming,

1859
01:45:01.230 --> 01:45:04.260
trying to have friends and he's like into all sorts of freaky like uh,

1860
01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.650
enhance your mind type shit.
Like,
oh,
he has like anchors.

1861
01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:09.040
He comes up with these things like he'll,

1862
01:45:09.041 --> 01:45:12.360
he'll hold his hand in a certain way and when he's killing on stage,

1863
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:15.540
he'll hold his hand a certain way and like remember that moment.

1864
01:45:15.541 --> 01:45:17.790
So he then when he goes on stage again numbers,

1865
01:45:17.791 --> 01:45:20.790
he holds his hand the second way and he puts himself right back into the place

1866
01:45:20.791 --> 01:45:22.950
where he was absolutely destroying onstage.

1867
01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:26.190
Like he has like an anchor to that experience.

1868
01:45:26.191 --> 01:45:28.400
So he can put himself in the same state.
You know,

1869
01:45:28.410 --> 01:45:31.890
that you get a state when you're killing,
when you're onstage and just boom,

1870
01:45:31.891 --> 01:45:36.030
you just hit,
you know,
that feeling.
We just,
the pauses are perfect.

1871
01:45:36.031 --> 01:45:40.000
You're super relaxed and you're just in the material,
you know,
and he,

1872
01:45:40.050 --> 01:45:43.680
he tries to anchor that state in his mind and his consciousness and his memory

1873
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:48.150
and he does something with his hands.
And then,
uh,
once he,
uh,
has it,

1874
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:51.880
has it down,
then in his next show,
like right when he's about to go out,

1875
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:55.320
he'll do that same thing with his hand and literally recreate the state or,

1876
01:45:55.321 --> 01:45:56.120
you know,
that's the theory

1877
01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.580
<v 9>or,
yeah.
But I think that,
well,
yeah,
I don't know.
It sounds,
I mean,</v>

1878
01:45:59.581 --> 01:46:03.810
whatever works for whoever,
but I mean,
every situation is different though.

1879
01:46:03.811 --> 01:46:08.370
Like whatever you were doing to make that night,
the perfect night of comedy,

1880
01:46:08.371 --> 01:46:08.550
this,
this

1881
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:11.740
<v 6>is a whole different set of people total.
It's a different night.</v>

1882
01:46:11.741 --> 01:46:15.190
Different Shit happened today.
Absolutely.
There's definitely,

1883
01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.850
that's definitely true.
But,
um,

1884
01:46:17.890 --> 01:46:21.790
I also think that when I achieve what's attractive to me about it,

1885
01:46:21.791 --> 01:46:25.240
and I haven't tried it yet,
but is that,
you know,
it's like,

1886
01:46:25.241 --> 01:46:29.560
it's sometimes it's real difficult to figure out where to put your brain when

1887
01:46:29.561 --> 01:46:32.560
you're about to go onstage.
Like when you're about to go on stage.
First of all,

1888
01:46:32.561 --> 01:46:35.770
I go over my material,
I want to make sure I get this new thing I gotta do.

1889
01:46:35.771 --> 01:46:38.200
I've gotta get this out of the way.
I got to do this.
I should pry that.

1890
01:46:38.201 --> 01:46:42.490
Should I move this in here?
And which I do that.
But then it's like,
you know how,

1891
01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.590
what do I do with my happy here?

1892
01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:47.710
I'm excited to just wait until I get on stage until I figured out what the fuck

1893
01:46:47.711 --> 01:46:49.370
I am.
You know,
what do I do?
Yeah.

1894
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:53.280
At least what he's doing is trying to anchor himself to some really positive

1895
01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:57.240
state of mind and then go out and then the ball falls where it may and you know,

1896
01:46:57.241 --> 01:47:00.330
he might have to deal with hecklers or it might be a different kind of show,

1897
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:04.020
but at least his state of mind is the optimum state of mind.

1898
01:47:04.021 --> 01:47:08.220
So instead of like recreating the exact perfect state,
it's more like,
you know,

1899
01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:12.240
he just figures out the right way to be himself when he gets up there,

1900
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.830
<v 9>if that makes any sense.
Yeah,
it's so,
yeah,
it's tough.
I am,
like I said,</v>

1901
01:47:16.831 --> 01:47:21.540
I am kind of moody and it's just a bummer when I have to do a show and it's like

1902
01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:26.100
I fucking like,
this is the last thing I feel capable of doing.

1903
01:47:26.101 --> 01:47:29.550
Not that I never,
like,
I never piss and Moan about having to do a fucking show,

1904
01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:34.710
but sometimes it's like,
yeah,
I'm just not,
yeah,
I'm not that.

1905
01:47:34.711 --> 01:47:36.690
I'm not the fucking life of the party guy tonight.

1906
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:41.660
<v 6>Go on stage and you get a few laughs.
Doesn't it start it,
start a kickback in</v>

1907
01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.830
<v 9>sometimes.
I mean it's,
it's always fun and it's,
you know,</v>

1908
01:47:45.831 --> 01:47:50.330
but no,
sometimes the whole time onstage I'm just kinda like,
yeah,
I'm just not,

1909
01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.340
this is,
you know,
I mean,
we're humans.
Like,
it's like,
yeah,

1910
01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:58.070
it's just not that much fun tonight.
And I'm not feeling like,
you know,

1911
01:47:58.730 --> 01:48:01.700
or is it the crowd or is it given,
it's a combination.

1912
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:06.230
Like I can be in one of those like depressed,
just fucking,

1913
01:48:06.231 --> 01:48:10.640
I don't want to do this Sunday night show and I get on stage and there's like

1914
01:48:10.641 --> 01:48:15.260
that,
you know,
the crowds like,
no,
we're good.
We're here to fucking,
this is,

1915
01:48:15.261 --> 01:48:17.690
we're not just going to be a bunch of fucking shit.
We're here,

1916
01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:21.700
we all want it to be here.
This isn't an office party or whatever.
And,

1917
01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:24.650
and then you're like,
oh yeah,
then if fucking,
yeah,

1918
01:48:24.651 --> 01:48:28.310
that changes everything because it's a total give and take.
I mean,

1919
01:48:28.730 --> 01:48:31.610
cause like if I'm in a great fucking mood and the crowd just like we're not,

1920
01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:34.690
we don't really give,
we wandered in here somehow,
you know,
like,
right.

1921
01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:38.720
Which can happen.
Yeah,
it does happen a lot.
So it's like,
oh,

1922
01:48:38.721 --> 01:48:41.330
well this isn't a mutually beneficial thing then.

1923
01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.180
<v 6>Do you,
um,</v>

1924
01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:45.990
do you have crowds now where they're coming out specifically to see you and you

1925
01:48:45.991 --> 01:48:46.920
know the difference?

1926
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:49.870
<v 9>Not really.
Not Crowds.</v>

1927
01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:52.990
There are people groups in the crusade.
Yeah.

1928
01:48:52.991 --> 01:48:57.210
A handful of people who know me from Doug I to,

1929
01:48:57.211 --> 01:48:59.950
I opened for Doug for a few years,
um,

1930
01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:04.330
spy kids to buy kids too.
Um,

1931
01:49:05.110 --> 01:49:08.740
it just kind of being,
I mean,
I haven't been doing it super long.
Um,

1932
01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:13.640
how long were you doing it?
About eight years.
Uh,
started in know too.

1933
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:14.850
Yeah.
I,
that's

1934
01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:19.120
<v 6>one crazy.
If you were like in school you'd have a fucking Phd,
but with comedy,</v>

1935
01:49:19.121 --> 01:49:21.370
like Ram,
you need to put in some years kid.

1936
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:25.280
<v 9>Yeah,
no,
I'm still figuring it out and yeah,
I W I was,</v>

1937
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:29.570
I was like 29 30 when I started and it's like,
fuck,
why didn't I get like,

1938
01:49:29.571 --> 01:49:32.930
I was just having too much fun goofing off.
I was like,
ah,
I don't know.
I didn't,

1939
01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.720
I wish I started when I was like 22 or something.

1940
01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:37.290
<v 6>Yeah.
But you know what you did.</v>

1941
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:40.380
That's the most important thing is that you did forget about all that other

1942
01:49:40.381 --> 01:49:44.010
bullshit and still I was goofing off the whole time,
but I wasn't.

1943
01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:47.440
I think the good thing is you don't have this body of work from the past that

1944
01:49:47.441 --> 01:49:48.430
like sucks

1945
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:51.430
<v 5>back when you're stupid and they go on Youtube and man,</v>

1946
01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:53.230
I've got some comedy out there.
There's some,

1947
01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:57.610
some video of me from when I was 25 at Rascal's Comedy Club in New Jersey.

1948
01:49:57.611 --> 01:50:00.850
It's terrible.
I have a luscious head of hair though.
I'm so jealous of my hair.

1949
01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:02.980
When my hair started really fallen out,

1950
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:06.880
I was like just starting to fall out back then and um,
there was like,

1951
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:08.590
the is silly.
I was all skinny.

1952
01:50:08.591 --> 01:50:11.140
I didn't lift weights back then or anything and I was like looking,
I was like,

1953
01:50:11.170 --> 01:50:15.070
God,
it's just awful comedy and it's attached to me forever.

1954
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:18.370
<v 9>Yeah,
I guess like,
I mean this stuff,</v>

1955
01:50:18.371 --> 01:50:23.080
I even know I was 29 or 30 when I started.
I mean,
yeah,

1956
01:50:23.081 --> 01:50:26.200
there's some pretty,
there's not great shit I was doing.
I had,
it was

1957
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:30.220
<v 5>a lot of shit actually.
I bought a diary a better than beat when I was 21.</v>

1958
01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:34.400
But yeah,
no,
there's nothing that's like completely appalling.
I've got a,

1959
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:36.170
when I was 21,
man,
I,
uh,

1960
01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:38.650
there's a couple of times that are recorded myself and I recorded the second

1961
01:50:38.651 --> 01:50:41.680
time I was ever on stage.
I have it back there somewhere on a cassette.
Wow.

1962
01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:46.390
And it's set on it just audio tremendously bad.

1963
01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:48.060
It's so horrible out.

1964
01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:52.300
Painful to listen to my accent makes me want to kick myself in the halls.

1965
01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.930
It's just,
it's so,
or is it just a thick Boston accent?
A little bit,
yeah.

1966
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:58.400
The Boston accent and just,
I didn't have anything to say mean.

1967
01:50:58.410 --> 01:51:01.000
What the fuck do you have to say when you're 21,
you're just like,
look at me.

1968
01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.300
And then people are like,
why do you want me to look at you?
And then you go,
yeah,

1969
01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.410
okay,
hold on.
I have to figure that out.
Yeah.
Get Way ahead of yourself.

1970
01:51:08.411 --> 01:51:11.150
You go and look at me first before you have anything to say.
You know,

1971
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:14.160
when you're 21,
I mean if you're,
you right now you're,
you know,
36 years old,

1972
01:51:14.170 --> 01:51:18.640
I was 30,
37 you go to a comedy club and some 21 year old goes on stage,
you know,

1973
01:51:18.641 --> 01:51:21.310
and you're like,
I mean,
come on rent really w how much have you got?

1974
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:24.860
<v 9>Really?
It's,
I mean,
and I tried not to prejudge people,</v>

1975
01:51:24.861 --> 01:51:27.950
although I can tell onsite whether or not somebody is fucking funny or not.

1976
01:51:27.951 --> 01:51:30.950
You can just tell it like every now and then you're surprised.
You're like,
oh,

1977
01:51:30.951 --> 01:51:32.540
I thought that guy was really gonna suck.

1978
01:51:32.541 --> 01:51:37.100
Just judging by the way he looks and you can tell like,
um,
but no,

1979
01:51:37.101 --> 01:51:39.590
I tried to keep an open mind and yeah,

1980
01:51:39.591 --> 01:51:44.000
a lot of times it's like heard that,
but like it's just,

1981
01:51:44.001 --> 01:51:48.770
people just don't like a lot of these younger guys just don't have a knowledge

1982
01:51:48.771 --> 01:51:49.370
of like,

1983
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:53.360
it's like you're not the first guy to ever fucking split the atom on this.
Like,

1984
01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:56.090
you know,
you don't think I can.
Yeah.

1985
01:51:56.110 --> 01:51:59.520
<v 5>I think of a good example.
They have a knowledge of stand up.</v>

1986
01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:03.010
You sort of have to have like a body of stand up that you've listened to before

1987
01:52:03.011 --> 01:52:03.850
you just jump in.

1988
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:07.490
<v 9>Yeah.
Get familiar with some stuff.
Even like,
you know,</v>

1989
01:52:07.491 --> 01:52:11.540
I mean I listened to a ton of,
I have a bunch of old comedy albums that I,

1990
01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:15.080
I like listen to them on vinyl and I've had them since I was a kid.

1991
01:52:15.081 --> 01:52:18.110
I mean I collect them still,
you know,
I buy them.
It's a cheap hobby to have.

1992
01:52:18.111 --> 01:52:22.430
You can get comedy lps for like three bucks a piece.
Uh,

1993
01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:26.660
but even just like,
yeah,
I can't think of,
well yeah,

1994
01:52:26.661 --> 01:52:31.130
you should know like older shit because it's like you're not the first guy.

1995
01:52:31.131 --> 01:52:33.200
A lot of this stuff that you think is brilliant.
It's like,

1996
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:37.300
well fucking Sam Kinison had a whole thing about it or,
uh,

1997
01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:41.190
or there's five guys working the road right now doing a thing about the

1998
01:52:41.191 --> 01:52:46.191
Starbucks coffee cup sizes being called different names than a small,

1999
01:52:46.281 --> 01:52:51.080
medium and large.
Like,
yeah,
come on man.
Yeah,
but it's all,

2000
01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:52.300
I guess you just figure it out.

2001
01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:52.841
<v 5>Well,</v>

2002
01:52:52.841 --> 01:52:56.620
I can understand someone just doing their own version of it until they sort of

2003
01:52:56.621 --> 01:53:00.040
get their feet out from under him or get their feet under him.
You know,

2004
01:53:00.041 --> 01:53:03.040
when they're just,
you know,
when you're doing an open mic nights and shit,

2005
01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:06.770
I get all that.
But once you actually start doing gigs,
you know,
she started,

2006
01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.480
you know,
going places,
then you should probably know what other people are doing,

2007
01:53:10.810 --> 01:53:11.350
you know?

2008
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:13.660
<v 9>Yeah.
I,
yeah,
I mean sometimes</v>

2009
01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:16.900
<v 5>you can't be doing a Lenny Bruce joke and not knowing,
oh no,</v>

2010
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:19.960
because there was a dude that,
uh,
I used to know back in Boston has,

2011
01:53:19.961 --> 01:53:22.900
is he's a great writer.
He's a really funny guy.
He didn't,
he didn't steal it.

2012
01:53:23.110 --> 01:53:26.610
He wrote it on his own,
but it was a Lenny Bruce line.
Now I'm like,
man,

2013
01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:28.540
you should,
you got to got to know about that one.

2014
01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:33.340
It was about gay people and gay people,
gay being illegal,
dig this man gay.

2015
01:53:33.341 --> 01:53:35.200
Being gay is illegal.
So what do they do?

2016
01:53:35.230 --> 01:53:39.370
They take you and they put you in prison with a bunch of men want to have sex

2017
01:53:39.371 --> 01:53:42.420
with you.
Yeah.
You know,
and that was Lenny Bruce like in you know,

2018
01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:46.860
whatever's in 1950 or something like that dude reinvented it in 1990 you know I

2019
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:48.190
had no we just did.

2020
01:53:48.330 --> 01:53:52.170
<v 9>Well that's going to happen and I mean people are going to tell you,</v>

2021
01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:55.230
although sometimes like there've been a couple,

2022
01:53:55.710 --> 01:54:00.390
there's one thing in particular that I was kind of confused as to why nobody

2023
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:03.750
told me I was doing a bit like I had again when I started,

2024
01:54:03.751 --> 01:54:06.450
it was a lot of fucking diarrhea jokes and stuff and I had a,

2025
01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:11.610
I had a joke about Tgi fry,
like just,
it was basically a diary,
a chunk,

2026
01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.480
but it started with Tgi Friday cause I got wicked like bad diarrhea from Tgi

2027
01:54:17.490 --> 01:54:19.050
Friday's one time.
And Yeah,

2028
01:54:19.051 --> 01:54:22.650
just that was like the got me into my diarrhea thing.

2029
01:54:23.010 --> 01:54:27.450
And then I was in Philly working at the club there and I didn't have enough time

2030
01:54:27.451 --> 01:54:29.370
to eat.
I either,
there's a rite aid across the street.

2031
01:54:29.371 --> 01:54:32.700
I bought hot pockets from the rite aid and heated him up in the microwave,

2032
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:36.360
ate them and like the worst fucking diarrhea again.

2033
01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:39.030
So I just changed it in my bit.
Like it's like,
well,

2034
01:54:39.031 --> 01:54:42.480
I'll update my diarrhea chunk to the last thing it gave me diarrhea was hot

2035
01:54:42.481 --> 01:54:44.960
pockets and uh,

2036
01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:48.770
but Jim Gaffigan has like this huge hot pockets chunk.

2037
01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:54.590
I didn't,
I saw it on TV one day.
Like I saw his,
you know,

2038
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:57.780
I turned on TV,
comedy central zone.
I was like,
oh,
I'll watch some of this guy.

2039
01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.420
And he goes into this like 15 minute hot pockets chunk.

2040
01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:08.010
And I'm like,
how did nobody ever tell me that this guy?
Like,

2041
01:55:08.011 --> 01:55:09.330
I mean it's not like we're doing this,

2042
01:55:09.331 --> 01:55:12.510
but he talks about how they give you a diary in,
I don't know.
It's just weird.

2043
01:55:12.511 --> 01:55:13.970
Like I think you

2044
01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:17.330
<v 5>paths don't cross your fans and his fans and your people in his people.</v>

2045
01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:20.600
<v 9>Well it seems like it's a pretty famous kind of bit of finger though,</v>

2046
01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:21.450
even though I didn't,

2047
01:55:21.450 --> 01:55:24.800
<v 5>I don't know the bit though.
But I know he does a bit,
this is a famous sitters.</v>

2048
01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.990
I don't know the bit,
but I know he hasn't.

2049
01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.130
<v 9>Yeah,
it's that famous.
It's like his signature,
like put them on them.
You know,</v>

2050
01:55:32.190 --> 01:55:33.180
putting them up into that.

2051
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:36.740
<v 5>He's an interesting case.
You know,
he's an interesting guy,
you know,</v>

2052
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:40.400
it's like super squeaky clean and nice and you know,

2053
01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:42.840
<v 9>tasks for tick character thing too.</v>

2054
01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:47.850
I've been talking to other community and friends who are like kind of,
you know,

2055
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:51.180
on my peers,
you know,
where you know,

2056
01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:53.310
I still feel like I'm struggling with like

2057
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:58.290
really fucking dialing in,
like finding my voice,

2058
01:55:58.291 --> 01:56:00.570
getting into that like zone of like,
you know,

2059
01:56:00.571 --> 01:56:04.670
like Doug or like just really knowing who you are and what,

2060
01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:08.040
like I don't feel like I have any strong opinions on anything sometimes.

2061
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:12.540
And I'm like,
Whoa,
yeah,
I'm kind of like,
you know,
don't,

2062
01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:14.580
yeah.
It's like I,

2063
01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:16.980
<v 4>it's like,
well,
I don't want to ruffle any feathers.
You know?
It's like,</v>

2064
01:56:16.981 --> 01:56:20.530
well then that's going to be,
oh,
you're gonna be a great comedian Sunday.
Yeah.

2065
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:21.900
Just get on stage.
What are you guys are,

2066
01:56:21.901 --> 01:56:24.960
I just want to make sure everybody's cool with everything I say because I don't

2067
01:56:24.961 --> 01:56:29.820
want anybody on that man.
Yeah.
That's kind of fun.
Still Cut.

2068
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:32.370
But I think that the character,
like Gaffigan has that.

2069
01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:37.340
<v 9>And even I was watching some of,
I saw part of Louis C [inaudible] hilarious,
uh,</v>

2070
01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:41.390
thing.
They showed it on comedy central the other night and I fall asleep halfway

2071
01:56:41.391 --> 01:56:42.880
through now because it was boring.
Ice.
Just

2072
01:56:42.890 --> 01:56:45.740
<v 4>exhausted.
Don't even say that.
A man shouldn't even say that.
Oh,</v>

2073
01:56:45.741 --> 01:56:50.600
well I fell asleep halfway through,
bro.
Watch that.
While it's great.
No,
totally.

2074
01:56:50.601 --> 01:56:54.450
I mean,
it's,
I didn't mean that.
Uh,
why,
why?
Yeah.
I,

2075
01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:58.660
I didn't sleep the night before and just as soon as I laid on a couch,

2076
01:56:58.661 --> 01:57:00.440
I fell asleep in the middle of k one dynamite.

2077
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:04.100
Like a bitch fell asleep in the middle of fucking cage fighting.

2078
01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:09.130
I'm watching [inaudible] try to kill each other with their bare hands and feet

2079
01:57:09.681 --> 01:57:14.540
and knees.
You're like,
you know,
I'm fucking in the counseling.
Well,

2080
01:57:14.890 --> 01:57:18.470
yeah,
that's not,
I mean,
actually Louis Ck is fantastic.

2081
01:57:18.471 --> 01:57:23.190
Louis Ck so good that I don't hear anybody ever say anything like,
but Louis C,

2082
01:57:23.191 --> 01:57:23.911
k s hilarious.

2083
01:57:23.911 --> 01:57:27.470
So there's not like one comic that I know that it's a dissenter that's like not

2084
01:57:27.471 --> 01:57:30.980
that good.
Yeah.
Everybody's like,
God,
it's so cool to be around,
you know,

2085
01:57:30.981 --> 01:57:34.670
at a time where there's a guy like this is doing a new hour of crazy new shit

2086
01:57:34.671 --> 01:57:35.504
every year.

2087
01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:39.290
<v 9>Dissect it.
And you know what I was seeing because I like I,</v>

2088
01:57:39.291 --> 01:57:42.570
I've been talking to other people about how like,
or what I've been noticing,

2089
01:57:42.571 --> 01:57:44.010
it's like,
oh,
it's like this character,

2090
01:57:44.011 --> 01:57:48.480
like Gaffigan asked the guy who talks to himself like this,
right?
And like,

2091
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:52.370
even Louis C k a guy who's just kind of like writing great ship.
Yeah.

2092
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:54.920
<v 4>He even has little like,
did,
did the dude,</v>

2093
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:58.730
like he has these little kind of things that are just part of his personality

2094
01:57:58.731 --> 01:58:01.890
and the way he talks where he's found his voice,
but it's like big

2095
01:58:02.230 --> 01:58:06.320
<v 9>and you know,
he could say a sentence without writing any joke to,</v>

2096
01:58:06.321 --> 01:58:08.210
it's just like the way it's like,

2097
01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:12.740
it's just all these elements are combined to like,

2098
01:58:12.741 --> 01:58:15.350
just make this perfect.
That's what makes a great comedian.

2099
01:58:15.351 --> 01:58:18.590
It's like you're like this definitive personality.

2100
01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:20.660
Like people can do impressions of you.

2101
01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:25.940
And that's I guess where like I feel,
I don't feel like I'm,
yeah,

2102
01:58:25.941 --> 01:58:28.010
I like,
I can make people laugh.

2103
01:58:28.011 --> 01:58:31.100
I can go on stage and keep people entertained all night,
but it's like,
well,

2104
01:58:31.101 --> 01:58:35.960
what's,
what's my fucking gimmick?
Like Nadia,
you know,
that sounds weird,

2105
01:58:35.961 --> 01:58:38.340
but even like Benson dug beds,

2106
01:58:38.341 --> 01:58:42.520
who was talking about that in some interview I saw them where like,
it's like,
oh,

2107
01:58:42.521 --> 01:58:46.090
the pot thing just kind of naturally happened.
And before that he was,

2108
01:58:46.590 --> 01:58:48.580
he was just a funny,
well-respected comedian.

2109
01:58:48.581 --> 01:58:52.720
But then once you have like some thing where that identifies you,

2110
01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:57.550
uh,
which uh,
yeah,
I don't feel like,
you know,

2111
01:58:57.610 --> 01:59:01.930
you said a phrase something like you can't,
do they get the beard out?

2112
01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:05.950
Yeah,
no,
I mean it's like a,
you need to get her done.

2113
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:09.940
I think it's just a big of like,
you know,
doing it fucking cause like yeah,

2114
01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:11.380
like you were saying you'd have,

2115
01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:15.220
I could be a doctor if I went to fucking school for eight years,

2116
01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:18.020
<v 6>but you would put so much more effort into being a doctor then you do in the</v>

2117
01:59:18.021 --> 01:59:20.060
being a comedian.
Comedians for the most part,

2118
01:59:20.061 --> 01:59:23.180
we're pretty fucking lazy about writing and about performing and about,
you know,

2119
01:59:23.190 --> 01:59:27.170
like really going over material and correcting in and trying to enhance it.

2120
01:59:27.171 --> 01:59:31.280
And Yeah,
I record all my sessions,
but I only listened to half of them ever.

2121
01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:34.230
It's like that fucking torture to listen to yourself,

2122
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:36.680
but that's the really the way to develop new material.

2123
01:59:36.681 --> 01:59:40.880
Whenever I have a new bit and I pause and I'd go over it and I,

2124
01:59:40.881 --> 01:59:43.910
I listened to the recording and then I go over the way it's written,

2125
01:59:43.911 --> 01:59:46.990
the way it's said,
I always can make it better.
I can always enhance it for sure.

2126
01:59:46.991 --> 01:59:48.050
It's always beneficial.

2127
01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.440
<v 9>It is.
I,
I'm the worst with it too.</v>

2128
01:59:50.441 --> 01:59:55.120
Like I have fucking drawers full of Lego pieces of paper and notebooks and it's

2129
01:59:55.121 --> 01:59:58.540
like,
I just write this shit down and then I throw the notebook in a drawer.

2130
01:59:58.541 --> 01:59:59.374
It's like,

2131
01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:03.910
why don't you flip through this shit a little more often and and watch yourself.

2132
02:00:03.911 --> 02:00:04.744
It's like,
yeah.

2133
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:10.500
<v 6>All right.
What is it doing?
I'm not doing anything.</v>

2134
02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:14.580
That's what it did earlier.
Remember the headphones near though?
Whoa.

2135
02:00:14.670 --> 02:00:17.750
That's crazy.
Well,
that was the loudest fucking seven.

2136
02:00:17.751 --> 02:00:20.850
That's weird because we're sitting here the whole time.
They're on your head,

2137
02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:23.290
but you took the headphones off.
What did you do?
I just,
yeah,

2138
02:00:23.291 --> 02:00:26.570
I just took my head off phones off and you put them near the microphone back

2139
02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:30.940
crazy.
No,
no,
no.
You were up there when it,
when it's still doing it back there.
Oh,

2140
02:00:31.230 --> 02:00:33.990
start started over there and then that's weird.
That's what I'm saying.

2141
02:00:33.991 --> 02:00:37.140
It's kind of weird.
That sucks.
[inaudible] plugged in,
right?

2142
02:00:38.530 --> 02:00:42.780
[inaudible] good.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Anyway,
where were you?
Oh,
Geez.

2143
02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:47.140
Your thing,
you voice,
not even your gimmick.
I know what you're saying.

2144
02:00:47.141 --> 02:00:47.881
You just kind of,
yeah.

2145
02:00:47.881 --> 02:00:52.790
I don't feel like you're 100% satisfied with the evolution of you as like you're

2146
02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.400
not representative of who you can be on stage and you don't really know.

2147
02:00:56.460 --> 02:01:00.880
You're just kind of them back and forth.
Yeah.
And it's,
yeah,

2148
02:01:00.970 --> 02:01:04.930
pretty was very honest man.
You know,
there was,
um,

2149
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:09.090
there's been many times in my life where my act is like changed or who I felt

2150
02:01:09.091 --> 02:01:10.870
about myself on stage and you know,

2151
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:14.670
how I performed is changed and most of it's depending on how much focus on

2152
02:01:14.671 --> 02:01:18.870
putting on it,
you know,
and who you're hanging out with,
what you're,
you know,

2153
02:01:18.871 --> 02:01:22.680
it's just,
yeah,
I mean I think you could definitely lose a grip on it.
You know?

2154
02:01:22.681 --> 02:01:26.280
That's the thing about comedy,
it's like you can start off in a good way.
I mean,

2155
02:01:26.281 --> 02:01:28.650
how many times you ever seen a guy who starts out really good and like,

2156
02:01:28.651 --> 02:01:31.830
this kid's got potential and then somewhere along the line they just skid out.

2157
02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:36.870
We get lazy.
They wrote,
yeah,
20 good minutes.
Yeah,
exactly.
23.
And it's like,
well,

2158
02:01:36.871 --> 02:01:40.280
you're 42 now.
And he really needed to be doing same joke.

2159
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.510
<v 9>That was funny.
Yeah,
that's brutal.
That's the most painful part of it.
Yeah.</v>

2160
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:48.570
<v 6>It's hard for guys to let go of Shit that they know will work and try new things</v>

2161
02:01:48.571 --> 02:01:51.090
that no one's ever heard before.
They have a chance.

2162
02:01:51.130 --> 02:01:52.750
<v 9>Well,
and even watching yourself,</v>

2163
02:01:52.751 --> 02:01:57.190
like I submitted for a half hour special on comedy central last year and I had,

2164
02:01:57.191 --> 02:02:00.610
I recorded,
you know,
I recorded some sets obviously,

2165
02:02:00.611 --> 02:02:05.611
and I had to send them a DVD and watching just from watching those DVDs,

2166
02:02:06.731 --> 02:02:09.010
I realized like,
I never fucking watch myself.

2167
02:02:09.011 --> 02:02:13.150
I improved fucking like five jokes just by sitting there and watch you go,

2168
02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:13.840
oh wait,

2169
02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.590
this is a much better tag than what I've been saying for the last eight months.

2170
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:20.950
After that fucking joke.
Sometimes you forget tags.

2171
02:02:20.951 --> 02:02:23.590
You go and listen to you like Jesus.
That's the perfect,
oh,

2172
02:02:23.610 --> 02:02:26.230
that's the best part of the fucking joke all the time too.
You're like,

2173
02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:31.320
how did I fucking forget that little aside that made that joke fucking good for

2174
02:02:32.051 --> 02:02:32.870
me.
And that's it.

2175
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:36.710
<v 6>The difference between you and,
um,
I and comics and you know,</v>

2176
02:02:36.711 --> 02:02:40.280
people that go for the PhDs,
they put in a lot more fucking effort and time.

2177
02:02:40.670 --> 02:02:45.650
But the thing about funny,
as funny as got to also be connected to fun,

2178
02:02:45.970 --> 02:02:49.850
like it's very difficult to have a fucking complete shit life and be funny on

2179
02:02:49.851 --> 02:02:54.290
stage.
Like you don't feel like funny.
Yeah.
There's gotta be some fun involved.

2180
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:59.140
And the reality is when you're in college or you're working for your phd or
your,

2181
02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:02.630
you know,
involved in some crazy business where you have to work 16 hours a day,

2182
02:03:02.810 --> 02:03:04.130
there's not a whole lot of fun going on.

2183
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:07.700
There's not a whole lot of humor in any of that,
you know.
And for a comic,

2184
02:03:07.701 --> 02:03:10.010
a certain amount of you almost has to be lazy.

2185
02:03:10.190 --> 02:03:14.120
Like I've never met like a great comic that at least one point in time didn't

2186
02:03:14.121 --> 02:03:19.040
struggle with extreme laziness and procrastination and self indulgence and the

2187
02:03:19.041 --> 02:03:23.230
need to just masturbate all day because,
you know,
you're just too silly.
Yeah.

2188
02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:25.730
Because yeah,
candidate feels good and you're like,

2189
02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:27.170
you get obsessed with it and you're like,
fuck it.

2190
02:03:27.330 --> 02:03:30.690
<v 9>Yeah,
we're all like,
I mean,
I know at least.
Yeah.</v>

2191
02:03:30.691 --> 02:03:35.580
I didn't like bedtime and like anything and now it's like,
oh,
now we're adults.

2192
02:03:35.581 --> 02:03:39.210
Like we're are kind of a bunch of fucking overgrown kids who are like,

2193
02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:40.900
I can go to bed,
whatever the fuck I went.
Yeah,

2194
02:03:41.190 --> 02:03:43.670
I fall asleep in front of the check off five times today.

2195
02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:46.610
It's a shitty retail email.
The fucking,

2196
02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:49.110
I'll return those emails tomorrow.

2197
02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:52.230
<v 6>What I was doing is I get my writing done and then when I get my writing done,</v>

2198
02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:54.750
I'm satisfied.
I've got over a thousand words,

2199
02:03:54.751 --> 02:03:55.830
I've got some really good shit there.

2200
02:03:55.831 --> 02:03:58.830
I like what I'm saying at a thousand words or whatever,

2201
02:03:58.831 --> 02:03:59.820
whatever I feel is enough.

2202
02:03:59.821 --> 02:04:02.400
Then I'll just start surfing the internet and I started watching documentaries,

2203
02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.230
so I'll be watching some fucking galactic void documentary about where they

2204
02:04:07.231 --> 02:04:09.410
think,
why don't you just tell her nursery,

2205
02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:14.640
why don't you do like laptop in bed then?
Yeah,
I don't sleep alone.

2206
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:17.460
That light going on and knowing people,

2207
02:04:17.461 --> 02:04:20.550
I think that's rude and I don't like when I'm in my office,

2208
02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:23.700
that's when I write my best shit.
You know?
That's my,
that's my area,

2209
02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:28.200
which is where we filmed this podcast.
Right.
You know,
it's like this,
um,
you know,

2210
02:04:28.201 --> 02:04:31.050
I,
this is my spot.
You know what I mean?
I got this spot nailed.

2211
02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:34.620
I know exactly what's going on.
Come on.
Refrigerator right here.
My coconut juice,

2212
02:04:34.621 --> 02:04:38.160
my computer right here.
I'm not going anywhere.
So any ideas that I have,

2213
02:04:38.161 --> 02:04:41.220
if I'm watching a documentary,
I want to be right here and comfortable with,

2214
02:04:41.221 --> 02:04:44.610
they can come out as easy as possible.
You know what I love,
man,

2215
02:04:44.611 --> 02:04:47.760
there's fucking Evernote thing that,
uh,
if you ever seen that,

2216
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:48.623
do you know what that is?

2217
02:04:48.690 --> 02:04:51.120
It's an application for the iPhone I've been at through your phone too.

2218
02:04:51.121 --> 02:04:54.840
You have a droid?
Is that a droid?
Yeah,
yeah.
I'm sure they have it for George.

2219
02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:57.990
It's amazing,
man.
You can take websites,

2220
02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:01.320
any idea that you have that you see on a website like,
Whoa,
the scientist,

2221
02:05:01.321 --> 02:05:04.320
just new discovery,
you know,
inside every black hole is,
you know,

2222
02:05:04.450 --> 02:05:07.340
the possibility of a new universe,
you know,
and you're like,
Whoa,

2223
02:05:07.341 --> 02:05:09.870
I've got to remember that.
What would this everquest thing,

2224
02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:13.920
all you have to do is like press.
You can get it,
you get the webpage,

2225
02:05:13.921 --> 02:05:17.240
the webpage loads up like the text version of the webpage,

2226
02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:19.620
you know even with photos and everything loads up on your,

2227
02:05:19.621 --> 02:05:22.170
your Evernote and you save it and you have that article.

2228
02:05:22.290 --> 02:05:23.550
Anything that you have an idea,

2229
02:05:23.551 --> 02:05:26.520
you have an idea like you have to write you a you,
you,

2230
02:05:26.521 --> 02:05:29.460
you write this down in your little phone and you put it in Evernote and when you

2231
02:05:29.461 --> 02:05:32.340
put it in Evernote,
it syncs up,
but it syncs up with your home computer.

2232
02:05:32.490 --> 02:05:35.760
It syncs up with whatever else you got and you got a laptop wherever you want to

2233
02:05:35.761 --> 02:05:39.920
keep the notes for a comic,
it's fucking in valuable.

2234
02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:40.410
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

2235
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:43.740
So like if you're writing a new bit and you don't have time to transfer to your

2236
02:05:43.741 --> 02:05:44.700
phone,
it doesn't matter.

2237
02:05:44.701 --> 02:05:47.260
You just turn on your new phone at the comedy club and go,
Oh,
there's the bit.

2238
02:05:47.261 --> 02:05:48.060
I was just writing

2239
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:51.720
<v 6>that was working on a bit at Sal's the other night and right before I got up I</v>

2240
02:05:51.721 --> 02:05:56.070
said,
Oh shit,
I forgot to get that,
retrieve it from Evernote.
So I go to Evernote,

2241
02:05:56.370 --> 02:06:00.460
retrieve it,
Bam,
copy and paste it,
put it in my notes,
went over the ideas,

2242
02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:01.940
hit the beats of the jokes.
Boom.

2243
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:04.410
You go on stage and it's like you can keep all your notes,

2244
02:06:04.411 --> 02:06:06.630
all of it online all the time.
Yeah,

2245
02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.580
and you could access it as you get a new phone,

2246
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:11.520
like say if you're fucking iPhone falls in the toilet and you're like,
fuck,

2247
02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:13.740
will you go to the apple store and you get a new phone?

2248
02:06:13.930 --> 02:06:16.350
Well your new phone will sync up and boom,
all those notes.

2249
02:06:16.351 --> 02:06:20.230
We'll be right back when they were so fucking this shit dude for right now.

2250
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:24.690
It's the shit.
The beautiful thing about it is that it's not just text,

2251
02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.460
it's text and pictures and anything else.
It's like,
yeah,

2252
02:06:27.570 --> 02:06:30.540
you can save a whole webpage.
Like you want to read a webpage,

2253
02:06:30.541 --> 02:06:33.120
you could read the whole thing,
man.
Just saves it right to your phone,

2254
02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:36.420
save the right to your laptop and you sync up with any number of devices that

2255
02:06:36.421 --> 02:06:39.600
you want.
You got a laptop,
you've got a home computer,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

2256
02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:40.890
So for,
for comics,

2257
02:06:40.891 --> 02:06:44.640
like when you find out like some crazy story online or there's some new subject

2258
02:06:44.641 --> 02:06:47.250
you have to talk about.
Boom.
It's so easy to save it.

2259
02:06:47.950 --> 02:06:50.700
<v 9>We'll look it up right now.
I mean I have to change the,
uh,</v>

2260
02:06:51.710 --> 02:06:56.110
I have to change the nine volt battery that might [inaudible] tongue on,

2261
02:06:57.070 --> 02:06:58.440
put your tongue on it.
See if it's still hot.

2262
02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:02.340
I remember that when used to do that with a little bit id,
nine volts.
Yeah.

2263
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.950
Get that jolt.
I said,
son,
what is that?

2264
02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:08.110
What are you doing yourself when you do that?
Does that give any cancer?
Probably.

2265
02:07:08.130 --> 02:07:12.120
I think it's just the little electric charge.
That's it.
Yeah.
Hope without,

2266
02:07:12.121 --> 02:07:13.440
fuck tried that first.

2267
02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:17.670
There's a comedian in Austin who's got a joke about who,

2268
02:07:18.070 --> 02:07:22.770
who was the first guy to try a pineapple?
Like the guys,

2269
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:23.201
that guy.

2270
02:07:23.201 --> 02:07:26.040
Well I don't even remember how it goes but it's funny cause it's like the most

2271
02:07:26.041 --> 02:07:28.770
uninviting.
Like let's eat this thing.
And he's like,
oh there's a,

2272
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:32.430
the first guy that ate the pineapple was like a hero and there's a guy like

2273
02:07:32.431 --> 02:07:35.070
right next to him with a pine cone.
Like fuck so close.

2274
02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:39.940
<v 6>That's funny.
Yeah.
He's a funny dude.
Austin's a funny place man.</v>

2275
02:07:39.941 --> 02:07:41.860
There's a lot of good comedy that comes out of Austin.

2276
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.430
<v 9>It's a great scene.
It's,
yeah.
I mean I,
I stayed there for,</v>

2277
02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:49.620
it's an easy place to live,
man.
Especially when you start working the road.

2278
02:07:49.621 --> 02:07:53.130
Cause I just,
I started working the road from there just doing shit,
shit,

2279
02:07:53.131 --> 02:07:54.030
Midwest stuff.

2280
02:07:54.031 --> 02:07:58.200
Just opening from random guys before Doug picked me up and I started going with

2281
02:07:58.201 --> 02:07:59.034
him.
It was like,

2282
02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:02.320
<v 6>you've got to kind of a dark act.
Do you ever get guys that tell you,
hey,</v>

2283
02:08:02.321 --> 02:08:04.780
you know,
don't do this bit or don't,
you know,

2284
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:09.080
don't swear too much or don't get too creepy or no,

2285
02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:11.140
I have no currently no,
no.

2286
02:08:11.141 --> 02:08:13.450
Like when you were middle and for guys when you're going on the road,

2287
02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:18.980
<v 9>ah,
you know,
I don't remember like there was no real,</v>

2288
02:08:18.981 --> 02:08:22.580
nothing sticks out with people going like,
if you fucking tell that

2289
02:08:23.190 --> 02:08:26.430
<v 6>we've had these conversations before about guys taking guys on the road with</v>

2290
02:08:26.431 --> 02:08:28.050
them and telling them like what bits to do,

2291
02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:31.980
what are you taking the guy on the road with you?
Yeah,
it's Kinda Kinda twisted,

2292
02:08:32.010 --> 02:08:37.010
but I did like random dudes that had sound cues and costume change clothes or

2293
02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.033
beyond that.

2294
02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:41.310
<v 9>I think they featured,
no,
no,
but I'd be the feature act where like,</v>

2295
02:08:41.370 --> 02:08:45.000
no thought goes into comedy booking.
It's like Sioux Falls,
South Dakota,

2296
02:08:45.001 --> 02:08:47.940
Brendan Walsh.
And then like,
uh,
you know,

2297
02:08:47.941 --> 02:08:51.270
there's a guy called the midnight swinger who's a nice guy,

2298
02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:55.080
but how is this a fucking show?
Like the guys all like,

2299
02:08:55.081 --> 02:08:59.040
he wears like a fucking Vegasy style thing.

2300
02:08:59.041 --> 02:09:03.770
He's got a big Johnny Bravo or whatever,
that cartoon guy,
the big Hairdo and,

2301
02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:07.710
and his act is like,
you know,
he does a bunch of sound cues and shit at the end.

2302
02:09:07.711 --> 02:09:10.020
I mean get standing ovations.
Everybody loves him,
but it's like,

2303
02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:12.320
well why am I opening for him?

2304
02:09:12.330 --> 02:09:15.630
Like if anybody in the crowd likes me,

2305
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:18.540
they're probably not going to like him.
Vice versa,

2306
02:09:18.541 --> 02:09:22.710
if people were here to see the singing and dancing guy who's like,
again,

2307
02:09:22.711 --> 02:09:24.670
super good dude and like Stan,

2308
02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:28.620
I never got a standing ovation in my life and he would get them six nights a

2309
02:09:28.621 --> 02:09:29.454
week.

2310
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:36.010
<v 6>But those guys are freak out and go,
why the fuck am I not on TV?</v>

2311
02:09:36.370 --> 02:09:38.470
America loves me.
These crowds love me.

2312
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:42.280
<v 9>I lot of them,
I don't know guys like that who have like kind of those big,</v>

2313
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:47.050
you know,
kind of clothes or things and really the whole lobby,
they seem,

2314
02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:50.920
a lot of them seem to be happy with like doing like little rooms in Vegas here

2315
02:09:50.921 --> 02:09:55.450
and there.
They'll go on a cruise ship and they'll really,
I,
I mean,

2316
02:09:55.451 --> 02:09:56.081
I don't know.

2317
02:09:56.081 --> 02:10:00.880
That's kind of get the idea that some of them are pretty happy with like,
Oh,

2318
02:10:00.881 --> 02:10:04.500
you know,
I can make,
you know,
like it's,

2319
02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:08.230
it's not easy to make 80 or a hundred grand a year,
you know.

2320
02:10:08.410 --> 02:10:13.090
And if you can do that just by doing like,
you know,
kind of be rooms headlining,

2321
02:10:13.091 --> 02:10:14.140
be rooms selling,

2322
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:17.740
like a lot of them have like some kind of t shirt or something they sell and

2323
02:10:17.741 --> 02:10:21.370
they'll fucking make more than they're getting paid from the club that week off.

2324
02:10:21.371 --> 02:10:22.780
They're like,
who farted tee shirts?

2325
02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.800
<v 6>Well I know a lot.
I have a lot of friends that uh,
when they go on the road,</v>

2326
02:10:26.801 --> 02:10:27.760
like they,
you know,

2327
02:10:27.761 --> 02:10:30.640
they run into trouble where people don't want a middle and forum.
Like Joey,

2328
02:10:30.641 --> 02:10:33.710
nobody wants Joey Diaz middle and for ya or Ari,
you know,

2329
02:10:33.711 --> 02:10:36.560
there's a lot of dudes who won't,
don't want a guy like that to middle for him.

2330
02:10:36.561 --> 02:10:39.110
You know,
like if,
you know,
there's,
students had complain about him,

2331
02:10:39.111 --> 02:10:41.180
like it goes up at the comedy store cause he's just,

2332
02:10:41.181 --> 02:10:42.350
he's dirty and it's ranching.

2333
02:10:42.351 --> 02:10:45.320
It's funny and people think for some reason that they get into,

2334
02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:47.810
someone gets into this mindset,
you can't pull them out of it.

2335
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:52.610
So I'll say I don't want him going on before me.
Like really?
Like what the fuck?

2336
02:10:52.670 --> 02:10:54.050
Come on.
That's crazy.

2337
02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:58.670
<v 9>I don't mind anybody gone on before me with the exception of like famous guy,</v>

2338
02:10:58.700 --> 02:10:59.211
like you know,

2339
02:10:59.211 --> 02:11:03.020
like I was at the laugh factory one time and was about to go up and you're like,

2340
02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:07.160
Carlos,
Mitzi is here,
he wants to go out and this isn't like a,
you know,

2341
02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:10.250
weird Carlos Man.
See his story.
He went on and he did like,
you know,
20 minutes.

2342
02:11:10.251 --> 02:11:12.650
It wasn't one of those things where he did three hours and I had to drive home.

2343
02:11:12.651 --> 02:11:15.350
Like he,
you know,
did like 15 or 20 minutes.

2344
02:11:15.351 --> 02:11:19.370
But the crowd was pretty psyched to see him and,

2345
02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:23.360
and you know,
he had a good set but then I had to go up and it was like,
yeah,

2346
02:11:23.361 --> 02:11:28.361
everybody's kind of still just getting over the fucking buzz from seeing that

2347
02:11:28.371 --> 02:11:30.020
dude.
Like nobody's listening.

2348
02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:33.030
<v 6>Those are good for you though,
man.
I did a lot of those sets and uh,</v>

2349
02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:36.490
the at the comedy store and I think those sets really taught me a lot about

2350
02:11:36.491 --> 02:11:38.260
grabbing the audience and about,
you know,

2351
02:11:38.261 --> 02:11:41.260
just just going out there and getting into it and doing your shit.

2352
02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:44.740
Cause there was a bunch of times where I'd gone after,
um,
Martin Lawrence.

2353
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:46.720
Oh yeah.
And the crowd would be,
you know,

2354
02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:51.400
90% black too and Martin Lawrence would uh,
get offstage do like,
you know,

2355
02:11:51.401 --> 02:11:52.320
he did.
He was,

2356
02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:57.130
and so he'd do like a long set and destroy and then bring me up and that nobody

2357
02:11:57.131 --> 02:11:59.770
wanted to hear a fucking word.
I was saying.
I did it with dice clay.

2358
02:11:59.771 --> 02:12:01.300
I used to have to go on after dice clay a lot.

2359
02:12:01.450 --> 02:12:05.440
I did a with a bunch of times with prior when Richard Pryor was really sick.

2360
02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:07.390
Oh I went on right after.
I'm like,
oh,

2361
02:12:07.450 --> 02:12:11.230
for like five weeks a wheelchair.
I've talked about this,

2362
02:12:11.231 --> 02:12:12.640
but it's a pretty crazy story.
He was,

2363
02:12:12.641 --> 02:12:15.280
he was so sick that they used to have to turn the mic up.

2364
02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:17.473
<v 10>Oh Shit.</v>

2365
02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:22.270
<v 6>Like it was so hot that it was so hot because he couldn't talk loud and he would</v>

2366
02:12:22.271 --> 02:12:24.130
just be sitting in his,
in his chair.

2367
02:12:24.131 --> 02:12:27.310
They would have to carry them onto the stage and he would be drinking and just

2368
02:12:27.311 --> 02:12:31.090
get fucked up and just talk and unstated.
You understand a word.
He was barely,

2369
02:12:31.190 --> 02:12:36.010
man.
I always love pussy.
There's no joke.
Yeah.
It's like he's,

2370
02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:40.210
his faculties were diminished substantially and yet he was on stage talking and

2371
02:12:40.211 --> 02:12:42.640
people like had this weird feeling that it was like,
it was,

2372
02:12:42.641 --> 02:12:45.160
there was a feeling of sadness.
There was like a feeling of,
of,
you know,

2373
02:12:45.161 --> 02:12:48.730
here we're paying tribute to a great legend of comedy,
but man,
look at them now.

2374
02:12:48.731 --> 02:12:53.650
Like it's,
it's hard to watch.
And so then they would,
they would bring me up and,

2375
02:12:53.651 --> 02:12:58.060
uh,
the,
the,
the uh,
piano guy,
Jeff would go.
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,

2376
02:12:58.061 --> 02:13:01.690
we have another very funny comedian.
You might've seen him on news radio.

2377
02:13:01.810 --> 02:13:04.960
Get up for Joe.
I might've,
you know what?
No,

2378
02:13:04.961 --> 02:13:07.240
I don't even think I was on news radio at the time.
I think I'm lying.

2379
02:13:07.450 --> 02:13:10.360
I think I was on hardball who was a show that was on Fox.

2380
02:13:10.361 --> 02:13:13.510
It was a baseball show that was on Fox and nobody gave a fuck about that show.

2381
02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:15.160
It didn't matter who you were.
Anyway,
man,

2382
02:13:15.161 --> 02:13:18.790
you were going on after Richard Pryor and they have to carry him.

2383
02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:23.080
They have to carry him through the audience.
Yeah.
So they're walking him.

2384
02:13:23.081 --> 02:13:27.420
It's chewy and some other dude are carrying him through the audience cause and

2385
02:13:27.421 --> 02:13:30.280
it takes a long time to get them through.
It takes like five minutes,

2386
02:13:30.281 --> 02:13:31.210
like no bullshit.

2387
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:34.560
Like they have to be really slow because they're sort of half walking him,

2388
02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:36.000
half carrying him.
Right.

2389
02:13:36.001 --> 02:13:40.590
So the audience is a standing ovation from Mr Pryor and then you get onstage and

2390
02:13:40.591 --> 02:13:44.880
you have to crack jokes while Richard Pryor is crawling.

2391
02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:45.910
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

2392
02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:51.560
<v 6>The creeping.
He can't even control his body.
How long did he do that for?</v>

2393
02:13:51.710 --> 02:13:55.970
I did a five weeks.
Wow.
Did a bunch of shows.
He did a bunch of shows.
Yeah,

2394
02:13:55.971 --> 02:13:58.550
it was weird,
man.
It was weird to watch.
I only watched a couple of them.

2395
02:13:58.551 --> 02:14:01.790
I couldn't take it anymore.
I was just freaking me out man.
You know,

2396
02:14:01.791 --> 02:14:04.430
cause I would,
when I was a little kid I saw live and that sunset strip light,

2397
02:14:04.431 --> 02:14:06.080
that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do comedy,

2398
02:14:06.081 --> 02:14:08.810
that that first video my parents took me to see in the movie theater.

2399
02:14:09.100 --> 02:14:13.310
And I remember sitting in that theater laughing so fucking hard thinking how

2400
02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:17.900
incredible it was that this guy is just talking and he's so funny.

2401
02:14:18.110 --> 02:14:21.410
And I thought all the funny movies I'd seen like stripes and all these different

2402
02:14:21.411 --> 02:14:23.510
things that were great,
but they were never as funny as this.

2403
02:14:23.511 --> 02:14:26.510
Like this was the old I looked around,
I looked in the theater,

2404
02:14:26.511 --> 02:14:29.230
I was watching people like falling out of their seat,

2405
02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:30.920
walking back and forth laughing.

2406
02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:33.260
And I was just thinking this is the most incredible thing ever.

2407
02:14:33.410 --> 02:14:34.810
And then they go from that to

2408
02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:37.320
<v 10>yes.</v>

2409
02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:41.440
<v 6>I mean the whole room is just crackling with this hot microphone sounds.</v>

2410
02:14:41.970 --> 02:14:44.110
His glasses clinking his,
you know,

2411
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:49.790
his ice in his glass always loved posey cause it never did no bad me.

2412
02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:54.540
Like it was like he had no jokes.
He had nothing to say.

2413
02:14:54.541 --> 02:14:58.860
It's all just like polite laughter.
Yeah,
it's,
Huh,
Huh?

2414
02:14:58.950 --> 02:15:02.790
<v 4>No,
the imaginary looks horrible.
That's so sad.
The worst thing.</v>

2415
02:15:03.230 --> 02:15:07.590
<v 6>Greatest in my opinion,
if I had to pick one guy who was like,
you know,
the,</v>

2416
02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:10.960
the shining,
you know,
example of what's possible.

2417
02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.950
So much better than anyone before him.
Yeah,
I know.
So influential.
It's prior.

2418
02:15:16.190 --> 02:15:19.510
I mean he's so much better than anybody before him,
you know,

2419
02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.180
and hitting the high notes and doing that style of comedy is like sort of

2420
02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:27.890
friendly,
Raunchy,
honest,
insightful comedy.
So lovable,

2421
02:15:27.891 --> 02:15:31.730
so vulnerable.
Like everything about him was just,
he was like the,
you know,

2422
02:15:31.731 --> 02:15:35.180
at the time he was like for sure the greatest standup comedian ever.

2423
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:39.020
And so to go from that to watching them just like his body just physically

2424
02:15:39.021 --> 02:15:42.790
betraying him,
you know,
it's like so hard to do and then they have to do comedy.

2425
02:15:44.150 --> 02:15:47.980
<v 4>Like it's,
it's such a double whammy.
It's jokes about,
yeah,</v>

2426
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:49.670
I would make jokes about it.
Like,
okay,

2427
02:15:49.671 --> 02:15:54.260
Richard Pryor and then who is this unknown White Douche bag?
You know,
who,

2428
02:15:54.261 --> 02:15:57.650
oh my,
what the fuck am I doing up here?
Yeah.
And I would say,
you know,
hey,

2429
02:15:57.651 --> 02:15:59.160
that's exactly what I'm thinking too,

2430
02:15:59.590 --> 02:16:04.590
to just get through this as they slowly did show her.

2431
02:16:04.730 --> 02:16:08.810
I still do like weird one night or things that,
uh,
this guy books,

2432
02:16:08.811 --> 02:16:12.620
these shows like that are all about an hour away and uh,

2433
02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:15.820
or the embars yeah,
they're in bars.
Uh,

2434
02:16:16.690 --> 02:16:21.530
Barstow's a rough after data one.
Um,
do you have to do one win tonight?

2435
02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:25.520
Where are you going to be at?
Uh,
Newport beach or something like that?

2436
02:16:26.110 --> 02:16:29.050
Do you want to tell people so they can go?
Oh,
sure.
Oh,
hold,

2437
02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:30.130
I'll tell you the name of the place.

2438
02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:35.410
<v 9>It's called e p.
Dot.
If you don't,
we did a,</v>

2439
02:16:35.411 --> 02:16:38.260
we all did sales comedy hall the other night.
I loved that place.

2440
02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:43.030
Isn't that a cool little spot?
You know?
Yeah.
It's got a great vibe.
I did,

2441
02:16:43.031 --> 02:16:46.750
but what I was doing this show like the Monday or Tuesday,

2442
02:16:46.751 --> 02:16:49.810
Wednesday before Christmas this year.
So it's like,

2443
02:16:49.811 --> 02:16:54.050
it's a few days before Christmas.
That guy's like,
hey,
let 50 bucks.
I'm like,
yeah.

2444
02:16:54.051 --> 02:16:57.850
All right.
And,
uh,
we got there.

2445
02:16:57.851 --> 02:16:59.260
It was just a whole Christmas.

2446
02:16:59.261 --> 02:17:02.050
Don't borrow was just full of people that were there for a Christmas party.

2447
02:17:02.051 --> 02:17:05.500
And there were like eight people at the front who came for the comedy show,

2448
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:08.920
but it was just like a coffee.
And I hate,
this is one of my biggest pet peeves,

2449
02:17:08.921 --> 02:17:12.790
like when comedians get these bar shows together and some guys are just there to

2450
02:17:12.791 --> 02:17:17.320
get a drink,
you can't force comedy down people's throats.
I'm going to guys like,

2451
02:17:17.321 --> 02:17:21.010
Hey,
fuck,
go,
hey,
there's a show going on over here.
It's like,
well,
yeah,

2452
02:17:21.011 --> 02:17:24.970
don't get on the guy's car.
He's just having a beer man.
Like,
uh,

2453
02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:28.960
so yeah,
it's like,
well,
it's all these people were here for Christmas party.

2454
02:17:28.961 --> 02:17:33.400
They don't care what the fuck I'm saying these other eight people are kind of

2455
02:17:33.401 --> 02:17:37.240
having a,
you know,
getting a kick out of it.
But I'd like very early on,

2456
02:17:37.241 --> 02:17:40.780
and I'm doing,
I'm taping a TV thing this week,
so I was like,
well,

2457
02:17:40.781 --> 02:17:44.100
it'll be a chance to try and run through that material.
Which like,
no way.
Right.

2458
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:49.120
I was like,
fuck.
And,
uh,
so I just said when I was up there,
I was like,

2459
02:17:49.121 --> 02:17:51.440
it doesn't matter what the fuck I say does it like,
no,

2460
02:17:51.441 --> 02:17:53.080
nobody's even going to acknowledge it.
I said,

2461
02:17:53.081 --> 02:17:57.700
I said like I ran a baby over on my way there and like it made me horny.

2462
02:17:57.700 --> 02:18:01.450
So I went back and jerked off on the baby and stole his wallet and found out

2463
02:18:01.451 --> 02:18:04.420
where it lived and went and face fuck,
that's mom.

2464
02:18:04.430 --> 02:18:07.840
And it just like just started saying all this random shit and like the people

2465
02:18:07.841 --> 02:18:10.840
who were paying attention,
we're getting a kid cause like it did not,

2466
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:15.070
not one eyebrow raised from the Christmas party.
And then for the last seven,

2467
02:18:15.071 --> 02:18:17.620
cause the guy wanted me to do a certain amount of time and it's like,
yeah,

2468
02:18:17.621 --> 02:18:20.620
it's one of those gigs where it's like,
well if I don't do the full fucking time,

2469
02:18:20.621 --> 02:18:24.250
you might not give you the 50 bucks.
So I looked at my phone,

2470
02:18:24.251 --> 02:18:26.660
I was recording it at a,
or maybe I was,

2471
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:29.050
maybe I turned the recorder off at a certain point.
But,
uh,

2472
02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:33.520
I saw I had like seven minutes left.
And I just said,
I was like,
well,

2473
02:18:33.521 --> 02:18:37.810
I have seven minutes left.
I'm just gonna make noises for the last seven minutes.

2474
02:18:37.811 --> 02:18:39.420
If anybody has any suggestions,

2475
02:18:39.450 --> 02:18:42.590
I mean I'll try to make whatever noise you telling me to make.

2476
02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:46.180
I did a car alarm,

2477
02:18:46.210 --> 02:18:51.210
like you know the full run of the car alarm ain't took some weird suggestions,

2478
02:18:52.811 --> 02:18:57.520
did like a tiger tiger doing something and I wound up going,

2479
02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:01.840
it's great middle of it.
But I did all the time.
But it was,

2480
02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:06.070
that's very liberating when,
I dunno,

2481
02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:09.460
I hadn't been in a experience like that in a really long time where I was like,

2482
02:19:09.490 --> 02:19:13.150
oh this is fucking like impossible.
What's that die?
It was one of the most,

2483
02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:17.290
it was pretty fun actually because I was like,
well,
once I realized I was like,

2484
02:19:17.291 --> 02:19:17.561
okay,

2485
02:19:17.561 --> 02:19:20.500
I'm not going to get to run through this fucking set list that I'm trying to get

2486
02:19:20.501 --> 02:19:24.430
together.
And it's like,
really nobody's paying attention like,

2487
02:19:24.431 --> 02:19:28.310
and then just to start just saying whatever fucked weird shit comes into your

2488
02:19:28.311 --> 02:19:28.700
head.

2489
02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:32.720
<v 6>I did this gig recently in of the worst hell Gig I've done a long time and I did</v>

2490
02:19:32.721 --> 02:19:34.160
look a year ago,
that Twitter thing,

2491
02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:36.680
remember we did it wouldn't dove Dove David off.

2492
02:19:36.681 --> 02:19:40.610
Nick Foun me and was there another person?
There was a post,

2493
02:19:40.611 --> 02:19:42.020
I forget the host's name,
I apologize.

2494
02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:46.100
But it was something for Twitter and they did it in a rock bar and the acoustics

2495
02:19:46.101 --> 02:19:48.020
were the worst acoustics ever.

2496
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:52.580
Every word you said was echoed back and was totally incomprehensible.

2497
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.080
No one had any idea what you were saying.

2498
02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:58.010
There was a very narrow area in the front of the stage where you could talk and

2499
02:19:58.011 --> 02:20:01.430
that's it.
The people in the front of the stage like directly in front of you,

2500
02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:05.270
you know six feet to the left,
six feet to the right.
They can hear you.
Yeah.

2501
02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:08.000
But everyone else on the sides,
it had no idea what the fuck you were saying.

2502
02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.710
I was literally five feet from the stage while,

2503
02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:13.430
while dove was on stage and I couldn't understand a word he was saying

2504
02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:17.120
[inaudible] button just warehouse.
How big was the venue for this?

2505
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:22.070
It was weird cause it's like a night club dance floor.
So the situation,

2506
02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:26.410
it wasn't set up for talking now and then on top of that the whole time doves on

2507
02:20:26.411 --> 02:20:29.630
stage,
they're blowing smoke on.
I'm not kidding.

2508
02:20:29.631 --> 02:20:33.860
Like he's covered in smoke because a band was on beforehand so the smoke is

2509
02:20:33.861 --> 02:20:34.760
blowing down on him.

2510
02:20:34.761 --> 02:20:37.910
You can't hear a word he's fucking saying and is at one point in time we turns

2511
02:20:37.911 --> 02:20:39.530
and looks at me and Nixon and on the side he's like,

2512
02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:44.770
what can fuck is this this kid even be real like it was so spectacularly shitty.

2513
02:20:45.681 --> 02:20:47.180
Lee set up and it just,

2514
02:20:47.181 --> 02:20:49.610
it didn't even seem like it'd be real and through and went up into the same

2515
02:20:49.611 --> 02:20:50.840
thing and then I went up into the same thing,

2516
02:20:50.850 --> 02:20:53.060
which is how we both like people on the side of us.

2517
02:20:53.061 --> 02:20:56.060
We're just looking at us like anyone on the side of you,

2518
02:20:56.061 --> 02:20:58.520
they would just look at you.
They have no idea what the fuck you were saying.

2519
02:20:59.020 --> 02:21:03.740
<v 9>Boone told me one of the craziest fucking stories a couple of weeks ago.</v>

2520
02:21:03.741 --> 02:21:08.420
I can't even do it justice Dick if you're listening,
Collin.
Uh,
no,

2521
02:21:08.421 --> 02:21:12.410
it was just like a nightmare stage story.
Like it blew my fucking mind.

2522
02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:17.440
Like it was in San Francisco and like basically the waitresses all wound up

2523
02:21:17.451 --> 02:21:20.990
getting like the crowd hated him and then like the waitresses were like these

2524
02:21:20.991 --> 02:21:24.230
roller derby ish type Bettie page chicks or whatever.

2525
02:21:24.231 --> 02:21:28.520
And they wound up like rushing him on stage and one like held them down while

2526
02:21:28.521 --> 02:21:32.150
the other one tried to pull his pants down.
It's,
it's honestly,

2527
02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:36.680
it's the most fucked up story I've ever Nick Thune Nick Thune.
Yeah.
Recently,

2528
02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:37.970
a few years ago,

2529
02:21:37.971 --> 02:21:42.240
I think it was in San Francisco because we were talking,

2530
02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:46.670
we got on the topic.
I mean,
I don't mean to,
I hope I'm not fucking being gossipy.

2531
02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:51.200
Uh,
I don't know.
It's weird,
but it was like,
no,

2532
02:21:51.201 --> 02:21:55.520
it wasn't a club,
but he was saying that,
you know,
um,
yeah,

2533
02:21:55.530 --> 02:21:57.420
I don't want to say,
I don't know if it's weird enough,

2534
02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:00.800
but like somebody who books the clubs in,

2535
02:22:00.801 --> 02:22:05.390
in San Francisco was at that show and he's like,
hands.

2536
02:22:05.390 --> 02:22:08.030
I was like,
the biggest nightmare.
He,
you know,

2537
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:11.510
practically got booed off stage and then all these people tried to rape them on

2538
02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.520
onstage.
Wow.
But like,

2539
02:22:13.521 --> 02:22:17.690
so I don't think he gets booked at like the punchline or like he doesn't get

2540
02:22:17.691 --> 02:22:21.920
booked up there and he's like,
wow,
she was at that show where that happened.

2541
02:22:21.921 --> 02:22:25.650
And I don't know,
I guess,
you know,
they're not a fan or I that's weird.
I don't,

2542
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:28.140
cause I'm,
I could be wrong,
but uh,

2543
02:22:28.410 --> 02:22:33.410
but I know it happened in San Francisco at some weird menu and it was the mo and

2544
02:22:34.741 --> 02:22:36.870
I'm forgetting parts.
Like he,

2545
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:41.310
it was a pretty interesting story and I feel bad.

2546
02:22:41.311 --> 02:22:43.650
I was hanging out with nick the other day.
Uh,

2547
02:22:43.850 --> 02:22:48.180
we went and like walked dogs and we're hanging out in the park with the Chelsea

2548
02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:51.270
Peretti too.
And I don't,
we're just all fucking goofing around.

2549
02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:52.950
I forget how it happened,

2550
02:22:52.951 --> 02:22:57.780
but I wound up tweeting congratulations to nick through newest cast member on

2551
02:22:57.781 --> 02:23:02.170
Saturday night live,
but it just totally joking and we,
like,
we decide,

2552
02:23:02.171 --> 02:23:04.580
I don't know,
we were talking about starting a rumor or something.
Right.

2553
02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:08.730
And that fucking thing spiraled out of control so fast.
I feel bad.

2554
02:23:08.731 --> 02:23:09.331
I mean I've taught,

2555
02:23:09.331 --> 02:23:12.990
me and nick have talk cause like he started getting emails and it's this Twitter

2556
02:23:12.991 --> 02:23:16.590
thing is fucking scared.
Like people were saying,
fuck you.
You're not,
no,
no.

2557
02:23:16.591 --> 02:23:19.740
They're saying congratulations.
We always knew you.

2558
02:23:19.741 --> 02:23:23.000
I mean it's just the worst like,
and he's like,
and he's getting,

2559
02:23:23.001 --> 02:23:27.160
he's got to be like,
it's pulled down by Derby bitches.
Well that was a,

2560
02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:31.650
that was years ago.
But yeah,
I feel bad about that little hoax that

2561
02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:34.640
<v 6>Shaffir are.
You should feel went on this a long tour.</v>

2562
02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:37.160
Him and Tripoli and a couple other guys,

2563
02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:40.730
they went on this long tour and after he came back he said one thing for sure I

2564
02:23:40.731 --> 02:23:43.580
learned from this.
No more bars.
That's it.
No more bars.

2565
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:46.130
You said it's not done before but bars.
Yeah,
no more.

2566
02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:48.110
Freddy Soto used to say that.
We still always talk about it,

2567
02:23:48.111 --> 02:23:50.840
that people would offer him gigs and it would go no thank you.

2568
02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:55.930
<v 9>That's me and Stan hope started working together was when we really started</v>

2569
02:23:55.931 --> 02:23:59.120
working together.
The bars.
Yeah,
that's,
I mean,
when he was booking,

2570
02:23:59.121 --> 02:24:01.850
shit just threw my space when he was like,
I'm not working any more clubs.

2571
02:24:01.851 --> 02:24:04.970
They would just put on my space.
If you have a place,
tell me where it is.

2572
02:24:04.971 --> 02:24:08.030
We'll work out a door deal.
And Yeah,
we did.

2573
02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:13.130
We did some fucking shitty place,
like you know,
place with that stages.

2574
02:24:13.131 --> 02:24:17.510
I mean they were all,
it was a fun experience.
But the outside place in Vegas,

2575
02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:20.120
the outside place.

2576
02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:25.040
<v 6>Yeah.
Some dude was shelling,
having shows in his backyard and I did it.</v>

2577
02:24:25.041 --> 02:24:26.000
I don't know if Doug did it,

2578
02:24:26.001 --> 02:24:29.120
but I know a couple of comics like guys would names did it.

2579
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:32.120
I think the guy emailed me or that sounds familiar,
but no,

2580
02:24:32.121 --> 02:24:35.780
I never did this to doing it,
but it was like,
you know what?
I could do the palms.

2581
02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:40.630
Yeah,
why am I doing?
You're crazy in the back yard.
You might be nuts,
man,

2582
02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:45.920
and I'm connected to you.
You fucking crackpot.
But it's a great,
great idea.

2583
02:24:45.921 --> 02:24:49.100
You know,
kid just decide it's going to set up his own comedy club.
He was like,

2584
02:24:49.101 --> 02:24:52.220
you know,
I'll charge 20 bucks at the door.
Everybody's packed into my backyard.

2585
02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:55.790
I've got a stage and a PA and everyone's enthusiastic and we're all drinking

2586
02:24:55.791 --> 02:24:59.660
beer,
other coolers and shit.
Like on paper it sounds awesome.

2587
02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:03.740
But then the other girl who is this crazy ass asshole yeah,

2588
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:05.540
bringing me into his backyard.

2589
02:25:05.650 --> 02:25:08.500
<v 9>And that's kind of the stuff that's a big difference between Doug and I.</v>

2590
02:25:08.501 --> 02:25:12.100
Like he kind of thrives on that shit where it's like a crazy,
insane idea.

2591
02:25:12.101 --> 02:25:13.120
I'm on board and,

2592
02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:15.210
<v 6>well,
I was hanging out at his house back when the,</v>

2593
02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:18.560
the homeless people living on his front porch and then the homeless woman wound

2594
02:25:18.570 --> 02:25:21.960
up Stan,
but stabbing the homeless man and like,
you know,

2595
02:25:21.961 --> 02:25:24.100
and Doug had all these films of her.

2596
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:24.641
<v 5>In one of them,</v>

2597
02:25:24.641 --> 02:25:28.150
she had blood all over her hands after she stabbed her boyfriend and she's

2598
02:25:28.151 --> 02:25:29.560
sitting on her knees.

2599
02:25:29.561 --> 02:25:32.650
So she's kneeling and she's looking at her hands and she goes,
I'm a cunt.

2600
02:25:32.651 --> 02:25:34.750
I'm a whole.
I'm a content,
I'm a whore.
I'm a come to my heart.

2601
02:25:34.930 --> 02:25:38.350
She's saying on this craziest while she's got this guy's blood on her hands and

2602
02:25:38.351 --> 02:25:41.920
they take him away and you know,
he has to go get stitched up and he survives.

2603
02:25:41.921 --> 02:25:44.110
But he's got,
you got fucking stab,
you know,

2604
02:25:44.111 --> 02:25:47.610
and she goes to jail and these were people live in on Doug Front porch.

2605
02:25:47.611 --> 02:25:51.040
She just had them homeless people or audio tape.
I'd hang out with them.

2606
02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:53.880
I'd go over Doug's house to drag and be like me and Doug and say,

2607
02:25:53.950 --> 02:25:56.470
you know a couple of friends.
It's a fucking homeless people so far.

2608
02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:01.180
It was so weird.
He's so,
I mean he invites the chaos,
but I think God damn dude,

2609
02:26:01.181 --> 02:26:03.880
I understand what you're doing,
but fuck,
just homeless,

2610
02:26:03.881 --> 02:26:05.290
stabbing festivals and you're from

2611
02:26:05.340 --> 02:26:08.860
<v 9>four.
That's I,
yeah,
but that's a perfect example of like,
yeah,</v>

2612
02:26:09.130 --> 02:26:13.440

Yeah.
Cause I'm like,
ah,

2613
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:16.140
Yeah.
But I do try to,
you know,

2614
02:26:16.141 --> 02:26:20.250
sometimes it does make me think twice before knee jerk go and fuck that shit.

2615
02:26:20.251 --> 02:26:23.130
That sounds retarded.
I'm like,
well wait a minute.

2616
02:26:24.270 --> 02:26:25.710
What if I do like,
I don't know.

2617
02:26:25.711 --> 02:26:28.710
Let's fucking live a little and see what fucking happens.
You know,

2618
02:26:28.711 --> 02:26:33.480
I'll go do some weird backyard show or I'll get in a car with some guy hires,

You guys are,
you know,
like people want to hang out after the show.

2621
02:26:40.430 --> 02:26:41.910
Usually it's like,
I'm just going to walk back

2622
02:26:41.930 --> 02:26:43.020
<v 5>some towns,
you know,</v>

2623
02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:46.680
Austin's the best for meeting people and hanging out after the show.

2624
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:47.371
I remember Brian,

2625
02:26:47.371 --> 02:26:50.760

The crazy dude was his whole face tattooed and his tongue split down the middle.

2629
02:27:03.361 --> 02:27:06.720
He does like freaking enigma.

The one that takes all your shit together.
Evernote.
Evernote.
Evernote.
Okay.

2693
02:30:55.720 --> 02:30:58.180
I want to say end gadget for some strange reason.
Gadget.

2694
02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:02.600
<v 11>Uh,
that</v>

2695
02:31:04.220 --> 02:31:07.640
<v 5>trust fund kid who just wants to look like [inaudible] could be just some dude</v>

2696
02:31:07.641 --> 02:31:09.670
is broken there.
I like that.
Did you,
have you,

2697
02:31:09.671 --> 02:31:12.970
have you been watching that celebrity rehab zoo?
This one kid now,

2698
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:16.250
one of the kids is a billionaire's son,
really celebrity,

2699
02:31:16.251 --> 02:31:19.550
but he's the poor kids walked up on heroin and all kinds of shit.
Just,

2700
02:31:19.860 --> 02:31:24.030
he's just a physical wreck and just rebels.
Just chaos,
you know?
Yeah.

2701
02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:27.600
That could easily be a cat person.
The same shit.
I mean,
you just,

2702
02:31:27.601 --> 02:31:29.670
you start down that road.
Next thing you know,

2703
02:31:29.671 --> 02:31:32.190
you're screwing spikes in your fucking forehead.

2704
02:31:32.310 --> 02:31:34.050
<v 9>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2705
02:31:37.820 --> 02:31:40.790
<v 5>Wish I was a trusted on kid.
Do you?
I know one,</v>

2706
02:31:41.060 --> 02:31:45.890
he's a week condo of a man.
Just a shell and I don't say kinds of a man,

2707
02:31:45.891 --> 02:31:49.820
like he's a bad guy.
He's actually a nice guy and he has,

2708
02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:53.600
it has nothing.
He has no drive.
He has,

2709
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:56.660
he's always got this idea of doing things and nothing ever gets done.

2710
02:31:56.661 --> 02:31:57.494
Every business venture

2711
02:31:57.590 --> 02:32:02.340
<v 9>I have that I don't have a giant safety net.
He's got no care.
Yeah.</v>

2712
02:32:02.570 --> 02:32:03.790
<v 5>Just there's,
you know,</v>

2713
02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:07.990
I think human beings need a certain amount of tasks and accomplishing those

2714
02:32:07.991 --> 02:32:11.110
tasks gives you confidence and that confidence gives you a better understanding

2715
02:32:11.111 --> 02:32:13.900
of yourself and your capabilities and what you can accomplish in this life.

2716
02:32:14.140 --> 02:32:15.910
And people who've never had to accomplish anything,

2717
02:32:15.911 --> 02:32:17.290
they've never had to pull her own weight.

2718
02:32:17.291 --> 02:32:19.570
They've never had to make something out of nothing.

2719
02:32:19.571 --> 02:32:22.540
They've never had to go out and achieve and get something done.

2720
02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:25.750
Those people who have no connection to life,
they're just adrift.

2721
02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:28.540
They're just loose and everything's come to them and they don't understand,

2722
02:32:28.930 --> 02:32:32.760
you know,
and then they,
they,
they just,
they have no purpose.
No meaning.
It's a,

2723
02:32:32.810 --> 02:32:37.180
it's a fucking,
it's a weird thing that we,
as,
as,
as beings,

2724
02:32:37.181 --> 02:32:38.980
as human beings have to realize,

2725
02:32:38.981 --> 02:32:42.910
is that we have a certain amount of requirements.
We require physical touch.

2726
02:32:42.910 --> 02:32:46.750
We have to have it.
We have to be,
you'll be depressed if you don't have,
you know,

2727
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:47.621
not even just sex,

2728
02:32:47.621 --> 02:32:51.730
but hugging and affection and being around loved ones like that's all required.

2729
02:32:51.731 --> 02:32:54.820
What's required of your biology?
You need to be able to blow out stress.

2730
02:32:54.821 --> 02:32:57.820
You have to,
you have to have some sort of physical exercise.

2731
02:32:57.821 --> 02:32:59.080
If you have a physical body,

2732
02:32:59.290 --> 02:33:03.730
your body is basically the same fucking hardware as people that live thousands

2733
02:33:03.730 --> 02:33:06.130
and thousands of years ago and needed to run away from wolves and to fight off

2734
02:33:06.131 --> 02:33:09.040
fucking,
you know,
angry tribes coming over the hill.
I mean,

2735
02:33:09.041 --> 02:33:11.770
there's a lot of shit that was required of our bodies back then.

2736
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:13.800
It's basically the same hardware you've got to,

2737
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:17.170
except all those things like people have to do in order to manage your life

2738
02:33:17.171 --> 02:33:19.810
correctly.
You really have to look at all those things and say like,

2739
02:33:19.811 --> 02:33:22.630
these are all requirements.
This is,
this needs to be met.
You know,

2740
02:33:22.631 --> 02:33:25.480
like priests going crazy.
You want to fucking kids,
Hey,
guess what?

2741
02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:28.040
Your body has a sexual requirement.
You've got to take care of it.

2742
02:33:28.041 --> 02:33:30.640
If you can't even masturbate,
yeah,
you're going to go nuts.

2743
02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:33.520
You're going to go nutty and stick it in anything warm.
You're fucking,

2744
02:33:33.521 --> 02:33:34.354
you're sick.

2745
02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:37.020
<v 9>And that's what I was taught when I was talking about the nuns earlier when I</v>

2746
02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:40.230
called them dikes around.
I don't have anything against dikes,
but it's,

2747
02:33:40.231 --> 02:33:44.220
that's what it was.
They're repressed.
Yeah.
Like,
yeah,
they can't,
you know,

2748
02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:47.730
they can't even rub one out without feeling dad about it.
Port Fox.

2749
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:50.550
So instead they just screaming your kids' faces.

2750
02:33:50.660 --> 02:33:52.580
<v 5>And the problem is once it religion gets started,</v>

2751
02:33:52.581 --> 02:33:57.020
it's so fucking difficult to stop.
It's so easy to keep on going.
You know,

2752
02:33:57.021 --> 02:34:00.530
it's real easy to like for,
you know,
if,
if Catholics,

2753
02:34:00.531 --> 02:34:01.610
if it wasn't Catholic priests,

2754
02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:05.960
it wasn't like a certain percentage wasn't like 10% it was 100% of all of them

2755
02:34:05.961 --> 02:34:06.794
were raping kids.

2756
02:34:07.490 --> 02:34:11.420
100% of people would still argue for the Catholic church who would say,

2757
02:34:11.421 --> 02:34:15.200
but they do so much good work and they're so good with the homeless and they,

2758
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:18.010
<v 9>my sister is not pay to that part.</v>

2759
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:21.130
<v 5>Let's just focus on,
even if there was 100% of them,</v>

2760
02:34:21.131 --> 02:34:23.080
people are so committed to it that they would still,

2761
02:34:23.081 --> 02:34:26.290
there's still people who'd be willing to go to church.
Oh God.
Yeah.

2762
02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:29.440
I mean even it was 100% of all priests proven.
They all,

2763
02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:34.870
you know.
Right.
Don't you think cross the board so hard to stop.

2764
02:34:34.871 --> 02:34:37.630
One getting one started once they get started.
You know,

2765
02:34:37.631 --> 02:34:40.510
it's easy to like ridicule Scientology like,
oh my goodness.

2766
02:34:40.511 --> 02:34:43.870
It was remade by a science fiction author in the 1950s hot.

2767
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.710
Isn't that better information than these fucking monkeys that wrote this shit

2768
02:34:50.711 --> 02:34:53.620
down on animal skins and they'll come on stupid.

2769
02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:58.340
Yeah.
I'll start a fucking religion.
We need to start a religion.

2770
02:34:58.370 --> 02:35:01.240
Steric divert difficult to start a new one though.
It's very hard.

2771
02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:03.520
You can look wherever we were looking at the,
um,

2772
02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:06.960
the pilgrimage around the mosque,
around,
um,
uh,

2773
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.080
Mecca or see when there's a,

2774
02:35:09.130 --> 02:35:13.180
like this box like structure and they all walk around it and they all were like

2775
02:35:13.330 --> 02:35:15.300
traditional robes.
It's really crazy.
Yeah.

2776
02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:18.280
It's really strange to watch and know there's thousands and thousands of people

2777
02:35:18.281 --> 02:35:20.890
walking around.
But what I was saying,
when I,
when I first saw it,
I was like,

2778
02:35:20.891 --> 02:35:23.470
if this was new,
if this was a new religion,

2779
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.340
wouldn't you be shitting your pants if all of a sudden there were some new

2780
02:35:27.341 --> 02:35:30.820
religion where everybody wore robes and they had a super secret box.

2781
02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:34.150
It was in the middle of Saudi Arabia and they all walked around it.

2782
02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:35.740
We would be for Rican.

2783
02:35:35.741 --> 02:35:39.000
The fuck out they would do would be 24 hour coverage on CNN.

2784
02:35:39.010 --> 02:35:43.060
They're still circling the box,
no word yet as to what's going on inside the box.

2785
02:35:43.390 --> 02:35:47.070
What does the box represent?
My,
well,
we're not exactly sure.
There's a unit,

2786
02:35:47.100 --> 02:35:50.290
there's different accounts.
Some folks say that's where Muhammad is buried,

2787
02:35:50.291 --> 02:35:53.600
and some say it's not.
It could be some sort of a sacred media.
Right.

2788
02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:58.470
And we would be terrified.
We would like Waco.

2789
02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:01.960
You know what I mean?
It's really like some new super Waco sort of a situation,

2790
02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:04.030
but because of the fact that it's been around a long time,

2791
02:36:04.031 --> 02:36:07.330
we just sort of accept it.
You know?
It's interesting,
man.
It's interesting.

2792
02:36:07.331 --> 02:36:10.090
We were,
we're cool with shit.
As long as it's always been like that.

2793
02:36:10.091 --> 02:36:14.380
Even if it's fucking ridiculous,
if it's complete total nonsense,

2794
02:36:14.470 --> 02:36:15.820
as long as it's already exists,

2795
02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:18.190
we sort of just go with whatever we see around us.

2796
02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.150
Like those ladies in Africa that,

2797
02:36:20.151 --> 02:36:23.550
that cut their lips and then stretch their lips calculates and,

2798
02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:26.320
and the larger the plate is just now,

2799
02:36:26.321 --> 02:36:30.910
finally in like 2009 2010 2011 finally hipsters,

2800
02:36:30.911 --> 02:36:34.570
they're starting.
Women are starting to not do that.
They are right.

2801
02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:39.820
Have you ever seen one person in America?
We have the plate lip lip plate.
No.

2802
02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:42.670
That's the way they do it in Africa.
It's a serious commitment.
Yes,

2803
02:36:42.671 --> 02:36:47.671
a smash out your bottom teeth and the women next stretching ladies too.

2804
02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:52.570
That's crazy man,
because you can't take that shit off.
Now thinking about that,

2805
02:36:52.571 --> 02:36:54.760
it's an Africa.
How hot is Africa?

2806
02:36:54.761 --> 02:36:59.761
Hot and sticky and sweaty and bugs are in those little metal bars and dirt and

2807
02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:03.340
fucking stray loads because you're a girl for sure.

2808
02:37:03.341 --> 02:37:07.420
Some straight loads made the way to that metal.
Right?

2809
02:37:07.570 --> 02:37:10.950
If you're some crazy African lady with the long neck for sure.

2810
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:14.530
Want to do it is thinking I am going to face fuck this shit out.
This bitch.

2811
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:19.160
Look at all that neck.
She just swallowed my Dick.
No problem at all.

2812
02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:22.250
So there's all that and you can't even take them off to wash them because if you

2813
02:37:22.251 --> 02:37:25.100
take them off your head where your head will fall right off,
he'll die.

2814
02:37:25.180 --> 02:37:29.630
Break your spiders.
So shit,
people are nuts.
Speaking Africa stuff.

2815
02:37:29.631 --> 02:37:33.800
I just noticed the trilogy of terror doll.
Yeah,
I got that from Bobby Slayton.

2816
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.700
Oh yeah.

2817
02:37:34.700 --> 02:37:38.060
Bobby Slayton had one of the first Internet radio shows long before the Joe

2818
02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:41.300
Rogan experience podcast back in the day.
Bobby Slayton.
There was some,

2819
02:37:41.420 --> 02:37:44.210
some weird company that was trying,
I mean,
this is like the 90s,

2820
02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:46.340
they were trying to create a,

2821
02:37:46.341 --> 02:37:50.120
an Internet radio station because people have the radio at work and you could

2822
02:37:50.121 --> 02:37:51.410
listen while you're at work or whatever.

2823
02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:55.040
And so they hired a bunch of comics and I forget what it was called,
but they,
uh,

2824
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:57.650
you know,
Bobby Slayton had the best show on it and he had,
you know,
like,

2825
02:37:58.030 --> 02:38:01.100
it was basically the Bobby Slayton show,
but it was on,
you know,
on the Internet.

2826
02:38:01.140 --> 02:38:03.380
It'll tell you ahead way,
way,
way ahead of its time.

2827
02:38:03.381 --> 02:38:06.710
And bandwidth was like super expensive and dial,
couldn't figure it out.
Yeah.

2828
02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:10.850
They figure out a way to,
you know,
to,
to monetize it.
I think,
you know,

2829
02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:16.060
I think I was using dial up up until like 2000 really again with the whole,

2830
02:38:17.481 --> 02:38:19.850
like,
I'm not technologically,

2831
02:38:19.851 --> 02:38:24.220
I don't give a shit like 2000,
2011.

2832
02:38:24.290 --> 02:38:25.190
<v 1>I love him.
And that wasn't easy.</v>

2833
02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:27.800
I was probably using dab up in 2000 until you're really worried.

2834
02:38:28.430 --> 02:38:32.150
It seems like 2000,
2000,
2001,
2000.
I had

2835
02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:36.490
<v 5>uh,
definitely had,
uh,
not I,
I might've had ISD in 2000.</v>

2836
02:38:36.850 --> 02:38:40.660
No,
no I didn't.
I had to take one line at a t one line

2837
02:38:42.270 --> 02:38:45.640
cause I couldn't get,
couldn't get ISD in up here.
Oh I couldn't get,

2838
02:38:45.641 --> 02:38:49.660
rather I couldn't get cable and I couldn't get DSL so I got a t one line until

2839
02:38:49.661 --> 02:38:52.930
they get DSL up here.
So I had some ridiculous Internet connection up here.

2840
02:38:53.770 --> 02:38:58.600
Like a business connection that you use for like an office building
I had to get,

2841
02:38:58.601 --> 02:39:00.190
it was the only thing I could get.
It was high speed.

2842
02:39:00.340 --> 02:39:04.540
That was my a game addiction days dude,
for sure.
For sure.

2843
02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:08.140
They're coming up with this new way of broadcasting,

2844
02:39:08.141 --> 02:39:12.370
wireless Internet that that goes through light spectrums.
Have you heard of this?

2845
02:39:12.430 --> 02:39:14.080
I've heard of it.
Wow.

2846
02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:17.800
Just like how wireless Internet goes through radio spectrum.

2847
02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:22.330
This goes through a light spectrum.
Wrap your fucking head around that.

2848
02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:25.260
They're their wireless Internet through life,

2849
02:39:25.350 --> 02:39:26.760
<v 1>but you knew what you already have.</v>

2850
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:29.250
We know you can do Internet through power lines,
you know,

2851
02:39:29.251 --> 02:39:32.310
power line adapters and stuff like that.
So there's nothing really too crazy.

2852
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:34.500
It's just like you have,
you plug in,

2853
02:39:34.501 --> 02:39:38.160
one plug is your internet and then you know on the other side of the house you

2854
02:39:38.161 --> 02:39:40.770
have the other side of the Internet.
It just runs through your power lines.

2855
02:39:41.340 --> 02:39:44.340
Brendan Walsh was tickled.
I have to Piss.
So yeah,
I've been,
I could see it.

2856
02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:48.570
I can see the way you're moving fella.
Well,
an expert on shit to 45 just saying.

2857
02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:49.730
Should we just wrap this pitch out?

2858
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:52.790
He's probably just around this rap as Bishop Brennan.
Where is it?

2859
02:39:52.810 --> 02:39:55.050
Where can people see you next man?
Uh,

2860
02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:59.460
tonight at the Improv lab tomorrow.
What time does the Improv lab,

2861
02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:01.860
I think the show starts at eight 38 30.

2862
02:40:01.861 --> 02:40:04.740
And then tomorrow we'll be on the eight o'clock show at the Improv.

2863
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:08.760
And if you're in New York,
I mean you go to my website,
Brendan walsh.com.

2864
02:40:08.761 --> 02:40:12.580
B R e n d o n w a l s.
H.
A.

2865
02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:14.300
And I'm going to be taping

2866
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:16.980
<v 2>a couple episodes of the John Oliver show.
What's that work?</v>

2867
02:40:17.790 --> 02:40:21.010
So you know the guy from the daily show,
John Oliver,
the English dude.
Okay.

2868
02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:25.100
Correspondent.
He has,
he's a stand up and he has his own stat.

2869
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:26.400
It's like John Oliver and friends.

2870
02:40:26.401 --> 02:40:29.850
So you come down to host this show and then there's like four comics come out

2871
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:33.390
and do like 10 minutes.
Is this a comedy central show?
Comedy Central.
Yeah.

2872
02:40:33.391 --> 02:40:36.630
And there is,
if you go to my website,
there's a link.
If it's this week,

2873
02:40:36.631 --> 02:40:41.250
this coming weekend,
uh,
the 14th 15th and 16th you can,

2874
02:40:41.610 --> 02:40:44.490
there's a link on my front page where you can go get free tickets.

2875
02:40:44.491 --> 02:40:45.600
If you want to go to the taping.

2876
02:40:45.601 --> 02:40:49.160
It's on the Nyu campus and then I'll be in a good way.

2877
02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:52.240
<v 1>Bananas and Cincinnati.
February 10th,</v>

2878
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:56.230
<v 2>13th and a Sun Valley,
Idaho.</v>

2879
02:40:56.600 --> 02:40:59.090
<v 1>I think I did go bananas in Cincinnati.
I'm pretty sure I did.</v>

2880
02:40:59.510 --> 02:41:03.110
You say Cincinnati is a weird one,
didn't I?
I didn't know.

2881
02:41:03.111 --> 02:41:06.120
I don't think it was go bananas.
I think you did the clubs.
Doug,

2882
02:41:06.130 --> 02:41:09.930
I know work you did with Ra.
There was,

2883
02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:14.980
cause there was a a a show there once there was a UFC in Cincinnati is a weird

2884
02:41:15.051 --> 02:41:17.960
place.
We have to land in Kentucky and they called the Cincinnati airport.

2885
02:41:18.510 --> 02:41:21.170
It's in Kentucky.
Yeah.
That's trip.

2886
02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:24.590
And that's the a Cincinnati funny bone is actually in Kentucky.

2887
02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:27.040
They call it the one that we would not be fulfilling.
Yeah.

2888
02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:29.720
I went to go bananas to once power.

2889
02:41:30.170 --> 02:41:34.670
There's a long Benson's favorite [inaudible] some reason it's a really small

2890
02:41:34.671 --> 02:41:38.480
club man.
Yeah,
it's,
it's uh,
yeah.
I don't know what it holds too.

2891
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:41.520
It's like a basement sort of a,
yeah.
It's got a crucial,

2892
02:41:41.540 --> 02:41:45.770
I mean the name go bananas doesn't do it justice.
I did it with Chris Mcguire.

2893
02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:47.990
That's how I did it with Brian Long ass time ago.

2894
02:41:47.991 --> 02:41:49.970
And then the next time I came I did the funny bone.

2895
02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:51.980
<v 2>Cool.
I think,</v>

2896
02:41:52.970 --> 02:41:57.080
<v 1>fuck am I talking about February 10th through 13th I'll be at the funny bone and</v>

2904
02:42:21.171 --> 02:42:26.050

If Joey Diaz doesn't pull a Joey Diaz.
Yeah.

2905
02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:29.480
Like you did the other night at Sal's.
We were all at Sal's.

Brendan was at sales as well,

2907

A fucking national treasure.
Funniest,

funniest man ever walked the face of the planet.
