James Steward: We wanted to answer the question of why an individual work of art matters.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.280 position:98%
-- why someone who isn’t a specialist in the discipline ought to find something engaging, how does it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.750 position:98%
relate to its moment, how does it speak to the career output of the artist in question distinct

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.500 position:98%
from it being simply an object in a vacuum? I think one of the real challenges in contending with

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.350 position:98%
art from the past, especially from cultures that seem quite remote from our own, is the challenge

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.460 position:97%
of bringing the original work of art back to life. And instead of simply talking or telling people

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.510 position:98%
verbally about the extent to which European artists re-engaged with the ancient world to consider

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.550 position:98%
how to represent the human form, we’re actually showing it. So, we’re juxtaposing a great anonymous

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.840 position:98%
painting of St. Sebastian with a second-century Roman torso to make very direct that sense of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.980 position:97%
causality that there was indeed a formal relationship between these objects. Not only is there

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.840 position:97%
intellectual value in doing this, but we can do it because of the sheer breadth and depth of the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.350 position:97%
collections. So that right now you will find, for instance, our great Vincent Van Gogh painting of

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.090 position:98%
the “Tarascon Diligence” hung with two Japanese prints as companions to say something about how

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.610 position:63%
Van Gogh was drawing visual inspiration.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.020 position:97%
Caroline Harris: Last year, when we re-hung these galleries, we decided to do them in a way that we’d never done before.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.230 position:97%
We wanted to integrate, with the paintings and sculptures, works on paper and works of decorative art.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.520 position:97%
The 19th-century painters like Monet, like Van Gogh, were fascinated by Japanese prints.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.040 position:97%
These began to enter the Paris market in the mid-19th century when Japan opened up to trade with the West,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.650 position:97%
and both Monet and Van Gogh collected Japanese prints as well as many other artists at the time. In the Van Gogh

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.149 position:98%
you can see the influence of Japanese prints in several ways. In Japanese prints, of the sort they were collecting,

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.420 position:98%
you often find interesting viewpoints onto a scene. So, here you kind of have a “bird’s-eye view”

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.330 position:97%
down into the space, and then it pushes up and telescopes away from you.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.040 position:97%
Christopher Heuer: James’ approach is one that is going to make the museum not just kind of more accessible,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.080 position:97%
more marketable, but will do what museums across the country, across the world are being forced to do now,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.010 position:97%
which is make art relevant to the present day in a way that’s more than kind of superficial. That’s always

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.230 position:98%
been something we try to talk to students about, but James is also been crucial in opening up the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.640 position:97%
museum to more than just the University community. These kind of comparisons he’s drawn are just

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.720
one way to do that.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.390 position:97%
James Steward: We have certainly been opening ourselves out much more substantially I think in the last couple of years.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.870 position:98%
We began our first ever evening hours …we now keep the galleries open every Thursday evening until ten o’clock.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.890 position:98%
Those evenings are often heavily programmed with things that are again intended to create entry points into

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.080 position:98%
thinking about the visual arts. That might be film screenings, it might be concerts, it might be gallery talks. But

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.890 position:97%
again something that opens out the world of art to someone who doesn’t self-define as an expert.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.030 position:97%
My view is that every art museum is by definition (or should be) a teaching museum. Through looking at

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.270 position:97%
a broad array of let’s call them cultural artifacts, we can get a better understanding about the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.640 position:97%
impulses of a culture at any given point in the past. And we’re encouraging students and other

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.010 position:97%
visitors to make these direct connections to see linkages and to re-awaken a sense of: How would

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.850 position:97%
this have been viewed in the time that it was created, and what were the factors in society that

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.050 position:98%
gave rise? Why do paintings or any other works of art look the way they look?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.150 position:98%
Caroline Harris: This is a portrait of Jean Cocteau by Modigliani and it shows the translation into his

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.830 position:98%
painting of the aesthetics of African sculpture. We have these heddle pulleys (these are actually instruments

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.550 position:97%
used in weaving) in association with the Modigliani because this is exactly the sort of African art that

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.010 position:97%
he was looking at and was interested in. And when you look at the treatment of the face -- the way

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.040 position:97%
that the eyebrow is related to the nose, the elongation of the face and the chin, and the somewhat

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.030 position:97%
diamond shaped mouth -- all of those stylizations of the features really resonate with the African

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.270
objects that he was interested in.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.740 position:97%
James Steward: All work was at some point contemporary. We forget this in a certain way,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.580 position:98%
and I think that this “period-eye” approach to creating a deeper sense of both historical and visual context is

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:17.360 position:98%
a way of trying to get at that. And all of this combines, we hope, to create a more accessible approach to very

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.620 position:98%
rich content no matter what one’s background is, whether it’s a Princeton student who has come here to study in a

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.070 position:97%
field that has absolutely nothing to do with the history of art, or, indeed, a member of the community

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.340 position:98%
for whom museum-going may not be something they’ve traditionally experienced.
