00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.110
- It's my honor to
introduce our next speaker,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.713
Doctor Paul Glassman.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.340
Doctor Glassman is a
professor of dental practice,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.610
director of community oral health,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.210
and director of the Pacific
Center for Special Care

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.680
at the University of the Pacific

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.653
Arthur Dugoni School of
Dentistry in San Francisco.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.410
He's also the director of a
California statewide task force

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.050
on oral health for people
with disabilities and aging.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.860
And he's served on many national panels,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.720
including the IOM Committee on

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.640
Oral Health Access to Services,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.050
which produced the IOM report

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.600
on improving access to oral healthcare

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.570
for vulnerable and underserved populations

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.025
and the board of directors
of the Denta Quest Institute.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:56.940
Doctor Glassman is well known for

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.700
his innovative work in dental healthcare.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.740
We look forward to hearing

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.100
what's the latest in this area today.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.163
Doctor Glassman.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.280
(crowd applauding)

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.113
- Great, thank you.

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.640
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.323
So, dental care.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.100
Not optional, even though, as you heard,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.010
our Medicaid system seems to think it is.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.240
And California has eliminated
adult dental benefits

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.640
at a time of a recession
and now brought them back.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.650
So, we're now actually in an era

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.570
where we've got full benefits

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.410
in our Medicaid program for dentistry,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.490
which is different than most other states.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.173
Most other states still don't.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.540
But we still have a dental system

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.430
that's not working very well,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.740
and I'll give you some
information about that,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.290
not working very well for most people,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.360
and not working very well for people

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.830
with developmental
disabilities in particular.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.110
So, first of all, disclosures.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.253
Nothing to disclose.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.180
For people with
developmental disabilities,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.560
these are the main issues,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.080
in terms of people getting dental care.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.280
One is the ability to actually access

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.940
and have dental care
done in a dental office.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.100
Access is an issue, sometimes,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.920
because of the large number of people

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.590
who may be on low income, on Medicaid,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.500
and who can't find a dentist

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.170
willing to accept someone on Medicaid.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.950
Let alone someone who's gonna take

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.103
more time and effort to treat.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.950
For some dentists, the
complex health histories

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.480
and not being familiar
with how to navigate

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.840
all of the consultations

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.840
and all of the
considerations, is a barrier.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.630
And the major thing, though,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.110
is actually the ability to
apply preventative procedures.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.510
Dental disease is among

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.810
the most preventable of all diseases.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.100
And yet, we have rampant dental disease

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.800
among large portions of the population.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.580
So, I'm gonna spend just a couple minutes,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.710
really, quickly, with
sort of a big overview

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.320
of what's happening in
the dental industry now.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.810
So, I think it lends some context

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.680
to innovations in dental care.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.160
And you'll see why these
innovations, I think,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.739
are critical for the future.

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.490
So, one is just the fact that we spend

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.710
lots of money in the United
States on dental care.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.970
This is the CMS projections
of how much was spent

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.450
back in 2000 up to 2025.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.360
A 300% projected increase
up to $200 billion.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.567
That's with a B.

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:20.909
$200 billion spent on dental care.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.610
And a lot of people think
even that 200 billion,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.870
that's actually still a small percentage

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.900
of our total national
healthcare expenditures,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.020
which was about four and a half trillion.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.060
Our policymakers don't
pay very much attention

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.030
to dental care for that reason.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.820
But, in fact, dental care is
a bigger business than that.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.890
If you compare dentistry with

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.959
everything else combine
together, it's about 4 or 5%.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.790
But, if you look at our
natural expenditures

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.700
by disease condition,
dental care is number three.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.150
We spend more money on dental care

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.350
than we do on mental
disorders, cancer, COPD,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.460
every other condition
except for just a couple.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.373
So, it's actually, really,

00:03:54.373 --> 00:03:56.163
a very big business in our country.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.750
But the fact that we spend all that money,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.060
I think, as most people know,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.770
doesn't translate into most people

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.250
having access to dental care
or having good dental health.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.850
In fact, if you just look at
basic utilization numbers,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.820
this is data from the
American Dental Association,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.330
the highest utilizers of dental services,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.830
and this is across the income spectrum.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.500
The highest utilizers of
dental services are children.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.110
And, for children, it's
still less than half

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.780
of the children in the country
actually get dental services.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.260
The marker here is a very low bar.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.350
It's an annual dental visit.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.290
It doesn't mean people
had all their needs met

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.940
or they had good dental health.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.099
Just means they interacted with

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.840
the dental care system
once during the year.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.690
So, even the highest utilizers, children,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.210
less than half the children in the country

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.980
have even an annual dental visit.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.720
About 43% of seniors

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.300
and only about 1/3 of working age adults.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.140
So you can see the dental care system

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.260
is not reaching most people.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.259
And, if you were to do this,

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.420
get other slides that I had
but didn't put in today,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.050
show that the lower your income are,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.490
these numbers drop drastically,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.640
so that low income children,
about 33% low income seniors,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.953
it's only about 20% of
those working age adults

00:04:59.953 --> 00:05:02.710
who are actually getting
any kind of dental services.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.780
So, by my calculations,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.340
200 million people in the United States

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.270
are not getting dental services.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.220
We have a dental industry

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.250
that is primarily serving the wealthiest

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.430
and healthiest people in the country.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.253
I think far different than
the general healthcare system.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.120
So, that's one bit of data.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.510
So, the macroeconomics
of the dental care system

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.650
in the country, which, by my
view, is failing miserably

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.390
to provide dental care to the population

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.940
of people in the United States.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.920
What's interesting, though, actually,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.480
if you look at the
utilization of dental services

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.140
in the Medicaid program, nationally,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.130
by looking at people with
developmental disabilities,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.520
they tend to actually have higher

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.480
utilization than other people.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.960
Now, it's still not good.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.440
But, tend to be higher utilization.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.560
This is the data from a report
that was recently released,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.990
showing, if you look at the
two bars on the left side,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.680
these are diagnostic
preventative services.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.660
The yellow bars are those with
developmental disabilities.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.400
The blue bars are those without.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.090
More people with developmental
disabilities tend to get,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.900
at least, than other people
in the Medicaid system,

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.270
diagnostic preventative services.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.330
And the other little blip says
adjunctive general services.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.100
These are services that
are associated, generally,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.380
with people having
dental care at a hospital

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.510
or under general anesthesia.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.750
So, it's sort of puzzling to me

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.150
why is it those numbers look good,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.640
when I think everyone
in this room would agree

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.500
that dental service is probably
the number one unmet need

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.740
or if you ask people or caregivers

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.500
or people in developmental
disability systems

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.610
what's the biggest problem you have?

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.450
It's often getting dental care for people.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.590
And I'm not sure what the answer is.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.220
Although, I think you have people

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.470
who are in a system where
there are caregivers,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.310
where there are people

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.300
who are bringing them to dental offices.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.073
But I think what we find
is, in dental offices,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.990
the right things to keep people healthy

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.210
are not necessarily being done

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.410
because of all the challenges

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.120
that we talked about a few minutes ago.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.180
So, let's talk now about a few things

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.450
that are happening that
I would call innovations.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.800
Or at least changes in
thinking about dental care

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.533
across the dental industry.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.139
And one of the reasons I wanna give

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.950
a little more background to this idea

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.540
of disruptive innovation.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.100
The dental industry is an industry that

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.599
is ripe for disruptive innovation.

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.080
How many of you have
heard this term before?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.580
Disruptive innovation?

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.190
This guy, Clayton Christensen,
who wrote these books

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.160
and, actually, a bunch of others,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.550
is a professor of business at Harvard.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.850
And he's one of these people that

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.410
gets $10,000 a day to speak
to Fortune 500 companies.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.450
I've been trying to get that job,

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.919
but, so far, no one's offered it to me.

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.100
But he talks about his idea
of disruptive innovation.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.590
He talks about companies.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.620
In this case, we'll
translate it to companies

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.260
or industries or, for this
particular presentation,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.160
I'm talking about the dental industry.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.590
Sometimes companies
tend to innovate faster

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.610
than their customers' needs evolve.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.760
That they can start to
produce products or services

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.650
that are actually too
sophisticated, too complicated,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.950
and too expensive for many
customers in their markets.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.170
And companies continue to do this

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.370
even after their customer
base starts to drop off,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.330
because, historically, that's
how they made the most money

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.190
is by having more bells and whistles,

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.300
adding more expensive products.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.120
But the problem is, when
companies persist in doing that

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.300
at a time when they outstrip
their customers' demands,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.653
needs, and ability to access services,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.010
they unwittingly open a door
to disruptive innovation.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.080
He talks about disruptive innovations

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.270
as a whole new product or service

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.960
comes in at the bottom of the market

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.610
and begins to take over
and eventually begins to

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.440
disrupt the market so that you get people

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.770
who now were, historically,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.540
unable to access those service, now can.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.310
So, there's lots of examples
in the US industries.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.570
The automobile industry,

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.250
where the American
automobile manufacturers

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.163
were making these block
long cars back in the 1980s.

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.680
And then the Japanese
automobile manufacturers came in

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.940
with low cost Toyotas.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.480
Very low cost, very high
quality, good gas mileage.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.120
And practically put the
US automobile industry

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.953
out of business.

00:08:53.953 --> 00:08:56.000
The computer industries,
where IBM was making

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.520
these very expensive mainframe computers.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.240
And then the Apple laptop
almost put them out of business.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.860
And what we have is a dental industry

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.600
where the dental industry has continued

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.780
to develop fantastic innovations.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.490
Implants and veneers
and all kinds of things

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.430
that most people in the
country can't afford,

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.970
don't need, and don't have access to.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.300
And so, it's an industry that has

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.211
actually positioned itself now,

00:09:22.211 --> 00:09:24.180
that's really ripe for
disruptive innovation.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.900
For different ways of thinking about

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.850
how do you get dental health to people.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.190
So, one of the things that's a new way

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.900
of thinking about dental care

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.740
is a shift in thinking
about dental disease

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.430
being amenable to acute
surgical interventions

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.380
as opposed to thinking
about dental diseases

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.840
as chronic diseases that really require

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.440
a system of chronic disease management,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.990
like is so prevalent in managing

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.010
other medical chronic diseases.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.100
So, what am I talking about here?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.620
I'm talking about our two major diseases,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.010
dental caries and periodontal disease,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.600
are both chronic diseases.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.870
Chronic diseases, in the sense

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.390
that diabetes is a chronic disease.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.060
You go to your physician's office.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.290
And your physician doesn't fix
your diabetes today, right?

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.090
You go to a dental office and
you got a hole in a tooth,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.840
the dentist puts a filing
in that hole in that tooth.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.050
That does actually not fix
the dental caries disease

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.140
that caused the whole tooth to
be there in the first place.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.090
The same with the other major
disease, periodontal disease.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.480
There's nothing a dentist
can do on a given day

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.920
that's gonna fix that disease.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.640
These are both chronic
diseases that require

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.190
management over time.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.820
It's not the way the
dental industry is set up,

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.080
even in terms of treatment,
payment, or anything else.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.350
So, there's a thinking now that

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.500
we're talking about chronic diseases.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.230
And one of the things
that people think about

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.700
when you're talking
about chronic diseases,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.320
is looking at what is
it that caused people

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.630
to have good health and
long lives over time?

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.680
And it's very clear.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.430
This is a meta-analysis
of a bunch of studies

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.160
showing that the major thing that happens

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.250
that keeps people having health,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.660
this is whether it's general
health or oral health,

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.640
is behaviors.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.800
These are individual behaviors.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.290
These are things that people do

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.890
by themselves and for
themselves every day.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.540
These are things like the use of alcohol

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.010
and tobacco and your diet.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:03.950
What's your diet like?

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.310
Do you exercise?

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.480
Do you brush your teeth with
some kind of fluoride product?

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.962
These are all things people
have some control over,

00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:12.000
or the people caring for
them have some control over,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.050
on a daily basis, every day.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.070
That's the major thing that actually can

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.690
cause people to have dental health or not.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.110
There's some, of course,
contribution by genetics.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.980
So, you have to pick your
parents very carefully,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.320
if you wanna do something about that one.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.630
And then we can do some
things as a society.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.410
But the contribution of procedures

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.800
performed by healthcare professionals,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.970
and this is true for general
health and oral health,

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.410
is very small compared to the ability

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.780
to actually maintain health

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.840
by the things that we do every day.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.930
So, in recognition of that,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.420
we have been developing something

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.010
for a long time at my institution,

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.680
which is a package of training materials

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.640
called Overcoming
Obstacles to Oral Health.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.380
It started out back in the 1990s.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.810
We're now working on
our sixth edition of it.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.700
Started out being on VHS cassettes

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.330
and then it went to CDs and
then it went to USB things.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.120
Now, by later this year,
it's gonna be a free resource

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.500
available on the internet
that anyone can access.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.120
I'm gonna give you just a couple minutes

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.680
of some idea of the content of it.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.850
But we think that the idea of helping

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.730
individuals and caregivers
being able to practice

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.400
what we call good daily mouth care

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.810
is actually the most important key

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.360
to people having dental health.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.640
Because, when you don't
have good dental health,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.670
getting disease repaired is
so difficult for many people.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.960
And particularly for those with
developmental disabilities.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.470
So, this was put together by
a whole bunch of organizations

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.910
that collaborated together.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.730
The basic idea is a
pyramid training approach

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.210
where you have oral health professionals

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.990
who are able to collaborate with and train

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.310
social service professionals,
nurses, facility managers

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.990
and leave the materials with them.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.290
Now it's gonna be readily
accessible over the internet

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.070
and be able to have those individuals

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.650
work with parents and caregivers

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.540
and direct care staff
who have high turnover.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.160
So, a new person comes into a facility.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.490
The manager can set them
down in front of a computer

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.900
and take them through a
whole bunch of lessons

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.810
and help support their
doing a much better job

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.480
of daily mouth care.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.110
Without giving all of the
details of lessons to you,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.460
I'm gonna flip through a couple
slides and give you a flavor

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.920
of the kind of things that are in there.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.990
So, this is divided up
into several things.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.210
Several, what we call the
obstacles to good oral health.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.960
One of them being informational.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.160
That's, of course, when people don't know

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.110
what to do or how to do it.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.013
But that's not true for many people,

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.180
they know that to do, they
just face other barriers,

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.850
like physical obstacles where someone

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.060
just can't perform oral hygiene procedures

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.340
'cause of physical problems

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.670
or behavioral obstacles where people

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.270
are resistive to having someone,

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.970
have anything near their
face or near their mouth

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.750
and letting someone,
if they can't complete

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.630
their oral hygiene procedures themselves.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.430
And, finally, organizational obstacles,

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.410
which is one that we've added

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.080
since the first edition of this,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.910
because, with the
growing recognition that,

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.170
in any kind of system of care,

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.430
unless those at the top and
those who are organizing

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.510
the system put a priority on oral health,

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.340
daily care and the direct care staff

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.250
are probably not gonna
pay much attention to it.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.300
So, if you're working in
any kind of organization,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.580
whether those are residential
facilities or daycare programs

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.450
or other services that are provided

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.220
for people with
developmental disabilities,

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.360
any kind of system, getting
the system to recognize

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.830
the importance of oral health
actually becomes really key

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.870
to having the daily mouth care activities

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.120
take place, that need to.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.040
So, it includes materials like recognizing

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.240
what dental disease looks like.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.693
The difference between a
healthy and an unhealthy mouth.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.898
How to remove plaque using
specialized toothbrushes.

00:14:31.898 --> 00:14:34.400
These are examples of
two sided toothbrushes.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.260
It makes it a little
easier to remove plaque.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.880
Understanding basic
infection control procedures.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.030
How to store toothbrushes.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.720
We've found, working with
a lot of direct care staff,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.790
a very basic thing that would be obvious,

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.080
they just don't understand.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.773
Needs training and emphasis.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.860
Adapted instrumentation for being able to

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.370
do daily mouth procedures.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.400
We call these mouth rests.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.560
Some people call them mouth props.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.480
But just helping someone
hold their mouth open

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.010
while something's being done,

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.080
that can be made so disposably, easily.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.600
Positioning for being able to help someone

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.613
achieve oral hygiene or good oral health.

00:15:09.613 --> 00:15:11.900
I'll just tell you a little
story about this one slide.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.810
So, this is an example of

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.130
a dental hygienist holding an instrument.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.960
But imagine that's a toothbrush

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.150
in the hands of a caregiver.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.807
Now, I often am talking to caregivers.

00:15:18.807 --> 00:15:20.310
And some of you may have the opportunity

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.270
to have the same kind of conversation.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.200
Where I'm asking them are
they helping this individual

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.850
to do their daily mouthcare?

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.283
And they say, yeah, he or
she can't do it themselves.

00:15:30.283 --> 00:15:31.116
So, I have to help them.

00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:32.460
I say, how do you do that?

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.293
Where are you, are you standing up?

00:15:33.293 --> 00:15:34.380
Are you in the bathroom?

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.647
Where are you while
you're in the bathroom?

00:15:35.647 --> 00:15:36.480
Are you standing up?

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.360
Yeah, I'm standing behind the person

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.193
and trying to help them.

00:15:38.193 --> 00:15:39.880
Well, you can imagine a
sort of resistant person.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.950
You're trying to do something
like this and you can't see.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.190
And the person's head's moving around.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.160
It's just really difficult for
a caregiver to do a good job.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.060
So, we have evolved,

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.770
mostly through toothpaste
commercials, actually,

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.260
the idea that you brush
your teeth with toothpaste.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.230
And the reason you do that,

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.380
you're gonna try to do two things.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.490
One is to remove plaque,

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.100
which is the bacterial accumulation.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.810
And the other thing you
can do is apply fluoride.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:05.720
Both of which are critical.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.170
But we do it all at once, right?

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.680
The toothbrush is removing the plaque.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.150
You don't have to do it all at once.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.620
So, the instruction to
the caregiver would be,

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.120
why don't you try going
into the living room.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.953
You have a couch.

00:16:14.953 --> 00:16:16.070
Can you lay down?

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.480
Have someone put their
head in your lap like that?

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.810
Maybe cradle their head to hold it.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.400
Use one of those mouth rests

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.710
to help them hold their mouth open.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.240
Just wet the toothbrush
with a little bit of water

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.370
just to soften it up a little bit.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.910
Don't have any, 'cause, as
soon as you have toothpaste

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.077
in there, you gotta be spitting out.

00:16:29.077 --> 00:16:31.020
And it's just impossible
to get it done on a couch.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.810
Remove all the debris,
remove all the plaque.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.280
Do a good job at cleaning
between the teeth.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.710
And then go into the bathroom

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.430
and then put some fluoride toothpaste

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.340
on the thing and put it around,

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.000
'cause the fluoride will actually
diffuse around the mouth.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.670
So, it doesn't all have
to be done in one step.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.080
That's just an example of a tip or trick

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.580
that's a part of these training materials

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.960
that can help people do a better job

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.013
of what we call daily mouth care.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.490
There's also a whole bunch of stuff

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.880
in our training materials

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.790
about behavioral intervention techniques

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.690
or behavioral support techniques.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.920
I won't talk to you about what they are,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.810
'cause I assume most people
have an idea of what those are.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.860
But it's pretty critical if
you're working with caregivers.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.750
Often don't really have the training

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.600
to get someone who's resistive

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.940
to having the toothbrush in their mouth

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.350
to get them to a place
where they'll accept it.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.910
So, that kind of training
is really critical,

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.860
if you're gonna make a difference
in daily oral healthcare.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.500
And there are manuals
for the administrators

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.563
and for direct care staff.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.860
Just some examples of all that.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.590
And the last thing is something

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.720
we call a daily mouth care plan.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.780
And, as you know, in many care systems,

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.270
including those for
developmental disabilities,

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.160
you have all kinds of planning processes.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.750
And, often, there's no
mention of oral healthcare

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:38.900
on those planning processes.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.620
We've developed a separate instrument

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.870
for people to actually plan
both behavioral interventions,

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.320
what the problems are the person's having,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.960
what's the method of dealing

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.140
with those problems or
issues at the moment.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.070
For the purpose of
communication and making sure

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.163
people are following an orderly
plan to improve oral health.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.290
Okay, so that was all
about daily mouth care.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.920
The other big innovation that's happening

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.520
in oral health services is what I call

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.280
the declining role of the dental drill.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.460
So, when I was in dental school,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.420
we're talking now, particularly,
about tooth problems.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.130
When I was in dental school,
even the very, very beginning

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.000
of any kind of what we call
demineralization of the tooth,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.910
the only thing you could do
was reach for a dental drill

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.120
and drill out that part of the tooth

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.290
and put an artificial substitute in.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.240
We now have all kinds of things

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.990
that can be done, short of doing that.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.183
And that dental drill can be reserved

00:18:29.183 --> 00:18:31.180
for much more serious problems.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.550
So, fluoride varnish,
as some of you may know,

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.400
is a fluoride product that can be used,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.920
once or two or three times a year.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.280
That has proven benefits.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.210
It can actually reverse
demineralization of enamel

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.290
in teeth that's already begun.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.420
There's a new product out that

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.310
you may or may not have heard of,

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.500
'cause It's been around for a
long time in other countries,

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.620
but just been approved by the FDA

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.550
in the United States very recently,

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.330
called silver diamine fluoride.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.760
This is something, one drop
on the surface of a tooth,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.910
it stops the decay, deposits a little,

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.400
thin layer of silver
on that area of decay.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.980
It takes a long time for
it to start up again.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.150
So, it's something that's
proven very effective

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.330
and it's starting to get
much more widespread use

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.403
in the dental profession now.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.450
Dental sealants have been
around for a long time.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.000
And, very clearly, among the things

00:19:24.186 --> 00:19:26.410
with the strongest evidence of efficacy

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:30.130
in the dental profession, is
the ability to stop decay,

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.080
to seal grooves in teeth
to keep them from decaying.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.760
And now something
relatively newer is called

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.140
interim therapeutic restorations.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.862
So, this is a technique that can be done.

00:19:39.862 --> 00:19:42.690
When I was in dental school,
what I was taught was that,

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.360
if you have a tooth with some decay in it,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.630
you have to remove it
all, because if you don't,

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.480
there's gonna be bacteria
left underneath the filling

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.630
and they're gonna continue to grow

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.110
and then bad things'll happen.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.780
Well, the science, I'd say new science,

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.410
I mean new, I mean 20
years, so new science,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.850
is such that it's pretty clear now,

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.330
you don't actually have to remove

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.690
all the decay from a tooth.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.360
With our new modern adhesive
restorative materials,

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.600
seal the bacteria in place.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.710
So, people call it
sealing caries in place.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.180
The bacteria stop growing.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.530
So, not only is it okay to do it,

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.750
but it's actually better for teeth.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.780
To use the very scientific explanation,

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.140
if you're mucking around in
a deeper part of the tooth

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.680
and you're getting close
to where the nerve is,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.520
you're much more likely to
end up with nerve damage

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.700
or toothache or needing a root canal

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.610
or something like that afterwards.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.770
So, it's actually better for teeth

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.670
to leave some of the decay in
the deeper part of the tooth.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.790
And the reason I'm going into this

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.540
little mini-dental lesson
on dental restorations is,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.780
the point of this is that removing decay,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.270
when you're removing
just the surface decay

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.610
and you're sealing decay in by bonding

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.260
a tooth colored filler material in there,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.300
that can be done without any anesthetic.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.133
No drilling.

00:20:44.133 --> 00:20:44.966
No shots.

00:20:44.966 --> 00:20:46.550
And it can be done by a dental hygienist

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.260
in a residential facility

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:51.710
or in a community day program.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.940
So, it removes the need
for the dental drill.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.970
It removes the need for the dental office.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.440
And there's a whole bunch of teeth that

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.320
can actually be kept healthy
without the need for sitting

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.830
in a dental chair in a dental office.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.400
It's really a huge paradigm shift

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.040
in terms of the previous idea

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.210
that dental care happens
in dental offices.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.360
We now have lots of ways
to keep people healthy

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.680
without resorting to what I call

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.900
the high cost surgical suite,

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:12.993
which is what the dental office is.

00:21:12.993 --> 00:21:15.150
There's a lot of ways that
allied dental personnel

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.970
can keep people healthy
in community settings.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.670
So, we've got new science.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.380
We've got this whole idea of dealing with

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.920
chronic dental care as chronic diseases.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.820
And the next leg of this three circle

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.400
Venn diagram you're gonna see built here

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.160
is the idea of different delivery systems.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.260
How do you actually get
dental care to people?

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.420
We've been working for
more than a decade now

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.070
on something we call ommunity-based

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.710
telehealth connected team deliver systems.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.510
And we did part of this
through a pilot project

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.870
from our Office of Statewide
Health Planning and Development

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.690
here in California.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.210
How many of you have heard of this

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.300
workforce pilot project mechanism?

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.390
So, a few of you have.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.940
So, California's actually unusual in that,

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.220
if you want to change the scope
of practice of a profession,

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.870
in every other state,
the only way to do it

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.700
would be to go to the legislature
and have them pass a law

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.500
that changes the scope of a practice.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.370
So, you go to legislature
and you say to them,

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.610
we'd like to have dental hygienists

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.630
be able to take out people's appendix.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.020
And someone might say to you,

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:16.853
how do you know that's a good idea?

00:22:16.853 --> 00:22:18.070
And you say, well, we don't know,

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.390
'cause they've never tried it before,

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.240
'cause they're not allowed to do it.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.960
But, if you'll pass a
law and let them do it,

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.240
we'll see how it works out.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.030
Of course, that's a ridiculous idea.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.010
But that's kind of how it
happens in most other states,

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.050
is someone goes to the legislature,

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.487
proposes a change in scope of practice,

00:22:30.487 --> 00:22:32.270
and the legislature's
have to take it on faith

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.600
that it's a good idea.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.750
California has a mechanism
where you can actually go

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.260
to this Office of Statewide
Health Planning and Development.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.260
You can apply for what's called

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.580
a Health Workforce Pilot Project.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.413
It's a big deal.

00:22:43.413 --> 00:22:45.040
There's lots of paperwork
and public hearings.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.410
But, if you get approval for
that, you can actually try

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.130
things that are outside of
the normal scope of practice.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.330
This is not just for dental care.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.480
It's nursing and every
other health profession.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.810
You can create a whole
new profession this way.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.250
And then you can go to
the legislature saying,

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.990
we've tried this thing
in a pilot environment.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.680
It was heavily evaluated.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.010
Here's the data that shows
it's safe and effective.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.730
And now we want you to pass a law.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.330
Which obviously makes a lot more sense

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.680
than the way it's done in other states.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.670
So, we have this mechanism in California.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.440
We used it to test out some new ways

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.477
of getting dental care to people.

00:23:14.477 --> 00:23:17.240
And the idea was to do
it in community settings.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.580
And we were testing two
new specific duties.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.620
One was the ability for
allied dental personnel

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.960
to decide which X-rays to take

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.210
before a dentist got
involved in seeing them.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.250
And the second was to be able to place

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.390
these things that I just talked about,

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.480
these interim therapeutic restorations.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.480
So, the realization
that we're coming to is,

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.610
and I think general healthcare
is much further along

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.270
in realizing that
healthcare is a team sport.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.470
And dental care is a team sport, as well.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.550
So, we came up with this system.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.750
We call it a virtual dental home.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.450
I'm sure most of you
have heard of the term

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.220
medical homes or health homes.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.200
The general idea of the home concept

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.253
is you're trying to keep
someone from getting lost

00:23:55.253 --> 00:23:57.410
in the complicated
healthcare system we have.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.350
Making sure they're getting back

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.150
for the things they need to get back to.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:01.660
Helping to educate them to be able

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.280
to manage their own disease.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.120
Getting people to
advanced surgical services

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.340
when they need them.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.980
And, in the general healthcare system,

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.290
there's a pretty broad recognition

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.750
that lots of different kinds of entities

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.750
can do that set of services.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.900
In dental care, if you look
at the dental literature,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.270
it's almost entirely referring

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.780
to the dental home as
the dentist's office.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.690
And what we wanted to
be able to demonstrate,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.590
was you could have all those concepts

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.380
that are part of the home
system, a dental home,

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.630
but it can be done in what we call

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.120
a geographically distributed

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.840
telehealth-connected team environment.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.440
So, it wasn't everybody in the
same place at the same time.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.800
This telehealth system could connect

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.200
all the right people together.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.960
And you could deliver all the
services of the dental home.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.991
So, we've been testing this for,

00:24:42.991 --> 00:24:45.930
now, it's getting to
be more than a decade.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:46.763
The general idea,

00:24:46.763 --> 00:24:49.670
this is a dental hygienist
who's in a school.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.530
That little thing in her hand,

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.160
it looks like a hairdryer, but it's not.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.890
It's actually a
miniaturized X-ray machine.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.157
And inside the young lady's mouth,

00:24:57.157 --> 00:24:59.790
we no longer use film,
that's a digital sensor.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.270
So, she's taking X-rays.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.460
This is a photograph of the tooth.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.700
You can see the picture of the tooth

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.750
on the laptop computer in the back there.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:07.730
This is actually a gentleman

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.650
who's got intellectual disabilities.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.513
He's at the Golden Gate Regional Center.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.360
He had had all of his previous dental work

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.683
done in the hospital operating room.

00:25:18.683 --> 00:25:19.990
He would walk into a dental office.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.020
He'd be nervous.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.380
The dentist would look at him and say,

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.840
I can't work on this guy.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.030
He's gonna have to go to the hospital

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.000
and have dental care
under general anesthesia.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.580
And yet, in his own house,
that's his favorite chair.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.930
That's where he watches TV.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.360
He's got that thing over his face,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.280
'cause he didn't like the
light, but that was his idea.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.540
So, he's able to have, here,
a full set of X-rays taken.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.210
The hygienist can clean his teeth.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.420
She can apply those small
restorations when he needs them.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.400
He may never have to go
back to the hospital again.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.860
So, you can see how just
changing the environment

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.420
and changing the way that
you're delivering service

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.940
can make a huge difference in terms

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.960
of people's ability to get dental care

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.820
and to have procedures
done that they might not do

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.083
in the context of the scary
surgical suite dental office.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.070
This is one through portable equipment.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.963
This all packs up.

00:26:00.963 --> 00:26:03.540
And, with a trip to the car,
you're in one place one day

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.480
and you're in another place the other day.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.510
And we've been testing this
across the age spectrum

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.550
from young children in
preschools and elementary schools

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.610
all the way up through
people in nursing facilities,

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.890
residential facilities for
people with disabilities.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.113
So, it has broad application.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.910
So, we did a formal test.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.830
The general idea being
that the allied personnel

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.820
are collecting records in some place.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.930
All the records are going
up to a cloud-based system

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.880
where a dentist who's not
in the residential facility

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.920
or the daycare program or the school

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.350
is able to get access to them,

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.470
can see a full set of dental records,

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.570
make a diagnosis and a treatment plan.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.950
And then provide instructions for

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.220
the allied personnel who are there.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.350
So, this is an example of one of those

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.260
small restorations being placed.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.810
This one's in a school,
but you could picture

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.720
this same thing in a residential facility

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.810
for someone with disabilities

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.730
or a daycare program
using portable equipment.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.770
That small hole, for many
people, nothing happens at all

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.047
until that turns into a
bigger hole and a bigger hole.

00:27:05.047 --> 00:27:07.390
And then, at some point,
they have a toothache.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.770
And, at some point, they have an infection

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.990
and they end up in the emergency room

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.540
or the hospital operating room.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.070
Now, in about 10 or 15 minutes,

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:18.457
with no shots, no drilling,
that decay is sealed in place

00:27:18.457 --> 00:27:20.010
and that tooth put into a holding pattern.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.210
Sometimes for many years before

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.050
anything else has to be done for it.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.800
So, just an example of an
innovation in dental care

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.070
that's allowing us to really
think very differently

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.680
about how we improve the oral
health of lots of people,

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.160
including those with
developmental disabilities.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.140
These are just some examples
of those kind of restorations

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.153
with beginning decay that's
been sealed in place.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.570
This one was actually done
in a nursing facility where,

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.340
for lots of people who were
taking many medications...

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.030
There's about 400 medications
that cause dry mouth.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.920
And dry mouth is devastating for teeth

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.840
in terms of leading to
rampant dental caries.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.450
And it often starts like this one does

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.430
in the upper left picture,
right up at the gum line.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.640
And the dental hygienist,
again, no shots, no drilling,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.280
was able to seal all those areas in place

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.160
and put those teeth into a holding pattern

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.460
for a long period of time.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.960
So, we did this test across California

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.290
in 13 different communities.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.670
Demonstrating this system.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.470
About 50 different sites.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.110
And there's a whole report on our website,

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.710
if you wanted to read the details.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.250
But basically what we found was that

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.970
we could make this idea of
telehealth-connected teams work.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.350
We could have people in different places.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.880
They could communicate together and form

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.823
a full system of care
connecting through telehealth.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.950
We think about it as hub and spoke system

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.170
where the hub is where the dentists are.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.940
That's the places like the dental office

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:35.880
or the dental clinic.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.980
And the spokes are any
kind of community site

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.790
where you might have someone
who's a dental hygienist

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.250
can go with equipment, set up
their equipment for the day,

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.510
and be able to see people
in that environment.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.480
And, in fact, what we found was,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.290
as a a result of that demonstration,

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.970
that this was a way to
reach a lot of people

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.130
who were not getting
access to dental care,

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.540
was a way to emphasize prevention

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.150
and early intervention,
to get to people early

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.590
before small problems became big problems.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.350
We actually found the majority of people

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:06.640
could be kept healthy and
verified healthy onsite.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.700
About 2/3 of children
didn't need anything else

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.787
other than the dental hygienist

00:29:09.787 --> 00:29:11.630
the only one physically touching them.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:12.630
About 2/3.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.470
Which we are working with very low income,

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.500
high disease rates populations.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.420
And that's a really big deal.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.410
Because most of the children
in these populations

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.560
were not getting any care at all

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.830
until they had big problems.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.170
And a little bit less
with people with adults,

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.210
people with disabilities.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.500
About 50 or 60%.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.363
But, still, high numbers of people

00:29:29.363 --> 00:29:31.890
that could be kept healthy
with a dental hygienist

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.080
the only one physically touching them.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.590
And the word verified in there,

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.110
is really actually pretty important,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.670
can be kept healthy and
verified healthy on site,

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.360
because most kind of dental care systems

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.810
where people are going into the community

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.420
or school-based care, we've
done something for 20 years

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.070
of having hygienists be
in residential facilities

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.070
doing some kind of hygiene procedures.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.260
All those other kind of systems where

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.770
the dentist is not involved,

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.200
everyone gets told, okay,
we did X, Y, or Z today.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.330
But you need to go see a dentist,

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.570
because we didn't do a
complete examination.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.453
And so, then there's a whole process

00:30:00.453 --> 00:30:02.240
of getting someone to a dental office,

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.070
which is often difficult to do.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.810
Now, using the telehealth system

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:09.780
and being able to bring the
dentist into the school,

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.010
the residential facility, the care home,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:12.843
being able to bring the dentist

00:30:12.843 --> 00:30:14.330
in through the telehealth system.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.180
Now we can actually have the dentist say,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.090
I've reviewed the records,
do a complete examination

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.950
and treatment plan, you are healthy now.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.790
Next thing you need is
to have a recare visit,

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.080
a recall visit by the hygienist

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.930
in three or six months or whatever it is.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.620
And so, being able to actually verify

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.840
that people are healthy onsite,
using the telehealth system

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.240
becomes a big deal, as well.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.660
The only thing that's
really critical here,

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.030
is the bullet that says
continuous presence.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.130
So, we describe this system as
a continuous presence system,

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.910
meaning that wherever the site
is, where the hygienists are,

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.170
and these are typically group sites,

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.670
it's not really economically
feasible to do this,

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.230
where you're just going
one home at a time.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.200
Although, there are some
instances where that is done.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.180
But any kind of a group setting,

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.260
having the hygienist be there on

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.760
a regular basis all year long.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.430
Now, regular basis
doesn't necessarily mean

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:57.800
five days a week.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.870
It might be one day every other week

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.240
or it might be one day a month.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.180
But having the hygienist
there on a regular basis

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.250
actually changes a lot of
thinking in the environment.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.650
It raises people's
awareness about oral health.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.470
People are starting to
think about dental care

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.000
more than they were before.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.210
It has a huge impact.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.130
And I think the most important
thing, as I said earlier,

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.570
which is daily mouth care.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.140
You know the hygienist is coming back.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.180
And you know they're gonna be looking

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.170
in the person you're caring for's mouth.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.100
And you know, if you haven't
been brushing their teeth,

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.707
it's gonna be obvious to the hygienist.

00:31:24.707 --> 00:31:26.210
And you don't wanna look bad,

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.630
so you wanna actually pay attention.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:28.640
Because you know they're coming back.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.570
So, this idea of continuous presence

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.050
for an oral health
professional in the environment

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.060
makes a big difference in
the most important thing,

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.140
which is actually this
daily mouth care idea.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.000
It also begins to
integrate oral healthcare

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.440
in with the community organizations.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.070
Whether these are social
service or educational

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.890
or general health organizations.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.290
Having a member of the dental team there,

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:50.030
begins to integrate the
oral health services.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.530
So, it's not an isolated
system, like it often is.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.030
And it actually brings
the dentist in through

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.490
the telehealth system without the dentist

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.193
having to be in those locations.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.300
So, as a result of that
10 year demonstration,

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.660
we had a bill that was passed

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.450
and was signed in 2014, AB 1174.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.830
It took those duties we were testing

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.350
and made them a part of
the scope of practice

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:10.723
of allied dental personnel.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.083
Made the Washington Post.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.300
I said, California to launch
Medicaid-funded teledentistry.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.110
So, the Medicaid funding
was a part of the bill.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.160
It wasn't the only thing in the bill.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.020
But that's what made the news.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.090
But it did require our
California Medicaid system

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.380
to pay for dental services,

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.730
whether they were performed in person

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.250
or whether they're performed using

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.800
telehealth connected team services.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.093
That's now part of the
DentiCal System in California.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.970
The American Dental
Association has subsequently,

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.080
I had the opportunity to testify

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:39.970
at their house of delegates,

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.080
it subsequently adopted
a policy saying that

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.690
teledentistry is an important tool

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.980
a dentist should be able
to use and get paid for.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.500
And so, it's beginning to
get national attention now.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.040
California's adopted, now,
regulations and bulletins

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.850
out to dentists about how to bill

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.850
using telehealth-connected teams.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.680
The other one was for the
fee for service system.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.100
And this is something we work

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.400
with the California
Primary Care Association.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.290
The billing system's a little
different for health centers.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.000
But we now have guidance for both

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.830
the fee for service system
and the health center system

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.540
about how to use
telehealth-connected teams

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.153
and be able to bill for them.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.530
A little run-through of
our history with all this,

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.760
is that it started in 2009
with this proof of concept

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.390
of this idea of using
telehealth-connected teams.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.560
Got to the legislation in
2014 and regulations in 2015

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.690
and since that time, it's been expanding,

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:28.700
both in California.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.870
We have grant funded projects now,

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.650
where we're working
right now with about 40

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.260
different health centers and
private practice dentists,

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.640
to teach them how to
do this kind of system.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.160
It's actually pretty
different than the normal way

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.530
of delivering dental care,
so people still need training

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:42.830
and technical assistance in doing it

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.110
but we've got a lot of interest in it now.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.100
And we've had about eight
or nine other states

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.290
that have copied California's legislation

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.090
and now are paying, their
Medicaid system's required

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.610
to pay for telehealth delivered services

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.350
and teledentistry in particular.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.470
And we've got a funded
replication project system

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.530
going, now, in Oregon
and Colorado and Hawaii.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:06.280
So, it's going to be
ubiquitous across the country

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.130
in the next, probably, decade,

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.090
that everyone was going to
be using this style of care

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:10.990
to reach lots of people.

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:12.860
As you heard earlier,
the 200 million people

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.390
who are not getting dental
care in our country,

00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:16.280
this is not going to
reach every one of them

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.370
but I think it's going to allow

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.820
the dental profession to go a long ways

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.763
towards delivering more dental
care to a lot more people.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.510
The last thing just to touch on,

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.930
I think many of you are aware of this,

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:28.170
is just the whole way
that we're beginning,

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.310
as a country, to think differently

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:32.110
about financial incentives

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.920
and I'm sure you're all
aware that we've entered

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.080
an era of accountability
where our policymakers

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.810
are asking not just
what are we paying for,

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.970
but what are we getting
out of what we pay for?

00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:42.480
And with our national goal having now

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.600
become the the Triple Aim,

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.550
the the goal of improving
experiences of care for people,

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.717
improving the health of the populations

00:34:49.717 --> 00:34:52.380
and doing all that at
a lower cost per capita

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.340
and now, it's evolved from the Triple Aim

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.400
to the Quadruple Aim, with the addition

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.180
of the fact that provider satisfaction

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.350
has actually got to be included

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.020
if we're going to have a
health care system that works.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.890
There wasn't in the original formulation

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.280
but that's actually a part of it now.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.680
And so, we're moving towards systems

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.370
where there's a lot more measurement

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.380
and outcomes-based care and
people beginning to figure out,

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.080
how do you pay for health outcomes

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.993
as opposed just for paying
for health professionals

00:35:14.993 --> 00:35:16.940
just to do a lot of stuff?

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.810
And we feel that this idea
of getting to people early,

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.310
providing prevention, early
intervention services,

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.840
in sites where people are receiving

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.280
other kinds of services,
getting dental care integrated,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.150
is going to be a key
to actually being able

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.090
to reach those goals of
producing better health,

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.930
having people have better experiences,

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.110
and doing all that at a
lower cost per capita.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.330
To rely solely on the
high cost surgical suite,

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.630
which is a dental office,

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:43.250
we're really going in the
opposite direction of those aims.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.793
So, dental care in the future.

00:35:44.793 --> 00:35:46.130
I think we're all going to climb

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.650
into one of these machines at some point,

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:48.890
then the dentist who's at their house

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:50.435
is going to be doing
something with data gloves.

00:35:50.435 --> 00:35:52.190
(crowd laughing)

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.300
Yeah but that's not this year, though,

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.160
so that's a little bit
further down the road.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.280
But what I think is actually coming

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.690
sooner than then many people realize

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.090
is this idea of using
geographically distributed

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.390
telehealth-enabled oral health teams,

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.580
I think is going to be, it's
already beginning to spread.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.600
We're getting lots of interest.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.040
I think that's going to be
a big part of dental care.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.560
Actually, what I say now,
is if we were to be able

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.830
to jump in the time machine
and get 20 years in the future

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.640
and you were to ask dental providers

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.590
across the dental industry,

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.150
are you using telehealth connected teams

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.480
as part of your work?

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.780
They would say, well, of
course we're doing that.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.070
Why would we not do that?

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.300
The same way, if you ask someone today,

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.750
are you using some kind of smart phone?

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.700
They'd say, well, of course I do.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.030
Why would I not do that, right?

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.540
But you ask someone 20 years ago,

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.840
they would not even know
what the word meant.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.190
So, I think we're going
to see a lot more adoption

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.630
of this style of expanding
the role of dentists,

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.680
having dentists be able
to expand their reach

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.630
much further using this idea
of telehealth connected teams.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.380
I think as we do that, as we
focus more on health outcomes,

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.870
we're gonna see much
more focus on dental care

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.940
using biological and
medical and behavioral

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.500
and social tools as a
way of improving health,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.490
rather than, as I say, the
declining use of the dental drill

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:02.070
is the sort of primary focus
of how dental care happens.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.940
And we're gonna see dental care

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.840
become much more integrated
with general health,

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.160
educational, and social service systems.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.140
And I don't think this is
optional for the dental industry

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.450
because if we're gonna actually get back

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.130
to interacting with the
majority of the population,

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.750
we're going to be pushed to do this

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.160
as we focus on health outcomes,

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.630
as we get further into the
area of accountability.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.720
So, I want to finish up with
just a couple of thoughts

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.750
about people with
developmental disabilities,

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.650
in particular, in relation
to all of these innovations.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.450
So, one is, to repeat what I said earlier,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.130
which is that daily mouth care is the key,

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.290
number one and everything
else pales in comparison.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:37.130
If you don't have good daily mouth care,

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.560
people are not going to
have good oral health,

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.200
no matter what any dental professional

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.883
does to them or with them.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.410
The second issue is if
things do get to the point

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.650
where they need disease repair,

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.070
being able to perform procedures

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.450
without having to use
sedation or anesthesia

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:53.880
is really critical.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.020
At dental dental schools
across the country,

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.950
across the state, which are
often the primary providers

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.420
of local and general
anesthesia dental services,

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.100
although the other dentists
are doing it as well,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.170
we have huge waiting lists.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:07.690
We have more than a
year-and-a-half waiting list

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.300
at my dental school for someone
who's already been deemed

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.640
that the problems are severe enough,

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.290
they need to have dental care
under general anesthesia.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.490
Can you imagine, it's
like you heard earlier

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.440
about the payment system.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.480
Well, this is not a payment system,

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.970
it's just a capacity system.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.310
Yeah, you've got this disease,

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:21.690
it's so advanced you need to be treated

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.090
under general anesthesia
and come back in a year

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.080
and a half and we'll see what
the waiting list looks like.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.760
I mean, you know, it's
an impossible situation

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.700
and we're not going to
solve that by producing

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.080
more opportunities for general anesthesia.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.410
It's just way too expensive
and the only solution

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.480
is to be able to reduce the
need for general anesthesia

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.070
by getting to people earlier.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.870
Which leads to the last bullet,

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.890
which is that prevention,
early intervention care,

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:46.800
delivered in community settings

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.480
is most likely to result
in better mouth care

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.800
and then better oral health

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.540
and reduce the need for the consequences

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.320
of treating disease when they're
much further down the road.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.900
Now, we have a payment system right now,

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.840
the Medicaid or Medicaid
dental program, Denti-Cal,

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.530
which does not support any of the stuff

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:04.700
that's required to be able to do

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.660
what I just been talking about.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.980
It doesn't support care coordination.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.210
It doesn't support
education, oral activities.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.940
It doesn't support caregiver
support activities.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.870
It doesn't support, really,
anything that's needed

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:18.173
to have an effective system
of community-delivered care.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.550
Which means that if we're
going to be able to do this

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.990
and there's already
some experience with it,

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.240
it actually falls back to the
opportunity to do it today

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.810
and today's payment environment falls back

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.180
to the regional centers.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.970
So, regional centers can, and some have,

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.730
been able to come up with funding

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.470
to be able to pay
dentists for doing things

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.310
that are out of the norm or go beyond

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.650
what the Denti-Cal system pays for.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.320
And, in fact, we have projects going now.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.250
I've worked with a lot of,

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.450
I had the opportunity to work with a lot

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.350
of the regional centers across the state

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:49.090
in various ways over the 40 years

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.040
I've been doing this kind of work.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.750
So, it's getting to be a long time

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.600
and we have three specific
projects going right now

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.030
with the Alta Regional Center

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.540
and Golden Gate in North Bay,

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.600
where we're specifically using this idea

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.700
that we've been talking about today,

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.410
this idea of using
telehealth connected teams.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.343
So, in those projects,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.400
we're helping the recruit providers,

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.360
we're actually doing
training for the providers

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.430
on how to work with people with
developmental disabilities.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.000
We're helping them set up this whole idea

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.220
of telehealth connected teams,

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.830
to be able to know how to reach people

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:21.900
without having them have to come

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.870
into a dental office or a clinic.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.690
We're figuring out and helping them work

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:29.380
with regional centers to
integrate dental services

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.940
in with residential
facilities and day programs

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.640
and other places where people

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.790
in the regional center system are located.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:39.400
And the regional centers are
actually using their funding

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.940
to pay for some of these education

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.410
and prevention and care management

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.350
and early intervention services.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.560
I think it's critical, actually,

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.300
if you're involved in a
regional center system

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.960
and thinking about how
to improve oral health

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.010
and realizing that's
one of the top problems

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.240
that the people who are being served have,

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.520
is to think about ways to support systems,

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.353
systems like this.

00:40:58.353 --> 00:41:01.110
I know a number of regional
centers around the state

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:05.130
are paying a fair amount of
money for dentists to take,

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:06.360
to support dentists, to be able

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.340
to do dental care under
general anesthesia.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.790
And while I think that that's admirable

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.260
because the backlog is so huge,

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.920
as you heard, and it's a needed service

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.620
when people get to that stage.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.440
I think that we need
to shift that pendulum

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.500
to maybe, in addition, have
the regional centers realize

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.860
the value of getting
to people much earlier

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.490
and preventing disease
before it gets to the point

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:27.180
of needing general anesthesia
and there are mechanisms

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.210
and these three regional centers

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:29.043
have figured out how to do it.

00:41:29.043 --> 00:41:32.150
There are mechanisms to be
able to pay dental providers

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.840
and to set up systems like this.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.690
So, I think that the innovations
that I've talked about,

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.230
I think there's a lot
of hope for the future,

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.180
for being able to do things differently

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.539
and do things differently in
a much more effective way.

00:41:43.539 --> 00:41:45.560
I'll be happy to talk at the panel

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.980
and a few minutes for
questions and answers

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.430
or even at lunch, if
you want to talk to me

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.440
or there's my email address,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.240
if you want to get in
contact with me afterwards.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.542
So, thank you.

00:41:52.542 --> 00:41:55.459
(crowd applauding)
