Now that we have a better
understanding for

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.540
how things can be grouped together
to communicate relationships,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.730
let's talk about the specifics of
laying things out on the screen.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.590
Material design uses an 8dp
grid to align components.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.080
Text aligns to a 4dp baseline grid.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.140
Let's take a closer look at the grid so
you can see it a bit clearer.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.490
Notice that for finer grid control,
the baselines of text sit on a 4dp grid.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.892
That's kind of a subset
of this 8dp grid.

00:00:30.892 --> 00:00:35.318
So things like image and
icon sizes, spacing,

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:40.088
margins, and
paddings are all multiples of 8dp.

00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:45.020
So things like 16, 72, 40, and
16, those are multiples of 8.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.556
And for text, line heights
are multiples of 4, so 20dp.

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:54.820
These 8dp and 4dp grids allow us to
easily apply the laws of grouping and

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.460
keep our UIs organized, balanced, and

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.237
in harmony with the rest
of the operating system.

00:01:00.237 --> 00:01:04.200
There are material designed templates
and stencils that use this grid,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.790
available for Adobe Illustrator,
Photoshop, and Sketch.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.620
Check the instructor's notes for
links to them.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.390
Even though there's a grid, we need a
couple other pieces to lay out our UIs.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.830
Keylines are used to vertically or

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.195
horizontally align objects
in a user interface.

00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:24.895
Aesthetically, they enforce
a sense of order in a UI.

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:28.585
They also make it much quicker to scan
the screen and take in the information.

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:33.405
The material design specs suggest some
common keylines to use in mobile design.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:38.655
Using 16dp margins from the left and
right for auxiliary content like icons,

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:42.412
and avatars, and so on, and
72dp from the left edge for

00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:48.030
the primary content, the things like
the page title and the page contents.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.690
Now, if you don't have
auxiliary content,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.150
then your primary content should
probably also align to the 16dp keyline.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.940
And the exact value of these keyline is
less important than the concept aligning

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.720
content to bring order to your UI, and
making it quicker to visually parse.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.980
Before we move further,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.080
let me pass it over to James to have you
apply these concepts in Android Studio.
