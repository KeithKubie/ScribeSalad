00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.049
I basically, in general, responded to the
building as a whole, particularly the exterior

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.310
of the building, confronting the orange-ness
of the brick, and the horizontality of the

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:32.189
pattern in the exterior of the building. The
amphitheater, as well, thatÕs a particular

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.300
structure that I included in my design. Up
here, in fact, the way that I have the pattern

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.629
end, open, end and begin again in that particular
spot.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:54.190
I do the drawings by hand. I like that directness.
I like that approach. It becomes a kind of

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:05.530
painterly exercise, in a way, just going through
this tactile, tangible process of mapping

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.200
the design on the wall.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.170
I love the power of design, pattern, and symbol
in traditional African art, and I learn from

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:29.340
it quite a lotÑthe sense of invention, drawing,
the sense of space, material.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.909
You can do so many things with color and create
so many different situations, and I wanted

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.429
to create ultimately a positive situation
here with the colors. I didnÕt want to have

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.319
colors that could be ultimately cloudy or
depressive. I wanted thought provoking colors,

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.890
interesting colors, interesting and dynamic
situations, environmental situations. When

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.860
I make these kinds of installations, it seems
often enough that I deal with each wall as

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.810
a separate event, and a circumstance or situation
based on how it exists, and then how it exists

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.530
with the space adjacent to it. The first wall
was sort of like just the beginning of, letÕs

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.160
say, a concert, where you have the big, loud
drums and the instruments tuning, and all

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.500
thatÕs just [claps], just this CHH CHH CHH,
just this beginning. I call it Wall One, which

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.651
is the entry wall at the door, and Wall Two,
which is the wall adjacent to itÉhow they

00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:32.490
meet at the corner and they fan out in this
kind of diagonal explosion. They just explode

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.000
outward.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.030
I was thinking also of people traveling through
the spaceÑof the particular type of person

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.640
traveling through the space: the students.
And what are they going to be doing here?

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.920
TheyÕre going to be studying, theyÕre going
to be communicating, having a community here,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.540
living here. So I was thinking about that
sort of environment, too. What kind of color,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:06.540
coloration, design would be conducive to that
kind of activity. Work that is in public space,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.490
like thisÉI think people are able to come
to it and to painting in a much more open,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.330
generous, and quicker way. ItÕs immediate.
ItÕs the body feels the painting.
