00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.740
HOST: So welcome.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.020
Welcome Athenistas to Google--
for today's talks at Google.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.540
It's interesting that
both of our companies,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.190
which are technology
companies in the 21st century,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.440
actually have names for
our employees-- Athenistas

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.150
and Googlers.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.650
And hopefully some
of the Athenistas

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.520
and some of the Googlers
will mix it up here today.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.364
We're here today for talks
at Google with Jonathan Bush.

00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:37.780
That's all right-- if we can
have that-- the ratio doesn't

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.410
have to be perfect.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.951
JONATHAN BUSH: School
here or abroad.

00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:43.080
Just think of it as
an exchange program.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.320
HOST: So we're here to talk with
Jonathan Bush, whose book just

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.930
came out, Where Does It Hurt?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.480
An Entrepreneur's Guide
to Fixing Health Care.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.610
I was just speaking with
one of Jonathan's associates

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.530
who asked me if I was
familiar with the book.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.010
And I've actually read the book.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.570
And in fact, you can actually
see some notes in the margins.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.110
JONATHAN BUSH: Did you
read it on paper too?

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.360
HOST: I read it on paper, yes.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.220
I actually read
this on a plane--

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.178
JONATHAN BUSH: There's
still some left, people.

00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:10.320
This is what they look like.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350
HOST: So Jonathan
is, in addition

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.030
to the author of this book,
which I recommend highly--

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.920
it really does make a very, very
complicated topic much easier

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.210
to understand.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.829
It also makes a very complicated
topic possibly very scary

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.120
for some of us who haven't
seen all our way through it.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.980
But in addition to being a
soon to be best selling author,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.970
Jonathan, also the president CEO
and chairman of Athena Health

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.260
which he co-founded in 1997.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.430
He took public in 2007 when
it was the most successful IPO

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.060
of the year, and continues to
thrive and grow today in 2014.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.560
HOST: Yes?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.190
Were you going to say--

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.770
JONATHAN BUSH:
That's what I do when

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.894
I'm feeling full of myself.

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:55.910
I just do that.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.410
HOST: OK.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.080
But we're not going
to necessarily talk

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.407
deeply about the business today,
although we'll get to that.

00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:04.490
We'd like to talk about
the book, which is just as

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.060
much the Jonathan story
and the health care story

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.479
as it is the Athena
Health story.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.100
So Jonathan-- I'll
start you off with kind

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.470
of a life of Jonathan question.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.970
You graduated from Wesleyan,
the College of Social Studies.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.900
Is that correct?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.990
JONATHAN BUSH: Yes.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.150
HOST: How does a graduate
of Wesleyan College--

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.420
or what does a person do when
they graduate from Wesleyan

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.480
in the College of Social Studies
to work their way to this?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.500
What was the path?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.060
What were some of
the motivations?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.170
What were some of the
inspirational epiphany moments

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.410
that happened then,
right after then,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.084
right before then that
eventually got you to 1997?

00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:48.500
JONATHAN BUSH: Well, I think
I'll go a little bit earlier.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.870
And I was actually-- I
was one of the few people

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.950
to receive early
rejection from a college.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.330
So that's where you apply
early and they don't refer you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.580
to the general admission pool.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.430
They say wow, you are so far
off in terms of your goals

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.250
that we're going to
help you by saying

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.560
that you'll never come here.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.110
HOST: OK.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.640
JONATHAN BUSH: And--

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.640
HOST: Was that Wesleyan?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.430
Was that Wesleyan?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.959
JONATHAN BUSH:
That was Wesleyan.

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.000
Which, of course, was
immediately to me was like,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm coming there.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.140
And so I took a year
off and I went to BU

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.520
and I got good
grades-- which was

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.170
exhausting-- the good grades.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.250
But I did it.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.420
And then I came
back and I got in.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.160
And I really wasn't-- after
all that effort getting good

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.290
grades, I realized I wasn't
really good at anything.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.040
At anything.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.192
I wasn't good at sports,
and I wasn't good at math,

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:37.650
and I wasn't good
at science, and I

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.045
wasn't good at literature.

00:03:39.045 --> 00:03:40.820
But I liked all of it.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.260
And I liked the idea of being
a little better at all of it.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.760
And the College
of Social Studies

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.250
was an interdisciplinary
program--

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.624
that was history, government,
economics, and philosophy--

00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:53.170
in little colloquia that
you go through intensively.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.730
And I-- it would
intensively do it.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.942
Did a bad job at all of them.

00:03:55.942 --> 00:03:57.400
But there were only
a few of us who

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.910
would dare try to
take all of those on.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.940
And it worked wonders
for my dyslexia,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.940
and it gave me an
incredible confidence

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.300
at seeing the broad
stroke of things.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.860
And that's why--
Wesleyan's president just

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.550
wrote a book on why
liberal education is

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.300
useful in an era of
comp-sci and [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.270
it's about seeing the
broad stroke of things.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.424
In health care that's,
particularly hard to do.

00:04:24.424 --> 00:04:25.840
In fact, there are
years and years

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.056
of well intentioned law
making it almost illegal

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:30.430
to see the broad
stroke of what's

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.772
happening in health care.

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:32.980
So that's how it got started.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.700
And it was in fact, the idea of
looking for places where there

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.090
was no broad stroke
that made sense,

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.310
that got me to health care.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.230
And so Wesleyan was
perfect training.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.070
Who knew?

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.255
Also, I was the absolute
best Wesleyan graduate

00:04:46.255 --> 00:04:47.921
in health care
management, because there

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:50.280
were no other Wesleyan
graduate anywhere interested

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.530
in the management of health

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.030
HOST: Great.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.670
So you finished up
at Wesleyan and you

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.880
had a couple of
adventures, right?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.050
That actually started to
get you closer to this.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.270
JONATHAN BUSH: Right.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.140
It was-- I graduated
with Wesleyan still

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.264
clinging to the idea that
maybe there was something

00:05:03.264 --> 00:05:04.390
that I could be good at.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.260
And since the idea of making
a lot of money saving people's

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.120
lives appealed and no
one else in my family

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.270
had been a doctor except for my
uncle Johnny, who was then 80

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.785
and had polio-- and so he
couldn't compete with me.

00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.410
I thought maybe I'd
be a doctor and I'd

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.780
be like-- this was before ER,
but it would be like ER, knight

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.160
and I'd save people's
lives and [? work ?].

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.190
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.470
And then I learned about this
whole organic chemistry thing,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.030
and there went that.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.752
But before I discovered
organic chemistry,

00:05:38.752 --> 00:05:41.210
I-- a doctor friend-- I said,
like I want to do this doctor

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.630
thing and he's a trauma surgeon
who's worked on the President's

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.450
rescue squad that flew
around the world case

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.550
the President got shot.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.300
And he said, look.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.420
Try before you buy.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.640
I have a friend who's the
police surgeon in New Orleans.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.470
Get a job, get your
EMT certification,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.640
and get a job treating patients.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.640
And then decide if you want to
put seven years of your life

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.990
into being bad at school again.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.210
And and I did, and I didn't.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.960
And I'm really glad I
didn't go all the way

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.970
through medical school
and have this experience.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.110
But I absolutely loved
driving an ambulance at six

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.350
at night to 6:00 in the
morning in New Orleans.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.459
It was the greatest
experience-- I think, probably

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.250
in my career to date--
including everything

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.300
that's happened now to date.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.150
Partly because of the romance
of being honored with the one

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.090
thing that is going
truly horribly

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.970
wrong amongst a million people.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.960
Right now amongst the 5 million
people in Massachusetts,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.080
there's some horrible
thing happening.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.010
And to be the one entrusted
to help in that moment

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.750
and be allowed to
race to that place

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.050
is romantic and
important and beautiful.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.950
But also, the whole system.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.240
You get to travel
through the whole food

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.640
chain from the back
room of the house

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.290
all the way through
the emergency room

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.940
and into the operating room
and see all the hand offs.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.360
Which, if you like the
broad stroke of things,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.650
provides an extraordinary
front row seat.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.410
And really inspiring business
ideas come out of that.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.120
One business idea was,
wow, EMT's go things better

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.280
than doctors.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.669
Paramedics can put in lines
and tubes better than doctors

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.460
because we do them all
the time in a moving

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.510
ambulance with someone
who's trying to kick us.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.720
And that's really good practice
for being able to get it right.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.970
Another idea -- so
can't we downscale?

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.394
Can we create different
specializations below doctor

00:07:29.394 --> 00:07:30.310
and make care cheaper?

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.870
That was an idea
that came out of it,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.430
went into Athena women's health.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.290
Another one was
most of the people

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.270
we treated in an ambulance
didn't need to be transported.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.020
They needed a little
bit of stabilization,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.714
a little bit of help, a little
bit of emotional support.

00:07:42.714 --> 00:07:44.130
And we weren't
allowed to do that.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.440
If we didn't transport
them, we'd get no money.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.620
If we did transport
them, we'd get $495.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.240
So treating in place remains an
enormous business opportunity

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.480
for somebody who
likes that stuff.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.407
And that's what got me
going on this whole,

00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:58.990
how does the whole
thing fit together?

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.640
How could it fit together
differently idea.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.000
HOST: Great.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.920
That was followed by, as we
refer to it here in Cambridge,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.231
the B school.

00:08:07.231 --> 00:08:07.730
And--

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.650
JONATHAN BUSH:
--Temple of capitalism.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.200
HOST: Yeah, OK.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.710
The temple of capitalism if we
didn't catch that on the mic.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.240
And consulting.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.260
Right?

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.343
JONATHAN BUSH: Booz-Allen.

00:08:18.343 --> 00:08:20.710
Yeah, there another to
fail again at something.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.030
So I was able to get
into the business school

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.600
about seven minutes before the
meeting where they were going

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.155
to sit me down and talk
about how it's not working.

00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:31.340
I just was with spreadsheets
and the footnotes

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.440
and getting it all right.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.184
I was terrible.

00:08:35.184 --> 00:08:36.340
HOST: OK.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.506
JONATHAN BUSH: I loved the
problems we were solving,

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:40.500
but once I saw what the
answer was, the seven

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.110
months of billing for
PowerPoint analysis of it

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.162
all just was torture.

00:08:45.162 --> 00:08:47.120
I think probably a lot
of people come to Google

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.460
for that reason instead
of going to [? DC. ?]

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.120
HOST: Or they've perhaps made
a stop there and end up here.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.330
JONATHAN BUSH: That's right.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:52.650
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.980
HOST: They've made the stop
there and they end up here.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.610
We definitely have
a lot of those folks

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.060
here, as you imagine.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.730
So then the time comes
to start a business.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.000
Inspiration, market--
identifying a market

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.270
opportunity, inspiration.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.040
Athena Health starts as--

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.610
JONATHAN BUSH: Yeah,
well it started

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.220
as a series of women's health.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.470
And alternative
to maternity care.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.140
A holistic approach
to maternity care.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.640
And it took all the things I
learned as an ambulance driver,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.520
as an army medic was even more
extreme examples of delegation

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.980
down below the M.D. level.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.310
And became very clear.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.520
I did the work at business
school-- Harvard Business

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.800
School is great because
people call you back.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.883
Say I'm doing research at
Harvard Business School.

00:09:37.883 --> 00:09:39.400
Oh, maybe I'll call
them back, sort

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.990
of like I'm calling from Google.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.840
I'll call back on that.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.170
And built a model that showed
that-- some breakthrough

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.137
insights like, not everybody
who's pregnant is also sick.

00:09:52.137 --> 00:09:54.220
But in the United States,
everybody who's pregnant

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.261
gets treated like they're
sick, like they're just

00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:57.534
about to blow any moment.

00:09:57.534 --> 00:09:58.700
When, in fact, it's a thing.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.810
In fact, the first
doctor turns out

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.091
to have been the subject of a
perfectly healthy pregnancy.

00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:06.720
That's a joke, because
the doctor was--

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.220
HOST: Yes.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.610
JONATHAN BUSH: And so the
idea of matching health

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.800
advocates to healthy women
and to help fewer of them

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.030
actually end up in
need of a doctor,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.930
and then matching doctors
to unhealthy women,

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.240
and therefore those women
got the benefit of a better

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.550
doctor who's actually
spending all of their time

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.640
with sick moms.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.770
Created better doctors,
much lower cost of care.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.042
And it was great, except
we ran it into the ground

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:37.250
because we couldn't get paid.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.460
We couldn't figure out all
of the various accounting.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.210
Get the hospital
information, and the lab,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.730
and the pharmacy, and
the anesthesiologists,

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.462
and the neonatologists
all in one picture.

00:10:46.462 --> 00:10:47.920
We couldn't even
get our own claims

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.380
paid because there was no
code for a nutritionist doing

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.900
a visit instead of a midwife,
even though the exact right

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.190
person to do it was a midwife.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.316
Or nutritionist, et cetera.

00:10:55.316 --> 00:10:57.564
HOST: So can you just slow
down on that point for just

00:10:57.564 --> 00:10:58.300
a second.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.840
The year is what when
this is happening?

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.400
JONATHAN BUSH: This
was '97 through '99.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.160
HOST: '97 through '99.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.580
Explain again how you
had trouble getting paid.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.700
Again, a lot of folks in this
audience will understand that.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.140
But this video will be posted on
YouTube if 280,000 subscribers

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.060
to that YouTube channel.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.290
And so while they'll be
very thoughtful people,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.872
they may need a
little bit more--

00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:26.580
JONATHAN BUSH: So you
guys on the street.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.544
You ever get a bill in
the mail from a visit

00:11:31.544 --> 00:11:33.710
and it's got the thing you
tear off in the envelope,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.959
and then it says
this is not a bill?

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:39.250
You ever get one of those,
like from a lab like LabCorp

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.965
or whatever, and
you're like-- it

00:11:40.965 --> 00:11:42.530
says amount due and everything,
but it says this is not a bill,

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.988
and you're like,
well what do I do?

00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:47.420
Or an EOB for your kids it's got
lots of little rows and columns

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.320
and codes, and you're
like so what do I do?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.460
Doctors, they do
that-- that's all--

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.399
it's like filing
your taxes every day.

00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.940
That's what it's
like being a doctor.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.745
Everybody you see, everything
you do has to be defended.

00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:07.570
It has to be charged for
in one of 7,000 different--

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.900
what's called CPT.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.980
Procedure codes.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.510
And then the
procedure codes need

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.740
to be defended by
one of 10,000--

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:19.099
soon going to 140,000
different ICD diagnostic codes.

00:12:19.099 --> 00:12:20.890
And then you have to
write little bits that

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.300
explaine why those were
the right diagnostic codes.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.820
And then you file your
taxes-- file your claim,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.740
and you get this paid.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.640
Well that is
exhausting if you do

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.560
it exactly the way
everyone else does it.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.440
But if you try to mix it up
and do a bundle of things that

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.920
aren't normally bundled
together or use somebody that

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.130
isn't the doctor
that usually does it,

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.520
the coding and defending
and documenting

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.560
and tax filing energy
goes right up to 11.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.956
And that's what Athena ran into.

00:12:47.956 --> 00:12:50.080
And that's what everybody
in health care runs into.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.163
I want to do it better, I
want to do it different.

00:12:52.163 --> 00:12:55.200
And then they find out what
it takes to just do it at all

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.220
and they get bogged down.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.650
The notion of a
health care cloud.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.620
Just like Google with-- I
mean, I don't know the age.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:09.490
But the amazingness of Google
is hard to put into words.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.510
You just put the
words in the box,

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.610
and it pretty much gives you
the thing you're looking for.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.470
That's ridonculous.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.230
I mean, that's amazing.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.960
Right?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.300
I don't get it,
but it's awesome.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.961
And what health care
doesn't have-- now

00:13:23.961 --> 00:13:25.210
health care is more difficult.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.293
There's security issues
and there's privacy issues

00:13:27.293 --> 00:13:29.000
and there's
complexity issues that

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.450
make that just calling what's
out there not sufficient.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.350
But it seems like
we were thinking

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.190
at the time, God it would be
great if some of this muck

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.030
could just be called and handled
and linked in the background.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.770
And I could say in English what
I did, or what I want to do,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.500
and why.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.620
And then whoever needs to
speak claims-ish or filing-ish

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.030
can translate it through
Google translator

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.320
and tell whichever claims
system that needs to know.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.600
And that was where Athena-- it
was the idea of not being able

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.100
to sufficiently code
for, get paid for,

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.220
exchange information
around what we were doing

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.179
that caused us to start
to build our own cloud.

00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:10.636
They couldn't afford
the enterprise

00:14:10.636 --> 00:14:11.610
software was available.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.020
We had a-- my co-founder's
younger brother

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.080
was president of the
Harvard computer club.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.130
They were like the
technical support people

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.662
that volun-- that you could
pay to join at Harvard.

00:14:20.662 --> 00:14:22.620
And he got two of his
friends and they came out

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.470
for the summer.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.560
HOST: And this was in San Diego?

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.393
JONATHAN BUSH: Yeah.

00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:28.350
And they-- we were all living
in these two flop houses

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.730
where we all took
little spaces of carpet.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.380
Really good
wall-to-wall carpeting.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.370
So we just thought
it's so clean.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.620
HOST: That's a '90s thing too.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.453
JONATHAN BUSH: Yeah.

00:14:36.453 --> 00:14:37.100
Use it.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.310
And it was great.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.100
And it was amazing tacorias, so
we didn't-- the food was fine.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.020
And--

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.010
HOST: We'll get to why
you ever left in a--

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.176
JONATHAN BUSH: It was tough.

00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:47.050
It was tough.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.610
If it wasn't for
my then wife saying

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.070
she'd leave me-- which she
did anyway 10 years later,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.200
I'd still be there.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.440
For good reason,
I'm a workaholic.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.650
But wow.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.900
Amazing experience.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.720
And what he started
to say-- what our CTO

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.850
and what other guys started
to say is, look-- you,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.331
we should just write this.

00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:10.830
We should just write
this ourselves.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:16.190
We were downloading stuff
into Microsoft Access tables

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.700
and pivoting and
figuring out what

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.210
we needed to report
to whom that way.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.644
But after a while, it-- why
can't we just write this.

00:15:22.644 --> 00:15:24.560
And so we started writing
a little applet that

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.595
crawled the state
Medicaid website.

00:15:26.595 --> 00:15:28.530
In California, it's
called Metacal,

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.120
to see if people-- they put
in different-- screen scrape

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.982
different names or numbers
that we had from our front desk

00:15:33.982 --> 00:15:35.440
and see if we could
figure out they

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.236
were covered that month
for state assistance.

00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:40.610
And then we started figuring
out how to automatically add

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.050
the modifiers that you have to
use to do the same coding when

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.870
it's a midwife seeing the
patient instead of a doctor.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.166
And little by little
by little-- what we now

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:50.790
call lean development,
but at the time,

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:55.160
we called just fix one
more thing development.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.210
It started to grow
like wall mold

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.910
through different
parts of the practice.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.720
And pretty soon,
even though I'd said

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.480
I went to the temple
of capitalism,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.380
I know the theory of
comparative advantage.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.270
We're a health care company,
not a technology company.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.769
Therefore we will
buy our technology

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:15.340
and and trade and build our
health care service experience.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.580
It just happened.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.760
The wonderful thing about
Perl and internet coding

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.730
and the lean
development process that

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.050
is allowed in that we can
talk about the software

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.630
enabled service business model.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.340
It almost takes on
a life of its own.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.410
It almost starts to-- It's
so easy for so many people

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.794
to see the problem.

00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.710
And it's so easy to solve
it, and it's so hard

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.990
to stop them from solving the
problem that it sort of just

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.950
goes at the pace
of the imagination.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.700
As opposed to, we're
going to have a plan,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.040
we're going to march out,
we're going to set up,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.850
we're going to climb
the hill, and then we're

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:46.340
all going to do it.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.256
And at the end of the
year, have another plan.

00:16:48.256 --> 00:16:51.280
It's more of a jazz
band than an orchestra.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.370
HOST: So the business
model essentially changes

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.500
from a service--

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.666
JONATHAN BUSH: That's right.

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:58.460
We decided that we
were too far ahead.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.501
That we were a business
that needed a health care

00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:01.645
cloud to exist.

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:04.270
And so what we were going to do
is build the health care cloud.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.130
We were going to build-- So we
changed the vision statement

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:06.609
of the company.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.150
It was Athena Women's
Health is going

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:14.300
to be a management
infrastructure that

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.359
helps make women's
health work as it should.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.749
And we switched it
to Athena Health--

00:17:18.749 --> 00:17:21.230
not Athena Women's Health--
will be an information

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.099
infrastructure that helps make
health care work as it should.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.819
And once we did that,
we were opened up

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.605
to selling to anybody.

00:17:28.605 --> 00:17:30.480
And they didn't have to
use our unique model.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.854
They could be any
way they wanted

00:17:31.854 --> 00:17:33.470
as long as they
wanted to connect.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.810
And that that connection
fabric would somehow, someday

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:41.650
be the sub strata that people
could then build businesses

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.920
on top of.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.820
And sure enough,
the book is exciting

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.681
because that was this
ridiculous idea 16, 15 years ago

00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:51.180
to try to keep
people from quitting.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:51.840
I'm like, wait.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.100
No, no!

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:52.710
You don't understand.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.990
Because then it's going to
be like this sub strata,

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.410
and then there's going to
be all these Athena Women's

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.599
Health that are built on
top, and you're like, OK,

00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.890
I won't quit for another month.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.900
But stop with the
talk about the stuff.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.992
And here's whatever
there are in the book.

00:18:04.992 --> 00:18:06.200
I mean, there's tons of them.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.112
But there's like five
or six in the book

00:18:08.112 --> 00:18:10.070
that have-- folks that
have actually done that.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.520
So it's actually happening.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.960
HOST: Right.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.670
So talk a little bit about
actually now building

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.639
a new technology company.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:18.430
Maybe a little bit.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.250
Because in the crowd
here, we probably

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.040
have-- even though
you'd like all of them

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.050
to work for Athena
forever and we'd

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.520
like all the Googlers to
work at Google forever.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.570
They won't, because they're
smart, they're young,

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.290
they're ambitious, they'll
have their own ideas.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:32.790
JONATHAN BUSH: They're
getting very big.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.150
It's scary.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.920
HOST: Talk a little
bit about what

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.400
it was like to actually
build this new company.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.900
JONATHAN BUSH: Maybe
we should throw

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.820
in your question about
the software and--

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.370
HOST: --and still
I'll make it a two

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.060
parter about software
enabled services.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.120
And so, essentially, the concept
of building this new company

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.200
in what is a new
category, not SAS,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.880
but software enabled services.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.150
What do you mean by that,
and how did you build that?

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.827
JONATHAN BUSH: So we didn't--
we named it in retrospect,

00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:03.410
because what we wanted to point
out to people was that we were

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.300
not SAS.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.060
So you have the--
if you think about,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.300
if you go to science museum
to the Paleolithic exhibit

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.234
way back in the cro magnon, here
are there enterprise software.

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:13.900
And you pay millions
of dollars, and you

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.314
receive what amounts to a disk.

00:19:15.314 --> 00:19:16.730
And then you buy
machines, and you

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.560
have consultants which are
these three legged punched that

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:27.045
come and burn in stuff and load
up stuff, and download stuff.

00:19:27.045 --> 00:19:28.670
And then they have
classes where people

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.630
come to learn how
to follow the ritual

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.740
of that particular
enterprise software.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.936
Then there are ASPs
that come after that,

00:19:34.936 --> 00:19:37.435
and these are where they have
professional consultants where

00:19:37.435 --> 00:19:38.560
you don't have to buy them.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.910
They just are always there
backing it up and hosting it

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.451
and doing the
downloads, and you just

00:19:42.451 --> 00:19:43.780
pay a little more every month.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.160
And then suddenly, in
comes in a chariot Mark

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.810
Benioff and you guys.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.530
And you guys-- although you
guys have a way cooler business

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.030
model.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.650
But companies that say, listen.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.820
I'm going to just have
one copy of this thing

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.140
up in the world native
on the internet.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.950
And if you like it the way it
is, you can come and use it.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.040
And you're not going to
have to get trained on it,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.570
it's not going to be
installed or downloaded.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.300
And if you've been
using it for a while,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.750
I'm going to start
to charge you.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.134
Or I'm going to
start to sell-- I'm

00:20:15.134 --> 00:20:17.300
going to start to show you
stuff that you didn't ask

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.150
for so that I can charge
someone else, either way.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.200
And so it's a tool that is used
by people to either service

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.530
themselves or service others
native on the internet.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.640
And then the break from
there-- which the muse for me

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.320
is [? BASOS-- ?] but
we view ourselves

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.400
as an industrial strength,
narrower, deeper Amazon--

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.450
is that the software, the
tool is no longer the product.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.320
It's not the monetizable thing.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.760
It's just the store into which
you go to get the service.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.370
So Amazon sells the arrival
of stuff in your life.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.810
Either shipped to you,
hover crafted to you,

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.440
or squirted to your Kindle.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.120
And when you get that
stuff, a little piece of it

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.480
goes to Jeffrey.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:03.980
Right?

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:04.979
And he's a peaceful man.

00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:10.070
He just wants a little piece
of everything in the world.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.610
And God bless him.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.810
But what it does is, it
changes his business model.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.720
Because now he's
not only in charge

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.620
of making a software work.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.000
He's making sure
that people actually

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.460
use the software in
a way that he desires

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.060
and get outcomes that they
desire in order to monetize.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.040
So Athena-- now,
anybody can use Athena.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.980
And we don't charge
you until you

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.630
get a claim paid,
or a chart filed,

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.080
or a patient in your office.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:36.880
It is the event.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.660
It is the work being done
that generates the revenue.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.610
And so if we use the
internet, or carrier pigeons,

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.040
or 2000 people in India
data entering paper forms

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.610
that the insurance
company just can't

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.690
seem to give us electronically,
that's all good.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.380
It can be knowledge,
it can be software,

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.070
and it can be bone
crushing work.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.320
Forklifts included.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.890
As long as the result gets
got, the revenue is driven.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:09.910
That idea opens up so much
of the pre-internet world

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.060
to new businesses.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.612
And we found one, but
there are countless others.

00:22:14.612 --> 00:22:16.070
And that idea of
a software enabled

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.610
service was-- the way it
started for us was we started

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.477
as a service that didn't
even want software.

00:22:22.477 --> 00:22:23.060
We said, look.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.770
We want a piece of your profits
as a women's health practice.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.570
And they said sure,
and then we said, OK.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.940
How about a piece of your
revenues as any practice?

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.460
And little by little, we
keep designing our products

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.570
around a piece of the success.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.380
Whatever success is defined
as, a little piece of it.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.130
Which liberates us to do
the kind of lean developing

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.340
that a SAS company
can do, but add

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.450
non-software, non-technology
arms and legs around it to make

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.591
it go faster.

00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:51.090

as a competitor,
as an opportunity--

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.800
JONATHAN BUSH: --Look, I think
those are really well run

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.900
fabulous companies
of another era.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.050
And that era, I see as over.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:35.000
But I get to sit at
the theoretical helm

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.890
of this incredibly ambitious
visionary group of people that

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.300
are constantly pushing,
and pushing, and pushing.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.610
Not every hospital is sitting
at the helm of such a ship.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.880
And so something safe that's
of an era that they understand,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.850
where parking places are
part of your comp packet

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.050
with the little name on it.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.760
And think about
hospitals, right?

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.100
So a safe thing that's
been going on for years

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.400
that uses the same ecosystem of
consultants, and specialists,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.580
and vendors, and
allows the same career

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.010
paths that have
always been there.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.790
Going to be the
CIO of a hospital

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.090
and there's a special
trade association for them

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.350
and-- it's hard to imagine
letting all of that

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.930
go until it's very,
very, very safe.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:20.430
There's that wonderful
book Crossing

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.470
the Chasm of-- invention
is amazing and it works,

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.790
and the early adaptors
who would happily

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.120
deal with all the works
of a new invention,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.400
make you feel like you
finally cracked the code.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.940
And then you get to your
mainstream customers,

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.570
and they're like,
Jesus this is a mess.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.350
I hate this.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.440
And you have to go through
this horrible chasm of making

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.240
your new age thing work as
reliably as the old age did.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.940
And health care is that way.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.420
So we're having to
get though to a place

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.850
where the safety
that people associate

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:53.070
with Cerner and Epic,
which are not safe.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:58.920
They're systems are down 10,
20, 30 times more than ours are.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.510
And none of the systems
correlate the performance.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.102
Epic doesn't lose money
if they lose your claims

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:05.560
or if you lose your
claims on Epic.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.150
They don't lose
money if your doctors

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.640
don't document their charts.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.730
There's no correlation
between your performance

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.460
and their performance
like there is with Athena.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.945
But still, that's a scary step.

00:25:19.407 --> 00:25:20.990
So was electricity,
and we seem to all

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.240
be OK with that at this point.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.790
So was the internet, we seem to
be banging away on that, so--

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.790
HOST: --Do you find that
you're getting traction

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:32.230
with the concept of software
enabled as opposed to SAS?

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.050
JONATHAN BUSH: For those
who-- for the elites

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.860
that are listening to this
YouTube, I think they get it.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.470
So when one of our salespeople
gets in front of somebody

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.990
and actually explains the
difference, it's easy.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.060
The word cloud helps people.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.470
So thank God Microsoft spent
all that money for everybody

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:49.830
on the cloud apps.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.100
Let's go to the cloud, kids.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.890
Remember that?

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.660
The idea of somebody
who's actually

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.540
going to look out for
your particular stuff

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.760
in a space, the
iCloud-- that helped.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.220
Because people--
now those things

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.680
don't work at the level
of security and fidelity

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.800
that Athena net does.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.900
Shouldn't have to for your
photos or your whatever.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.170
But the fact that
at least it's a term

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.460
that people can grock and
can start to get ahold of.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.930
And that's helping us.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:21.070
And Epocrates, which
every doctor understands

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.507
and half of doctors
use every day, helps.

00:26:24.507 --> 00:26:26.840
HOST: Talk more about that,
because some of the audience

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.660
may not be aware that you
guys acquired Epocrates.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.590
JONATHAN BUSH: We did.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.590
HOST: What do they do,
why did you acquire them,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.160
how's it playing out?

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.900
JONATHAN BUSH: Epocrates is
the best known and loved--

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.280
in terms of Net
Promoter Score brand

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.600
in the world of
practicing physicians.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.170
So that's what we love
the most about it.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.000
We also love all the things that
they have done over the last 15

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.030
years to earn that love.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.800
I like the way they
think and operate.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.760
It is a decision support tool.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.570
It's a read-only app
that a doctor whips out

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.120
in the moment of
care it says I'm

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.560
going to raise your dose
because this one's not working.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.120
But I just want to
check to make sure

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.770
that this works on men
the way I think it does,

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.250
or at your weight.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:11.260
Or whether the on brand,
whether the off brand generic

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.750
is just as effective.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.130
Little questions
that they're not

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.180
familiar with
because they're not

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.490
doing that prescription
enough that they know it cold,

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.881
they'll check it.

00:27:18.881 --> 00:27:21.380
There was a thing called the
physician's desk reference back

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.160
in the day which was this
book, and they'd say, just

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.100
one minute, and
they'd go out and make

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.560
sure they weren't killing
you with the wrong dose.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.290
Epocrates is sort of a living,
breathing, interactive version

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.570
of that.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.600
And it gives us half
the doctors eyeballs

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.320
in the country on a
very regular basis.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.429
And it gives us the
opportunity to use the plumbing

00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:43.470
that we've been building.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.900
There are now
100,000 connections

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.710
between Athena net and Legacy
Systems labs, pharmacies,

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.100
hospitals, and more
being built every day.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.580
And now Epocrates can
start to be wired up

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.922
like your Xfinity remote.

00:27:55.922 --> 00:27:57.630
Back in that day,
remember the first time

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.020
you sent an email
off your BlackBerry

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.000
and there was in your Outlook
account, and you're like,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.708
that was awesome!

00:28:01.708 --> 00:28:04.820
I didn't even do a
cable, and it's there.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.930
That opportunity to just
stop going into these bowel

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.302
based enterprise
software products

00:28:11.302 --> 00:28:13.052
but but still have
them if the hospital is

00:28:13.052 --> 00:28:14.270
going to be stuck on them.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.420
To be able to drive them
like your Xfinity remote

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.710
can change your channel
if you work at Google

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.960
and you actually can
figure out how to do it.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:27.170
That idea is the potentiality
for us of Epocrates.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:32.292
HOST: So working to
expectations to date?

00:28:32.292 --> 00:28:33.500
JONATHAN BUSH: Half and half.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.450
So what they've done
to earn the trust

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:39.570
and loyalty of physicians,
they continue to do.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.370
If bombs were going
off, if the Syrians

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.450
were taking over
San Francisco, they

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.740
would still be doing it
with barrel bombs going off.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.030
They have not made money.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:54.375
And so we have to help them
with that is a good thing.

00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:55.250
That's the one thing.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.060
And we will.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.650
We will, because
otherwise, we'll die

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.640
and we'll all be out of a job.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.390
But I think we can do it.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.474
It's not going to be hard.

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:03.223
HOST: What's the--

00:29:03.223 --> 00:29:05.650
JONATHAN BUSH: --sort of like
saying gravity is a thing.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:06.830
You need the revenue, and--

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.090
HOST: Right.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:12.470
Is there a next big
hurdle for Athena Health?

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.970
Or is it--

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:13.440
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.190
HOST: What's the next biggest--

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.023
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:15.023 --> 00:29:18.460
JONATHAN BUSH: I mean this
is a $2 trillion mess.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.040
Just a-- nobody understands it,
doctors don't understand it,

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.340
everybody feels-- and
I want to say this.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.950
The thing about
health care that gets

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.280
me is not how expensive it is.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.420
That gets me a little.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:31.470
But really kind
of just cuts at me

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.000
is that for all that money,
now taken by force of law--

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.910
you can't opt out.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.020
It really isn't an
expression of our humanity.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.560
Think about everything on what
we're wearing, where we work,

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.150
where we travel,
whether we travel,

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.250
who we date-- everything we
do with our personal power

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.682
is a way of tricking ourselves
out and being a person.

00:29:48.682 --> 00:29:50.390
And we can change it
if we don't like it,

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.860
and we do many
times before we die.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.760
Somehow, health care--
you just take it.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.830
You just pay for it.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.220
It gets taken out
your check like taxes,

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.040
and then you just get this
experience that you don't like.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.330
Or that you do, but it's
a pleasant surprise.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.220
It's not like you're
in charge and they're

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.720
jumping to get to you.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.880
They're not doing
product management

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.380
to be more appealing.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.030
When you see research-- 85%
of Medicare beneficiaries

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.880
don't receive their
Medicare wellness visit.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.412
All the research talks
about these idiot Medicare

00:30:18.412 --> 00:30:18.995
beneficiaries.

00:30:18.995 --> 00:30:21.540
I'm like, you mean my parents?

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.590
Well maybe your
wellness visit sucks.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.020
How about that?

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.570
Why don't you do it more
interesting than you do it?

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.630
If you explain what happened
in a way that's fun,

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.060
why don't you do product
management the way

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.440
other businesses do?

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.690
And I totally forgot how
I got on this tangent.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.235
So everything in health care,
if connected and analyzed,

00:30:42.235 --> 00:30:45.480
could start to have
a demand curve it.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.512
Could start to be something
that could do better

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.220
with product management
and good pricing,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.927
and do worse without it.

00:30:50.927 --> 00:30:52.010
And that would be amazing.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:57.067
So insurance companies need to
be threatened with extinction.

00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:59.150
All the cost management,
and the accounting firms,

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.180
and all these guys who are
doing these one offs little

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.880
spreadsheets and mailing them
to the doctors about their taxes

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.540
need to be threatened
with extinction.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.910
All of these manual, isolated,
guild like-- well only I

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:10.970
understand all the rules.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:12.840
Only I can speak to Oz.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.620
All of those guys need to be
threatened with extinction

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.790
with some kind of product.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.920
Even if it's a piece of crap,
low end disruptive product,

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.500
at least it wakes
people up to the idea

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.480
that maybe-- like you guys are
doing with travel and movies,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.761
and you're sort of nipping.

00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:28.760
It's not quite-- I don't
use you for the movies,

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.770
but maybe I do a little
sometimes just to piss

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.970
off Fandango.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.720
I just want to-- I love
that everywhere there's

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.682
somebody nipping at the
heels of these guilds.

00:31:39.682 --> 00:31:42.140
Making sure they're earning
the right for these I'm unique,

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.810
only I understand,
only I can speak

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.340
to Oz pricing and performance.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:51.200
And so that-- health insurance,
laboratories, pharmacies,

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.580
in-patient care,
home nursing care.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.510
Self care.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.280
We got nothing
going on self care.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.050
Why aren't our Fitbits
connected to our charts?

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.175
Why don't our doctor wake
up when we're behind?

00:32:01.175 --> 00:32:03.710
Or why don't we get a
really serious discount when

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:05.810
we do actually run
every day for six months

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.690
instead of a stupid exploding
thing on the Nike app?

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:09.700
Like, yay.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.090
Nike likes me.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.000
HOST: And you've paid
them a lot to like you.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.125
JONATHAN BUSH: Yeah, right.

00:32:15.125 --> 00:32:17.290
For $150 I'd like you too.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.160
So I mean, I'd like
some real money.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.460
I'm spending real money.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.754
Look at our employees-- I
don't know, $20 million?

00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:24.170
That's I know for
you guys, that's

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.110
valet tips at the Google garage.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.659
But for us, $20 million
is a ton of money

00:32:28.659 --> 00:32:30.450
to spend on something
that we make people--

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.350
you have to pay it.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.890
And no matter whether
you like it, like ah.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.970
Yeah.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.370
Doesn't feel good.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.080
It's expensive and amazing.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.860
OK.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.460
We're rich.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.670
Rich country, rich company,
let's-- but if it's rich

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.567
and lame--

00:32:48.567 --> 00:32:51.150
HOST: I'm going to come back to
the industry in just a second.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.790
And I want to get back to the
journey for just a moment.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:57.540
You had beautiful soft
shag carpets, tacquerias.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.050
But you're in Watertown now.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.697
JONATHAN BUSH: Yeah.

00:33:00.697 --> 00:33:02.030
HOST: Why move the company here?

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:07.020
JONATHAN BUSH: Well we founded
the company at 94 Codman Road.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.830
There's a temple
built there now.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:15.287
A beautiful-- OK, so there's
an apple tree which I planted.

00:33:15.287 --> 00:33:16.370
And they haven't cut down.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.219
But it's a ranch house by
the Codman farm in Lincoln.

00:33:20.219 --> 00:33:21.260
And it was a split level.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.810
So down the split
was the world HQ

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.090
of Athena Health and
the washer and dryer.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.382
And up the split was the
home of the Bush family.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:31.340
And then in the yard was
the conference center,

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.009
which was a Jeep Wagoneer
where we kept flip charts.

00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:36.300
The big paper with the markers,
and we'd have meetings.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.265
We dropped the gate down.

00:33:39.265 --> 00:33:41.140
And then when we got--
we're like, well let's

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.723
just get a local
medical group that we

00:33:42.723 --> 00:33:44.690
can work on as our alpha site.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.550
And none of them listened.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:49.262
None of them--
absolutely not, we're not

00:33:49.262 --> 00:33:50.720
going to let you
touch anything it.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.007
Go away.

00:33:52.007 --> 00:33:53.465
And then we found
a bunch of kooks.

00:33:53.465 --> 00:33:56.240
I had to actually miss
my accounting exam

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.539
at Harvard Business school.

00:33:57.539 --> 00:34:00.080
I went to the guy and said, I
don't want to fail your course,

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.190
but I will if I
have to because I

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.000
have to be out of
town for your final.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.410
He said, what on earth would
make you want to do that?

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.760
Said well it's the only
time of the American College

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.250
of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.070
convention in Vegas.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.070
I said, you know I've
been teaching for 30 years

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.440
and I had thought
up until this moment

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.715
that I had heard
everything but that.

00:34:18.715 --> 00:34:20.465
And he let me-- it was
before cellphones--

00:34:20.465 --> 00:34:23.829
he let me take the exam
at his house in Belmont.

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:25.870
Put me in a taxi and said,
OK, go to the airport,

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.360
don't talk to anyone.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:32.900
And I went and I found basically
the only obstetricians that

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.330
were in the right combination
of brilliant visionary status

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.389
and about to go out of business.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.719
Where they would let a bunch
of guys who shared laptops

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:41.960
for savings to save money.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.310
Like, hey, can I use a
laptop? -- to take them over.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:47.859
And we raised the
amount of money

00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:50.150
that we would need to basically
populate their accounts

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.519
receivable from angel investors.

00:34:52.519 --> 00:34:53.310
So we did that all.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.330
Our world headquarters
was 94 Codman,

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.120
but the group happened
to be in San Diego.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.835
So it was like, San
Diego or nobody.

00:34:59.835 --> 00:35:03.930
And since we fancied ourselves
a global national chain

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.920
of women's health centers, who
cares what your first one is?

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.885
Because we were going
to migrate pods.

00:35:08.885 --> 00:35:10.010
They were going to be pods.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.360
We'd buy six doctors
in every market

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.526
and then hire hundreds of
midwives and nutritionists

00:35:13.526 --> 00:35:15.860
around them-- a dual license.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.260
And so it was like,
what's the difference?

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.150
So we went for six months,
and it was really in bad shape

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.230
after six months.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.860
But we said, we have to declare
victory because if we don't get

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.170
another pod soon, we won't--
we're going to run out

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.120
of the money.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.190
And and no one will give
us more money when there's

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.180
flames in the waiting room
and everybody's unhappy.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.150
HOST: We found--
just want to talk

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.160
for a minute about
the local market

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.290
again for people who
might be pursuing

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.780
their own dreams at some point.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.885
We've had Bill [? Helman ?]
from Greylock in here to talk--

00:35:45.885 --> 00:35:47.010
JONATHAN BUSH: --Great guy.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.840
HOST: --to talk about
the local market.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.390
JONATHAN BUSH:
--Greylock dumped me.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.740
Would not put the money.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.960
I send him my quarterly.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.760
I send him my quarterly every
quarter, thinking of you.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.530
HOST: I did not know that.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:01.880
I did not know that.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.380
JONATHAN BUSH: He's
actually invited

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.340
me to speak to his
annual partners meeting

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.499
in the spirit of humility.

00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:10.040
He's going to have me go through
play by play all the times I

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.630
tried to go to Greylock and
got shown then [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.940
HOST: OK.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.190
JONATHAN BUSH: Good guy, Bill.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.480
But fabulous-- and
fabulous friend.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.220
HOST: We spoke a lot about
the local environment

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.230
as a place to start
and grow a business.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.862
Do you have a view
on this market

00:36:26.862 --> 00:36:28.320
JONATHAN BUSH: I
share Bill's view,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:32.420
but I like-- I love the story
of Brer Fox and the Briar Patch.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.340
Don't throw me in the
briar pa-- you know.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.150
And then if you learn how
to be in the briar patch,

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.840
you win in the briar patch.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.350
Right?

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:41.070
This is the briar patch.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.680
It's got reg-- it's
the most business

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:48.640
unfriendly, bureaucratic, up
in the nose, attitude emporium.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.330
But you've got a huge
amount of intellect,

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.370
a huge amount of capital,
and a huge amount of problem

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:56.030
to solve.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.350
Like the cost of health
care here is off the charts.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.010
The amount of
financial management

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.170
that goes on wastefully
here is off the charts.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.348
And so if you choose
a briar patch business

00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:07.556
plan that isn't sort of,
invent something really neat

00:37:07.556 --> 00:37:09.450
and go instantly
viral really fast,

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:11.040
this is a bad place for that.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.870
But if you choose a
thorny, messy place that's

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.882
going to take a lot of
work, this is a great place.

00:37:16.882 --> 00:37:18.340
Because you get
all these-- I mean,

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.920
we get amazing resumes from
people at Parner's Health that

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.760
are brilliant people,
that are passionate,

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.020
that work long hours, that
could grock technology as well

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.461
as anybody at Google or Athena.

00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:31.085
But they thought
that-- how many of you

00:37:31.085 --> 00:37:32.540
know any of these people.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.930
Krishna?

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.999
We're like, this isn't
change-- this is not

00:37:35.999 --> 00:37:37.790
the world changing
things I thought it was.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.330
I'm trolling the
halls, it's political.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.490
I'm not sure that I'm
being as efficacious as I

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:43.990
thought I would be.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.550
It's not like I
thought it would be,

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.780
and yet I still want to
be part of health care.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.400
And we can Hoover those
people up and use them.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.110
So it's a great
place for intellect,

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.210
and for passion--
for social mission.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.320
It's not a place where
it's like, quick, happy

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.570
go lucky virally
explode across anything.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:07.480
But if you want to be down in
a hard trench for a long timee,

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.890
I think it's really good.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:10.900
And the fact that
[? Helman's ?] disappointed

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.219
is kind of perfect.

00:38:12.219 --> 00:38:14.510
HOST: But he actually speaks
very highly of the market.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.920
JONATHAN BUSH: Good.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.260
HOST: He speaks very
highly of the market.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.384
JONATHAN BUSH: He told me
that he cried once to me,

00:38:18.384 --> 00:38:20.259
oh, my partners in San
Francisco's are making

00:38:20.259 --> 00:38:22.550
all the money and I have to
be at the helm of the ship.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.500
I can't get anybody to
do anything great here.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.708
HOST: Well, I think that's
the challenge he spoke to.

00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:29.489
He thinks that the potential
is all here, but we haven't--

00:38:29.489 --> 00:38:31.030
JONATHAN BUSH: Well
what he has to do

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.321
and what the next generation
of entrepreneurs has to do

00:38:33.321 --> 00:38:35.960
is-- hats off to the
Google guys and the fact

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.130
that they went out--
you ever read that book

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:44.400
Nicholas Taleb
Nassim, Black Swan.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.270
Extremist stand.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:48.190
And they went from
zero to a billion

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.692
to a Google really fast.

00:38:50.692 --> 00:38:52.150
And there are those
business plans,

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.547
and, San Francisco is tuned.

00:38:53.547 --> 00:38:55.130
When one of those
pops, they're ready.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.785
They know how to go that way.

00:38:56.785 --> 00:38:59.670
It's like the movie, Wag the Dog
in its description of the movie

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.220
industry.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.970
They know tho to call, and
everyone knows what to do

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.280
and it all comes together.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.490
Boston is not that.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.670
But the next generation
of successful businesses

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.570
aren't going to go
from zero to Google.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.820
There'll be those every once
in while, one will go off

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.180
and you'll see it boom.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.610
But there'll be a lot of
really, really fast compared

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.650
old fashioned companies
but really, really

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.210
slow compared to
instant viral companies.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.550
And that's where I think
the sweet spot of Boston is.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.395
HOST: And I think-- not to
misrepresent Bill-- again,

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:24.895
potential--

00:39:24.895 --> 00:39:27.228
JONATHAN BUSH: --We just beat
the crap out of poor Bill.

00:39:27.228 --> 00:39:30.420
HOST: Capital intellect
culture lacking.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.900
Particularly a
mentoring culture--

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.200
JONATHAN BUSH:
--And that's right.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.910
A mentoring and a
social mission culture.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:39.340
There is a very-- it's a
little bit narcissistic

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.850
and it's extremely
mercenary in San Francisco.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.480
It's quick and it's
no hard feelings.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.360
It's great because
it's failure friendly.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.860
it's like, hey, I tried, I'm
going to pic up my sleeping bag

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.480
and my port-a-fridge I'm
going to go to another startup

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.310
and do it again.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.230
And I'll either be a billionaire
or I'll be picking up my fridge

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.060
and going somewhere else.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:57.800
And it's fine.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.860
And that mercenary-ness is
good for a lot of businesses.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.562
And we've done so much
with the internet because

00:40:03.562 --> 00:40:05.770
of those mercenary businesses
that don't mind failing

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.310
and don't mind regenerating.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.160
But there is another
sector-- what

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.580
I would call the
fiduciary sector-- which

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.870
has been over-regulated.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.460
As soon as we care too
much about baby precious,

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.130
we let baby precious get fat,
and he's spoiled, and he cries

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:19.930
and we give him whatever he
wants because we're afraid

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:20.596
he'll get upset.

00:40:20.596 --> 00:40:23.269
And we've got a bunch of
sectors of our society

00:40:23.269 --> 00:40:24.060
that are like that.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.430
Transportation and auto and
financial services and health

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:29.360
care.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.730
We're big fat incompetent--
oh, but I need a subsidy.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.480
But no you don't,
you need to die

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.170
and we need to get
your people out and put

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.620
them to work in real companies.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.010
But there are social goods.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.490
They're quazi-social
goods and we

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.380
are afraid of hurting
our safety net.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.320
And so we, for good reasons,
create sclerosis-- moats

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.560
around them.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.310
And we can still do it.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:53.736
We can still-- this
book talks about ways

00:40:53.736 --> 00:40:54.860
of doing it in health care.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.110
It can be done in
transportation.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.390
It can be done in education, it
can be done in law enforcement.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.973
All these places that are hyper
regulated and over protective,

00:41:00.973 --> 00:41:03.020
and therefore when
you watch them operate

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.760
from the outside whe you're
used to the Google way of moving

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.760
people through the
office or doing anything,

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.270
you're like-- I would
shoot myself on my 3rd day

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.700
at the police
department watching

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.970
the way they have to do a report
downtown when they show up

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.090
at a traffic
accident or whatever.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:21.760
And so those opportunities
are waiting for us

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:26.580
to infiltrate and go more slowly
but make a more profound impact

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.360
on society when we succeed.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.030
HOST: We have a governor's
election coming up here.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.300
JONATHAN BUSH: Yes, I've heard.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.380
HOST: Any thoughts on, is there
an opportunity for a candidate

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.024
or a party or an initiative or
point of view to help at all,

00:41:39.024 --> 00:41:41.440
and if any of this is related
to health care specifically?

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.700
JONATHAN BUSH: Well,
it's very interesting.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.074
Massachusetts is
very interesting

00:41:44.074 --> 00:41:47.250
because the very centerpiece
of the Massachusetts

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.670
success over the
last 20 years has

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:53.480
been related to the development
of institutions who now are--

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.070
not through any moral
intent of their own--

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.360
like the personification
of the problem.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.046
So we are not a
little bit over bedded

00:42:01.046 --> 00:42:02.170
in terms of inpatient beds.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.710
We are massively over bedded.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.260
We're not a little
bit over priced,

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:11.050
we are hysterically
like Kafka overpriced.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.890
And so-- and there are
millions and millions

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.250
of people who work in
hair nets and blue smocks,

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.880
in unions and in
organizations of other types

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.310
and who vote who work
for those institutions.

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:25.850
And so how does the
government pivot?

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.480
Because these institutions
are strangling the worker base

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.440
and innovation base by
making the cost of everything

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.860
higher than it needs to be.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.190
But yet they are the
establishment as well.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.407
And so how do
you-- you can't say

00:42:38.407 --> 00:42:39.990
burn baby burn if
you're the governor.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.417
You know, bring down
Mass General, yeah!

00:42:42.417 --> 00:42:43.250
Not going to happen.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.291
In fact, they'll even let
them buy up more people

00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:47.347
and perfect their monopoly
in the south shore.

00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:48.930
HOST: That would be
the next question.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.420
Should they have allowed that
merger to be Attorney General

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.320
said yes to that merger?

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.111
JONATHAN BUSH: They're
so far over the path

00:42:54.111 --> 00:42:56.160
of government invasion.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.100
The things that we could
do in Massachusetts--

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.590
it's illegal to open up a
better product across the street

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:03.560
from a hospital.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.940
How about we make it
not illegal to open up

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.605
a cheaper hospital across the
street from a lame hospital?

00:43:08.605 --> 00:43:10.980
That would really help us with
our lame hospital problem.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.980
It would put a lot of
hospitals out of business,

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.490
and that is OK.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.670
Hospitals going out of business
when you're 45% over bedded.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.760
We have 45% more beds
than we actually need,

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.510
if you sort of follow
the Dartmouth study,

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:25.510
give everybody what they want,
and pay for it like it's OK.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.500
It's illegal for doctors
to work for companies,

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.310
even though entrepreneurs
do better product management

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.040
than doctors.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.790
There's all kinds of weird laws
that have sort of built up.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.830
Sort of like, you can
have beer on Sunday laws

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:38.986
or whatever-- these weird
from another era laws.

00:43:38.986 --> 00:43:40.360
And so now the
government, rather

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.170
than releasing those
laws, is actually

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.150
trying to say, but
also charge less.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.890
I'll make you, I'll sue
you, I'll investiage you.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.570
I'll send my investigators
if you don't charge less.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.530
Which is so not cool.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:59.120
It's sort of a Putin meets
Castro for the people.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.450
And so nobody is a good guy.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:06.190
There's no way for a
grass roots disruptor

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.506
to bring justice to
the over chargers.

00:44:08.506 --> 00:44:10.130
Because every time
they do these deals,

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.550
it's harder and
harder and harder

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:15.370
for the result in
regulatory deal making.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:19.170
It's fine for companies like
me with 17 lawyers on staff,

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:22.220
but not good for the dudes
at 94 Codman Road who

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.240
are like, how many minutes--
it's like, how much can you

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.730
do in six minutes when
talking to the law firm?

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:31.970
So that's the-- I see it
as-- it would be hard.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:33.490
But you'd have to
make a little pin

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:38.290
size holes in the moat, in
the walls around the health

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:40.560
establishment to
allow entrepreneurs

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.800
or just existing
players that want

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.025
to try to be entrepreneurial.

00:44:44.025 --> 00:44:45.400
And there's a lot
of that energy.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.890
Steward Health Care is a venture
backed into the struggling

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.670
Catholic hospitals and
turned into a venture backed

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.634
PE-type play.

00:44:53.634 --> 00:44:55.050
And now, they have
a lot of things

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.716
they're not allowed
to do that they want

00:44:56.716 --> 00:44:58.560
to, like close
underperforming hospitals.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.517
But if we let them,
they'd do really well.

00:45:03.517 --> 00:45:05.350
HOST: So we probably
have five minutes left.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:09.359
I'm going to try to hit two
quick questions which I think

00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:10.900
we can't contain
within five minutes,

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.130
but we're going to try.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.010
JONATHAN BUSH: I can try the
whole snippy short answer

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:14.250
thing.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:14.810
HOST: OK.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:17.770
Give it a shot.

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:21.100
Will we be able look back--
if we lok back in six years.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.730
Six years from
now we look back--

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:23.223
JONATHAN BUSH: 20/20.

00:45:23.223 --> 00:45:23.716
HOST: 20/20.

00:45:23.716 --> 00:45:25.507
JONATHAN BUSH: 20/20
vision this is called.

00:45:25.507 --> 00:45:27.200
HOST: That's right.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.180
Are we looking at--
what determines

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.206
that Obamacare-- as
we will define it,

00:45:32.206 --> 00:45:34.580
as I will use the term-- is
successful or not successful?

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.906
JONATHAN BUSH: Ah, yeah.

00:45:35.906 --> 00:45:37.364
The problem, when
you do-- when you

00:45:37.364 --> 00:45:39.830
make everybody do something,
there's no way AB test.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:41.980
So Obamacare will be a success.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:44.470
Because it'll be measured
against whatever we had,

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.730
which was nothing.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:48.232
And so, like oh, well
everyone was covered.

00:45:48.232 --> 00:45:50.190
Half the people will look
at and say half full,

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.790
and half the people will
look at and say half empty.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:53.480
And when the mood goes one
way, it'll be more than half

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.110
that are against it.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.651
And when the mood goes the other
way, it'll be less than half

00:45:56.651 --> 00:45:57.890
that are against it.

00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:58.696
Right?

00:45:58.696 --> 00:46:00.320
But because there's
no AB test, there's

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:04.030
no people who got to do another
thing besides Obamacare,

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.630
then we'll never know.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:11.140
I think in general, my
final thought on Obamacare

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.210
is it didn't do so much
harm that you can't still

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:15.860
be successful.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:20.130
You can still be an entrepreneur
in an Obamacare health care.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.332
And so, no excuses.

00:46:21.332 --> 00:46:22.290
Just get out and do it.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.590
And I'll throw in
one more thing.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:26.960
If we had done a better
job as entrepreneurs,

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.486
Obama wouldn't have
done Obamacare.

00:46:28.486 --> 00:46:29.860
It's only because
the marketplace

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.120
didn't rise up and
provide something

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.860
for the 40 million
people who opted out

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.100
that we had it in
the first place.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.350
HOST: Totally different topic.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.225
You're an author now.

00:46:41.225 --> 00:46:42.350
JONATHAN BUSH: Yeah, right.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:42.992
I paid a guy.

00:46:42.992 --> 00:46:43.783
Are you kidding me?

00:46:43.783 --> 00:46:46.961
HOST: OK, but for the parts
that you didn't pay for.

00:46:46.961 --> 00:46:49.210
JONATHAN BUSH: I was the
outline and I was the ranter.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:50.001
I ranted on my own.

00:46:50.001 --> 00:46:54.530
HOST: What did you learn about
yourself, process, rigor,

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.560
language, anything.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.393
{INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:56.393 --> 00:46:59.770
JONATHAN BUSH: I am a
huge, passionate fan

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:02.630
of rigorous process and rigorous
reevaluation of process.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:05.190
Because my personal
management of everything

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.400
is so bad that I just--
I'm in awe of anything

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.980
that can actually run
itself well from day to day.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.240
And so this book was
structured into the calendar,

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.830
there were certain days for
me to meet with Stephen,

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.996
there were half days, whole
days, two hour checkins,

00:47:17.996 --> 00:47:21.930
phone calls, and I was
under a time crunch

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.510
to get whatever I wanted
to get onto the page

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.390
onto the page within
that structure.

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:28.880
And at the end,
it was terrifying.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.499
I came back from my sabbatical
with a paper galley fat

00:47:32.499 --> 00:47:34.540
with yellow stickies and
underlines of the things

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.248
that I just couldn't
bear about the book,

00:47:36.248 --> 00:47:38.310
that we just had to
figure out how to change.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.520
Walked into my office
what my fat galley,

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:45.330
and there was the first hard
cover final copy on my desk.

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:47.780
Congrats!

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.050
So there's a certain--
there's something about,

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:54.550
everything in our life is
so fungible, so editable,

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.380
so changeable on the fly.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.170
We can lean develop
ourselves in what

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.120
we say in our speeches and
our code so continually

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.630
that forcing yourself into
a final statement that

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:11.770
will stay still is an incredibly
maturing and humbling,

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.540
and valuable, wonderful
honor to be able to have.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.370
HOST: Think you'll do it again?

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:19.450
JONATHAN BUSH: If
everyone buys two copies,

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.620
I will do another one.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.390
HOST: I do think we might
have two or three minutes.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:28.840
If there is one
or two questions.

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.460
Sure go ahead.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.740
AUDIENCE: If you
were in healthcare--

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.970
HOST: I think just
restate the question.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:33.410
JONATHAN BUSH: If I was
in charge of health care,

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.860
if I was the President
and choosing directions,

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.440
I would first choose
that presidents

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.410
don't choose directions
for 400 million people.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.160
That's what we have now,
and that's not human.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.101
That's not humanizing.

00:48:43.101 --> 00:48:45.100
It doesn't give enough
personal power to people.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.100
They don't feel in charge,
they don't feel good.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.840
Even if what they get is
amazing, it doesn't feel good.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.580
I mean I always felt like world
peace foisted on me by force

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.870
doesn't feel that great.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:55.460
Right?

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.168
Whereas world pe-- I
know that's extreme.

00:48:57.168 --> 00:48:58.110
Forget that one.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.750
Do you know what I mean?

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.760
When someone forces
you on something--

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.590
so if I was the
maximum leader, I

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.650
would try to make it possible
for many, many, many choices.

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:10.500
Many, many, many ways
of the word health

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.180
care to be expressed
throughout society.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.100
I think that's the one problem,
the biggest single problem we

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.620
have with health care the United
States today that the word

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:21.810
health care is now federally
litigated down to a very

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:23.810
specific definition of
an all-you-can-eat buffet

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:27.410
of interventions with no mental
health and no emotional support

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.260
groups and no good food.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.120
That's the definition of
health care in the country.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.480
And you are not allowed to sell
health care if it;s not that.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.580
And you look at the claims
data like, sex life, friends

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.950
at work, mean boss-- these
things correlate to health cost

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:44.847
way more than pap
smears, mammograms.

00:49:44.847 --> 00:49:47.430
Mammograms would just show now
that adverse correlation health

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.929
stats.

00:49:47.929 --> 00:49:49.340
Actually bad to get mammograms.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:49.970
Canadian study.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.420
Look it up.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:54.100
So the idea that some one
group-- no matter how smart

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.639
or well meaning-- get
to decide what it is

00:49:56.639 --> 00:49:59.180
is that thing that we ought to
be a little more humble about.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:02.560
A little more like, pull
back, get a definition

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.190
that still provides a safety
net, but is small enough

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.810
allow for a lot AB testing.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:09.810
A lot of crazy ones to come
and try on kooky stuff and say,

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:10.310
guess what?

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.990
This is my health
care, and be OK.

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.560
HOST: Thanks.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.365
We have one last one.

00:50:15.365 --> 00:50:18.032
AUDIENCE: Jonathan, you talk
about making more informed

00:50:18.032 --> 00:50:20.220
decisions-- what
if it, what if--

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.870
JONATHAN BUSH: Right, so the
question is, what-- in the book

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.970
we talk about the
ignorance economy

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:27.820
and how hard it is that
the patients don't even

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.320
understand-- if they could get
financial benefit from making

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.986
good health care
choices, how would they

00:50:31.986 --> 00:50:34.020
even know what choices to make?

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.780
I believe from an-- if you're
an entrepreneur watching this--

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.280
I don't think that
the step will be

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.540
from where we are to
patients empowered.

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.570
I think the first step will
be caregivers empowered.

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:48.040
It'll be entrepreneurs, doctors,
hospitals, these kooky clinic

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.330
types in this book
that accumulate--

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:55.250
that have enough deep
cuts of clinical knowledge

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:56.980
to understand the
coding and the referral

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.690
game and the sophisticated
payment picture

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.450
well enough that they can
start to shop and profit

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:06.360
from shopping in their
patient's behalf.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.290
Then the people
who are now trying

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.719
to get those shopping
doctor's attention

00:51:11.719 --> 00:51:13.260
will need to start
doing some product

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.850
management to explain
it to the doctor.

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:18.620
And once the doctor gets it
to where they understand it,

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:22.810
it'll be packaged close enough
that the first super consumers

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.220
will be able to shop for
it without the doctor

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.100
in the middle.

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.370
But that's-- the next decade
or two is going to be doctors

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:34.050
and those in the role of doctor
or caregiver learning to shop

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:37.339
and to profit from being really
good shoppers as fiduciaries

00:51:37.339 --> 00:51:38.130
for their patients.

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:39.440
That's the first way
of in my opinion.

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.520
That's a good one to end on.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.960
So everybody go
start a company where

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.500
you're a caregiver
shopping for consumers

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.666
and get onto Athenanet and
we will do your shit work

00:51:45.666 --> 00:51:46.930
that you hate and suck at.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:52.160
HOST: OK so on that
note, Jonathan Bush,

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.710
author of Where Does It Hurt.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.169
For those of you who were too
shy to sit in the front row--

00:51:56.169 --> 00:51:57.668
JONATHAN BUSH:
--missed a free copy.

00:51:57.668 --> 00:51:59.650
That's why they didn't
sit in the front row.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:02.360
HOST: Let's try to reserve those
for Googlers if we can, please.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.790
Sorry Athenistas, but I think
we might get something back

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.960
in profit.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.480
JONATHAN BUSH: That would be
weird if we came here and took

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.030
your food and your employees
and the books that we brought.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:10.780
HOST: So Googlers,
come grab a book.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.570
This can be found probably
in the next ten days

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:15.570
on our YouTube channel.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:19.120
I think it's at talks Google
is the YouTube channel.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.190
But just search for
talks at Google.

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:22.610
And really a
pleasure to have you.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:23.360
Thank you so much.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:23.550
JONATHAN BUSH: Oh,
this was great.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.160
Thank you guys all very much.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.710
[APPLAUSE]
