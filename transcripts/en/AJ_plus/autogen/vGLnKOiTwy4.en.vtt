actually kill them and that's kind of
what they've done by shutting down the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
what they've done by shutting down the
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.130
what they've done by shutting down the
banking system and really forced the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
banking system and really forced the
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.840
banking system and really forced the
near meltdown of the economy now they

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
near meltdown of the economy now they
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.980
near meltdown of the economy now they
could even accidentally go so far as

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990
could even accidentally go so far as
 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.859
could even accidentally go so far as
they do force a financial meltdown which

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
they do force a financial meltdown which
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.590

pushes Greece out of the euro even if

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
pushes Greece out of the euro even if
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.480
pushes Greece out of the euro even if
they don't intend to do it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.860
increase were forced out of the euro

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870
increase were forced out of the euro
 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.960
increase were forced out of the euro
things would get worse before they would

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970
things would get worse before they would
 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.310
things would get worse before they would
get better because there would be a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320
get better because there would be a
 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.420
get better because there would be a
financial crisis but there is life after

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
financial crisis but there is life after
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.820
financial crisis but there is life after
financial crises and they would recover

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830
financial crises and they would recover
 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.490
financial crises and they would recover
once the financial system was stabilized

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500
once the financial system was stabilized
 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.580
once the financial system was stabilized
and it is possible and I would say even

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590
and it is possible and I would say even
 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.970
and it is possible and I would say even
likely that they would recover faster

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
likely that they would recover faster
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.720
likely that they would recover faster
outside of the euro then the European

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
outside of the euro then the European
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.580
outside of the euro then the European
authorities are going to allow them to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
authorities are going to allow them to
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.420
authorities are going to allow them to
recover right now

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430
 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.489
