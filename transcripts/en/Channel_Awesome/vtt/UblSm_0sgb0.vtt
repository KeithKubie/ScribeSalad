00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.400
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.960
So it's come to this.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.360
Tom and Jerry and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.920
That's a lot of ands for this title, and one of them should clearly not be there at goddamn all.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580
I like Tom and Jerry. I like Willy Wonka.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.080
But similar to welcomely divorced parents, just because I like them individually does not mean they shouldn't stay miles away from each other.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.760
I've talked about Willy Wonka and Tom and Jerry at great lengths on this show, so it figures we should look over their latest cash-grab of inconvenience.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.580
And for those not aware, this is not the first time something like this has happened with Tom and Jerry.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080
They've taken a strange direction in the past couple of years,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.060
in that there is no direction.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.240
They're now tied in with classic stories turned into classic films despite there being absolutely no connection.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.540
They're almost line-for-line. They just somehow sneak Tom and Jerry into there.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.820
Nobody cared too much as these properties were so big and so overused that none of it really seemed that surprising.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.760
But something about this one drove the Internet bonkers.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.340
Maybe because cinematically, Willy Wonka has only 2 versions,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.280
and even though it's for kids, it still holds a slightly cynical edge that seems to be strangely contemporary,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.340
even though it came out years and years ago, being lovingly satirized and referenced even today.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.640
So is this the film to suck out that unique edge from a timeless classic?

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.720
Well...

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.760
Yeah.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.480
This is Tom and Jerry and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.440
Oh, it's just like watching a Tom and Jerry cartoon! This should make all the Willy Wonka fans happy!

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.560
Oh, it's just like watching Willy Wonka! This should make all the Tom and Jerry fans happy!

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.480
You see the problem, you first 2 seconds?!

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.140
Yup, this is mostly a shot-for-shot retelling of the original film.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.060
Christ, I thought I gave the Beauty and the Beast reboot a hard time.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.040
Though at least everybody can't sing in this one.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.480
Funny enough, the opening is...funny enough.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.880
Yeah, Tom and Jerry do some slapstick chasing each other around, looking for food, and it's not badly done.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.580
Even Tom's scream seems humorously appropriate.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.920
[Tom] Aaaahhhhh!

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.020
[Critic] But Jerry escapes into a candy store and...

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.160
...with no tie-in or even introduction, the Candy Man song begins.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.260
[Candy Man] ♫ Who can take a sunrise? ♫

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.300
♫ Sprinkle it with dew? ♫

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.940
[Critic] Why, this is as well-woven as a web that's trying to ensnare and kill you.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.400
Oh, c'mon, it's a shot-for-shot remake if you couldn't even animate that kid getting thwacked with the counter?

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.580
Wait, spoke too soon.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.960
This is already weird!

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.900
Who puts a mouse trap in candy? The Candy Man's a psycho!

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.560
Something else you'll notice is that, for what it is, the animation clearly has effort put into it.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.100
It's colorful, smooth, gets chunks of the slapstick right.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.160
It's not half bad.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.940
But then you'll realize it's not half good, either.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.340
As for all its talent, it still looks rushed out,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.460
and most likely, there was no time to redo a drawing if one looks slightly off.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.180
Because of this, I'm gonna do my

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.120
Ooh, that's a good one to start off with.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.460
Charlie totally ignores the fact that free candy is being handed out,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.760
and instead, stops Tom from eating Jerry.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.860
[Charlie] I had to do that. I couldn't let you eat that poor mouse!

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.800
Things can't be that bad, can they?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.800
[Critic] Hey, don't you encourage that. We all know where this mindset leads!

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.680
[All] ♫ The greatest gift in life's a friend! ♫

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.860
[Man] Turn it off!

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.720
[Critic] Charlie feels bad for the both of them being hungry,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.920
so he gives them the bread that he was gonna give his family.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.540
Well, wait, then how does the later scene go?

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.620
[Charlie] Grandpa George, Grandma Georgina,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.420
Grandma Josephine, Grandpa Joe.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.280
[Charlie] Cabbage soup?
[Critic] Gaaah!

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.700
Could you lean forward with a little less intensity?

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.280
[Charlie] I'm tired of cabbage water. Tonight, we're gonna have a real banquet.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.020
I had two of them, but I gave one to some new friends.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.400
[Critic] So, George and Georgina will still eat the shitty cabbage water, but the rest of us will eat like royalty!

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.460
Tom and Jerry want to repay Charlie, so they try to sneak into the candy store and steal a crate of Wonka bars.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.560
Thankfully, the delivery man is a dog,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.360
because coherent realities are dumb.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.560
Charlie, of course, tells them it's not right to steal, and they should return it.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.700
They put the crate back, while breaking and entering, and beating the crap out of the staff,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.940
breaking several more laws to account for one misdemeanor.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.780
[affected accent] My conscience is clear!

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.880
[normal] Meanwhile, like in the film, a big announcement hits the school.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.100
[Teacher] What's going on out there?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.080
[Student] Willy Wonka's-

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.040
[Critic] Kid, were you just waiting at that door for someone to open it?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.200
You look like you've been practicing that pose for hours.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.400
Yeah, this is good.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.060
[Student] Willy Wonka's opening up his factory!

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.040
You gotta buy Wonka bars to find the tickets!

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.180
[Teacher] Class dismissed!

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.700
[Critic] After Charlie fantasizes about killing them...

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.580
...killing them all...

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.580
Tom and Jerry recommend that they steal again that crate they stole before.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.320
[Charlie] No! It's not right guys.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.960
[Critic] Funny fact, this is the artist's interpretation of what Hanna Barbera would think of this film.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.420
You know the drill, 4 kids find the golden tickets,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.580
Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Mike Teevee, and Violet Beauregarde.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.280
[Violet] When I heard about this Wonka thing, I switched to chocolate.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.640
But then, I went straight-

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.100
[Critic] Dooooh, that's another creepy face!

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.760
And at last, the fifth one is found by...

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.340
...to be fair, a pretty humorous cameo.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.700
[Droopy Dog] I've never been happier. Olé.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.780
[Critic] Not only did they work in a Droopy cameo,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.200
but they also worked in a Mexican stereotype to go with the other stereotypes!

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.980
Tom and Jerry recycle bottles to get some money to buy a bar,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.920
again, wondering how payment to animals works in this ecosystem,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.520
but the coin falls down the drain only to be picked up by Charlie.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.360
By God, all of that was needed!

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.840
[Candy Man] One Wonka bar it is.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.860
[Critic] And, of course, it's from the crate that Tom and Jerry had hidden away.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.040
[Reporter] The fifth golden ticket is a forgery.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.660
Alberto Minoleta has just been taken into custody by the police.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.280
[Critic] Okay, as funny as that was, I am a little disturbed to see Droopy in cuffs.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.860
Could he get the chair for this?

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.300
If animals can make a living, I have no idea what the laws are like in this world.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.300
Charlie naturally opens up the bar, finding the last golden ticket.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.160
After another creep face.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.140
It's scrum-Satanly-umptious.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:45.100
As you probably guess, Slugworth stops him, and tells Charlie how he wants him to get an Everlasting Gobstopper from Wonka.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.560
But this time, there's three big differences.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.540
One is, he's German.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.820
[Slugworth] You must get a hold of an Everlasting Gobstopper and bring it to me,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.720
so I can find the secret formula.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.480
[Critic] We have one of those stereotypes already, thank you.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.380
Two, he moves like the skeleton of a pink elephant from Dumbo.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.020
[Slugworth] The Everlasting Gobstopper. If he's successful, he'll bankrupt me.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.980
[Critic] Eh, I think there's too many creepy faces to count for this one.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.760
We'll just do a Cliff Note.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.300
Third, (and it's not easy to say this) strangest of all,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.280
he sings Veruca Salt's song, I Want it Now.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.340
[Slugworth] ♫ I want it all! ♫

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.880
[Critic] What?

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.560
[Slugworth] ♫ I want the whole world! ♫

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.120
♫ I want to lock it all up in my pocket! It's my bar of chocolate! ♫

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.100
[Critic] Why are you playing this here? It only ruins the song later when you play it again.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.280
Also, the other kids didn't get a song, what makes Charlie so special?

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.200
In fact, doesn't that make him see even more how untrustworthy this guy is?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.740
It makes no sense.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.660
[Slugworth] ♫ I want the works! I want the whole works! ♫

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.400
♫ The world on my plate, it isn't too late! ♫

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.760
[Critic] I'm so glad kids finally have a Nickelodeon version of Pink Floyd's The Wall.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.020
[Spongebob] Squidward, we don't need no education. Dahahahaha!

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.680
[Slugworth] ♫ Don't care how, I want it now! ♫

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.760
[Critic] But Charlie sings him down a sewer, because life is a joke,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.400
and he shows his family the ticket, causing that faker Grandpa Joe to suddenly start walking.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.920
[Grandpa Joe] Ah, I'm fine Charlie. I'm fine.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.100
Look at me!

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.880
♫ I never thought my- ♫

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.900
[Critic] Whoa, now that was a segue.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.500
Oh, I'm fine, Charlie, I'm fine. LOOK AT ME!

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.880
♫ I never thought my life could be anything but catastrophe! ♫

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.220
You're kinda acting like you knew it wouldn't.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.720
Thank God we have Tom and Jerry fighting over this momentous occasion.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.080
[Grandpa Joe] ♫ 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! ♫

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.460
It's ours Charlie! Here I go!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.820
Ha ha, watch my speed!

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.560
[Critic] Yeah, I can't watch your speed because you're not showing it!

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.200
Clearly this movie wanted this miracle of healing to focus on violence and maiming.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.140
If I just showed you this scene, would you think it's about a man who can walk again,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.840
or the 3 of them committing a murder?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.320
And don't let the fact that you're welcoming death influence you.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.380
So the next day, they go to the factory, where all the Ren and Stimpy characters,

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.820
with their cheeks about to be ripped off, await.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.940
But pointless insert #12 arrives, as Grandpa Joe forgets his ticket,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.340
so, Tom and Jerry use all their power of filler to get it back to him.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.500
But a bird sees the ticket, and takes it to her nest, on top of a stoplight to use as a pillow.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.000
As birds do.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.120
[Violet] Check out this stretch!

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.720
[Critic] Christ, are Violet's eyes trying to leave their sockets?!

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.480
We don't even need an Oompa-Loompa song for her, nobody's going to want to do what her creepy ass is doing.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.140
What I like about this scene of Wonka coming out, pretending to be disabled, is that,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.380
unlike the other film, where people just look a little confused, and maybe disappointed,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.260
the people in this one are downright pissed!

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.700
A cane? Piss on his corpse! You know who else had a cane?

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.640
The devil!

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.520
He, of course, tricks them, revealing your eighth nightmare tonight,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.240
and Tom and Jerry sneak the ticket back into Joe's pocket.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.760
[Grandpa Joe] Where did I put it?

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.880
[Critic] Oh my God, is that what I think it is?!

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.900
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.720
[Violet] Violet Beauregarde.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.700
[Wonka] Darling child-

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.300
[Critic] Okay, that wasn't just one drawing, you kept her eyes like that while she was talking!

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.980
You're not even trying to hide your faces of death anymore!

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.440
W-Wait a minute. That dog was on a leash.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.840
If they can hold down jobs, own homes, and commit crimes,

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.920
why do they still need to be on a leash?!

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.760
Your world building is as stable as a Jenga made out of wet toilet paper!

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.440
But Tom and Jerry see Slugworth, and even listen to his quote/unquote evil plan.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.460
[Slugworth] By the end of the day, Charlie Bucket will get exactly what's coming to him.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.520
And then, this chocolate factory will have a new owner! Muhahahahaha!

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.900
[Critic] I love cryptically explaining my good deeds! Muhahahahaha!

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:06.040
Oh, look. I'm going to deliver this ice cream to the children's hospital! Muhahahaha! Won't that be nice of me? Muhahahaha!

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.140
So Tom and Jerry sneak in to stop his quote/unquote evil plan,

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.160
and come across Tuffy as an Oompa-Loompa intern.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.640
[Tuffy, deep voice] Who dares trespass into my candy factory?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.200
[Tuffy, normal voice] Don't you know it's dangerous down here?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.860
[Critic] Oh, and forget that hellish bass I had a second ago. We're never going to explain it.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:32.040
They end up in the chocolate room, again distracting from the enchanting moment with more slapstick.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.860
[Wonka] ♫ Anything you want to, do it. ♫

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.820
♫ Want to change the world- ♫

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.260
[Critic] Yeah, that's just as creepy in animation as it was in live action.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.380
Of course, Augustus falls in, and gets stuck in the pipe, and the Oompa-Loompas sing about it.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.340
They couldn't even have Tom and Jerry flying off the letters.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.280
See, even my shitty ideas are more inspiringly lazy than your shitty ideas.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:02.740
They get to the boat, and Tom and Jerry seem to miss it, but luckily, Tuffy has a boat just for him to catch up.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.180
[Tuffy] Good thing I always keep a spare boat by the river.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.160
[Critic] There's so many whys and so little time, I'm just going to list them here.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.060
Feel free to go back and look at them if you wish.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.280
They get in the boat, and sure enough, they go through...

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.200
the tunnel.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.020
Okay, movie, I'm not gonna lie,

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.980
this is the one scene I'm looking forward to.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.340
I just have to know, how does insanity depict insanity?

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.960
What does a reflection of a reflection look like?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.500
You can't have the balls to have them chop off a chicken's head or say "the fires of Hell".

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.460
I actually have no idea what's in that goddamn thing,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.560
and I'm surprisingly excited to see your interpretation of it.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.960
Okay.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.920
Okay, go.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.600
[Tuffy] There's no earthly way of knowing.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.900
[Critic] Um, they're having Tuffy the Mouse do this scene?

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.440
[Tuffy] There's no knowing where we're rowing.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.960
[Critic] Are they actually saying the whole poem?

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.020
[Tuffy] Is a hurricane a-blowing?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.760
Not a speck of light is showing, so the danger must be growing.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.480
[Critic] Was that a toy dog in the background?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.120
[Tuffy] Are the fires of Hell a-glowing?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.720
[Critic] Oh my God! He said it! He said the word Hell officially in a Tom and Jerry cartoon!

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.400
[Tuffy] Is the grisly reaper mowing?

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.460
Yes!

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.880
And they're certainly not showing ANY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE SLOWING!

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.700
[Critic] This is amaziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.500
[Tuffy] Woaaaaaaaaaaaah!
[Critic] This is amaziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.700
[Critic] Did that really just happen?

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.560
No joke,

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.780
this might actually be more insane than the original!

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.480
The first one had people's fears. It wanted to scare and frighten them.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.240
This has a toy dog, an Oompa-Loompa who's also a mouse,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.560
a kid mouse, with a cute little lisp,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.940
in a Tom and Jerry cartoon where they say the word Hell.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.040
Don't get me wrong, I know Gene Wilder is terrifying in the original,

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.480
but look at this!

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.900
[Tuffy] ANY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE SLOWING!

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.560
[Critic] Look at this!

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.960
[Tuffy] Woaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.760
[Critic] I'm...not saying this is better than the original, not by a longshot,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.960
but I am saying it's crazier.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.520
And it's kind of the best thing in the movie.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.300
We don't need that, it goes without saying.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:49.880
Sadly, the boring kind of madness takes over again, as we just see Tom and Jerry in the background of other famous Wonka scenes.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.540
Getting the Gobstoppers, licking the wallpaper, and turning Violet into a blueberry.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.620
Oh c'mon, you couldn't even really make her look blue,

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.280
it just still looks like a weak light is on her face.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.500
How do you do that in animation?

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.960
The only difference is Slugworth and the dog chase Tom and Jerry around while all of that is going on.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.560
It doesn't even make sense. Why is he obsessed over getting them?

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.580
It happens during the Fizzy Lifting Drink scene, the goose scene,

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.720
and, yes, even during the repeat of the song we already heard.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.880
[Violet] ♫ Give it to me now! ♫

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.440
[Slugworth] ♫ Oh, I want today! ♫

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.780
[Violet] ♫ I want tomorrow ♫

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.020
[Critic] Ooh, now it's a duet! This adds a totally different angle I never considered before-

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.100
Wait, it's just stupid.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:35.100
Why is he even singing it? He doesn't need to convey he's evil to a cat, mouse, and Oompa-Loompa!

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.700
In fact, why doesn't the Oompa-Loompa know? He's got the freaky tunnel shtick down!

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.720
How come he doesn't know that Slugworth isn't a bad guy?

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:48.240
Oh, wait, maybe it's because he's doing everything a bad guy would do, and for no literal good reasons!

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.000
He even steals the Gobstopper.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.100
Great. What are you going to do with it?

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.160
Mister Vonka, I stole the Everlasting Gobst...what was my job again?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.980
Tom and Jerry get stuck with Veruca getting sent to the furnace.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.200
[Tuffy] We're in the furnace!

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.100
[Critic] Holy shit! They're going Toy Story 3 on our assess!

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.840
[Mr. Salt] Out of my way, cat!

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.120
[Critic] No, no, no, it doesn't end there.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.720
It ends with this!

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.520
[Tuffy] Woaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.260
[Critic] No, no, not there either.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.620
It's Tom and Jerry, they just brush it off, occasionally making a blackface joke.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.840
None in this one? Whew. That would have been hard to explain to your kids.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.600
Though not as hard as this:

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.420
[Tuffy] Woaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.420
[Critic] Good luck with that, parents!

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.560
Mike Teevee gets axed off next, which means we're probably getting close to the film's traditional ending.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.200
To say the least, this movie takes some...

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.820
liberties.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.280
[Charlie] They're leaving the factory!

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.380
[Slugworth] Daaah!

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.560
[Critic] Of course, Wonka knew they would figure out his technology and beam him back,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.300
changing their sizes, having a death battle,

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.120
resulting in everyone's insides being switched around!

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.040
I mean, it's in every playbook, y'all!

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.780
[Slugworth] My offer still stands, Charlie Bucket.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.340
With 2 Gobstoppers, I could rule the candy world!

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.400
[Critic] Does 911 not exist anymore?

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.580
[Slugworth] Now, you and I can be partners.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.440
Our Gobstopper will make us kings of the candy world!

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.500
[Critic] What is it with Tom and Jerry and smiling predators walking slowly towards the camera?

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.980
So, after Charlie's trust is tested, it's...

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.360
tested again in the classic scene where Wonka flips out at him.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.980
[Grandpa Joe] We didn't see any rules!

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.620
[Wonka] Wrong, sir! Wrong!

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.460
Under section 37 of the contract signed by him...

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.300
[Critic] Which we never saw signed. Oops.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.180
[Wonka] You stole Fizzy Lifting Drinks, so you get nothing!

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.500
You lose! Good day, sir!

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.140
[Critic] Wow. That was surprisingly tame by this film's standards.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.860
I would have expected at least 3 soul-sucking faces out of that scene.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.600
Of course, Charlie leaves the Gobstopper, even though...

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.620
honestly, should, he's more than earned his trust, Wonka's just being an asshole now!

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.900
But he reveals again it was all a test.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.740
[Wonka] Let me introduce Mr. Wilkinson.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.740
[Slugworth] My master plan was to help Wonka find an heir.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.960
I was concerned that you and Tom and Jerry would interfere with that plan.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.420
[Critic] Granted, like 99.9% of it made no sense, but,

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.540
look, Tom and Jerry are farting bubbles.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.060
Why question anything?

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:33.440
Wonka naturally gives Charlie the factory, and says the final line with easily the creepiest face in the entire movie.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.880
[Wonka] You know what happened to the boy who suddenly got everything he ever wanted?

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.000
He lived happily ever after.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.560
[Critic] Tom and Jerry!

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.680
So, yeah, it's about as bad as you would think.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.540
I'll give it a little credit for animation that's at least trying, even if it doesn't always work.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.920
Once in a while, the slapstick can get a laugh, and,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.540
Jesus Christ, that tunnel scene!

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.700
But aside from that, it's a combination that doesn't belong together,

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.120
resulting in the focus always being on the wrong thing.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.080
Willy Wonka fans won't enjoy Tom and Jerry distracting from the emotional moments,

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.360
and Tom and Jerry fans won't enjoy Willy Wonka getting in the way of their chaotic mayhem.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.860
What can I say but, it's a bad egg.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.740
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, and,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.920
one more time!

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.180
[Tuffy] Woaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.320
I think we're all going to remember that.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.340
[Tuffy] Are the fires of Hell a-glowing?

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.880
Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout-out,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.160
and this week, we are doing Red.org.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.100
Red partners with the world's most iconic brands

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:26.080
that contribute up to fifty percent of profits from Red-branded goods and services to The Global Fund.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.920
Red has generated more than four hundred and sixty-five million dollars for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.980
A hundred percent of that money goes to work on the ground, no overhead is taken.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.820
Global Fund grants that Red supports have impacted more than ninety million people

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.020
with prevention, treatment, counselling, HIV testing, and care services.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.700
If you check out their YouTube channel or their site, you can see in great detail

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:57.600
all the hard work they put in to this, as well as the millions of people who's lives they've made better.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.520
Click on the link, and you can show your support and your thanks for all the kindness they've shared.
