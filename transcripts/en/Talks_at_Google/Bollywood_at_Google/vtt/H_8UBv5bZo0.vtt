00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:08.347
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.660
SUNDAR PICHAI: Never gotten
such an applause before.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.118
I've done a lot of
things, but this

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:24.850
is the first time I feel like
I've done something worthwhile.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.305
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.482
First of all, thank
you all for being here.

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:36.690
Shah Rukh and I were walking
when a bunch of Googlers

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.070
just did a flash dance, and
Shah Rukh joined in the back

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.569
as well.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.400
So thank you all for
coming here today.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.460
We are also live-streaming
this, so it's

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.462
being watched live in YouTube.

00:00:48.462 --> 00:00:49.920
YouTube India is
live-streaming it,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.570
as well as Google+
Hangouts On Air.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.960
Shah Rukh needs no
introduction, but he's

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.504
one of the most popular and
acclaimed actors in India.

00:01:00.504 --> 00:01:01.670
He has done a lot of things.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.004
He's not just an actor.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:03.670
He's a producer.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.070
He's a philanthropist.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.000
He has been given the Padma
Shri award by the government.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030
He has starred in over 50 films.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.060
Started his career in
1992 with "Deewana."

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.300
Most of you probably
know this better than me.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.580
And he has also won
the UNESCO award

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.540
for all his philanthropic
work as well.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.050
They had a great
show last night.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.740
A bunch of my
friends were there.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310
And Shah Rukh just told
me it was their last show

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.590
and so they partied
hard late last night.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.820
So he's probably a bit tired,
but I'm very, very glad

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.320
he's here.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.460
So let's welcome Shah
Rukh onto the stage.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.930
SHAH RUKH KHAN: This is
overwhelming, first of all.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.430
Thank you.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.399
I love you, too.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.380
So yeah.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.890
That's it.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.585
When I come to
America, it's the love

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.460
and the number of ladies
willing to marry me.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.840
And what is surprising is
this time, I'm not saying no.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.549
Especially everyone
here at Google.

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.340
SUNDAR PICHAI: I'm
worried, because my wife

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.064
went to your show last night.

00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:25.230
SHAH RUKH KHAN: Is she back?

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.313
SUNDAR PICHAI: She's back.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.150
SHAH RUKH KHAN:
Well, thank you very

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.730
much for having me over
here and all of you.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.290
I'm sorry to keep
you waiting, but we

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.960
were kind of partying
until very late

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.900
because this was our
last show last night,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.270
and we've done six shows
all across America.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.470
And now, we head back and
go to London, do a show

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.360
and then back to the promotions
of our film, "Happy New Year."

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.030
But it's been
wonderful, and thank you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.400
for having me over here.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.450
SUNDAR PICHAI: Well,
thank you for coming.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.350
I think a lot of people are
curious about what drew you

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.606
to acting, and how
did the journey start?

00:02:57.606 --> 00:02:59.980
And for me particularly, one
of the things that struck me

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.490
is how much you
have a connection

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.910
with the common person in India.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.451
The common man,
common woman in India

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.770
and the connection you
have all over the country.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.397
So can you talk a
little bit about it?

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.730
SHAH RUKH KHAN: I never wanted
to be an actor, actually.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.820
I was wanting to be either
a software engineer,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.600
or-- No, really.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.020
At that time, it was very new.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.320
It wasn't as easily
spoken as now,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.810
and so I did give my
entrance exam in the IT.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.810
It seems like a joke, but I did.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.490
I look stupid.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.990
I'm not.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.365
I'm really
intelligent, you know?

00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:40.630
And just to let you
know, I did electronics.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.645
I got 98, which is the
highest in India ever.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.451
Those were the days
of diodes and triodes.

00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:48.950
It wasn't with the
chips and things.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.370
SUNDAR PICHAI: Anytime you want
to switch careers, let me know.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.530
SHAH RUKH KHAN: I'd love to.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.680
Yeah.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.760
And then, I wanted
to be in sports.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.860
I didn't want to act,
in film especially.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.990
I kind of-- not
looked down upon it,

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.620
but never thought I'm cut
out for Indian cinema.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.370
I did a bit of English theatre
with Mr. Barry John in Delhi.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.170
I'm from Dehli.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.040
And then, I hurt
myself-- my lower back.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.529
And one thing led to the other.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.734
There was a play
being done and I

00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:21.670
know the people, all the
girls from Delhi Lady Shri Ram

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.890
College.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.670
So there's a girls' college,
and they needed seven boys

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.550
to act with 85 girls.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.970
And I got a job as a principal
dancer, not as an actor.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.820
I had one line-- Annie Get
Your Gun, it's a famous play--

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.690
and I got a line in it,
which I said, "Annie, I

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.200
have a letter for you."

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.640
And it started like that.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.470
And I continued with theatre.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.010
Television became big in India.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.670
Yeah, television started.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.799
I went to get a house on rent.

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.340
Instead, I got a
rolling [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:01.090
Some years later, a year
later, it became very popular

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.100
and I got a phone call.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.450
Somebody said, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.860
I'm like no, this has
to be somebody else.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.850
It's not a real call.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.600
And they said, would
you like to do films?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.890
And I said, no.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.175
I'm not interested in films.

00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:18.550
And then, something
sad happened.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.570
My parents expired.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.195
And I said, OK.

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.195
I want to stay in Delhi.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:22.060
I was feeling sad.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.374
So I went over to
Mumbai for a year.

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:26.040
I told my friends,
I'm back in one year.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.230
I'm going to do five films,
get over the sadness.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.460
And it's been 25 years.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.751
I'm still not going back today.

00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:31.930
I'm still here.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.609
So my growth has been of someone
who has not really thought out

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:36.650
that I would be an actor.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.358
It just happened.

00:05:37.358 --> 00:05:38.700
One thing led to the other.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.962
And I don't know if I'm
a good actor or not.

00:05:41.962 --> 00:05:43.420
If I act well, if
I do well or not.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.522
But I don't ever describe
the process too seriously.

00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:50.980
I think it's very
boring for people

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.910
to hear how the art works.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.010
I truly believe the art is much
more important than the artist.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.620
And I'm very humble about
the fact there are so

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.940
many people like me, and
I'm very, very grateful.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.620
So what I do is I
take things from life

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.410
and just continue acting,
have fun, smile a lot,

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.180
and share a lot.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.680
I think acting is about giving.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.970
I think somehow that's
made people like me

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.608
a little more than
the talent I have.

00:06:13.608 --> 00:06:17.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.670
SUNDAR PICHAI: It explains
why so many people identify

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.090
with you, even in such a
diverse range of films.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.321
What's the most challenging
role you've done?

00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:25.820
Why?

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.110
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.050
SHAH RUKH KHAN: It's
always the next one.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.220
Yeah.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.636
It's never the one
that I've done.

00:06:30.636 --> 00:06:32.936
Because if I've done it,
then it's over and done with.

00:06:32.936 --> 00:06:34.310
However badly I
may have done it,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.930
but it's no longer a challenge.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.300
But I find the one
thing that I want

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.560
to do in cinema for
the last 25 years now,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.190
because I've been
working and I don't

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.820
know how to extend and
give back to cinema--

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.090
Indian cinema, specifically.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.280
So I want to make
it technologically

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.890
a little more
advanced than it is.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.460
So what I like to
do is try and do

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.740
films with a lot of
visual effects in them.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.610
I have a small department
of visual effects,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.550
and I want to enhance
filmmaking in India

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.380
so that, technically,
we can be at par

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.620
with international cinema--
especially Hollywood.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.380
And of course, we need
to make them shorter

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.010
and have less songs in them
for people to watch them.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.270
OK.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.100
So we'll keep them as
long and no songs in them.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.820
More songs and longer films now.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.240
But for me, the
toughest have been

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.375
films which I've
produced, actually.

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:27.750
Because people
didn't think these

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.958
are the firms that will work.

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:29.980
A film like "Ashoka."

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.700
I think a film
like [INAUDIBLE]--

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.750
and they all flopped miserably.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.776
So let me tell you, they were
films nobody wanted to buy.

00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:38.150
There was a film
called "Ra.One,"

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.010
which I made-- which I really
wanted to make so that I could

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.640
advance the
technological part of it

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.070
and a difficult film to make.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.450
And now this one.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.340
As an actor, I don't know.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.230
No role is difficult,
because I don't

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.280
have a method that I follow.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.700
I just take instances
from life, meet people.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.800
And I meet so many people.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.760
I love people.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.477
I love the hugs.

00:07:59.477 --> 00:08:00.310
I love to kiss them.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.861
I love to talk to them.

00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:03.360
Yeah.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.776
We're doing the
kisses afterwards.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.490
So I just get to know people.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.330
And then somewhere
down the line,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.160
whenever a role is given to
me, I kind of take from life

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.350
and use it.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.910
And sometimes,
it's over the top.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.072
Sometimes, people think
it's too simplistic.

00:08:19.072 --> 00:08:21.530
But I think it reaches out to
everyone, touches everybody's

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.390
hearts, and people
identify with it.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.110
So films like
"Chakde" were nice.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.430
Swades.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.310
There's [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.645
I like Don.

00:08:35.645 --> 00:08:36.520
I find him very sexy.

00:08:40.307 --> 00:08:41.890
SUNDAR PICHAI: Let's
talk a little bit

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.000
about the work you do
outside of movies, too.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.230
There is Shah Rukh Inc,
which announced the whole KKR

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.340
and how we've done
there, and you've

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.900
been very successful with
Red Chillies as well.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.310
So talk a little bit
about the KKR journey.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.680
How did the IPL
journey all come about?

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.271
I know I've always
seen you in the video,

00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:05.770
always there supporting the
team and they've done very well.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.300
SHAH RUKH KHAN: And desperately
supporting the team.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.450
Now, like I said, I
wanted to be a sportsman.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.190
And this whole thing
started about leagues.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.840
The three things I really
like-- I like entertainment,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.980
I like children,
and I like sports.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.360
These are three things
that really turn me on.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.730
Nothing else, actually.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.530
I'm not much of a sightseer.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.900
I'm not much for travel.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.824
I'm very boring.

00:09:28.824 --> 00:09:29.740
I'm very, very boring.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.410
The three things that I like,
is like watching films or video

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:37.400
games or watching
sports or children.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.225
I love children.

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:41.872
So whenever there is a thing
that I can involve myself now,

00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:43.580
because I've kind of
done well for myself

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.960
and I have a little extra money.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.420
So whenever there's something
I get an opportunity to invest

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.700
in, any of these
things, I always

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.000
do without thinking of
the business aspect of it.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.880
So business-wise, I don't know
if they're doing well or not.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.700
My team is here.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.636
They'll tell you.

00:09:56.636 --> 00:09:59.470
I have to keep working hard
and bringing the money in.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.170
But VFX was part
of entertainment.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.280
IPL was, because I like sports
and I really wanted to play.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.960
I wanted to be a football
player or a hockey player.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.034
And it sounds very pompous.

00:10:10.034 --> 00:10:11.450
When I couldn't
become a player, I

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.610
thought-- let me just go
ahead and buy a team instead.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.970
But I did it for my kids.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.250
SUNDAR PICHAI: That's
the way I think as well.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:17.480
SHAH RUKH KHAN: Yeah.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.500
Let's go buy a team.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.627
My kids liked it.

00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:21.210
We were sitting one
day and they said,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.090
we should have a league
team because of the English

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.350
Premiership League and all.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.599
And I just went and bought it.

00:10:25.599 --> 00:10:29.210
And I remember we were to
bid for it the next morning

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.780
at 11 o'clock, and the
bidding was very high.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.470
Much more than I could
afford or still can afford.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.210
All the big carpets
were doing it.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.560
I was awake, and I was
hoping somehow my bid was not

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.420
accepted, because I
didn't have the money.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.200
So I just went ahead, and
after I bought it also,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.330
we lost so many hours
and so pathetically

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.740
that it became very sad.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.241
Business was bad, and the
game wasn't being won.

00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:51.740
And it's been a
roller coaster ride,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.000
but I stuck around with it for
three years now-- five years.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And some other things
I've done, because I truly

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.460
believe-- and some of
you are younger here

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.876
and you should
know this-- I don't

00:11:00.876 --> 00:11:03.780
want to sound philosophical and
as if I'm giving you a lecture.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.320
But just when you think
things are going to go wrong,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.600
if you hold onto them,
they kind of turn around.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.074
Just that last brink is
always the most important one.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:19.260
SUNDAR PICHAI: You
mentioned education as well,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.120
and I know you've
done work there.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.520
What do you think about
where education is in India?

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.649
There's so many young
students coming through.

00:11:25.649 --> 00:11:27.190
How do you think
technology can help?

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.875
This is what a lot
of us work on, so.

00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:31.250
SHAH RUKH KHAN:
You know, I don't

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.458
think there's anything more
important than education.

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:37.230
And I'm very keen that my
kids are very educated.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.840
And now, with technology
and this accessibility.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.590
And you know,
education has become--

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.660
there used to be a time.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:48.264
And still is, I'm sure, to
specifically specialize in XYZ.

00:11:48.264 --> 00:11:50.430
You have to be a scientist,
you have to be a doctor,

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.952
you have to be an engineer,
and those things are important.

00:11:52.952 --> 00:11:54.410
But I think the
overall development

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.230
happens when you can educate
yourself in a more round way.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.370
And I think technology
can help there.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.810
Just the fact--
I'll be very honest,

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.522
and I'm sure everybody
comes in and says that.

00:12:05.522 --> 00:12:06.980
I'm not saying it
because I'm here.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.990
But feel I don't need
a teacher or books

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.310
since Google has been there.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.390
I find myself so
much more educated

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.170
in the last few years
because of Google.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.840
I've got a yearning
for learning.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.030
I really do.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:30.040
And some of it, there's a
church next to my house which

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.760
says-- whatever answers
Google doesn't have, God has.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.220
And it says that.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.420
Every day, I pass it.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.390
And I think it's one
of the nicest things,

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:45.010
and if you guys can extend just
beyond the search engine, which

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.230
my friend there is head of.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.940
But just being able to give
people more access to more

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.840
subjects and topics-- and make
it fun, which you guys are.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.520
That floor there
only [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.300
to step on those things, I
could spend the whole day there.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.270
I would never enter
into the office.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.570
But I think technology and
Google, specifically today,

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.600
can really help education
go far and wide to areas.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.950
Especially in India, because the
internet is still not gone out.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.430
There are areas where
schools can't be constructed.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.006
And I think for India,
especially, it's very important

00:13:16.006 --> 00:13:17.630
that the youngsters
are educated if you

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.755
want to change the country.

00:13:18.755 --> 00:13:20.914
Because we have
everything going for us.

00:13:20.914 --> 00:13:22.830
If we are just educated
a little more, or have

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.120
access to education.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.600
So I would request everyone
who is working at Google,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.120
figure out something specific.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.370
Because you have the intelligent
ones, the smart ones,

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.140
and the fun ones.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.090
Figure out some specific
things for Indian education

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.810
so that it reaches deep
inside the heartland of India,

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.561
because we need kids like
you coming here and ruling

00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:41.060
the world.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.250
SUNDAR PICHAI: We know you
have a new movie coming out.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.500
It's not just Shah Rukh today.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.949
We have two other
superstars to join us.

00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:57.921
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:26.527 --> 00:14:28.360
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: Is
it just San Francisco?

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.190
Why are all the guys
only asking for me?

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.117
Even last night, remember?

00:14:34.117 --> 00:14:34.992
SHAH RUKH KHAN: Yeah.

00:14:40.187 --> 00:14:42.270
SUNDAR PICHAI: I was hoping
my name would come up.

00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:46.084
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN:
(SCREAMING) Sundar!

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.570
SUNDAR PICHAI: So they're here.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.570
They're also doing
show-promoting the new movie.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.390
It's called, "Happy New Year."

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.066
It's premiering for Diwali.

00:15:02.066 --> 00:15:03.690
So maybe you guys
can talk a little bit

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.398
about the movie, what
the movie is about,

00:15:05.398 --> 00:15:07.897
why you're excited
to be part of it?

00:15:07.897 --> 00:15:09.480
SHAH RUKH KHAN: Let
me first introduce

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.490
Abhishek, who I've
known since childhood.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.660
He's a wonderful, wonderful
co-actor, friend and one

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:22.690
of the most deranged and
fun person on the set.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.470
Most distracted,
but most lively.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.640
And the happiest, happiest
person that I work with.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.119
So I thank him.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.060
Deepika, as you all know,
started with [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.440
I like to show off and be
pompous and take the credit

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:47.380
for the fact that I made
her, which I can say openly.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.930
And today,
unfortunately, she won't

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.810
be able to sing because
her voice is gone.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.310
Otherwise, she would
have, normally.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.726
She does a full [INAUDIBLE]
as soon as she comes, when she

00:15:56.726 --> 00:15:57.610
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.240
She does a whole [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.310
But she wouldn't
be able to do it.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:08.210
The film is a heist film mixed
with a dance competition.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.827
And easier to describe
it, though the stories

00:16:10.827 --> 00:16:12.660
are not copied, though
people will say that.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.900
But it's "Ocean's Eleven"
meets "Full Monty,"

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.580
if that combination
can ever, ever happen.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.530
But Farah Khan
thought of the film

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.430
where, like a
regular heist film,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.920
you have one guy-- a mastermind,
so to say-- who collects people

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.470
with different specialities.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.290
Someone is a lock breaker.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.900
Somebody's-- obviously, there's
one-- is it OK to say "nerd"

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.732
here?

00:16:36.732 --> 00:16:38.700
SUNDAR PICHAI: Yeah.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.380
I'm not one, but they all are.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.120
SHAH RUKH KHAN:
Or I'll be pelted.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.910
You have one
highly-sophisticated,

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.900
intelligent computer hacker.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.700
And so on and so forth.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.330
Abhishek has a
speciality which really,

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.960
really cannot be described,
because it's gross.

00:17:03.202 --> 00:17:05.410
But you'll get to see it
when you see it in the film.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.849
It's gross, the ability
that he has in the film.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:08.740
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN:
Special power.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.698
SHAH RUKH KHAN: The
special powers that he has.

00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:14.260
And I'll now defer-- I'll
request Deepika and Abhishek

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.480
to tell you a little
more about what they do.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:22.229
Deepika, as you will hear now,
normally also sounds like this.

00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:24.770
DEEPIKA PADUKONE: I didn't think
I had that effect on people.

00:17:30.085 --> 00:17:31.210
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: It's OK.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.456
It was an Apple.

00:17:33.456 --> 00:17:35.866
[LAUGHING]

00:17:42.892 --> 00:17:44.350
DEEPIKA PADUKONE:
I'm really sorry.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.130
I can't say much today
because I've lost my voice.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.175
SUNDAR PICHAI: I think people
are just happy looking at you.

00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:52.050
SHAH RUKH KHAN: We'll
do it in dumb charades.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.790
We'll do it like-- three words.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:18:00.850
Say, "How are you?"

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.590
How-- second word?

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.090
You.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.960
You.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.066
How are you?

00:18:09.066 --> 00:18:09.566
OK.

00:18:11.587 --> 00:18:13.087
SUNDAR PICHAI:
Abhishek, do you want

00:18:13.087 --> 00:18:14.720
to say a few words
about the movie?

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.970
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: Know that
it's an absolute pleasure

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.644
to be here.

00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:21.060
Contrary to what
everybody thinks,

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.290
we actually haven't
slept all night

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.610
because we've all been
so excited to come here.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.430
Yeah.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.020
But very honestly, just
to see all the Desis out

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.770
there is way cool.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.554
I mean, I don't mean to sound
too much of a nationalist,

00:18:43.554 --> 00:18:45.970
but it's just fantastic to see
that you guys are literally

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.112
running the world, man.

00:18:51.906 --> 00:18:53.530
SUNDAR PICHAI: So we
do take questions,

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.700
which people have all submitted
both internally and externally.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.270
And the most popular question
was throughout your career,

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.000
who has been your inspiration
for each of you, and why?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.420
So if you could talk about that.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.460
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: Me?

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.376
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.180
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: Yeah.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:20.120
My eternal inspiration
has been-- so, yes.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.621
For me, it's always been
my father in whatever I do.

00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:25.120
Anything--

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:26.930
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: Yeah.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.920
I love him, too.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.450
And he's actually very
jealous that I'm here today.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.690
He's more of a computer
geek than even me, so.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.820
Actually, he must be blogging
right now as we speak.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.320
So yes.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.445
It's always been my father.

00:19:44.445 --> 00:19:48.120
I think for not just his
professionalism, but just

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.340
the kind of human
being that he is.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.450
His sense of morals and values.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.410
Things that I've always admired,
and I aspire to be like him.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.920
And whatever I do in life
is always for my parents.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.590
And so I think my parents have
been my inspiration always.

00:20:08.762 --> 00:20:09.720
DEEPIKA PADUKONE: Pass.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.190
SUNDAR PICHAI: Pass.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.690
SHAH RUKH KHAN: I
think even her dad

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.230
must be an inspiration for her.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.870
Mr. Prakash Padukone, one of
the greatest, greatest sportsmen

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.295
the country's ever produced.

00:20:18.295 --> 00:20:20.295
DEEPIKA PADUKONE: My
parents are my inspiration.

00:20:20.295 --> 00:20:21.620
SUNDAR PICHAI: There you go.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.030
SHAH RUKH KHAN: And who
is your speech coach?

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.820
DEEPIKA PADUKONE: You.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.679
Since I started off with you.

00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:31.137
SHAH RUKH KHAN: (MOCKINGLY,
WITH HOARSE VOICE) Oh yo yo yo.

00:20:32.055 --> 00:20:33.180
Well, that's very sporting.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.490
DEEPIKA PADUKONE: You
walked into that one.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.365
SHAH RUKH KHAN: Yeah.

00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:37.932
This was very good.

00:20:37.932 --> 00:20:39.390
Can you do an
[INAUDIBLE] take-off?

00:20:42.168 --> 00:20:44.490
DEEPIKA PADUKONE:
I-- Gee, sorry.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.000
SHAH RUKH KHAN: I get inspired
by-- I've always said this,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.610
and it may sound
a little strange,

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.970
but I get inspired
not by special people.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.690
I get inspired by
ordinary people.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.780
I find it's not special
to be a special.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.220
It's very special
to be ordinary.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.040
And I see people
who achieve so much

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.880
with such little
facilities at hand.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.520
I get very inspired by that.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.650
In terms of big people-- of
course, my parents died early,

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.380
but they were very
good teachers.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.060
So some of the
people I've liked may

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.700
sound a little odd,
but Muhammad Ali.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.290
I like the boxer.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.330
I really get inspired
by his story.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.760
I get inspired by the
story of Mother Theresa.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.670
And I've never had
the opportunity

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.540
to meet either of them, but
whatever little I've read.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.596
And I make it a point
to read about them,

00:21:31.596 --> 00:21:32.970
and that's why
maybe sometimes, I

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.280
come across a little arrogant.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.113
Because of Muhammad
Ali, not Mother Theresa.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.750
But I like the way
he has led his life.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.880
But more than that, I
think I just get inspired.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.770
I find when I meet
people, I ask them--

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.320
how do you come
here for the shoot?

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.820
And they say, we
wake up at 5:00 AM.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.010
We take a local train.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:51.760
We've cooked food.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.310
We've brought the
kids to school.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.851
And now, we made it
here at 8 o'clock

00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:56.360
and when we pack
up at 8:00, chances

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.040
are we don't make it back home
until 4:00 AM again, sometimes.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.140
And I get really inspired
by ordinary people.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.680
And that inspiration,
I take that.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.620
I've gotten unfortunate now,
and I'm no longer ordinary.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.271
And I should retain that
ordinariness around me

00:22:09.271 --> 00:22:10.770
to be able to achieve
a little more.

00:22:14.747 --> 00:22:16.580
SUNDAR PICHAI: Another
question which people

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.880
ask is about YouTube.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.850
So how does the Bollywood
industry look at YouTube?

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.337
It's very popular in India.

00:22:24.337 --> 00:22:25.670
What do you think about YouTube?

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.961
And there are many people
who work on YouTube here, so.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.558
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN:
Deepika will speak.

00:22:34.558 --> 00:22:36.266
DEEPIKA PADUKONE: I'm
feeling so useless.

00:22:36.266 --> 00:22:37.182
SUNDAR PICHAI: I know.

00:22:37.182 --> 00:22:39.162
DEEPIKA PADUKONE: So sorry.

00:22:39.162 --> 00:22:40.158
AUDIENCE: Keep smiling.

00:22:44.525 --> 00:22:46.400
SHAH RUKH KHAN: I think
it's very, very cool.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.630
I think it's really fantastic.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.790
I get a little frazzled when I
have to put that over-18 thing.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.500
That is a little confusing.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.700
They have their little-- that
word that you have to type

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.500
what you can see.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.500
With my eyesight, it's
really, really difficult.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.100
It takes me five times to
tell them I'm 18 years old.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.650
Please, next time if you find
me putting in those numbers.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.610
No, I'm more than 18.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.940
Allow me to watch everything
on YouTube, please.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.490
I'm a busy actor.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.040
I don't get to pick out the
films I really want to watch,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.090
so I have to watch
them on YouTube.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.200
But I think it's
really, really nice.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.590
I spend my most fun
nights, actually,

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.360
when my kids are back home.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.480
They're both grown up now.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.530
They're 16 and 14.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.320
My daughter and the little
one is still 16-17 months.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.130
But our biggest source
of entertainment

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.320
is actually YouTube.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.660
Because they find such
amazing stuff on there.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:42.060
Such amazing-- more than movies,
and what are they called?

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.730
The youngsters call them epic
fails and the strange things,

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.450
the comic stuff.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.760
Some people trying
to sing, dance.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.237
As a matter of fact,
a lot of it-- a lot

00:23:52.237 --> 00:23:54.820
of the dancing in the film when
we were doing "Happy New Year"

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.970
is about dancing from the
heart, not being a good dancer.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.470
Celebrating the fact that
you don't know how to dance,

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.565
but you just go ahead and
dance, which 99% of people are.

00:24:03.565 --> 00:24:04.690
We don't know how to dance.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.610
We just are happy dancers.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.540
And when Farah started making
the film, the first thing I did

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.340
is collected all
the weird dancing

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.370
from YouTube for inspiration.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.370
Actually, we wanted to
start the film with that.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.910
So it's really the most
entertaining part of the day

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.860
when my son and
daughter, they sit down.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.880
And my son and his friends have
some strange, strange things

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.190
that they find on it,
which I didn't know.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.120
Like some poker games and
poker champs, the lifestyles.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.640
It's really amazing.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.990
I think the most entertaining
time I have is on YouTube.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.781
So thank you, YouTube,
for entertaining us.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:47.732
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:24:47.732 --> 00:24:49.440
SUNDAR PICHAI: Do you
guys use-- everyone

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.880
wants to know that you use
Google products, Google

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.550
technology?

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.540
Do you guys like them?

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.492
And any advice for people here?

00:24:55.492 --> 00:24:57.200
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN:
Well, we didn't really

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.570
know where we were going
today, so I was on Google Maps.

00:25:03.899 --> 00:25:04.870
Yeah.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:10.020
And actually, Shah, before
we started the film.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.230
Like you were saying,
as an inspiration,

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:17.160
we were all given this link to
this wonderful gentleman who's

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.660
made a video of himself,
who he basically

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.265
is an Indian villager who thinks
he's Spiderman or Superman.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.540
So YouTube is something
that we all use.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.680
And PewDiePie is
this one YouTuber

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.420
who gives a lot of
entertainment to all of us.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.660
It's also nice as actors,
because previously, we

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.089
had to buy our own DVDs
to revise our work.

00:25:43.089 --> 00:25:44.630
You see now, you
can just YouTube it.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.320
So YouTube, Google
Maps are things.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.987

that I-- can I have the phone?

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.050

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.383
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: This is mine.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.510
So I think the greatest
thing is you all have almost

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.830
replaced everyday
things in our lives.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.360
So there isn't any day
that you don't actually

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.500
go to work or just wake up
and not use a Google product.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.780
So yes, thank you.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.520
And we do use a
lot of your stuff.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.657
Yes.

00:26:19.657 --> 00:26:20.865
SUNDAR PICHAI: Very exciting.

00:26:20.865 --> 00:26:22.323
I know they've
[INAUDIBLE] us well.

00:26:22.323 --> 00:26:24.460
I think they have a trailer
for the upcoming movie.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.585
So we want to play that so
you all can take a look.

invite them onto the stage.

How are you?

Good to see you.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.340
Who loves me?

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.923
SUNDAR PICHAI: We can hear from
Farah about the movie as well.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.560
FARAH KHAN: I've never seen
so many cool kids together

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.380
in one room.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.160
Thank you.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.910
SUNDAR PICHAI: She'll
tell us a little bit

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.160
about the making of the movie.

00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:22.157
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN:
Do you have a mic?

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.670
SUNDAR PICHAI: Do you guys
want to share your thoughts

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:37.315
on the movie?

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.520
I've heard rumors
of an eight-pack.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.970
An eight-pack is on the way.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.940
FARAH KHAN: Do they not
want to ask anything?

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.940
SUNDAR PICHAI: Why don't
you share your thoughts

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.120
about the movie and
what led you to this?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.860
FARAH KHAN: My thoughts,
right now, I'm damn nervous.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.610
We are like, what?

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:14.940
25 days away from
the release and it's

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.970
literally like giving birth
to triplets all over again.

know if he's going
to show it to you.

No, no, no, no, no.

00:29:40.358 --> 00:29:40.858

00:29:45.684 --> 00:29:47.100
You see, this is
where you realize

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.891
she was talking about
Boman, not Shah Rukh.

00:29:52.855 --> 00:29:54.730
FARAH KHAN: Boman doesn't
have an eight-pack,

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.870
he has a family pack.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.360

No!

00:30:04.649 --> 00:30:06.940
SUNDAR PICHAI: [INAUDIBLE]
is one of my favorite movies

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.880
as well, so why don't
you talk a little bit

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.880
about "Happy New
Year," your role in it?

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.170
BOMAN IRANI: Well, I dare
talk about three idiots

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.220
on this stage.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.095
But "Happy New Year,"
lucky to be cast.

00:30:18.095 --> 00:30:20.139
In fact, I was the
first one cast.

00:30:20.139 --> 00:30:22.180
FARAH KHAN: And let me
tell you, no casting couch

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.185
was used in this case.

00:30:24.185 --> 00:30:25.810
BOMAN IRANI: Look,
I'd tell you it was,

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.143
but then, I don't kiss and tell.

00:30:27.143 --> 00:30:28.860
That's another story.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.870
But it was a privilege
to work on this film.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:36.200
It was probably the greatest
time of my life as an actor.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.760
And it's so wonderful touring
with these wonderful people--

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.700
Shah Rukh and
Abhishek and Deepika,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.600
because it always
works out better for me

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.850
when the crowds are out there.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.510
I send them out first so
they can distract the crowds,

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.822
and then I can make
my way out of it.

00:30:50.822 --> 00:30:52.030
Farah Khan knows, so it's OK.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.790

I'm sorry.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.545
I'm very, very shy
in personal life.

00:31:15.545 --> 00:31:16.990
I really am.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.050

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.610
I personally trained him.

video we made of him

00:31:24.189 --> 00:31:25.480

SHAH RUKH KHAN: Yeah,
it's on YouTube.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:26.930
We put it on YouTube.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:27.590
Yeah.

he was working out,

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.826
I was personally sitting
there and saying-- come on,

00:31:30.826 --> 00:31:31.460
you can do it.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.000
SHAH RUKH KHAN: But
I'm very, very shy.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.546
OK, I'll try and show it.

00:31:39.546 --> 00:31:41.025
I'll hide behind.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.870
I'm sorry.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:57.255

But I'm a good girl.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.500

not going to talk

you're still the girl.

club or on bed or on a rug.

00:34:28.395 --> 00:34:30.230
BOMAN IRANI: I'm a good girl.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.080
ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: My
rhymes are laid back,

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.360
so lay back while I
drop the playback.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.639
Get to my group and then you'll
ask if you can stay back.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.830
You're fine, so fine, I'm
going to keep you smiling.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:38.750
Nice eyes, fine
fur, pimp styling.
