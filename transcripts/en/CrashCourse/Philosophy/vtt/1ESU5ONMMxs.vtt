00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.040
A warning: This episode of Crash Course Philosophy contains language that may be upsetting for some viewers and may not be appropriate for viewing in certain settings.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.680
Consider the following sentence: Jason shot
a mouse in his boxer shorts.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.040
Simple enough.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.760
Or is it?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.620
Like, my first thought was that Jason was
wearing the boxer shorts when he shot the mouse.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.179
But maybe the mouse was wearing Jason’s
boxer shorts?

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.810
Or maybe the mouse was wearing his own boxer
shorts?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.999
Or was the mouse in Jason’s boxer shorts
while he was wearing them!?

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.710
And while we’re at it – what kind of shooting
are we talking about?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.460
Was it done with a gun, or with a camera?

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.140
Words can go wrong, in lots of different ways.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.079
And when they do, the problem usually comes
down to the distinction between speaker meaning

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.219
and audience meaning – or what a speaker
intends, as opposed to what a listener understands.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.720
When these two meanings don’t match up,
the results can range from confusing to hilarious.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.900
But words don’t only convey meaning.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.540
They can also relate attitudes.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:05.440
And when a speaker’s attitude doesn’t match that of their audience, their words – whether they were intended to be just funny, or edgy, or dirty – can end up being seriously harmful.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.480
And now is the part where I warn you that we’re going to talk about some of those harmful words today.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.060
I’m going to say them, even though I’m
not going to like it.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.120
You are going to hear them.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.940
You also probably won’t like it.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.600
And we’re both going to know what they mean.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.000
But we have to talk about them because they’re everywhere, and they’re powerful.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.140
[Theme Music]

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.280
Let’s start out with a harmless example of miscommunication: our mouse-in-boxer-shorts.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.380
The reason that sentence is so confusing is because we understand most language by context.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.320
But sometimes – like in a lone sentence
about a mouse – the context just isn’t there.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.080
And the result is often ambiguity – when a statement has more than one plausible interpretation.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.670
But there are other times, when we do have
context, but it isn’t enough.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.180
Because there’s the context that you share with your interlocutor – stuff that’s known to both of you – like how mice don’t wear underwear.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.740
But there’s also the personal context that
each of you brings to the conversation.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.100
Like, if somebody makes a stupid off-the-cuff joke about “your mother,” that could turn out to be painful, if your mother has recently died.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.400
There are other kinds of unintentional linguistic
harm, as well.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.600
Some of which I’m sure you’ve encountered,
probably in texts or emails.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.440
One person says something as a joke, but the other person reads it as serious, and takes offense.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.500
These are cases where the speaker tried to flout one of Grice’s maxims that we talked about, by, say, using sarcasm or irony.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.740
But the audience was using the cooperative principle, and assumed that everyone involved was saying what they really meant.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.000
So a sarcastic text, if read without the help of social cues like tone of voice or body language, can end up creating miscommunication.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.440
But when it comes to the injuries caused by language, the greater concern for us here is words that are deliberately chosen to cause harm.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.700
Now, let’s pause for a moment here to talk
about how we talk about harmful language.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.400
Philosophers often rely on what’s known
as the Use/Mention Distinction.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.180
This is the difference between talking about
a word, and talking with the word.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.840
Let’s look at the difference between using the word "philosophy" and simply mentioning it.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.220
Consider this statement:

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.600
“I have a hard time staying awake in my
philosophy class after lunch.”

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.160
Right there, I used the word "philosophy."

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.660
But when I say: “Philosophy’ is a Greek
word meaning ‘love of wisdom,’”

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.000
I’m mentioning the word, or talking about it.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.380
The use/mention distinction is helpful when we talk about sensitive, or taboo words, because, we have to use them in order to talk about them.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.520
And there are actually many kinds of taboo
words.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.780
Some are considered off-limits just because they’re, for lack of a more philosophical word, dirty.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.980
Dirty words are scatalogical, blue, coarse.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.050
They refer to things like body parts, bodily
functions, and sexual acts.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:38.070
You probably don’t want to use these words in polite company, but if they do offend people, it’s because they offend their sensibilities, and not, say, their ideas about themselves or their identity.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.310
These words are used for emphasis, to shock, and to express strong attitudes, but their point isn’t to target a person.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.040
Their point isn’t to harm.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.550
In contrast, hate speech consists of words
that are directed at a member of a group.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.460
And they’re used specifically because of
that person’s membership in that group.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.260
These groups are generally based on something that’s key to a person’s identity – like race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or religion.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.400
Hate speech is typically understood as more morally problematic than dirty words, because hate speech is designed to hurt.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.240
But how can mere words cause harm?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.180
To understand this, we need to talk about
a linguistic phenomenon known as thick concepts.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.400
These are words or ideas that come pre-loaded not just with descriptive meaning, but also with evaluative content.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.600
There are attitudes and values that are baked into these words that are hard, if not impossible, to un-bake.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.040
For instance, "murder" is a thick concept that contains a description – it means to kill someone.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.380
But it also contains evaluation – murder
is unjustified killing.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.880
There’s no such thing as a good murder.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.300
Now with this concept in mind, let’s consider a theory about how certain words cause harm, posed by American lawyer Charles R. Lawrence III.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.480
Lawrence argues that hate speech should be legally punishable in the United States, just as it is in some other countries.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.480
His argument focuses on thick concepts that are used to disparage a person for simply being who they are.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.800
What’s problematic about these concepts,
he says, is that you can’t pull their descriptive meaning away from their inherent negativity.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.080
Both the meaning and the attitude are tied
up in a single word.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.360
Let me give you an example, a word that I am going to have a hard time saying.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.900
It’s a hateful word, but we can’t pretend
it doesn’t exist.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.660
Because, in a sense, that mentality – the idea that certain words shouldn’t be discussed, and analyzed, and argued about – gives these words even more power.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.820
The word I want to talk about is "faggot."

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.340
This word has descriptive content, in that it’s commonly used to describe a homosexual man.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:33.300
But that description is bound up with an inherently hateful attitude – so much so, that the target of the word is unable to separate that attitude from the fact about his identity.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.320
The word hurts, because it tells its target
that an essential part of his identity is bad.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.700
Being told you’re wearing an ugly shirt or that you have a stupid haircut might sting, but those aren’t essential parts of you.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.520
If you’re told that who you are is inherently bad, or wrong, then you’re being hit to your core.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.820
The point of using a word like that
is to harm.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.290
That’s all it’s used for.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.980
That is its sole purpose.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.260
And Lawrence argues that, while free speech is important to democracy, hate speech should not be protected.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.500
Instead, he says, hate speech should be understood as belonging to the class of speech known as “fighting words.”

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.280
And yes, that’s an actual term.
They’re not just for cartoon cowboys.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.120
Fighting words are words that are meant to
incite violence.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.220
And since the point of protecting speech is
to promote open communication, Lawrence says,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.820
words that are designed to replace communication with violence and fear don’t deserve constitutional protection.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.600
Contemporary American philosopher Stephanie Ross offers another explanation of the way that words can cause harm.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.040
Let’s head over to the Thought Bubble to
explore it with some Flash Philosophy.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.800
Rather than focusing on words that most people would agree are negative, Ross deals with words that generally seem innocuous.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.560
Think of the word ‘baby,’ used as a term of endearment among adults, particularly applied to women.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.400
Nothing wrong with calling your significant
other ‘baby,’ right?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.370
Well, Ross thinks there might be.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.800
She says the words that people use to refer to us can create what’s known as metaphorical identification.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.290
Think about the characteristics of your average
baby:

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.220
helpless, dependent, relying on others to
care for them, to make decisions for them.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:08.620
Ross argues that, when a person is repeatedly referred to with a word like "baby," a metaphorical identification gradually takes place, whereby she begins to think of herself as having those traits.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:17.460
In other words, she starts to see herself as powerless and dependent, as someone who relies on others – particularly the men who call her that – to take care of her.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.740
This might sound far-fetched, but think about
it.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.400
The way we think of ourselves is largely shaped
by what we believe others think of us.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.650
And we tend to act according to the expectations
that we think others have of us.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.900
So, a child who knows he’s thought of as a troublemaker is more likely to continue acting out,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.560
while a child who’s perceived as a “winner”
is more likely to push himself to win.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.860
To be clear, Ross doesn’t think this is something that happens consciously.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.900
She sees it as insidious, eating away at our self-perception without us even being aware of it.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.560
The words people use to refer to us, end up informing the way we understand ourselves.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.700
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.020
Now, what about hurtful words that you probably
wouldn’t classify as hate speech?

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:02.680
I’m talking about more prevalent language – the kind we use in the cafeteria, in the dorms, when talking to our friends, or talking about our enemies.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.600
They’re hurtful, but they’re powerful in a somewhat different way, because they’re almost mainstream.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.360
And because we see them as less threatening – no big deal – they could actually be more likely to cause unintentional harm.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.740
So consider another word that I really don’t
want to say: "slut."

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.940
This is another thick concept.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.139
It has descriptive content, in that it’s
used to refer to women who have casual sex.

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:27.910
But it’s the evaluative content that really
does the work when this word is used.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:36.320
The attitudes that are baked into this word – attitudes specifically about women and sexuality – are so potent that it’s even used to describe women who don’t have casual sex.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.700
People use it to describe to women who just, like, wear clothes that they consider revealing.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.920
And the word is meant to mean, “that kind
of woman is bad.”

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.640
The attitude and the description are all bound
up together.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.380
Now, maybe you have opinions and reasons for those opinions that you feel justify using this word.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.940
But it might also be the case that you don’t actually think there’s anything wrong with having casual sex, or wearing certain kinds of clothes.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.760
So, you might want to think twice about using
a word like that.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.140
Because when you use it, you’re signaling
a specific attitude to other people.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.720
You’re endorsing that attitude.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:12.680
So if it’s an attitude you don’t really hold, and one you don’t think others should hold, you should take care not to spread it through your speech.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.440
OK. Now let me make just one more point.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.420
No one is telling you what you should or shouldn’t say here. That’s not my job.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.480
My job is to help you scrutinize – with a philosopher’s distance – the language that we all use.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:30.000
The philosophy of language can help us bring scary, powerful words out into the open, and figure out why they’re scary and powerful.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.760
And then, with reasoned arguments, we can understand and explain how the language that we use can inflict harm on others.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.100
Obviously, deliberately using words to harm
is awful.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:46.760
But, even if you don’t intend hate with the words you use, your audience might not understand that, because speaker meaning and audience meaning don’t always match up.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.880
Only by thinking seriously about the words we use, and what they mean, can we understand how they might be perceived by others.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.400
Today we talked about words, and how they hurt.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.140
We learned about the use/mention distinction, the difference between dirty words and hate speech,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.160
and we also learned about thick concepts and
metaphorical identification.
