00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.139
We'll be sharing five tips for helping someone with a mental illness based on an article from issue two of our magazine

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.789
One of the biggest factors in whether those who are mentally ill will open up to a person about their feelings is

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.220
How that person reacts. It can be frustrating when someone in our life is ill.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.659
And we don't like seeing our loved ones in pain and often want to help.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.269
These five tips should help assure that your loved one and open up more to you.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.809
Tip number one:

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.779
Don't allow your negative emotions to be visible

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.529
Like I said, it can be frustrating trying to help someone who's ill. You might feel anger, pity,

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.739
sadness or even hopelessness when trying to help. It's best not to show these emotions

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.339
Don't sigh when your loved one responds in a way you don't like, and don't talk to them as if they are stupid.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.209
Keep in mind, if they could act healthy they would and if you show a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.979
negative reaction to your loved ones, they are much more likely to hide their feelings.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.860
On to tip two: do show them that you still care

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.719
This one may seem obvious but often mental illness makes a person feel broken or somehow let down.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.979
Therefore your loved ones should be reminded that you care greatly about them without this reinsurance,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.760
they may feel as if no one cares.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.100
Tip three: and this one is an important one

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.599
Don't tell or remind them that it could be worse. This is extremely unhelpful

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.898
The idea that knowing that some people are worse off will feel better is simply not true.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.069
In fact, it might make your loved one feel even worse

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.329
Firstly, all that matters to your loved one right now

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.760
is that they feel bad so bringing up others doesn't really factor into how they feel.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.790
Secondly this reminder may cause guilt within your loved one.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.329
They may feel guilty for talking about the illness or even worse feel guilty for being ill at all.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:39.100
This means that your loved one is less likely to open up about their illness to you or to anyone else in the future.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.340
Tip 4:

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.070
Don't try to relate how they feel to your own experiences, that is unless you have the same illness of course.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.320
It can be tempting to try and relate how they feel two things you've been through but

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.820
telling someone who has bipolar that you understand because you have mood swings

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.749
Or your friend with anxiety that you understand because you get anxious before exams isn't helpful.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.050
Mental illness is a more extreme than other behavior in feelings and it can often feel

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.779
Invalidating to the person to hear these things.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.940
Also,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.429
doing this tends to focus the conversation back on you when it is the other person who needs support, so it's best to listen

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.119
rather than try to offer up your own stories.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.490
And finally, tip 5: do try and research their illness

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.300
The Internet is a wonderful tool that allows you to research whatever illness your loved one has.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.700
You can research symptoms, helpful tips, and read others experiences.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.080
This all means that you can support your loved one in the best way possible.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.730
Something good to research is particular warning signs and how best to deal with them.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.230
Knowing for example, that someone's first sign of anxiety

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.639
Can be them feeling very hot is good for spotting when a possible anxiety attack is about to rear its head.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.268
That's it for our tips. We hope that you now feel better equipped to help support someone with mental illness

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.070
