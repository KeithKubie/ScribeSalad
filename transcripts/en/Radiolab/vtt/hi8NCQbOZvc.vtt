1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.710
Um, well, I think we should start the story on June 25th,

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.400
1969 or first you should see who you are. MCZ Lichtenberg I'm Janet. I'm Rod.

3
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:11.850
This is more perfect. Okay. So why, uh, why June 20? When was it?

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.840
June 25th, 1969 y then, uh,

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.790
Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren is retiring.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.440
Earl Warren of the Warren Court. Big Court. Yeah. That's really,

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.930
no, come on. Humor me. I think if you think of legendary Supreme Court justices,

8
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.000
he's probably in, I don't know, the top five.

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.500
So he was one of the Mountain Olympians. He's a big deal. Right? All right.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.860
He's retiring. He's retiring.

11
00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:39.910
He's been on the court for 16 years and he's in an interview and he's asked,

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.840
<v 1>how would you list Mr Chief justice as the supreme court's most important</v>

13
00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:45.640
decision in your 16 years here?

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.090
<v 0>And he says something that is kind of astounding.</v>

15
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.160
<v 1>I think the a reapportionment not only of state legislatures by Porsche</v>

16
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.050
<v 0>before you hear the answer. I think that you need to know that, um,</v>

17
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.740
he could have said all kinds of cases. He was the chief justice during,

18
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.720
during the interim. I don't know if Miranda,

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.310
either of his rights to remain silent. That's,

20
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.730
you have the right to remain silent. Oh,

21
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.140
<v 2>Clarence Earl Gideon petition</v>

22
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.550
<v 0>or Gideon versus Wainwright.</v>

23
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.360
<v 2>It is the beauty of the space,</v>

24
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.450
<v 0>which is you have the right to an attorney that seems big or has no place in our</v>

25
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.650
democracy. Brown vs board of Education. Okay. There was no better place.

26
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.510
And I know that one. I know desegregating the schools. That's big. Yeah.

27
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:32.010
What could be bigger than that? He doesn't say any of those. What does he say?

28
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.500
He says this little case called

29
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.180
<v 1>the baker versus Carr case. Baker versus Carr. Huh.</v>

30
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.060
I think that, uh,

31
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.540
that that case is perhaps the most important case that we've had since I've been

32
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:47.374
on the court.

33
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.910
<v 0>You thought that case, whatever it is,</v>

34
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:53.680
is more important than the case that desegregated the schools. You did. Wow.

35
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.470
So what the hell is it exactly? No, really what is it?

36
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.980
It's this case that was so dramatic and so traumatic that it apparently broke

37
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:08.430
two justices. There was an instance in which my, uh,

38
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.770
brother found my father going upstairs to get a shotgun. Wow.

39
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.750
More purple.

40
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.590
<v 2>The honorable,</v>

41
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.700
the chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United

42
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.180
States. All. Yay. Yay.

43
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.260
<v 0>Yeah. The brain quantum United.</v>

44
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.270
Your favorite money to draw and Aaron get very tight is now

45
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.193
vulnerable card.

46
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.123
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

47
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>Okay. So this is more of perfect a mini series</v>

48
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.930
<v 4>about the supreme court.</v>

49
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.920
And just to frame the story we're about to hear for a second,

50
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.980
as we were putting the show together, um,

51
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.090
we hosted a panel discussion and a couple of us were on stage and a woman in the

52
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:13.930
audience asked the following question. Oh yes. Could you, um,

53
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.150
address what I see is the, uh,

54
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.220
increasing politicization of the court, the apotheosis of which I guess was,

55
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.230
uh, you know,

56
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:28.231
voting or electing Bush to be our president.

57
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.790
Has the court always been this way?

58
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:34.660
Is this just my perception that it's becoming more politicized?

59
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.840
So this turns out to be a really interesting question. Uh, it turns out

60
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.720
<v 0>I didn't know this until Susie started looking into it,</v>

61
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.850
that there was a moment when the Pandora's box just got ripped open.

62
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.880
So I think to understand that moment in this story,

63
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.660
you have to get to know three characters and these aren't necessarily the three

64
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:56.800
most important justices of all time because at that time you had Chief Justice

65
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:59.800
Earl Warren [inaudible] and William Brennan on the court.

66
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:03.760
And these are kind of giants of the Supreme Court. Gotcha. But for this story,

67
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.790
these three guys are key. One of them is on the right,

68
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.990
one of them is on the left and one of them is just stuck right in the middle,

69
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.300
tragically in the middle. So on the conservative side,

70
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.270
<v 1>Ryan, what difference does it make when it in the constitution or in any other</v>

71
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:20.070
expression or action by the state?

72
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.360
<v 5>You had a guy named Felix Frankfurter.</v>

73
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.090
So Justice Frankfurter was one of the most, is really,

74
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.770
his name was really frankfurter. Yes.

75
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.360
One of the most influential justices of all time. That's Tara Grove.

76
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:34.410
She teaches constitutional law at William and Mary Law School. Um,

77
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.040
he was a very influential scholar at Harvard law school before he became a

78
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:42.390
justice, was a close advisor to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Um,

79
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.920
he was extremely smart, towering figure,

80
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.630
but as a person just as friends, just as frankfurter,

81
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.020
he wasn't necessarily the nicest person. I heard that from everyone I talk to.

82
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.580
I always call him a Bantam Rooster. Uh, he was a difficult crusty figure.

83
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.520
He was short, a little bit of a pouch on him.

84
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.630
It was one of the most condescending egotistical of justices.

85
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.180
He was a tough customer when a,

86
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.440
when a clerk would come to the u s supreme court chambers to deliver a message

87
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.670
and the person at the door tried to hand justice frankfurter the paper,

88
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.910
Frankfurter would inevitably let it drop to the ground.

89
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.230
So the person had to bend down and pick it up to hand it to him again.

90
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.220
<v 0>Dude, that's a Wainer. And by the way,</v>

91
00:05:31.221 --> 00:05:34.580
the voices you heard besides Tara Grove are professors. Mike Sidemen,

92
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.390
Georgetown University Law Center. Sam is that girl from [inaudible] school.

93
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.950
Craig Smith, California University of Pennsylvania and x Supreme Court clerk.

94
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.710
Alan Cohen, Cohn Home KLA Chan. Okay,

95
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:50.090
so frankfurter is on one side of the aisle and his nemesis is a gentleman on the

96
00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:50.924
other side of the island,

97
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.770
<v 4>a liberal named William O. Douglas.</v>

98
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 5>Here is Justice Douglas. Now the Supreme Court chambers.</v>

99
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.200
This is a recording from a 1957 interview with Justice Douglas.

100
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.970
It looks very well as a face as 10 rugged. His eyes sparkle.

101
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.200
Douglas was this mountain climbing environmentalist, Vegan civil liberties.

102
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.980
Finally,

103
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.980
the oncoming generation is more aware of the importance of deliberate Pratt

104
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.613
generation. Whoa,

105
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.400
<v 0>Justice Frankfurter Douglas was a prick</v>

106
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.940
to everybody around him. Everybody hated him.

107
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.750
All those same adjectives on the sending, egotistical,

108
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.560
abrasive applied. Here's how the New York Times described him.

109
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.930
<v 1>I habitual a womanizer, a heavy drinker, and uncaring parents.</v>

110
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.710
Douglas was married four times cheating on each of his first three wives with

111
00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:47.820
her eventual successor to do, to be a believer in kissing your bride, sir.

112
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.870
Oh, sure. Do you mind,

113
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.230
<v 0>this is footage from his last marriage to his wife, Kathleen.</v>

114
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.660
He was 67 she was 22

115
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.143
<v 1>Oh yes.</v>

116
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.910
<v 0>So yes, yes, that is. That is William Douglas. So you have these two guys.</v>

117
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.720
Frankfurter or the Bantam Rooster Douglas the prick. And as you can imagine,

118
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.100
they hated each other. They just despised each other.

119
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.690
So Frankfurter had this habit of monologuing and while he would go on and on,

120
00:07:15.691 --> 00:07:18.440
Douglas would just pull out a book right in front of him and just start

121
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.540
<v 7>reading. You know, he was just opening his disdain for Frankfurter.</v>

122
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.000
<v 0>I actually found a series of interviews that were done with Douglas in the early</v>

123
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.130
sixties where he basically calls frankfurter names.

124
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.160
<v 3>No, see evil, utterly dishonest.</v>

125
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.250
Intellectually. He was very, very devious.

126
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.850
He spent his time go left down the holes,

127
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:42.580
putting poisons in everybody's Sproul.

128
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.870
<v 0>Wow. Why did they hate each other so much? Well, according to Mike Seidman,</v>

129
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.300
<v 7>some of that comes from maybe their difference in background.</v>

130
00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:56.650
Frank footer was a Jewish immigrant from Austria.

131
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.170
A Douglas was a westerner,

132
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.540
<v 0>but according to him, the core of their hatred actually was ideological naked</v>

133
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.960
<v 7>reflected a really important split</v>

134
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.760
over how powerful the court should be. Though for frank footer,

135
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.540
courts just ought not to intervene.

136
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.930
<v 5>He believed that in many matters should be left up to the political process and</v>

137
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:21.760
the courts, you should stay out of those issues.

138
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.030
<v 7>It's Douglas. Um, he thought just the opposite.</v>

139
00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:28.750
He thought that courts want to intervene to protect, for example,

140
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.620
minority groups, free speech rights, things of that sort.

141
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.380
<v 0>So you had this personal feud going.</v>

142
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:38.860
You had this ideological war that was brewing in the court and into the middle

143
00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:39.910
of all this

144
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.190
Lux, Charles, whatever you might call them, the swing vote.

145
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.070
Okay, this is Alan Colton. I was a supreme court clerk for

146
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v 8>justice Whitaker from 1957 to 1950.</v>

147
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.820
<v 9>Kate Whitaker grew up in a small town in Kansas called Troy.</v>

148
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.320
The activist is a flashy, this is his granddaughter, kicked your Tena,

149
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.660
kind of a one room schoolhouse verbally a little red schoolhouse,

150
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.890
worked on the farm, but he, he,

151
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.540
he determined that was not the life for him. Kate says when he was around 16,

152
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:24.660
he became obsessed with the idea of becoming a lawyer and she says he would

153
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.680
actually practiced law to the animals. Can you imagine, you know,

154
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:33.450
pushing the plow along in the fields and then lecturing and arguing cases to the

155
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:36.070
cows or to the horses or whatever. Did you really hear the,

156
00:09:36.071 --> 00:09:40.310
he was lecturing dude. Yes. Oh, and on the side,

157
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.240
<v 8>which he would hunt, he would hunt squirrels,</v>

158
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.530
<v 9>awesome. Raccoons skunks,</v>

159
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.210
and he'd sell the pelts for a few dollars and he amassed I think $700 with that

160
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:52.010
money you put himself through law school.

161
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.570
My understanding is that he's simultaneously went to law school and high school,

162
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.570
which is just mind boggling, but yeah,

163
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:02.630
apparently he went to the head of the law school in Kansas City and he's like,

164
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.120
I don't have a high school diploma, but you need to let me in.

165
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.150
The Dean just saw how ambitious he was and he was impressed and he's like,

166
00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:11.510
all right, you're in. I love this guy. He's like, Mr bootstraps.

167
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.600
Totally any how to make a long story short,

168
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.870
Shawnee became a top lawyer and Alan Cohen says that's because he would do

169
00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:20.900
better than all of his opponents. He would outwork them out, prepare them,

170
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.080
<v 8>great attention to detail, great presence. Before a jury</v>

171
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.210
<v 9>and then he becomes a judge. First,</v>

172
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:29.880
a federal district judge and then an appeals court judge.

173
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.940
Then in February of 1957 he gets the call.

174
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.810
<v 10>Carla was in the evening and they asked if he could be in Washington in the next</v>

175
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:39.930
morning.

176
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.200
<v 9>This is Kent Whitaker, Charles Whittaker son. He should certainly,</v>

177
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:48.060
but my best blue shoot deals at the cleaners tonight. What did he where I,

178
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.920
as a matter of fact,

179
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.370
my mother or someone else got the cleaners to open up at night

180
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.083
<v 2>in the first</v>

181
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.950
[inaudible] allegation tending to show that the corporation's right dog exercise

182
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:05.450
of free will let them destroy it.

183
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.480
<v 9>This is one of the first times that Whitaker spoke on the bench and he</v>

184
00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:12.060
interjects with a question for the attorney and he is very Midwestern polite.

185
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.220
<v 2>Yes. I guess Dave, you had so many interruptions,</v>

186
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.560
but I have a question or two.

187
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:21.130
I wonder if I might have the privilege of asking sir. I think

188
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.970
<v 9>the thing that's crazy to me is that he walked into the highest court in the</v>

189
00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:26.770
land and he didn't even go to [inaudible]

190
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.230
<v 8>college.</v>

191
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:32.150
I think it's important to understand that he had no formal education really.

192
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:32.871
In other words,

193
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:37.550
he never took history or political science or social science,

194
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.240
but he loved the law. My father was not an ideologue.

195
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:47.390
<v 10>He expected the court to be an arena in which there were lively arguments on</v>

196
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.830
legal issues and that's what he enjoyed.

197
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.680
What he was really good at, what he, what he loved

198
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:57.980
<v 9>as Ken Whittaker Puts It,</v>

199
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.390
his dad was kind of the walking embodiment of that thing that chief justice John

200
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.770
Roberts said back in 2005 during his confirmation,

201
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.640
<v 10>Mr Chairman, I come before the committee with no agenda.</v>

202
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.830
He was sort of a blank slate.

203
00:12:09.831 --> 00:12:13.790
It's my job to call balls and strikes and not to pitch or bat.

204
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.300
My father was not interested in advancing a cause or a fury,

205
00:12:20.121 --> 00:12:23.060
but frankly that seems how a justice should be,

206
00:12:23.061 --> 00:12:27.080
that you're approaching it without a political agenda and you're deciding it.

207
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.050
I think in theory that's exactly right,

208
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.970
but in practice, so many of their cases,

209
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.920
there is no law to turn to to decide those cases.

210
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.610
<v 9>Ken says his dad quickly discovered that law, the Supreme Court is never clean.</v>

211
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:49.150
Cut cases make it there precisely because the law isn't clear.

212
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.200
Many of their cases are just without pressured them and it's in those cases,

213
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.320
<v 10>at least you have must have.</v>

214
00:12:56.321 --> 00:13:00.610
Your ideology is a as a starting point

215
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.810
<v 9>and the fact that he didn't have an ideology that left him vulnerable,</v>

216
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.920
he was definitely getting lobbied from both sides Frankford or on one side,

217
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.160
Douglas on the other.

218
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.600
<v 10>You were the new kid on the block and was being pulled by each one.</v>

219
00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:19.601
He didn't like the way the judges bullied for votes

220
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.910
<v 9>within his first three months.</v>

221
00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:22.950
He found himself in the middle of a death penalty case.

222
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.030
<v 1>She was found in her bedroom by firemen taken out so soon thereafter pronounced</v>

223
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.550
that

224
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.780
<v 9>a guy who had been tried for arson and murder and Douglas and the liberals</v>

225
00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:34.490
wanted to intervene to help him.

226
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.700
They felt like he'd been treated unfairly by the lower courts,

227
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.490
but frankfurter in the Conservatives thought that the supreme court should be

228
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.060
cautious. They should honor precedent. Now, according to Justice Douglas,

229
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.690
justice Whitaker was undecided all the time. Um,

230
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.750
Douglas would tell him one thing, oh, well, yeah, that seems right.

231
00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:53.660
And then just as frank herder would say something else and you say, oh gosh,

232
00:13:53.661 --> 00:13:56.070
that sounds right. I think there was some thought that, yeah,

233
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.800
he might side with the guy who talked with him last, you know,

234
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.000
he ends up being so undecided on this death penalty case that he forces the

235
00:14:05.001 --> 00:14:07.100
court to delay the vote until the next term.

236
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.860
And there were a series of cases like this. Robert knew

237
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.600
where the law would be fuzzy ideologies would harden and Whitaker,

238
00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:15.830
he would be right in the middle.

239
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.700
<v 10>The physical depictions of him in that first year from people who saw him,</v>

240
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.320
uh, described somebody who was restless,

241
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.590
terribly unhappy. I had lost a lot of weight.

242
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.240
Nervous was agitated most of the time. It was a lot of stress on him.

243
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.000
<v 1>I mean,</v>

244
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.870
I said this was just quicker that in normal course on the California procedure

245
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:41.763
at the minute,

246
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.950
<v 9>but over the next few years, he bounces back. He finds his feet.</v>

247
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.780
<v 1>You say that judgment on probation,</v>

248
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.380
<v 10>his production increased</v>

249
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.390
<v 8>in his third year, his fourth year and part of his fifth year.</v>

250
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.040
He wrote as many opinions at it as any other judge.

251
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.640
He wrote as many dissenting opinions as any other judge.

252
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.940
He was one of the nine he was fully employed and he wrote some very important

253
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:11.900
opinions during that period of time.

254
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:17.750
Along came a baker versus Carr and it broke him.

255
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.833
<v 11>[inaudible] it's coming up.</v>

256
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.520
<v 2>He's from Washington from snap, snap, duck live,</v>

257
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.560
watched Nashville Wyman theater flooding March 16th and I'm bringing the best in

258
00:15:46.561 --> 00:15:51.300
the world. Fry laughs a more amazing night out and yes,

259
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.960
she's coming. The funniest woman in the world. Jen Kober.

260
00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:00.660
I do my hung in the lady forest. Jen POBA rocks a brand new story.

261
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.570
Dick tickets it snap judgment. That'll watch you.

262
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.110
I've never gotten applause for it before. If you guys could call my mom,

263
00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:08.880
that'd be awesome. She's still pissed.

264
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.780
<v 0>Hey, this is more perfect.</v>

265
00:16:13.781 --> 00:16:17.260
I'm Jad Abumrad let's get back to our story from Susie Lichtenberg about the

266
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:18.760
case that broke two justices.

267
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.440
<v 1>Number 103 trade Charles W. Baker at out.</v>

268
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.680
But tell a balance versus Joe shake car and a half.

269
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.120
<v 0>Okay, so it's April 19th, 1961</v>

270
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.590
<v 12>the lion is chief justice man, please. The court,</v>

271
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.150
<v 0>the supreme court is hearing Baker versus Carr.</v>

272
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:37.990
<v 12>Yes.</v>

273
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.990
It is an individual voting rights case rotten by 11 qualified voters in the

274
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.540
state of Tennessee.

275
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.700
<v 0>Now on the surface Baker versus Carr was about districts and how people are</v>

276
00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:52.900
counted in this country.

277
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.980
And this is one of the most basic ways that political power gets assigned in

278
00:16:56.981 --> 00:17:00.040
America. Yeah. Like you know, as populations grow in size,

279
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:04.450
that growth should be reflected in the number of Congress people that are

280
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:07.240
representing them. But at that time in Tennessee,

281
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.000
Tennessee hadn't changed its legislative districts.

282
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.400
<v 12>The rear one in 19 and one</v>

283
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.220
<v 0>since 1901 which was 60 years earlier. Well,</v>

284
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:23.230
this created big problems for urban areas like Memphis because in those 60 years

285
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.640
people had moved to the cities in droves and rural areas were getting smaller.

286
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.140
But the Tennessee state legislature had refused to update its count and it was

287
00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:37.970
still giving more representation to those rural areas in Tennessee.

288
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.940
Um, the figure was 23 to one,

289
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.270
NYU law professor Sam is that girl for people that don't understand it,

290
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:47.240
how does it actually dilute your vote? Well, I mean this is very simple.

291
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.040
You have one district that, uh,

292
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.690
<v 13>one person in it and you have another district that has 23 people in it.</v>

293
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.010
The district that has one person gives all the power to that one person,

294
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.070
the district that has 23 people, uh,

295
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.250
spreads it out over all 23. Wait,

296
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.240
<v 9>all right, think of it this way. At that time,</v>

297
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:12.830
a person in the city in Tennessee had one 23rd as much of a voice in the

298
00:18:12.831 --> 00:18:15.140
legislature as a person living in the countryside.

299
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.640
And heres sort of the insidious underbelly of that,

300
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.870
it just so happened that the people living in the countryside or mostly white

301
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.350
and a large percentage of the people living in the city were black.

302
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.480
<v 13>Underlying all of the reapportionment litigation, at least in the south,</v>

303
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:32.160
was white supremacy.

304
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.870
<v 12>That's Doug Smith historian and the author of on Democracy's doorstep.</v>

305
00:18:37.871 --> 00:18:41.110
This is deeply tied to white supremacy in the maintenance of Jim Crow,

306
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:45.790
who was a method of making sure that rural white legislatures continued to

307
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:46.900
control the power structure.

308
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.420
<v 9>So you had this situation, he says were a small minority,</v>

309
00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:51.680
was choking the majority,

310
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.120
<v 12>choking the the cities and the growing suburban areas from any sort of any sorts</v>

311
00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:56.700
of funds.

312
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.460
<v 9>The cities couldn't get the money they needed for roads, education,</v>

313
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:02.520
social services. So the question at the supreme court was,

314
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.680
and they would actually tackle this in two separate hearings,

315
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.570
<v 13>what should they do about this,</v>

316
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.440
<v 14>Karen? You have the radical Devon</v>

317
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.600
<v 0>and here's where you get to the ideological smackdown liberals on the court,</v>

318
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.880
like Douglas basically agreed with the plaintiff when they are.

319
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.420
<v 14>I say there's nothing in there.</v>

320
00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:24.320
Congregational United States of America that aren't and nothing in the

321
00:19:24.321 --> 00:19:29.000
constitution of the Tet of Tennessee that are days that state government must

322
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.830
remain an agricultural commodity.

323
00:19:30.831 --> 00:19:34.010
And there's nothing in either one of those kinds of traditions is said it takes

324
00:19:34.011 --> 00:19:37.010
20 city residents to equal one farm.

325
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.860
<v 0>Liberals were like, yeah, this is clearly an injustice.</v>

326
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:41.510
People in the cities are getting screwed.

327
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.140
<v 14>Their voting rights have been alluded in debates to the point of nullification.</v>

328
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.410
<v 0>Well the conservatives are like, yes,</v>

329
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.340
people are getting hurt but we're not going to do anything about it. We can't.

330
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.460
Frankfurter

331
00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.020
<v 14>it may affect a rotten habituation. Doesn't mean a cold today.</v>

332
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.550
<v 0>Most vociferously said we cannot get involved in that. As bad as it is,</v>

333
00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:04.490
there was not an issue that the court should get involved in. Why now?

334
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.510
<v 14>I do have to think of the road that I'm going on.</v>

335
00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:10.310
What kind of road you inviting me?

336
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.110
<v 0>He was like, think of where this will lead</v>

337
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.920
<v 14>littering the fact that this is unique and it's the situation.</v>

338
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.660
This is a unique Tennessee situation.

339
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.170
<v 0>If we ended up doing this in Tennessee,</v>

340
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.800
pretty soon we'll be intervening in California, Maryland, South Carolina.

341
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.400
Pretty soon we'll be rewriting the entire US legislative map

342
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.210
<v 14>cause they come a lot of states and not say this is just fantasy for me.</v>

343
00:20:32.211 --> 00:20:34.160
This is the United States, not Tennessee.

344
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.980
<v 9>Yeah. So basically he felt like this would force the courts to get involved in</v>

345
00:20:38.981 --> 00:20:39.814
politics.

346
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.780
And he really believed that the court should never ever get involved in

347
00:20:43.781 --> 00:20:47.110
politics. This is a, this is an idea that goes way back.

348
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.520
Something called the political question doctrine, political question doctrine.

349
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.410
The political question doctrine says,

350
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.730
no federal court can decide this issue at all.

351
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.250
<v 13>The courts simply had no business getting into what were considered to be</v>

352
00:21:02.251 --> 00:21:03.750
fundamentally political questions.

353
00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:06.750
And what could be more fundamentally political than the makeup of a legislature.

354
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.840
It's a philosophy rooted in the notion that unelected lifetime judges should not

355
00:21:13.081 --> 00:21:18.081
be substituting their will for the will of the people's elected representatives.

356
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.360
<v 9>Frankfurter or felt like even if you have a terrible political situation,</v>

357
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.390
if the justice has stepped in and overruled the legislature,

358
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.900
that would be worse than doing nothing at all because it would be fundamentally

359
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.120
undemocratic. Um, he viewed,

360
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.830
he viewed the political question doctrine is a crucial limitation on the federal

361
00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:38.140
judicial power. And he wasn't alone.

362
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.440
The courts had followed this guideline for about 150 years.

363
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.810
And even with the current case in Tennessee,

364
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.510
<v 13>the federal court that first heard the case recognized the situation and</v>

365
00:21:48.511 --> 00:21:49.830
actually referred to it as an evil.

366
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.860
<v 12>The evil is a serious one,</v>

367
00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.830
but should be corrected without further delay and flow.

368
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.030
<v 13>All right. You said that this is a, this is a political question.</v>

369
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.990
Malapportionment is a political question and only the political branches can

370
00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:02.660
handle this, right?

371
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.230
<v 12>Of course,</v>

372
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:08.230
they have no power to do anything about protecting and enforcing the voting

373
00:22:08.271 --> 00:22:10.040
rights of these plaintiffs.

374
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.250
<v 9>So when the lawyer for Tennessee got up there,</v>

375
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.550
<v 14>I am not here defending the legislature.</v>

376
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.250
<v 9>He didn't try to defend how Tennessee was counting or not counting. It's people.</v>

377
00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.980
He basically said, yeah, what we're doing is bad,

378
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.230
but it's nobody's job but ours to fix.

379
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:33.140
<v 14>Is it worse for the legislature of Tennessee not to reapportion or is it worse</v>

380
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:43.100
for the federal districts gorge violate the angel doc separation.

381
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.870
<v 9>He basically said, if you step in,</v>

382
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.240
you're going to screw up the balance of power in America.

383
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.840
The power in America comes from we, the people, not the courts.

384
00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.890
So this matter should be left up to the people of Tennessee and their elected

385
00:22:57.891 --> 00:22:59.420
representatives. Wait a second.

386
00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.540
If the whole problem is that you don't have a voice in the legislature,

387
00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:06.680
then how can you suddenly just have a voice in the legislature? I mean,

388
00:23:06.681 --> 00:23:09.710
the only way to change it would be if the legislature itself were to give up

389
00:23:09.711 --> 00:23:12.080
power. And why would they do that? Because of course,

390
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.180
once elected officials are in power,

391
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.530
they have a vested interest in keeping their districts exactly as they are,

392
00:23:18.531 --> 00:23:20.900
because those were the districts that elected them.

393
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.370
<v 13>And fundamentally,</v>

394
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.720
electoral representatives knew that if they redrew the lines,

395
00:23:26.721 --> 00:23:28.680
that they would be, um,

396
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.210
voting themselves out of political power.

397
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.350
<v 9>That Ski Charles Professor Duke Law School.</v>

398
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.490
<v 13>So they had an incentive not to do anything about this.</v>

399
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.190
<v 9>So for the liberals on the court,</v>

400
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.130
they felt like this was a fundamental flaw in our democracy that needed to be

401
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:46.880
fixed and nobody was going to fix it. They didn't fix it. But for Frankfurter,

402
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:48.850
he's like, if you fix this one, you're gonna have to fix it.

403
00:23:48.851 --> 00:23:51.760
That one and that one and that one. And that one. And where's it going?

404
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.640
<v 10>If you do this, there is no way out.</v>

405
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.030
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

406
00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.520
<v 9>the court's going to get stuck in what he called [inaudible]</v>

407
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.180
<v 7>political thicken. Ah,</v>

408
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.520
the political thicken of the court must not enter the political thicket.

409
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.890
That sounds like Frankfurt. He must've written those words.

410
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.430
And the imagery at the thicket is that, uh, you know,

411
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:14.900
the dear very proudly with his new horns goes into the thicket,

412
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.980
gets entangled and can never get out.

413
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.240
Frank for years, claim was once the courts are in,

414
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:28.270
there will be nothing beyond it and someday the courts will be forced to declare

415
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:31.910
winners and losers. A very high profile elections.

416
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:35.860
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

417
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.920
<v 9>okay, so after the oral arguments are over in Baker vs Carr,</v>

418
00:24:38.921 --> 00:24:42.340
that justice is headed to conference. That's a meeting with just the nine.

419
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.880
And when they went into the conference,

420
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.990
basically the court would divide right down the middle.

421
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.330
And Charles Whitaker, he was a potential swing vote. Whitaker was deeply torn

422
00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.030
<v 15>[inaudible].</v>

423
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.510
<v 9>He'd been leaning Frankfurter's way,</v>

424
00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.690
<v 2>but if there is a clear constitutional right that's being violated</v>

425
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.750
<v 7>during those first, that first argument,</v>

426
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.990
he asked a number of questions that suggested a great deal of sympathy with the

427
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.230
plaintiff.

428
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.270
<v 2>Sam Is there not</v>

429
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:16.770
power and duty in the court to enforce that constitutional rights?

430
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.200
<v 7>There was a lot of thought that he might actually come down on the side of,</v>

431
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.800
of the plaintiffs in that case. I think that's where frank for to really,

432
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.310
really begin to, to rip into him

433
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.350
<v 5>Justice Frankfurter right after the first oral argument during the conference,</v>

434
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.780
even 90 minutes speech, so talked for 90 plus straight minutes,

435
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.960
darting around the room, pulling books off the shelves,

436
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.790
<v 10>holing books off the shelf,</v>

437
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:45.820
reading from prior cases gesticulating wildly to make his point and the whole

438
00:25:46.401 --> 00:25:48.290
time looking directly at Whitaker.

439
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.410
There was one account that I heard where frankfurter went on for four hours,

440
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.300
four hours

441
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.300
<v 7>lecturing, widowed. Really, really belittling him.</v>

442
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:00.910
<v 9>Oh, this guy.</v>

443
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.460
<v 10>Yes it was. It was horribly intimidating.</v>

444
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.610
<v 15>Um,</v>

445
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.660
<v 9>at one point, one of the justices on the liberal side, Justice Hugo black,</v>

446
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.550
he took Whitaker aside,

447
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:15.870
<v 10>black was trying to make him feel better and black said to Charles Whittaker,</v>

448
00:26:15.871 --> 00:26:19.080
just remember we're all boys grown tall.

449
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:20.680
<v 15>Um,</v>

450
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.650
<v 10>we're not the gods who sit on high and dispense justice,</v>

451
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.670
but it's very difficult not to see yourself in that role,

452
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.500
<v 9>particularly if your vote might be the vote that decides everything.</v>

453
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.250
<v 5>This started to weigh heavily on Whitaker's mind.</v>

454
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:39.410
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

455
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.660
<v 5>he was disturbed by the,</v>

456
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.950
by having the way to the supreme court on his shoulders,

457
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.870
<v 9>according to his family, Kate and Ken, my mother tells me that, you know,</v>

458
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.900
he at that time was under a lot of stress and spoke as though he worked

459
00:26:56.021 --> 00:26:59.110
dictating, spoke his punctuation.

460
00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.070
Hello Judith Comma, it's very nice to meet you, period.

461
00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:08.130
Clearly thinking about everything that he might say being recorded.

462
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:13.830
I remember his stating that it felt like all the words that he ordered were

463
00:27:14.291 --> 00:27:18.760
being jeweled in stone as a result of Wiki said you don't talk much.

464
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.953
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

465
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.730
<v 9>so after they heard the case, the first time would occur,</v>

466
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.760
couldn't make up his mind. And actually incidentally,

467
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:36.990
there was another justice justice Stewart who was the other swing vote in the

468
00:27:36.991 --> 00:27:39.360
case, who also couldn't make up as mind.

469
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:40.740
<v 16>Okay.</v>

470
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.670
<v 9>The court decided to hear the case again in the fall just because they needed</v>

471
00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:49.240
more time and over the summer. Interesting enough we did.

472
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.740
Chris said he remained deeply divided that he'd actually written memos on both

473
00:27:53.741 --> 00:27:55.660
sides of the issue. Doug Smith says,

474
00:27:55.661 --> 00:27:59.980
Whittaker wrote both an opinion for intervening and bigger versus car and a

475
00:27:59.981 --> 00:28:04.360
dissent against intervening and bigger versus car at the same time.

476
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.360
Meanwhile, as he's doing this,

477
00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:12.390
justice frankfurters circulated a 60 page memo explaining how this was a

478
00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:17.170
political question that should not be decided by the courts. He's got, you know,

479
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.690
a fire in his belly. He's not gonna let it

480
00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.090
<v 2>this one go number six,</v>

481
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.160
Charlotte is deputy baker now or tell him

482
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.550
<v 9>Monday, October 9th,</v>

483
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.830
1961 it's 10:00 AM and the court is back in session. Please. Of course,

484
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.890
the lawyer arguing the case against the Tennessee legislature begins,

485
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.370
<v 2>Tennessee voters seek federal court protection.</v>

486
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.860
<v 9>Frankfurter sits quietly for about five minutes listening without the light.</v>

487
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.563
And then

488
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.150
<v 2>you don't need to imply, they call it referred to the wrong</v>

489
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.540
[inaudible] right from the [inaudible]. And then I met suggested, right,

490
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.220
the ratio you gave a minute ago. I tried again.

491
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.280
[inaudible] trying to deal with that.

492
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.620
[inaudible] doesn't include any stated you would be different from you in much

493
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.550
worse when it's passed on it by denying or right under it,

494
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.820
it's better than passing on it. I don't know what is bad thing. Of course.

495
00:29:11.821 --> 00:29:13.190
Not Mr. Justice Frank Murder

496
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.670
<v 9>Frankfurter hammers the attorneys with questions during the course of oral</v>

497
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:22.490
arguments. He speaks approximately 170 times 170,

498
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.320
170. Damn Charles Whittaker.

499
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.940
<v 2>Please have some system for the allocation of its legislate doors to districts</v>

500
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.290
or account

501
00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.340
<v 9>17 times.</v>

502
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.720
<v 2>Well, uh, basically</v>

503
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.480
<v 9>after nearly four hours of oral arguments,</v>

504
00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.020
the justice is

505
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:46.640
<v 8>recess and go into conference. Frankfurter needed desperately.</v>

506
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:51.910
He had a good Winokur and he would kept after him like a dog after a bone trying

507
00:29:55.611 --> 00:30:00.170
to persuade them and that harassing he got, I have to make a point here.

508
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.440
<v 17>It was a nightmare and I saw the nightmare.</v>

509
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.870
How so? Describe it to me. Well, he was

510
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:20.370
a nervous wreck and like a cat on a hot tin roof. I found out,

511
00:30:20.371 --> 00:30:24.450
I don't know if he told me or his wife told me he was on tranquilizers to try to

512
00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:28.650
overcome what he thought was just work related stress. Well,

513
00:30:28.651 --> 00:30:33.651
clearly something was taking hold of him who had trouble concentrating.

514
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:35.550
Highly fraught.

515
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:40.610
I would characterize his eventual breakdown is something of a slow descent.

516
00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:48.620
By the early spring after the cord had returned from its winter recess,

517
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.310
a Whitaker was absent from the court.

518
00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.560
You mean like he just didn't, he didn't show for work one day apparently.

519
00:30:58.561 --> 00:31:01.740
So it's clerks didn't know where he was. Um,

520
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.190
the other justices didn't know his whereabouts.

521
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.580
He just disappeared really in the middle of what's going to become one of the,

522
00:31:11.881 --> 00:31:16.830
you know, monumental decisions of the 20th century. He disappears.

523
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:22.050
He had to escape. Where'd he go? Well,

524
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.330
he went to really,

525
00:31:24.331 --> 00:31:28.170
what would be a cabin in the woods in the middle of Wisconsin.

526
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.580
And

527
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:29.871
<v 10>he,</v>

528
00:31:29.871 --> 00:31:33.990
he called up one of his former law associates in Kansas City to come up and join

529
00:31:33.991 --> 00:31:34.780
him.

530
00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.280
<v 18>And according to Craig Smith, he in this guy whose name was Sam Mobi,</v>

531
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.650
they would just sit there on the bank of the lake

532
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:47.223
in silence.

533
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.930
<v 10>They would sit for hours on end, not talking to each other,</v>

534
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.710
just waiting for the justice to speak,

535
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.310
<v 18>no call our pride and what has happened. And so,</v>

536
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:28.030
you know, we have no way of knowing what he was thinking at that moment.

537
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:32.050
But I imagine he was just sitting there and he was thinking about these things,

538
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.110
<v 8>realities that could unfold. Like on the one hand,</v>

539
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.630
if the court stepped into politics, they could protect people. No, mom,

540
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:40.470
Alabama,

541
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.303
<v 14>the camera side.</v>

542
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.710
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

543
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.760
<v 14>but on the other hand, it's gonna precedent with this said, it's a sad deal.</v>

544
00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.630
Mr President when we can, would it make the court two powerful,

545
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.150
Richard Shiny versus Albert Gore,

546
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:06.310
in which case you have your bullshit people as received president of the United

547
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.340
States 200 matches. Mine went back and forth and back and forth,

548
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:11.420
<v 17>well not sleeping.</v>

549
00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.450
And when Whitaker decided that he really had to get back to work,

550
00:33:15.451 --> 00:33:17.700
then this protege would say to him,

551
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.380
no, just relax. Just take it easy and um,

552
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.800
get yourself together before you decide to go back.

553
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:35.540
<v 18>After three weeks, justice Whitaker returns to DC back to Washington,</v>

554
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:38.170
<v 10>uh, for a few days.</v>

555
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.020
<v 18>That's Ken, Teagan, his son.</v>

556
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:46.170
<v 10>We found my father to be really in extremis a debate and I think a borderline</v>

557
00:33:49.781 --> 00:33:50.614
suicidal.

558
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.580
<v 18>When you said he was suicidal, what do you mean</v>

559
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.300
<v 10>there?</v>

560
00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:00.300
There was an instance in which my brother found my father going upstairs to get

561
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:02.554
a shotgun.

562
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.120
<v 18>A few days later, Charles Whittaker checks himself into a hospital.</v>

563
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:19.400
<v 17>There is some evidence that it was really justice Douglas who convinced Whitaker</v>

564
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.680
<v 14>to go to the hospital.</v>

565
00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:26.730
<v 3>I do recall that I have a nervous breakdown.</v>

566
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.450
<v 14>That's justice. William Douglas again</v>

567
00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:37.290
<v 3>and he was at Walter Reed Hospital and I've been up to see him.</v>

568
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.820
She had been up to see him

569
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.273
<v 15>and uh,</v>

570
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:45.120
<v 3>[inaudible] wasn't very poor, physical condition,</v>

571
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:50.670
very worried and very depressed.

572
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:52.710
I thought he should do.

573
00:34:52.711 --> 00:34:57.711
I told him I didn't think he was being in a position to decide what he should do

574
00:34:58.441 --> 00:34:59.730
until I get well.

575
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.500
<v 19>A few weeks later,</v>

576
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.500
March 29 1960 to the presidential press conference from the new State Department

577
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.650
Auditorium, Washington d c several announcements to make.

578
00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.480
It is with extreme regret that I announced three time out of associate justice

579
00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:25.850
of the Supreme Court, Charles Evans,

580
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.540
Whitaker effective April 1st justice Whitaker,

581
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.620
I remember of the Supreme Court for nearly five years and of the federal

582
00:35:33.621 --> 00:35:34.454
judiciary.

583
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.510
Vanilli eight years is retiring the written direction of his position for

584
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:40.560
reasons of disability.

585
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.520
I know that the bench and the bar of the entire nation join me in commending Mr.

586
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:52.080
Justice Whitaker for his devoted service to his country during a critical period

587
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.290
and its history. Next,

588
00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:58.920
I want to take this opportunity to stress again the importance of the tax bill.

589
00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:00.450
Now before the House of Representatives.

590
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:02.410
<v 5>Wow. Just being made</v>

591
00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.670
<v 9>and whatever happened with the case with Descovy, well,</v>

592
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.630
Whitaker didn't vote on bigger versus car.

593
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.410
So you could say that this case that essentially broke him,

594
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.670
his vote didn't count. Wow. Right around the time that he was in the hospital,

595
00:36:15.671 --> 00:36:19.060
there was sort of this liberal coup at the court where Frankfurt or lost a

596
00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:21.640
couple of other votes. So in the end,

597
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:24.520
the decision actually wasn't very close at all. What was it?

598
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.970
It was six to ah, Frankie. Yeah.

599
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.450
And Brennan wrote the majority opinion and he says that this whole kind of

600
00:36:31.451 --> 00:36:35.380
cluster that we've been fighting over of how states in Tennessee count their

601
00:36:35.381 --> 00:36:39.040
voters that this is something that courts can and should look at.

602
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.180
So in other words, I decided to lower their Ahrens and go into the thicket.

603
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.223
Oh yeah, they did.

604
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.900
<v 5>Yay. In just one or two final questions. Um,</v>

605
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:49.910
what happened to Justice Frankfurter? Well,

606
00:36:49.911 --> 00:36:54.911
the the thing that I find perhaps most extraordinary is it less than two weeks

607
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.710
after the decision in Baker vs Carr came down,

608
00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.570
<v 17>Felix Frankfurter was working at his desk at the Supreme Court</v>

609
00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:06.810
<v 5>and Frankfurter Secretary found him sprawled on the floor of his office from a</v>

610
00:37:07.361 --> 00:37:08.150
stroke.

611
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:12.410
<v 17>He suffered a massive stroke and then never returned to service,</v>

612
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.780
<v 5>and while he was in the hospital solicitor general,</v>

613
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:20.150
Archibald Cox visited Frankfurter and Frankfurter, he,

614
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.620
he was in a wheelchair and could barely speak,

615
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.920
but he apparently conveyed to Archibald Cox that the decision maker versus car

616
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.980
had essentially caused his stroke.

617
00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:40.980
He felt so passionately that the court should stay out of the case that he

618
00:37:41.621 --> 00:37:46.210
physically physically deteriorated after the court had gone the other way.

619
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:01.930
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

620
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.250
<v 9>after Baker versus Carr,</v>

621
00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:07.540
President Kennedy essentially had two Supreme Court vacancies to fill now

622
00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.320
Whittaker seat.

623
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.190
He filled with a guy who turned out to be a moderate frankfurters vacancy.

624
00:38:12.191 --> 00:38:13.870
That second vacancy, it's

625
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.880
<v 17>that vacancy that will lead to the appointment of a man named Arthur Goldberg.</v>

626
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:26.530
That is the fifth vote that the four liberals would are regarded as the four

627
00:38:28.461 --> 00:38:29.001
liberals.

628
00:38:29.001 --> 00:38:33.770
That becomes the fifth vote that they need really to create what has come to be

629
00:38:33.771 --> 00:38:36.040
regarded as the Warren court revolution.

630
00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:41.130
<v 20>[inaudible]</v>

631
00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:44.670
<v 10>this is when the supreme court basically became an agent for social change.</v>

632
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:48.360
That revolution that begins with the 1962 term.

633
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:53.430
That's the revolution that is going to change [inaudible] at one man,

634
00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:56.250
one vote, the way, withdraw our political boundaries.

635
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:58.410
Then the prosecutor withheld,

636
00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:02.430
hey and fashion the way we think of criminal justice,

637
00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.340
where small black armband, the way we treat first amendment,

638
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.220
religious education, religious and obscenity issues.

639
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.730
That's the war in court that people remember.

640
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:20.520
And that's the court that came into existence when Felix Frankfurter left.

641
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.040
<v 4>And so just thinking about that question that,</v>

642
00:39:26.041 --> 00:39:30.290
that woman asked all the way at the beginning of this story. Yes. Could you, um,

643
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.520
address what I see is the, uh,

644
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.580
increasing politicization of the court,

645
00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:39.570
the apotheosis of which I guess was, uh, you know,

646
00:39:39.571 --> 00:39:44.571
voting or electing Bush to be our president.

647
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.640
You can kind of draw a line from this moment in Baker versus Carr all the way to

648
00:39:50.581 --> 00:39:52.080
December 9th, 2000

649
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.140
<v 7>block here in the east. The polls in six new states have just closed.</v>

650
00:39:56.141 --> 00:40:01.141
And the lead story at this hour is the state of Florida is too close to call.

651
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.330
I think folks from from with would've said C. And what we found was,

652
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:11.650
that's what I told you. That's what would happen is that eventually you will,

653
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.740
you will be deciding a partisan question,

654
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:20.010
which presidential candidate essentially received the most votes for those who

655
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:24.100
felt themselves on the losing side of push core.

656
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.070
This was just this Frankfurter's revenge.

657
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.570
<v 13>This was the moment that a Baker v Carr had opened up.</v>

658
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.530
And when I teach this to students, uh,

659
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.930
and particularly in the decade after Bush rigour when, uh, the,

660
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:47.440
the, the center sent to Ben Sentiments about this were still quite raw.

661
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.450
I would say to them, well, is this was frankfurter, right?

662
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:57.640
And I remember a student, uh, in the mid two thousands who said, uh,

663
00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.070
in class, I never thought I would say this,

664
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.180
but because I hated the outcome and pushed freak or I was so angry when the

665
00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:05.170
court interceded.

666
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.160
But if push free gores the price we have to pay for the courts,

667
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:16.171
making the overall political system work somewhat more tolerably properly,

668
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.550
it's a price I'm willing to pay.

669
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.303
<v 2>Okay.</v>

670
00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.900
<v 4>Before we totally sign off what happened at Douglas,</v>

671
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:29.500
we sort of lost track of him. So after Baker versus Carr was decided,

672
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:33.470
he went on to be a supreme court justice for 13 more years. And to this day,

673
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.010
he actually

674
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.600
<v 9>holds the record for being the longest serving justice of all time, 36 years.</v>

675
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.273
And Frankfurter.

676
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:45.400
So Baker versus Carr was the last case that he ever heard and he died a few

677
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.050
years afterwards. And Charles would occur. Did he ever recovered? Well,

678
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.880
after Whitaker retired from the court,

679
00:41:52.881 --> 00:41:57.020
he moved back to Kansas City with his family and his son said that it took them

680
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:01.520
about two years to get better from his nervous breakdown, but he did get better.

681
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.700
And eventually he got a job as counsel to General Motors,

682
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:07.460
but he never returned to the bench. He never was a judge again.
