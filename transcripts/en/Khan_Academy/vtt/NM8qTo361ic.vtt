00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.480
Let's see if we can
express 16/21 as a decimal.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.590
Or we could call this
16 twenty-firsts.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.110
This is also 16 divided by 21.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.740
So we can literally
just divide 21 into 16.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.770
And because 21 is
larger than 16,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.270
we're going to get
something less than 1.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.804
So let's just literally
divide 21 into 16.

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:23.720
And we're going to have
something less than 1.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.710
So let's add some
decimal places here.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.780
We're going to round to the
nearest thousandths in case

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.180
our digits keep going
on, and on, and on.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.490
And let's start dividing.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.610
21 goes into 1 zero times.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.870
21 goes into 16 zero times.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.750
21 goes into 160-- well, 20
would go into 160 eight times.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.310
So let's try 7.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.910
Let's see if 7 is
the right thing.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.700
So 7 times 1 is 7.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.315
7 times 2 is 14.

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:52.940
And then when we
subtract it, we should

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.570
get a remainder less than 21.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.660
If we pick the largest
number here where,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.100
if I multiply it by
21, I get close to 160

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.530
without going over.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.330
And so if we subtract,
we do get 13.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.010
So that worked.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.309
13 is less than 21.

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:11.600
And you could just subtract it.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.020
I did it in my head right there.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.000
But you could regroup.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.620
You could say this is a 10.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.140
And then this would be a 5.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.530
10 minus 7 is 3.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.950
5 minus 4 is 1.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.140
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.970
Now let's bring down a 0.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.009
21 goes into 130.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.550
So let's see.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.530
Would 6 work?

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.910
It looks like 6 would work.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.590
6 times 21 is 126.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.990
So that looks like it works.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.520
So let's put a 6 there.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.080
6 times 1 is 6.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.590
6 times 2 is 120.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410
There's a little bit
of an art to this.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.840
All right, now let's subtract.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.160
And once again, we can regroup.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.470
This would be a 10.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.850
We've taken 10 from
essentially this 30.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.682
So now this becomes a 2.

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:53.140
10 minus 6 is 4.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.310
2 minus 2 is 0.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.040
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.170
Now let's bring down another 0.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.900
21 goes into 40, well,
almost two times,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.030
but not quite, so only one time.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.509
1 times 21 is 21.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.830
And now let's subtract.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.919
This is a 10.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.065
This becomes a 3.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.394
10 minus 1 is 9.

00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:16.826
3 minus 2 is 1.

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:18.450
And we're going have
to get this digit.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.420
Because we want to round
to the nearest thousandth.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.780
So if this is 5 or over,
we're going round up.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.880
If this is less than 5,
we're going to round down.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.950
So let's bring
another 0 down here.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.860
And 21 goes into 190.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.030
Let's see, I think 9 will work.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.896
Let's try 9.

00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:41.140
9 times 1 is 9.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.950
9 times 2 is 18.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.600
When you subtract,
190 minus 189 is 1.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.445
And we could keep going
on, and on, and on.

00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:52.820
But we already
have enough digits

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.550
to round to the
nearest thousandth.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.400
This digit right over here is
greater than or equal to 5.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.880
So we will round up in
the thousandths place.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.740
So if we round to the
nearest thousandths,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.790
we can say that this is 0.76.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.260
And then this is where
we're going around up-- 762.
