00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.230
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Hello.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.190
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.542
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: OK.

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:06.490
So my name is Sachiko Nakajima.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.824
And it's an honor to be here.

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:13.400
And so I brought piano here.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.120
So today I'd like to
start with the piano.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.340
Actually, I'm a jazz
pianist and a composer,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.710
as well as a mathematician.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.960
And also I'm also working
for global leader development

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.640
solutions.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.380
But first, as a jazz
pianist and composer,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.330
I'd like to play one original
song called "Flower of Hope."

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.240
And this was made after
Tohoku earthquake.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.260
And so right now I'd like
to dedicate this song

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.990
to those who are suffering in
[INAUDIBLE] and also for you.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.490
Yes.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.030
Thank you, The title
is "Flower of Hope."

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.164
We say, [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
in Japanese.

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:21.868
[MUSIC - SACHIKO NAKAJIMA,
 "FLOWER OF HOPE"]

00:07:04.596 --> 00:07:08.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.680
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA:
Thank you so much.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.320
Yes.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.400
This song is called [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.030
And I really, really love music.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.670
Yes.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.230
And I like to play.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.050
But also I really
love to compose music.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.070
So today I would
like to tell you

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:42.250
about music and mathematics,
which I also love.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.810
Yes.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.880
And also some kind of education.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.490
Yes.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:47.990
Yeah.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.830
So I like to start my talks.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.900
So first I'd like to
introduce myself again.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.380
I have actually three degrees.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.920
One is music.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.250
I'm a jazz pianist composer.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.180
And I sometimes play
some some gigs here

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.380
in Tokyo, or
sometimes in Europe.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:17.220
And also I'm also a
big fan of mathematics.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.820
From 13 years old I've been
really absorbed in mathematics.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.570
And I went to International
Mathematics Olympics.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.610
Do you know?

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.690
International Mathematics.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:35.640
So in 1996, when IMO was
held in India, I went there.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.809
And I got a gold medal there.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.419
And in 1997 I went to Argentina.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.770
And I got the silver there.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.120
So in my junior high
and high school days,

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.180
my daily dives were almost
devoted into mathematics.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.750
I really loved that.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.580
And then at university,
I encountered with music.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.320
So I devoted my life into
mathematics and music

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.750
in my university life.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.360
Yes.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.770
My major was number theory.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.390
So I really love prime numbers.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:10.890
Yeah.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.910
OK.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.960
And also my other
piece is for education,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.550
or learning and development.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.340
I'm working at Phoenix
Consulting, which

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.440
is a global leadership
development-- which

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.746
provides global leadership
development solutions.

00:09:26.746 --> 00:09:30.550
And also I'm doing
some kind of workshop

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.300
or lectures all over Japan.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.180
Music and math.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.970
Yes.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.160
And sometimes I
supervise some drama

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.750
based on music and
mathematics, like "Hard Nuts."

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.080
Do have know "Hard Nuts"?

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:59.430
"Hard Nuts" is a drama in which
very talented girl try to solve

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.880
some problems like a detective.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.240
Yeah.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.030
And Ai Hashimoto, who was also
acting in [INAUDIBLE], yeah,

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.680
was the main actor--
actress there.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:21.440
So on the third story, they
used music and mathematics

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.760
as some kind of trick.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.290
Yeah.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.910
So I supervised that.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:36.590
So for me, music, mathematics,
education, learning

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.330
and development are
all connected for me.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.863
And it's quite
similar to each other.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.450
And so in my life,
it's all connected.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.670
And these all connected
human beings around me.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.250
So today I would like to
introduce some of my viewpoints

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.040
on mathematics,
music, education,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.800
and introduce some
of my activities.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.370
So as for mathematics,
first I would

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.840
like to start with mathematics.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.566
For me, mathematics is first
beautiful and mysterious.

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:16.600
I would like to show
you some equations which

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.150
I think really beautiful.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:24.400
And also in mathematics
we need a sense

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.570
of empathy, something
like empathy.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:37.530
Or a sense of essences which
we call doto in Japanese.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.430
Do you know him?

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.475
His name is Kyoshi Oka.

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:47.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.270
He's a very famous, world
famous mathematician.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.770
And also quite famous for
his strange, funny behavior.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.840
Yeah.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.930
But he says that in mathematics
what is most important

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.030
is [JAPANESE].

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.440
[JAPANESE] over logic.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.820
So he says in order to
polish your [JAPANESE],

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.810
you have to learn mathematics.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.030
And also he says he would
like to do mathematics

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.510
without any logic
or calculation.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.860
But maybe many people
will disagree with him.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.510
But for mathematicians it's
kind of quite essential.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.330
What he's saying is quite
essential to mathematics.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:36.760
So mathematics is not
a world of just logic.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.550
We need some kind of
sense of empathies

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.100
in order to discover
something here.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.300
And also mathematics has
sometimes infinite solutions

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.130
or infinite perspective.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.570
So it's very free.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:00.510
So we can see things from
various points of view.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.980
It's quite interesting.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:08.680
So those three points are
what I think mathematics is.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.980
So from here I would
like to challenge you

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.030
with some equations or problems.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.590
So please enjoy.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.090
OK.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.480
First this is equations.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.450
These very equations which
I really think beautiful.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.880
And when I was 15
or 16 years old,

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.460
I came to know this equation.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.120
And I really got surprised.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.630
And even thought right now
I already know some proofs--

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.490
some-- yeah-- some proofs
for these equations,

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:52.030
but still I think I cannot
understand this exactly.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:59.580
So here on the left hand, so
it means 1 plus 1 divided by 4.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.355
1 plus dot, dot, dot, dot.

00:14:01.355 --> 00:14:06.650
So 1 divided by square
are all summed up here.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:15.100
Then it will somehow reach
to pi squared divided by six.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.620
Do you know this equation?

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.690
No.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.430
Maybe some of you may know.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.440
And as for the second one,
this varies quite similar.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.780
Not square, but triple.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.270
But still, we don't
know what it is.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.350
So it's an unsolved problem.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.880
So if some of you
can try this, you

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.490
must become a very famous
person in the world.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.740
And here this is also
really, really beautiful.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.010
1 minus 1 divided
by 3 dot plus 1

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.970
divided by 5 minus
ba, ba, ba, ba.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.890
Then it reaches the
pi divided by 4.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:04.030
So this is also quite
beautiful, I think,

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:09.420
because here on the left
side, we cannot see any pi.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:17.050
All we see is kind of a
many natural integers.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:22.630
But on the right side,
suddenly pi will appear.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.630
And also this one.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:31.680
I'm sure everyone will disagree
with me on this equation.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.180
Yeah.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.550
But for some
mathematicians, they

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.970
think this is right in a sense.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.310
So if you look at
the left-hand side

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.380
from a different
perspective, sometimes

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.910
for some mathematicians, it
seems to us that it is minus 1

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.902
divided by 12.

00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:54.860
Yeah.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.150
So it's kind of a weird
and mysterious world.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:06.950
But mathematics sometimes tells
us that things are not always

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.390
just we see.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.610
So sometimes if
you look at things

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.010
from many, many
various perspectives,

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.360
sometimes the essence of
the things or equations

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.470
will appear.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.090
Yeah.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.480
So these are the equations I
really we love in mathematics.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.950
So I would like
you to think which

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:41.570
prime numbers can be written as
a sum of square, of integers.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.090
For example, 2.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.260
Now 2 is exceptional, right.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.810
But anyway, 2 can be
expressed as 1 plus 1.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.710
Yeah.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.700
1 is 1 squared.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.830
1 squared plus 1 squared.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.160
But 3 cannot be
expressed like that.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.260
But pi is 1 plus 4.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.319
1 squared plus 2 squared.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.910
Are you following me?

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:09.640
OK.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.099
So how about 7?

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.400
Yes or no?

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.160
No.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.720
Oh no.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.410
Yeah.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.940
How about 11?

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.569
No.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.133
How about 13?

00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:22.819
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:22.950
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yes.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.020
Oh, thank you.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.536
How about 17?

00:17:25.536 --> 00:17:26.490
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.530
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yes.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.289
How about 19?

00:17:30.969 --> 00:17:31.510
AUDIENCE: No.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.920
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: No.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.880
OK.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.115
So how about 41?

00:17:36.115 --> 00:17:38.304
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:38.304 --> 00:17:39.220
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yes.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.236
1 plus 1.

00:17:41.236 --> 00:17:42.610
AUDIENCE: 16 plus 25.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.526
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yes.

00:17:43.526 --> 00:17:44.140
16 plus 25.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.480
So it would be like this.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.960
And how about-- OK.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.340
Any number.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.040
How about 67?

00:17:54.704 --> 00:17:56.694
67.

00:17:56.694 --> 00:17:57.194
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.590
You can be wrong.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.770
Yeah.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.990
In mathematics it's
really important to fail.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.340
So no.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.370
OK, yes.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.270
You're right.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.780
And how about 401?

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.280
Yes.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:22.780
Yes.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.540
It's quite simple.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.190
Yeah.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:31.430
So this is kind
of a [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.050
So you can try anything,
any prime number.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.340
You can try any prime
number maybe at your home.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.360
But right now I don't
have enough time.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.850
So I will show these.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:53.020
So I would like to ask you what
kind of prime numbers have yes.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.818
What kind of prime
numbers are no?

00:18:56.818 --> 00:18:58.309
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] modulo 4.

00:18:58.309 --> 00:18:59.800
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Oh.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.160
There is a genius here.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.660
OK.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.522
Any others?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.728
So he said modulo 4.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.260
Modulo 4.

00:19:18.968 --> 00:19:27.840
So If you divide these
prime numbers by 4,

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:36.280
those who have yes have
a remainder 1 or 2.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.480
But 2 is really exception.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:45.180
So except for 2, those
have a remainder 1 are yes.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:51.240
And those who have
remainder 3 are no.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.150
So here actually there is
some really, really beautiful

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.970
and deep theory in
the back, actually.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:13.110
So at University, I studied
a lot these kind of thing.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.770
Yes.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.630
For me, it's quite,
quite interesting.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:23.170
And so for here, if you write
x squared plus y squared

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.340
equals to [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:31.090
So using i in the original unit,
you can express this like this.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:38.040
So it means if you allow i
to become kind of integer,

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:44.000
so integer plus integer times
i are another new integer,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.300
then these number
for example, 13,

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.810
are not anymore a prime number.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:21:00.840
That means 13 equals to 2
times 3i times 3 minus 3i.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:13.630
So prime number sometimes
is changing into the product

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.790
of two numbers.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:25.160
So things can be different
if you stay here,

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.500
they are prime numbers.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.580
But if you go up to the
next more upper world,

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.610
some prime numbers
will be divided

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.190
into two parts, or sometimes
maybe three or four.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.740
Yes.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.080
These kind of things.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.340
Yeah.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.950
So one more.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:46.840
Yes.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.240
One more.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.830
So this is policeman.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.706
And this is a thief.

00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:59.680
So police try to catch a thief.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.970
So policeman would
like to catch a thief.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.980
And thief would like to run
away from the policeman.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:14.030
So the rule is that policeman
first will go by only one step.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:19.980
And then thief will run away
from police by one step.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.150
And they take turns.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.310
So for example, police go here.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.670
Thief go here.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.820
And the police will
follow a thief.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.290
Then thief maybe go down here.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.400
Yes.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.600
And try to catch
the policeman-- no.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.770
Catch a thief.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:48.070
It is better to use
this white board.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.670
So can you please
think a little bit.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.530
And if you find a
solution-- oh sorry.

00:22:56.652 --> 00:22:58.680
If you can find a solution,
please let me know.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.850
So this is kind of a very game.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:15.450
Just a game.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.960
But here you have to
use your sense, not just

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.600
the logic, maybe.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.720
So if you try, maybe it might
be difficult for a policeman

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.970
to catch a thief.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.260
So you have to
change your ideas.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.800
You have to try other ideas.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.940
Can someone give me?

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.510
You're almost done here.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.522
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:04.522 --> 00:24:05.480
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yeah.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.354
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:09.089 --> 00:24:10.130
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Anyone?

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.472
I will try to run
away from here.

00:24:20.472 --> 00:24:21.834
So.

00:24:21.834 --> 00:24:23.650
Yeah.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.884
Please try me.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.862
So first policeman here.

00:24:31.862 --> 00:24:33.280
Thief is here.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.001
Policeman go by one step.

00:24:36.001 --> 00:24:37.050
A thief will go.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.425
AUDIENCE: To make
this different.

00:24:38.425 --> 00:24:39.341
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yes.

00:24:39.341 --> 00:24:39.980
Yes.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.024
We cannot say no or
pass or we cannot say--

00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:44.690
AUDIENCE: The policeman
should go right.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.150
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Should where?

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.205
AUDIENCE: Go right.

00:24:46.205 --> 00:24:47.580
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA:
Go right first.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.345
OK.

00:24:48.345 --> 00:24:49.430
Oh, OK.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.190
Could you please come here?

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:52.100
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yeah.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:52.720
Yeah.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.788
Yeah.

00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:54.287
Please.

00:24:57.486 --> 00:24:58.200
Yeah.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.730
Go right.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.230
OK.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.460
First so the policeman--

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.544
AUDIENCE: I'll do it.

00:25:01.544 --> 00:25:02.710
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: You do it.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:03.540
OK.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.620
So maybe you can [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] So you
said, first just go here.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:10.800
Right?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.840
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: OK.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.610
So I go here.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.470
AUDIENCE: OK. [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.690
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Maybe
it's better to switch.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.190
OK.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.690
Yes.

00:25:23.316 --> 00:25:23.940
AUDIENCE: Here.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.814
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: OK.

00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:27.595
A thief will follow a policeman.

00:25:31.273 --> 00:25:32.251
AUDIENCE: Let's see.

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:35.674
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Oh.

00:25:35.674 --> 00:25:36.174
Oh.

00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:45.950
Ah Yeah.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.046
Thank you so much.

00:25:47.046 --> 00:25:49.090
Thank you.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:49.590
OK.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:54.735
So what key here?

00:25:54.735 --> 00:25:55.360
Can you say it?

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.700
What was the key?

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.710
AUDIENCE: Like [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.457
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yes.

00:26:03.457 --> 00:26:05.453
AUDIENCE: Not
necessarily [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:08.765 --> 00:26:09.890
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Oh, yeah.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.100
Yeah.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:10.360
Yeah.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.235
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.140
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yes.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.110
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yeah.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.366
I think you're--
you're quite right.

00:26:20.366 --> 00:26:21.060
Maybe.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.560
Yeah.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.990
There are many, many
[INAUDIBLE] theories.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.520
Yeah.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.640
So as he said, so like this.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:33.270
If you paint the dots
like red and yellow, when

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.450
policeman go to yellow, the
thief also go to yellow.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:41.980
And policeman go to red,
a thief also goes to red.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.860
So that means if policeman
just go around here,

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.450
he never did get the thief.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.040
So policeman has to go here.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.830
So maybe you can sense
something is different here.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:04.700
So if a policeman try to go
up here, then he can catch.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.210
Yes.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.532
Fascinating.

00:27:06.532 --> 00:27:09.920
So this is kind of just a game.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.700
But you can see many ideas.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.720
So in our extra
life, sometimes you

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.440
are really keen on following
somebody and catching up him.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.410
But sometimes you have to change
your ideas and use your senses.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:30.480
And you have to find new
ideas to solve the problem.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.501
Yes.

00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:32.000
OK.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.731
So this I like to
try, but I will skip.

00:27:36.731 --> 00:27:37.230
OK.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:42.470
So here are some
works of children.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:47.510
Like this one is work
of a six-year-old girl.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:53.130
And this is a work
of a 9-year-old girl.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:58.940
I'm actually in the judging
committee of the Sansu Sugaku

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.740
no Jiyukenkyu.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.810
So free research on
mathematics and arithmetics.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:11.040
So from six to 17,
18 years old, they

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.060
can challenge this Jiyukenkyu
during their summer vacation.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:23.480
And now I've been in the central
committee for three years.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:30.630
But now we're having
as many as 15,000 works

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.970
from not only in Japan, but
from all over the world.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.710
This is quite interesting.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.030
Because first off, even
for a mathematician,

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.200
we thought that it might be
really difficult for children

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.310
to think up some new
discovery or new researches

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.660
on mathematics or arithmetics.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.180
But we were wrong.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.370
Their works are really,
really interesting.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:29:00.800
So I'm really having a lot of
fun in viewing these works.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:07.270
So for example here,
she tried to search

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:15.050
what can be the biggest
shape made by one rope.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:15.690
Yes.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:21.450
So she tried to make many, many
various shapes with that rope.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:27.790
And she tried to find the
size with the beads inside.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.120
So she found out
that a circle can

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.200
be [INAUDIBLE] these ones
for something like that.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.990
But this was done by
a six-year-old girl.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:41.240
And also, this one is also
a nine-year-old girl's work.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:46.380
And she tried to make up
sand clock of three minutes

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.780
for using just clock, addition,
subtraction, multiples,

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.060
and division, she made that.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.850
So using mathematics we
can do anything, actually.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:30:03.730
So I think many people
sometimes hate mathematics.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.260
Especially in Japan.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.280
But mathematics is everywhere.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.010
And also in mathematics,
everything is kind of free.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:14.820
So we can't set any
new ideas and try

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:20.300
to make something new with
our logic and ourself.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:26.000
So if you like to discover
something around us,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.620
you can find many, many
mathematics around here.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.760
Yes.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.540
So it's quite interesting.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.090
Others are like, is
it really good to send

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.590
the best batter on
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.850
And the baseball
batting order was

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.930
done by high school students.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:50.000
And also this is a
kind of famous work.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.940
So maybe you know
[INAUDIBLE] by [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:59.670
So she tried to research how
fast [INAUDIBLE] was running.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.220
And he found out that
[INAUDIBLE] was not

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.420
running, actually.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.820
So he said please,
[SPEAKING JAPANESE].

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.460
Yeah.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.990
Please, run, run more.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:15.660
So [INAUDIBLE]
should have run more.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:25.160
So here for example, even
from one theme or one problem,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.740
we can get many, many ideas.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:33.770
So here using this
problem, so here there

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.770
are five small
squares with area 1,

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.850
using scissors and
paint, please make

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.490
a big square whose area is 5.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.700
Then they tried a lot.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:50.510
And many people from all over
Japan tried, from six to 65.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:54.090
And they made each
original works.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:58.100
So there are infinite solutions,
infinite answers here.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:03.760
So math is really
world of freedom.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.260
OK.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.840
So next, music.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:13.740
Music is also has three
points, just as mathematics.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.950
Music is beautiful and sometimes
mysterious, especially jazz

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.540
music.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.230
Improvisation in music
can be really mysterious.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:26.570
So this is music for just now.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:31.340
So music can be really
beautiful and mysterious

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.030
and touches our heart.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.420
And also we-- maybe
you, all agree

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.310
that we need some kind
of [JAPANESE], or sense

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.920
of empathy in music, too.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.680
And also as music, we can have
infinite free perspectives.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.150
Yes.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:54.200
So through music, so not
just the copying the score,

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:00.630
playing just as the score says,
or sing just as the score says,

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:04.526
but also we can try to make,
compose, our own music.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.810
Mathematics and music are
not just for mathematicians

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.160
or professional composers.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.150
Anyone can try to do that.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.470
And I think it's
quite interesting.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:21.320
So if you can compose some
kind of original music

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.730
using your [JAPANESE]
maybe sometimes.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.380
Yeah.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.680
So before going
to improvisation,

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:37.240
I like you introduce
you one man, my mentor.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.950
His name is Takehiro Honda.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:48.070
Actually he is a really great
jazz pianist, and famous jazz

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.160
pianist and composer in Japan.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:34:03.200
But when I first met with him,
he just revived from a miracle,

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.510
from a big disease, injury.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:14.170
So he was paralyzed on his
left side from strokes.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.330
So he had strokes
two or three times.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:27.969
And the doctor said that your
left side is no longer works.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:33.850
But he really loved
music and loved piano.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:39.620
So in the rehabilitation
hotel, there was a piano.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.460
So he asked the doctor.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:47.370
And he practiced all
day long, every day.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:52.000
And after a while,
he made a miracle.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.130
And that's just
when I met with him.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:01.830
And I was really moved by
his way of living, and also

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.870
his music itself.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.640
I know his past works too.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:12.680
But for me it was really
kind of shocking for me

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:20.654
that he-- yeah--
he made a miracle.

00:35:20.654 --> 00:35:26.360
And so this also
one of very big key

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:34.730
element that I was moved
to go with a music life.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.380
Yes.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.350
But he's my mentor.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:44.900
And so music is somehow
a story of how you live.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.430
And even when you
listen to music,

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:51.910
it reflects how you live.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:55.860
So it's very similar
to paintings.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.500
But I think it's also
similar to mathematics too.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:05.620
But as for music, it's quite
direct to our daily lives.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.620
And also at music,
sometimes we can

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.550
have an infinite possibilities.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.390
For example, for
improvisation, we

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:21.535
can use our imagination
to connect dots.

00:36:21.535 --> 00:36:26.430
So for example, using do,
do, re, mi, do, mi, so,

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.120
do, [INAUDIBLE] or something.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:35.130
So using do as a connector,
we can go anywhere.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.865
So we can link
many, many some just

00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:43.070
chord or melodies or reasons.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:46.580
And we can get to anywhere.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:56.270
So here I'd like to try on
improvisation with your help.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:37:01.411
So right now I would like you
to give me four notes, maybe.

00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:01.910
Yeah.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.500
Four notes and one ti.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.170
Yeah.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:05.920
One ti.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.570
And I would like to try to
make an improvisation using

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.790
those four notes and theme.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:18.040
So could you please give
me four notes one by one?

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.380
Yeah.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:25.000
Like do or fa [INAUDIBLE],
or sometimes this

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.700
can be really simple and easy.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.643
But sometimes it can be
really difficult for me.

00:37:29.643 --> 00:37:33.970
So first today,
I'm not sure what's

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:38.391
going on-- what will
happen here today.

00:37:38.391 --> 00:37:38.890
Yeah.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.740
AUDIENCE: Mi.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.030
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Mi.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.530
OK.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.490
Thank you.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.690
Mi first.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:46.190
AUDIENCE: C.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:47.190
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: C. OK.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.468
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:48.468 --> 00:37:49.404
Ti.

00:37:49.404 --> 00:37:52.680
Mi, ti, and--

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.030
AUDIENCE: B flat.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.620
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: B flat.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.980
OK.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.900
OK.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.000
B flat.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
OK.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.500
And one more.

00:38:05.838 --> 00:38:07.212
One more.

00:38:07.212 --> 00:38:08.130
AUDIENCE: Fa.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.780
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Fa.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.390
Oh.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.873
Kind of a difficult one.

00:38:14.873 --> 00:38:16.230
Yeah.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:23.490
It sounds like, actually--
mi, ti, b flat, fa.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.350
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.250
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Mm.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.030
Quite mysterious.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.330
Yeah.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.600
And one theme, please.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.569
Any theme.

00:38:36.569 --> 00:38:37.870
AUDIENCE: The future.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.078
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: The future.

00:38:39.078 --> 00:38:39.611
Wow.

00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:40.110
Great.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.830
Thank you so much.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.225
The other day I was
given pi as a theme.

00:38:45.225 --> 00:38:46.730
And it was difficult for me.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:47.490
But yeah.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:48.070
Future.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.351
Oh, great.

00:38:49.351 --> 00:38:49.850
OK.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:50.430
So using--

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.190
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.750
So sometimes we can
use these four notes

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:00.009
with a chorus like this.

00:39:00.009 --> 00:39:03.502
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:05.498 --> 00:39:07.000
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Mm hm.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.020
Very mysterious.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.601
Or something like this.

00:39:11.601 --> 00:39:15.080
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:20.102 --> 00:39:21.060
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA: Yeah.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.780
So I will try to
connect these ideas

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.830
and make a story using
these four notes.

00:39:45.301 --> 00:39:49.792
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:23.591
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:26.472 --> 00:43:28.055
SACHIKO NAKAJIMA:
Thank you very much.

00:43:28.055 --> 00:43:31.552
[INAUDIBLE] piece of future.

00:43:31.552 --> 00:43:32.944
Yeah.

00:43:32.944 --> 00:43:37.220
So music is a world
of imagination.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:42.370
So you can imagine any-- so
sometimes for these people

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.000
it's future.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.100
But those people it's kind of
a fairly dark path [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.060
So it's quite interesting
for me that we

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.590
are different from each other.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:44:00.850
So in mathematics and
music are, I think,

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:02.040
quite similar to each other.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:10.680
So yes.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:16.740
Sometimes of course, in music,
there is mathematical logic.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:20.860
But not just that.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.590
Music and math are quite
similar to each other,

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.310
because they are the world
to create something new.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.380
And also lives are too.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.465
Sometimes in your life,
maybe, in my life too,

00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:37.360
I have to struggle with
something which I cannot

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.870
conquer.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:42.030
So that means it's kind
of a mathematical problem

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.350
or kind of a slump in music.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.030
It's quite similar
to each other.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:49.530
But there we have
to use our senses

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:53.610
and sometimes logics to free
ourselves-- free ourselves

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.440
from any bias or prejudice.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.650
We have to try something new.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.290
So yes.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:04.590
For me, music, math, and lives
are quite similar to each other

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:08.530
because they're the world
to create something new.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:13.250
But here his name
is Cedric Villani

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:16.030
Do you know Cedric Villani?

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:17.660
He's a French mathematician.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.540
And he won the Fields Medal.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:27.520
Fields Medal is-- Fields
Prize is like a Nobel

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.870
Prize in mathematics.

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:33.310
This really, really great prize.

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.560
So he has got that.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.990
And his fashion is
also quite impressive.

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.690
And he said that Lady
Gaga in mathematics.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.090
Yeah.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:48.090
And he really loves music too.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:52.140
And some of his
brothers are composers.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.880
And he sometimes have a
seminar with the composers

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.870
about creativity in France.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:02.120
And we had a really
interesting discussion

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.050
there about music
and mathematics.

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:08.990
And also here, like
Katshushika Hokusai.

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.760
He's famous.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.850
But he use mathematics in
designing his paintings.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:17.050
So maybe you know
Leonardo Da Vinci, too.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:20.760
And so many, many painters are
also used mathematics, and also

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.900
musicians, too.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.490
So artists and mathematics are
quite similar to each other.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:29.150
They can inspire
with each other.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.790
Science or mathematics
can inspire artists.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:38.060
And artists can also inspire
scientists and mathematicians.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.340
So yeah.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:44.290
So if you look at things,
and if you see circle

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.920
from the top and a
triangle from the front,

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.370
you may think that this can
be figure something like this.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.640
But it might be a figure
something like this.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.680
So from a side you
can see the square.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.520
So even from the front,
it is a triangle.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.620
From the top it is circle.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.750
But from the side,
it is a square.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:13.750
And maybe from inside,
maybe can be really--

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:17.050
I'm not sure what's inside.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.720
So things can be
really different.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:24.000
And in order to get closer
to the essence of the things,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.250
you have to use
your imagination.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:31.780
And also you have to use
a very free attitudes

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.360
to look at things.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.950
So inspired by these
kind of things,

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:42.450
or scientific developments,
Picasso or Cezanne

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.610
started cubism, actually.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:51.220
So cubism, there are
various viewpoints

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.700
are in that same paintings.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.360
So in order to get
closer to the essence,

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:04.600
they put a different perspective
on the same paintings.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.690
So I'm sure that Picasso
and Cezanne and all of them

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:16.390
were inspired by mathematics
and physics-- yeah, science.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.420
So also of course we have
the mathematics in music too.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.090
For example, if you--
[NOTE PLAYED] [INAUDIBLE],

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:26.586
the sound is kind of a wave.

00:48:26.586 --> 00:48:27.620
Wave.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:28.430
Yes.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:32.810
So [NOTE PLAYED] if you
like [INAUDIBLE] double

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:37.085
the frequency of this wave,
it can be something like this.

00:48:37.085 --> 00:48:39.410
[HIGHER NOTE PLAYED]
This is a double one

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:43.240
So if you like to--
[NOTE PLAYED] triple,

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.128
third times of this do,
you will have [NOTE PLAYED]

00:48:47.128 --> 00:48:48.340
[HIGHER NOTE PLAYED].

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:52.608
This is the sound
of three, actually.

00:48:52.608 --> 00:48:58.360
[TWO NOTES PLAYED]
This is one and three.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:58.860
Yeah.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.090
This is the sound of three.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:04.170
And if you like to hear
the sound of fourth,

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:08.530
[TWO NOTES PLAYED] two
octaves is sound of fourth.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:09.708
Five.

00:49:09.708 --> 00:49:14.710
[TWO NOTES PLAYED]
This is five sound.

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:15.530
And six.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.180
Sorry.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.230
No, no, no.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.380
Five sound is
actually like this.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:27.410
[TWO NOTES PLAYED] Do, mi.

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:30.090
So here [TWO NOTES PLAYED]
if you play

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:33.470
do, mi, it means
four versus five.

00:49:36.515 --> 00:49:42.741
[TWO NOTES] So this is
the sound of five and six.

00:49:42.741 --> 00:49:49.395
[TWO NOTES] And seven
is similar to this.

00:49:49.395 --> 00:49:57.332
[TWO NOTES] Eight.
[TWO NOTES] Nine.

00:49:57.332 --> 00:50:01.670
[TWO NOTES] And 10. [TWO NOTES]

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:14.380
So maybe you can see that a very
close tone, like two, three,

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:19.010
four, five, its harmony is
quite beautiful for really

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.980
Western people.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.730
Sometimes for Japanese
people, Japanese people like,

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:28.090
love-- [TWO NOTES] --this kind
of very complicated sound.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:35.430
But if you just listen
to very simple notes,

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:40.800
maybe you feel that these
harmonies are quite beautiful,

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.690
simple.

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.630
And going upward,
upward, sometimes you

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:52.730
can get a very kind of
dark or dirty sound.

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:55.494
For example, here--
[DISSONANT NOTES]

00:50:55.494 --> 00:50:58.880
It's a sound of squared 2.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.640
Squared 2 is
something like that,

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:10.396
which is often used in the
in many mysterious movies

00:51:10.396 --> 00:51:12.300
or something.

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:12.800
Yes.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.110
So we have five minutes left.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:22.460
And so now as for
educational sites too,

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.340
for me it's quite
similar to each other.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.390
So they're beautiful
and mysterious.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.900
We are beautiful and
mysterious, I believe.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.370
And we need a sense of
empathies or a sense

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:34.550
of essences over logic.

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:38.840
And also sometimes we need
infinite free perspectives

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.320
towards the things.

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.440
So in order to survive in
this 21st century here,

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:49.870
right now, in this VUCA word--
volatility, uncertainty,

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:51.900
complexity, ambiguity.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:57.180
So things are changing
very fast right now.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.280
So here we have to have
a sense of empathy.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:07.280
And also, we have to see
things with there are

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.955
very infinite way perspectives.

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.770
OK.

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:16.470
So I think for anybody,
mathematics and music

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.030
are really important.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:21.250
And for me, I have a
few challenges in 2016.

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:23.040
So I'd like to introduce this.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.470
And I'd like to finish
this one, this talk.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:31.896
So first challenge is a
collaboration of our artists.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.210
He is mysterious.

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:37.230
Satoshi Okada.

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:41.590
A very well-known artist,
international architect.

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:45.470
He has actually won Dedalo
Minosse International

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.230
Prize in Italy.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:50.860
He won the Grand-prix there.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.950
And yes.

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:57.730
He's based on simplicity,
which is his core value,

00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:03.040
he reached a deep
spirituality in his architect.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.850
Here is an example of his art.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:09.070
So you can check on the
internet of his works.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.860
So here we are
going to Biennale--

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:17.020
he was selected as a very great
architect at Biennale 2016

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.420
again.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:23.670
And this year, the theme is
time, space, and existence.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:28.590
And he decided to
collaborate with artists.

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:35.590
So we are now trying to make up
one work called "Collaborating

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:36.530
With Each Other."

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:39.850
He is an architect and
Tsuboi [INAUDIBLE],

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:45.810
a videographer, and me, jazz
pianist, composer and musician.

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:51.630
And also [INAUDIBLE] Google
also might help us a little bit.

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.850
The other challenge
was for an education.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.800
So we elect to
[INAUDIBLE] as an artist,

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.480
and also with those
powers, we'd like

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:04.320
to start some new learning,
experiential learning.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.440
At Phoenix Consulting, we
are doing for corporations.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.330
And also we like
to do those kind

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:16.350
of new learning, new creative
learning for children to STEAM.

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:19.160
STEAM means STEM plus Art.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:23.560
So we are now in
2016, we are now

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:28.180
challenging a new learning
style with a power

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.710
of artists and technology.

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:35.440
So lovely.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.270
So I think what we need in
the 21st century right now

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.970
is first [JAPANESE].

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:44.840
And also imagination
to connect dots.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:49.480
And also last but
maybe most important

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.890
is to the courage to
play, like Einstein

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.530
says, a person who never
made a mistake never

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:57.280
tried anything new.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.750
So I think the courage to play
is really, really important

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.710
now, because things
are changing.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:05.996
We have to have a
courage to play first.

00:55:05.996 --> 00:55:07.280
Yeah.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:11.660
So what I'm doing right
now is some like this.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:18.120
And I would like to go
online live like this,

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.380
and we'd like to
collaborate with each of you

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.310
someday if I could.

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:25.130
So thank you very much.

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:26.380
Thank you very much.

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:30.330
[APPLAUSE]
