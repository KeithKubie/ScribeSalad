1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.310
You might get frustrated right now because you haven't eaten and your blood

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:09.000
sugar's low,
but I'm going to be,

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.770
I'm going to use the Echo Charles approach of a,
that's weakness,
right?

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.000
It's weakness for me to be getting angry.

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.230
It's weak for me to be complaining because I'm on the tail end of a 72 hour
fast.

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:22.830
That's just weakness.
Not going to complain.
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.660
You don't need to eat for 30 days.
People can go 30 days without eating.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.471
For my daughter,

9
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.980
when she was cutting weight for wrestling this past season and she would say

10
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:34.330
that,
she'd say,
you know,
I'd be getting,
she said,
you know,
dad,

11
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:37.860
I would get really hungry and then I just think people can live for 30 days

12
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:40.800
without eating.
I think I can make it through the next eight hours.
Come on.

13
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.800
It's not that big of a deal.
There's no reason to get hangry.

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.530
That's just an excuse.
Don't do it.

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.300
Carry on with your airborne self.
You know how

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.880
I said this before,

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.240
there's a difference between how you feel and then how you behave.
You know?
True.

18
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.070
You can get hangry on the inside,

19
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.840
but once you start be behaving like you did too,
man,
get angry on the inside

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.560
trading places.
Those are really good.
Like that.
Very good.
Yo.

21
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.100
Actually now that I think about it,
when I was doing deployments after it,

22
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.940
back in the day in the 90s we watched,
we,
there was nothing to do on a ship.

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:24.210
We didn't have an internet.
No one wrote US letters.
No one cared about us.

24
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:25.044
It was no.

25
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.420
So all we did was play spades and watch movies and we'll movies we watched were

26
00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:33.180
on videotape because this is barker and j and before cds,

27
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.770
before Netflix you had video tape and we had a crate full of videos.

28
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.530
And so we were watching the same,
you know,

29
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.170
cheesy movies over and over and over again.

30
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:46.390
Probably trading places was one of them.
So if you go on it,

31
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.330
if you were to go back further in the movies,
you're not cause cause what am I,

32
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:55.180
five years older than you?
Yeah,
fuck sick.
Five or six years.
Yeah.

33
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.930
So I'm just five or six years ahead of you on movies.

34
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.380
So there's a whole bunch of cheesy movies that I actually know about that you

35
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:05.610
might not know about.
Yeah.
And occasionally we're getting an overlap.

36
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.000
Trade places,
polices iconic anywhere you the man.

37
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.040
Oh yeah.
But hangry,
right?
Karate man bleed on the inside.

38
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.730
Hang.
I liked that word hangry,
by the way.
That's
plenty.

39
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.780
But that implies that you're kind of like,
oh,
I'm hangry.
You know?
Like,

40
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.940
like you're expressing yourself,
you know,
don't express yourself.
Yeah.

41
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.700
Your emotions and keep it on the,
and act like a winner.
You fee,

42
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:39.360
you can feel like a loser on the inside.
You can feel hangry,

43
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.890
but act like don't act like that whole liver.

44
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.860
Other people see you be all static like that.
Like,
Oh yeah,

45
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.970
I haven't eaten in four days.
Whatever you,
you know what?
No.

46
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:54.450
Do you hear this joke?
You know what I mean?
Just,
hey,
I haven't eaten in six days.

47
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.810
No big deal.
I'm going to go train Jujitsu.
What are you doing?
Yep.

48
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.440
So yeah.
Oh,
what are you doing?
Sitting around being weak.
Go Dude.

49
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.080
I'll be over here doing something else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So yeah.
Separate.

50
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.340
Separate your feeling and your behavior and typically when it's the end,

51
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.971
you know,

52
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:17.971
you even have a word for it crept up on you and I had no control over it.

53
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.780
No,
you,
you identified it,
gave it a name,
everything.
And if,
I mean,

54
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:26.830
if my experience serves me a lot of times when people say like,
Oh,
I have,

55
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.460
I get hangry or um,
pms scene or I'm whatever,

56
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:34.630
it's to explain their common behavior.
Meaning they just let it go.

57
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.990
They embrace it.
That's how,
that's how it is for them kind of thing.

58
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.530
Please forgive me.
I'm hangry.
Yeah,
yeah.
I get like that sometimes.

59
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.440
What are you talking about?
And you just let it go,
you know,

60
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.740
be like that on the inside.
Be Good on the outside.

61
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.970
Separate the feelings versus behavior.
Next question.

62
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.820
Stifle your emotions inside.

63
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.100
You know,
they say like if you get emotions,
you've got to like let it out,

64
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.650
punch a pillow or whatever.
Yeah.
I guess as it turns out,

65
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:06.400
that's not true because if you intern,
you know how you say stifle,
oh,

66
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:11.401
well the reason I kind of say that with sarcasm is because I think that the,

67
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.810
for instance,
yeah.
You like you're saying people these days,
they say,
Oh,
you know,

68
00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:21.500
you've got to let your emotions out.
You've got to let your emotions out.

69
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.180
You've got,
if you've got to cry,
cry.

70
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.840
If you and I understand where that's coming from,

71
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:29.510
and you can get to a point as a person,

72
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.080
if there's something that's really traumatic that's happening and all you do is

73
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:33.681
hold it in,

74
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:38.390
and I've seen guys get destroyed over that because they're not expressing the

75
00:04:38.391 --> 00:04:39.790
emotions that they have.
Right.

76
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.230
<v 1>Okay.
But that's</v>

77
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.670
<v 0>at a big level,
right?
At a daily level.</v>

78
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.260
No,
you don't express those things.
You keep them in Charlotte.

79
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.840
That's why I say it like that.
Like a big kind of sarcastic,

80
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:58.450
but I'm being serious.
Yeah.
You know?

81
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.590
It's just don't let your emotions out and into the world.

82
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.380
Keep them for yourself.
Own them.
Keep them for yourself.

83
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.370
Don't share them with other people.
If you don't have to.
Yeah.
Now again,

84
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:11.680
people are gonna Freak out that I'm saying this because Barry,

85
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.050
your emotions because then what happens when you bury your,

86
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.070
when you've got something really traumatic that you bury,
then in each you apart,

87
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.360
and I've talked about that.

88
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.290
I mean talking about things that you go through in life and,

89
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.570
and expressing those feelings that you have met them,
that's good.

90
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.540
But what we're talking about is not that what we're talking about,

91
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:32.710
his daily emotions,
little ups and downs,

92
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.140
little tick marks on your Richter scale.

93
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.490
We're not talking about an 8.8 on the Richter scale,
right?

94
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.490
We're talking about just like little twos.

95
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.290
And when you express those twos and threes on the Richter scale out to people,

96
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.120
you just look unstable.
Hangry.
That's a two.
That's a two.
Yeah.
Overall,

97
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.280
and I'm not to split hairs are nothing,
but overall it's,

98
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.050
it's more about dealing with your quote unquote.
So yeah,
if you,
if you,

99
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.860
if a good conducive way to deal with your emotions is to let them out.

100
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.350
And there's all different kinds of emotions.
Like if you're sad,

101
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.530
if something's eating you up on the inside because of sadness or whatever and

102
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:13.100
it's conducive to your recovery development,
whatever,

103
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.670
to express those emotions,
then yes,

104
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:21.470
but if you're hangry and you lose your temper on your kid,
that's not going to,

105
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:24.170
you're not dealing with your emotions correctly,

106
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:28.460
so in stripe emotion,
but it's not really,

107
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:32.090
it is stifling them,
but before you stifle them,
you're identifying them.

108
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.220
You're like,
oh,
hey,
I'm hangry.
Okay.

109
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.610
I identified that I'm going to separate feelings from behavior that's dealing

110
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:39.770
with your emotions right there,
that's dealing with,

111
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.370
it's a great point that oftentimes expressing your emotions to the world doesn't

112
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.250
improve your situation or your position.
Not all.
Correct.
In fact,

113
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.320
I would say that most of the time,

114
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.210
expressing your emotions to the world sets you back,

115
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.750
and that is why I vote.
In many cases,

116
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.460
stifle your emotions.
Keep them in.
Don't let other people see you.

117
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:10.640
Put your cards on the table,
right?
You put your emotional cards on the table.

118
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.670
Now you can't gamble anymore.
You can't.
You're not in the game anymore.

119
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.340
The person knows what's going on.
You're giving it to them,

120
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.400
you're not gonna know what I'm thinking.
You're going to think I'm just,

121
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.610
everything's cool with me were trainings you did too,
right?

122
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.830
If I'm getting frustrated and I show that to you,
what does that do?

123
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.410
You're getting all of a sudden you,
you just go level up.
You Think,
oh,
I gotta be,

124
00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:33.980
he's frustrated.
I can't,
oh,
I'm working.
This is working against them.

125
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.850
If I'm just saying the same face all the time,
which is what I do primarily,
hey,

126
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:41.150
same face all the time.
Just we're,
you know,
moving the same way.

127
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.410
When you do get me,

128
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.500
I forget what you say when you get me to react to something good.

129
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.050
Recognize the urgency.

130
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.600
You say you recognize a little urgency there and I always go down.

131
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.850
I don't want him to recognize,

132
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.300
I'd rather just have you just pass my guard and you're just there and we just

133
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:00.140
sit there like it's no big deal.
Not In me.

134
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:03.530
Get all panicky where then you level up a little bit.

135
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.560
And that's the same thing with life,
right?

136
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.850
Every time you express these big emotions to your boss or to your team,

137
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.470
you express these big emotions to your team.
They see all your cards.

138
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.510
Don't let them see all your cards.
Is this manipulating kind of,

139
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.320
right?
This is one of those things where people think,
oh,
transparency.

140
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:27.260
We hear that all the time.
These days.
Transparency.
You've got to be transparent.

141
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.420
No,
actually you don't.
Yeah know with that,

142
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.740
you don't have to be transparent all the time.
You have to win the game.

143
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.911
You know what?

144
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:38.750
Does the football coach go out and canvass playbook to the other football team?

145
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.430
No.
He's got to win the game.
Typically.
No,
and that's not how you win the game.

146
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.460
So are we.
You know what we're doing?
We're playing chess.
It's emotional chest.

147
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.660
You're playing with other human beings.
You want to win.

148
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:54.650
Now if you're winning so that I can take advantage of you so I can manipulate

149
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:58.350
you and get something from you that you don't want to give me.
That's bad.

150
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.910
And I'm not talking about doing that.

151
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.920
But if one of them doing is keeping my calm so that instead of escalating an

152
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:05.940
argument with you,

153
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.210
I'm getting you to see it from my perspective just by remaining calm.

154
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.730
That's what we're talking about here.

155
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.370
And you'll leave told that story the other day where it,

156
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.330
he tells the story lot cause it was hilarious story where I came in,

157
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.270
we didn't have a chance to talk to each other.
I,

158
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.810
he was playing in this big operation and I come in 10 minutes before the

159
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:26.460
operation,
I said,
hey,
let me,
let me see what you're doing.

160
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.890
And he kind of shows me on a map,
hey,
we're going to go here,
here and here.

161
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.450
I was like,
Hey,
you should do this instead.
And he was like,

162
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.830
do we leave it in 10 minutes?
And I said,
man,
but just think about it.
And he goes,

163
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:43.020
you know what,
just cancel the OP.
And he was all mad.
Right.
And,
and you know,

164
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:45.060
he's,
he's like an Jocko kind of like laughed at me.

165
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:48.400
I did laugh at him like a leg,
like a jerk,
you know?
It was like nobody,

166
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.540
I was like,
hey man,
listen,
just think about what I'm saying right now.

167
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.610
But that's the,
that's an example,
right?
I didn't show my emotions,
which was,

168
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.460
which would be more like,
dude,
are you serious right now?

169
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.060
You're going to cancel an op because we have a difference of opinion and think

170
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.250
about what your,
I didn't do that.
I was like,
hey man,
I get it.

171
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.020
Everyone's stressed out right now.
We've got to leave on this thing quickly.

172
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.360
Think about what I'm saying.
They'll look at it.
This is all I'm saying.

173
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.900
We could execute this in a better way.
So that's what I'm talking about.

174
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.620
Does that make me manipulative?
No,
it doesn't make me manipulative.

175
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.890
It makes us as a team do a better job.

176
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.550
And as soon as life saw that and he was like deescalated himself and he was good

177
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:29.910
to go,
we we move on.
Yeah.
So that's what I'm talking about.

178
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:34.860
Stifle your emotions at all times,
you know?

179
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.900
And,
and just to address that though,
for Real,

180
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.040
when you do see the big emotional impactful things in someone's life and they

181
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:47.670
don't express them,
that absolutely is bad.

182
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:51.750
And I'll tell you where you see this a lot is with kids,
you know,
kids,

183
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.910
teens where they,
they there something bothering them and they don't,

184
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.300
they hold it in,
hold it in because they don't have anybody to talk to.

185
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.920
They can't talk to mom and dad because mom and dad don't get it.

186
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.360
Their friends are the people that they're pissed off and pissed off at anyways,

187
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.690
so they can't tell them what's going on.

188
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.560
So they sit there and they harbor a lot of that anger and that can be,

189
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:13.200
that can be very problematic.
And it goes through all through,
you know,

190
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.140
adults as well.
And,
and you know,

191
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.050
at work sometimes people,

192
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.460
they got problems at home so they can't talk to their wife because that's what

193
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:23.881
the problem was.

194
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.190
And they can't talk to her husband because that's the source of the problem.

195
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:28.470
But then they get to work and they don't want to look like the person that's got

196
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:30.300
problems at home.
So I'm not going to say anything there either.

197
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.800
And the next thing you do,
what are they doing?

198
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.380
They're trying to escape those problems.
How are they doing it?
Instead of,

199
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.660
instead of letting those problems out and talking to somebody about them,

200
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.750
they're having a,
you know,
having a drink in the afternoon,

201
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.670
getting on the alcohol,
whatever.

202
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:45.360
They're doing something that's negative and they're not moving forward at all.

203
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:47.730
So those are not the kind of feelings that,

204
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:51.480
and emotions that you want to subdue or stifle.

205
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.500
But these little ones,
twos and threes on the Richter scale being hangry,
get,
get,

206
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.780
get,
control those things and stifling,

207
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.170
stifling certain emotions ones and twos is a good way to deal with them because

208
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:09.190
when these,
cause they're usually real spontaneous emotions.
They'll and they'll,

209
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.910
they don't have the power to sustain.
Yes,

210
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:15.880
they're just gonna they're there and then they just fade away and that's cool.

211
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:18.730
That's why.
Yes,
correct.
Then over time,

212
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:20.560
now you're good at dealing with them in that way.

213
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.320
When you get hangry and you've been for one year,

214
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.980
you've been dealing with it by just ignoring it,
you know,
in regards to behavior,

215
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:30.550
just not acting on it.
Now you're good at doing that,
and that's automatic.

216
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:33.010
Now you don't get,
you don't act hangry anymore.
