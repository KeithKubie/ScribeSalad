think in retrospect it would have been a
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.300
think in retrospect it would have been a
more interesting story like you're

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
more interesting story like you're
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.640
more interesting story like you're
saying if there was a little bit more

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
saying if there was a little bit more
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.140
saying if there was a little bit more
paranoia because right from the opening

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150

scene you see those two divers get
attacked by a shark so you know it's a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
attacked by a shark so you know it's a
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.090
attacked by a shark so you know it's a
shark and you're on Roy Scheider's side

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
shark and you're on Roy Scheider's side
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.170

but it would have been a more

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
but it would have been a more
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.450
but it would have been a more
interesting story dramatically if there

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
interesting story dramatically if there
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.910
interesting story dramatically if there
was just a shred of doubt maybe even in

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
was just a shred of doubt maybe even in
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.170
was just a shred of doubt maybe even in
the viewers mind even though you're

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
the viewers mind even though you're
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.399
the viewers mind even though you're
you're you know you're going to get a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
you're you know you're going to get a
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.380
you're you know you're going to get a
shark yeah but I think maybe for the
