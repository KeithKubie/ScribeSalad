Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I mean, look funny. Then when you see pictures of Trump, he's eating Kentucky Fried Chicken. When you see pictures of this dude, he's, he loves her Trump phrase, Kentucky fried chicken was fucking private jet hilarious. He really loves that stuff. He loves it. He really fucking loves fast food. Like when he got all those athletes, when they came to visit them and the government was shut down and brought them off fast food, he didn't understand that. Like what the fuck this shit. And then he had another team showed up months later and he broke out the fast food again. The government was hope. Just imagine the fucking, you're going to see the president of the United States and you're a professional athlete. Yeah. Right. Your body literally is a temple and they were college athletes, but oh, they're college. I would still listen. Let's be real about that. Huh? Carriage athletes should get fucking paid crazy. That's the biggest robbery and all them politic's. Yeah. College sports cans to get into the NBA and the NFL. Yeah. You had a chance if they do, but you're making billions off these kids. Fucking billions. Don't give him a sweatshirt. Money, $20 fucking fast food.

Speaker 1:          01:11          I'm telling you man, this guy, in terms of like material, current and future, it's almost like we glutton down. It's almost like Trump was ice cream when he was in office. He was so good for comedy that it was like, there are so many Trump jokes every now everyone's like, no mo anymore. Can you take another bite cause I need something else. I can't have ice cream. These like one more bite ice cream is going to come chucking out of your throat. It's really true. It's so, he's so fucking eccentric. Like good or bad. Just look at him as a human. It's such a rare human being. Yeah. You know? I mean you've seen it with the, with the hair and the fucking constant golfing. Even though he shit, he shit on fucking Obama Golfing and he's gone away. Him, he doesn't even try to pretend he's not a hypocrite. No, not at all. He's just everything. He's just the fat American on a jet Ski. Just letting it rip.

Speaker 1:          02:14          If you know what's also hilarious, I think this is a real thing. Trump derangement syndrome. I think it's real. You mean people that are obsessed with him, they're obsessed with, you know, this is the thing that's going to get him. He'll be out of office in three weeks instead of like looking at it like this is the argument for garlic Michael Mouse that he's an objective analyst. Stepping back, looking at this, he's doesn't, he doesn't have a vested interest in this guy winning here, that guy and when he's just going, hmm, what is this? Sitting back and watching, this is if I, if I'm going to take that position, not emotionally involved because some people get so emotionally involved they can't sleep, they start crying, they think it's the end of the world. The world is exactly the same. We just have a different figure head and I think it will present challenges that will make us more understanding of each other.

Speaker 1:          03:04          I really do. That's what I really think. I think there's, there's good and bad about every situation, but the pro I see is communication. If we're just honest with the way we communicate, I think people on the right and people on the left, they share a lot in common. There's a lot, a lot that they share rather than what they don't share in common. Yeah. You know, the only thing they don't share is what they're watching. Well, there's that too. Right. And it's also the vibe you get. Yeah. I like this. The vibe from these, whatever, whether it's CNN, whatever show you're into MSNBC, Fox News, they all give out a vibe. Yeah. And that vibe is, you know, we are right. Here's what's going on. Here's why that's a problem. You know, and everyone has a different problem and everyone thinks they're right. And then you have, so you have different things.

Speaker 1:          03:52          You, some of them are have like eagles and flags and Tom, that's Fox News. Like that's my style. I'm into that kind of truth. Gimme gimme that shit. Yeah. Fucking yeah. Yeah. Come on over here though, right way. Yeah. All right guys. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Y'All fucking neighbor. Let him move in to your fucking neighborhood. Great job, Matt. Out trucks and hats. And guns that could comes your team. That becomes your claim. That's what it is. It's the team thing. Most of it, and, and the, the unfortunate part is both are saying, are spending so much time rather than thinking about this is the problem that we have to deal with. They're spending all their time thinking those other people are assholes. Right, exactly. It's being, it's the venomous attacks against fellow Americans because they have a slightly different view about healthcare. That part is the, the derangement of the culture right now.
