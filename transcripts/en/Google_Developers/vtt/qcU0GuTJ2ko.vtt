00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's the morning
of day two at Google I/O 2017.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.810
Hi, I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.060
I'm your friendly developer
advocate on the ground

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.460
here at Shoreline, and
I'm going to be taking you

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.067
around all the sandbox areas,
just like I was yesterday

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:19.900
so that you can have
some of the experiences

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.150
as if you were here with me.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.490
So let's go play around in
the accessibility tent, which

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.190
is, of course, all about
giving all of your users

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.840
a great experience
with your service.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.940
Let's check it out.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.215
Hi, Rob, how you doing?

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:34.290
ROB: Good, how are you?

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.623
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm doing great.

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:38.460
So can you help me with the
accessibility of my website?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.410
ROB: Absolutely.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.080
So what we're showing
here is the new Audits 2.0

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.430
panel in DevTools.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.700
So Audits 2.0 is basically
taking the very popular

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.420
Lighthouse Chrome extension
and integrating it directly

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.212
into DevTools.

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:52.670
So this will run
a number of checks

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.090
on your site for various web
app stuff, performance, best

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.411
practices, and,
especially, accessibility.

00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:58.910
So--

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, well,
let's see what's wrong with it.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.510
ROB: So here we've
got a page that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.190
has some form elements,
which are missing

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.427
their associated labels.

00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:08.510
And so if you want, you
can actually go and, like,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.480
click on these nodes right here,
and that will actually take you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.790
into the elements panel.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.370
So here we're showing the new
accessibility tab as well.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.700
So you can inspect all
sorts of information

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.910
about this node, this little
input field right here.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.710
ROB: Yeah.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: But
it looks like it's not

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.291
going to read anything.

00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:25.790
ROB: Right.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.306
So right now, we don't have
a label for this control,

00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:30.680
so a screen reader is not
going to know what to announce.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.360
So we actually do have a
label element right down here.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.965
If you want, you can
Control click on that.

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:39.000
Yep, and add an attribute.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.030
You can type in 4
equals sub dash name.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.490
Yep.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.590
Hit Enter, and
what that does, now

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.060
if you click on this
input field again.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.887
There you go.

00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:54.470
Now you can see that
you've associated

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.400
the label with the control.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.020
It's got a nice name
and a screen reader

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.610
will announce it and
tell the user what

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.660
they're about to interact with.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome!

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.410
ROB: Yeah!

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That was easy, Rob.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.680
Thanks!

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.507
ROB: Absolutely.

00:02:02.507 --> 00:02:03.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.050
Well, we're going to go
look at some more stuff.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.540
ROB: Yeah.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.210
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thank you so much.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.876
ROB: Absolutely.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:08.210
Happy to help.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, let's
go check out this selfie stick

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.224
with my friend, Austin.

00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:14.140
How you doing, Austin?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.475
AUSTIN: Good.

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:17.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you've
got a selfie stick, which

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.670
is designed for people
that selfie sticks usually

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.750
aren't well designed for.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.666
AUSTIN: Exactly, yeah.

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.390
So we have a pixel
here running TalkBack,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.760
which is a native
screen unit to Android,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.820
and we have a feature
that will give feedback

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.430
when it's in the camera mode
to what's on the screen.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let
me see what it says.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.810
SELFIE VOICE: Camera two faces.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.920
Shutter button two faces.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.480
Double tap to activate.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.740
Two-- Shutter Button
is now enabled.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.690
Photo taken.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.510
Two faces.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.010
AUSTIN: Yeah, it
just took a selfie.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.066
So it's giving audible
feedback to what's

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:50.690
on the screen, if
the face is centered,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.970
and if it's good for selfie.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
there's one more thing

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.230
that I want to check out.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.021
It's really cool, and
it's right over here.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.790
Hi, Jessica.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.730
So this is a spoon
for people who have,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.540
say, limited hand movement.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.370
Right?

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.530
And I'm just going to
go and try and use it,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.456
if that's all right.

00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:23.176
[CHUCKLES]

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.910
The trick is to try
and dump the beans out.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.210
I can't do it.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.550
That's really cool!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.660
Thank you so much.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.750
I'll put that down.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.500
