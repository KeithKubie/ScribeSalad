00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So each complexity class here follows a number of conditions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
or has a number of conditions that define it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so P is defined as being the class of all problems

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that can be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and NEXPTIME, for example, is defined

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
as the class of all problems that can be

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
solved in exponential time on a non-deterministic RAM.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now when you want to arrange those classes into a sort of hierarchy,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
then you always have to think about which conditions

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
are more restrictive than others.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I hope it's clear by now that determinism

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is more restrictive than non-determinisms.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So basically, we can say non-determinism

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is stronger than determinism.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Of course, this is very hand weary,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so don't show this to a theoretical computer scientist,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but for here it is okay to think about it that way.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now what about exponential time and polynomial time,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I think that is a very clear one.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So exponential time clearly should give you at least as much power as polynomial time,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and this basically gives us the hierarchy,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because polynomial time is clearly the most restrictive one,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and non-deterministic exponential time is clearly the most powerful one.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So we can already say here that P goes into the very inner circle

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
whereas NEXPTIME goes out here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now what about NP and exponential time on a deterministic machine?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When we talked about non-determinism,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we already found out that polynomial time non-determinism

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
can always be simulated in exponential time determinism,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which means that exponential time on a deterministic machine is

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
at least as powerful as non-deterministic time on a polynomial time machine.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So NP goes into the second circle here

00:01:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and EXTIME into the third.
