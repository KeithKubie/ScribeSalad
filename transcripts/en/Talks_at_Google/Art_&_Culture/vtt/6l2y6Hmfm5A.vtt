[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.390
SPEAKER 1: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.070
We're excited to welcome
Gaelynn Lea to Talks at Google.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.680
Gaelynn is a violinist,
a songwriter,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.920
and speaker, who has a
unique take on fiddle music,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.640
incorporating her love of
traditional tunes, songwriting,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.030
poetry, and sonic exploration.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.160
Last year, she won NPR
Music's Tiny Desk Contest,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.320
a competition
drawing submissions

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
of original songwriters from
musicians across the country.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.920
Since winning the
Tiny Dance Contest,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
Gaelynn's musical reach
has expanded significantly.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.580
And she has released an
EP, a full length album,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.640
and has been touring across
the United States and Europe.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.880
In addition to
performing, Gaelynn

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.270
speaks about disability,
overcoming challenges,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.400
and the joy of music.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.000
She has a congenital disability
called osteogensis imperfecta,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.420
or more commonly known
as brittle bones disease.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.750
Gaelynn is a strong voice in
the disabilities community.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.240
She uses her music as
a platform to advocate

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.310
for people with
disabilities and to promote

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.470
positive social change.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.050
Gaelynn believes
society must work harder

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.980
to prioritize accessibility
so people with disabilities

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.470
can participate fully
in their communities

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.680
and use their talents and
gifts without barriers

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.660
or discrimination.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.810
For today's talk, Gaelynn
will first perform,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.170
then we'll have a fireside chat
discussion, which will then

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.800
lead into a Q&amp;A.
Following the Q&amp;A,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.680
she will close out with
a couple of final songs.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.310
So please be sure to
stay for the whole thing.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.420
And for Googlers in
the audience please

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.600
think of your questions for the
Q&amp;A. So without further ado,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.990
please welcome me in joining
to the Chicago Google

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.080
stage, Gaelynn Lea.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.580
GAELYNN LEA: Thank you.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.580
[MUSIC - GAELYNN LEA, "WATCH THE
 WORLD UNFOLD"]

00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:20.945
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:22.885
Thank you.

00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:27.770
SPEAKER 2: Hi, Gaelynn.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.990
GAELYNN LEA: Hi, thanks
so much for having me.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.200
SPEAKER 2: Thank you.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.680
Absolutely.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.030
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.160
SPEAKER 2: It's a pleasure
to have you at Google.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.890
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.556
SPEAKER 2: It's a
beautiful performance.

00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:35.400
GAELYNN LEA: Thank
you very much, thanks.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.612
SPEAKER 2: I love the looping
and the ambience of what

00:06:38.612 --> 00:06:39.820
you're doing with the violin.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.780
It's very unique.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.400
GAELYNN LEA: Thank you.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.750
SPEAKER 2: It's very expressive.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.500
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.670
SPEAKER 2: And it's the
beauty of music, the ability

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.860
to express yourself,
be creative--

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.460
whether it's songwriting,
performing, touring.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.500
How did you get
your start in music?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.460
GAELYNN LEA: Well, I got
started way back in fifth grade.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.970
So the orchestra came
to our elementary school

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.170
and played for us to try
to entice us into joining

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.170
orchestra the next year.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.690
And I really loved the
sound of the strings.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.454
And I talked to my parents.

00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:14.620
And I was, like next year,
I want to join orchestra.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.090
So I didn't really think
about how I was going to play.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.880
I figured-- I mean usually my
whole life has been spent kind

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.650
of just figuring stuff out.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.670
So when I got there, I took
the music listening test,

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.060
and I was the only student
in the class that year

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.270
that got a perfect score.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.270
So the teacher took
it upon herself

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.760
to help me figure it out,
even though we didn't really

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.200
know how I was going to play.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.660
So I tried a bunch of the
different instruments.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.730
And the cello was too big.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.560
And the violin was too
big on my shoulder,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.000
but we kind of came to
this idea of playing it

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.210
up and down like a cello.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.050
And it was really fun, and
I've been doing it ever since,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.530
kind of along this path
that's led down a very

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.940
different road than I expected.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.870
But it's always been
the violin first.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.480
So yeah, it's really fun.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.430
SPEAKER 2: Nice.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.888
And who are some
of your influences

00:08:04.888 --> 00:08:06.580
musically as a performer?

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.920
GAELYNN LEA: Well, probably
the biggest influence

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.690
is Alan Sparhawk.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.700
He's in the band Low.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.440
But in 2011, he contacted
me and asked if we'd

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.760
like to do a project together.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.320
And I was like, well, of course.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:20.950
That's cool.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.290
But he introduced me
to the looping pedal

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.570
and also to this idea of more
expensive, longer sounds,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.480
and just kind of changed a lot.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.669
And then in other
forms of music,

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.250
like I really love
lyrics and harmony and so

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.600
like Simon and Garfunkel, and
The Decemberists, and Neutral

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.849
Milk Hotel, and Wilco.

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:43.390
I don't know.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.790
Those are the things I
grew up listening to.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.460
But in terms of what
I specifically do,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.350
he was really
influential for me.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.850
Yeah.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.920
SPEAKER 2: That's great.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.503
Yeah, tell us a
little more about just

00:08:53.503 --> 00:08:56.290
working with Alan and the
projects you've done together.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.720
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah, well,
we started back in 2011,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.300
as I said.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.690
And it was a live score to a
film, a 1920s Halloween film.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.170
And it was way out of my
range of what I had ever done,

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.310
but I don't know.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.110
For some reason, I felt like
this will be a fun challenge.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.210
And he looped my
violin in that project.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.010
And so I would just play
harmony to what I was hearing,

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:21.880
and we kind of--

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.900
we practiced a lot.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.600
I think we had like six or
eight pretty long rehearsals

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.210
for that.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.720
And so after we were done,
he's like, that was fun.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.750
We should probably
book some shows.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.750
So we booked a show
later in the month.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.060
And a couple of days
before the show, I

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.040
happened to write my first song.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.902
And it kind of came
out of nowhere.

00:09:40.902 --> 00:09:41.860
And I showed it to him.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.030
And he's like, that's good.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.020
Let's do it tomorrow.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.585
So the-- which was so scary.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.085
SPEAKER 2: No time
like the present.

00:09:47.085 --> 00:09:49.251
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah, that
wasn't what I was expecting.

00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:50.740
And so we did it the next day.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.130
And "The Murder of Crows" kind
of evolved into like about half

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.040
of my songs and then
half instrumentals.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.720
And then he would do one or
two of his songs now and then.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.996
And it became this
kind of unique blend.

00:10:03.996 --> 00:10:05.620
But it was really
him just like helping

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.300
me get a start in
songwriting, which was cool.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.780
I mean, the singing part,
it wasn't part of the plan,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.006
I don't think initially.

00:10:12.006 --> 00:10:13.630
SPEAKER 2: It's a
lot of improvisation.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.380
GAELYNN LEA: Oh,
a lot of improv.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.180
SPEAKER 2: Figuring
it out as you go.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.560
GAELYNN LEA: Yep, yep, and
then he brought me a looping

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.900
pedal at one of the
band practices and said,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.740
this is for you.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.930
I think you'll like it,
like you should work on it.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.030
And someday you'll
perform by yourself.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.760
And I thought he
was not accurate,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.630
but it turns out after a lot of
practicing, it really is fun.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.780
And even solo shows
have been really fun.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.520
Nothing I envisioned, though.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.020
Yeah.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.620
SPEAKER 2: So as
a solo performer,

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.930
how has that change been?

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.585
Like preparing for shows
and going out on the road,

00:10:44.585 --> 00:10:47.210
for example, what are the things
we might just take for granted

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.585
or might not necessarily
realize in that process for you?

00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:52.220
GAELYNN LEA: Oh, well, for in
touring in general, you mean?

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.020
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.880
GAELYNN LEA: Well,
touring is awesome.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.320
I get to do it with my husband.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.620
And it's really, really
fun to see the country

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.030
and meet all these new people.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.696
Some of the things
you don't think about

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:06.610
is just like you have to play
no matter how bad you feel,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.510
or how stressed out you are, or
how tired you are and just like

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.460
creating that mental energy.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.060
Or like how weird the
venue is or the sounds--

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.820
you just kind of
have to go with it.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.160
And and that's
something that I guess--

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.326
I performed a lot before
we left, but on the road,

00:11:24.326 --> 00:11:25.950
you're not going to
have all good days.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.370
So you've kind of
just got to find a way

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.680
to connect with the
music and the audience

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.540
and remember that it's
not all about you.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.360
And so it's actually
all about the audience.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.765
So you have to just be there for
that, because that's your job.

00:11:40.765 --> 00:11:41.640
You know what I mean?

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:41.940
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.960
GAELYNN LEA: So it's a
little different take,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.046
but it's still--

00:11:44.046 --> 00:11:46.170
I mean, I still get the
same like rewards out of it

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.220
than I did when I was
playing back at home,

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.440
just on a little bit
different context, I guess.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.470
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.690
So in terms of the music and how
you connect with the audience,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.820
just the tone of your songs,
just the looping, the violin

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.770
work, and just a
lot of the subject

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.520
matter that you
sing about, what is

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.139
that like, just connecting
with the audience, the feedback

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:06.930
you get from folks?

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.980
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah, my songs
are kind of intense, I guess.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.600
I think a lot
about spirituality.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.620
And I think with my disability,
I've had some near--

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.000
I wouldn't say near death
experiences like that.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.460
But I've had some experiences
that have been kind of scary.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.280
And I think that that
kind of reminds you

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.890
at a younger age
than maybe normally

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.420
that you're not immortal
and that life is short.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.920
And you have to
make the best of it.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.970
And I know that informs
my lyrics and the subject

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.230
matter that I write about.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.580
And so yeah, so I guess
they're kind of intense songs.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.650
And the violin is a very
beautiful instrument

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.700
that has all these long tones.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.200
And it clearly--

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.930
I think it sounds like
pretty close to a human voice

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.420
in a different way.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.250
And so people respond
pretty strongly to it.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.200
And it's cool,
because I get to hear

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.350
what it is about the
song that drew them in.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.770
And a lot of times I get to hear
about their lives after shows.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.720
Like I really like
meeting new people

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.630
and learning about what
they liked about the music

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.094
but then also just what
their lives are like.

00:13:07.094 --> 00:13:08.760
Meeting new people
is the part, I guess,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.635
I wasn't thinking as
much about when we left.

00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:13.020
And then all of a sudden
it's like the main thing

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.040
that touring is.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.480
That's like what you do
is you meet new people,

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.370
and it's really cool.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.270
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.260
And seeing you perform
live, it's definitely

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.570
different than on
the recordings,

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.295
just because I think
of that connection,

00:13:23.295 --> 00:13:25.870
that in-person connection
that's going on.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.720
So even coming up, and
it was like, oh, wow.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.480
I'm taken aback by it
because of the intensity.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.230
GAELYNN LEA: Cool.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.055
Yeah.

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:33.430
SPEAKER 2: Speaking
of intensity,

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.830
and thinking about
just shifting gears

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.371
a little bit, let's
talk a little bit

00:13:36.371 --> 00:13:38.760
about the Tiny Desk Contest
and how that has just

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.340
changed your experience
as a musician

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.430
and like career-wise what the
ramifications of that has been.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.670
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah, well,
I was glad they warned me

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.604
that things were going to
change when they told me.

00:13:50.604 --> 00:13:52.770
I guess I kind of had a
feeling, but I didn't really

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.860
realize the implications.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.270
So after the Tiny Desk
Contest was announced

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.347
and we went out to DC, we
did a few shows with NPR.

00:13:59.347 --> 00:14:00.180
And they were great.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.430
They're such good people.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.870
They're so awesome.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.730
And then I met-- like,
I met Martin Atkins.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.480
He's from Chicago.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.680
And I've just been meeting
people through that.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.340
That was the first big thing.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.394
But then the thing I
wasn't really like--

00:14:14.394 --> 00:14:15.810
you know, I didn't
really know how

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.760
it would go down is I
got a lot more offers

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.470
to play farther away.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.370
And so I started working with
a booking agent last summer,

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.370
and he has been
booking us pretty much

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.600
nonstop since October.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.020
So we-- my husband and
I-- both left our jobs,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.340
and we sold our house.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.930
And we bought a van.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.960
And we literally
like has been touring

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.659
for the last many, many months.

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:40.700
And it's been really fun.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.730
We've been to 37 states and
done, I think, 150 shows

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.590
and been to five countries.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.781
And it's just like a
very different life

00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:49.530
than I had before.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.630
I was teaching fiddle
lessons in my hometown,

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.617
and I was really
enjoying that too.

00:14:53.617 --> 00:14:55.950
But this has been really cool,
like a very big adventure

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.064
for us and definitely because
of the Tiny Desk for sure.

00:14:59.064 --> 00:14:59.730
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.300
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.260
SPEAKER 2: Wow, wow.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:01.970
GAELYNN LEA: So a
lot has changed.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.810
SPEAKER 2: Sometimes
people, they'll

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.420
be done being on the
road and touring,

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.310
and they'll go and do
teaching, for example.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.935
GAELYNN LEA: And I
might do that again.

00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:09.721
I loved teaching.

00:15:09.721 --> 00:15:11.220
But we're going to
just kind of keep

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.200
going until we don't
want to anymore.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.150
But, you know, we did
a seven-month thing

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.060
where my husband had a leave of
absence from work to help me,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.590
because I can't tour by myself.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.800
Obviously I needed a
lot more assistance.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.540
And so he's the guy
that helps, and they

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.710
were very understanding.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.949
And they said, sure, go see.

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:29.240
And hopefully you'll come back.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.270
But if you don't,
that's good news for us.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.420
And so they let us try it.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.220
And at the end of
the seven months,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.540
we decided to keep going.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.220
SPEAKER 2: Wow.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:37.970
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.100
It's been fun.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.710
SPEAKER 2: So Europe,
the US, the UK as well.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.630
So you've been on
the road for a while.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:44.840
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.320
SPEAKER 2: Tell us a little
more about your experiences

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:46.830
with touring.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.913
GAELYNN LEA: Well, you
know, touring is one thing.

00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:52.140
Like it's really,
really, really fun.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.280
It's pretty intense.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.090
You drive a lot.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.890
You don't always
get enough sleep.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.520
And you are eating
a lot of corn nuts.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.370
But then touring
with a disability

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.480
has been a whole
another different thing.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.680
So a lot of venues
aren't accessible,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.240
I would say more than half.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.430
I mean, it's solidly
more than half.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.350
And they might be
accessible to the patrons

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.670
but not to the performers.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.300
And so people are always
lifting my chair up

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.120
or are getting ramps
out of the van.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.420
And that's OK, but it's
just another level of work.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.389
And it's not OK.

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:26.680
That's the weird part about it.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.620
It's like I am a
pretty flexible person.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:35.260
And I've grown up adapting,
but if you think about a venue,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.440
just making it
welcoming and accessible

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.440
provides me the same experience
that any other performer would

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.280
have.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.190
Like you don't picture Aerosmith
being lifted on stage by four

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:50.170
people and like arranged in
his chair before he plays

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.970
or any artist.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.260
Bands don't have to do that.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.670
It's of like-- it changes
the vibe of what's

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.049
happening on stage.

00:16:59.049 --> 00:17:01.090
And so a lot of venues
will equate to like, well,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.740
if we help you get on
stage with your wheelchair,

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.550
if we all lift it, then they
don't need to get a ramp.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.550
But really, being able to
just do things on my own

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.339
has a different level of
like dignity and self-control

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.650
and just things that
most performers get

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.569
to do without thinking
about it, you know?

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.640
And then, yeah, just trying
to find accessible hotels

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.130
and like just different
little things that I guess

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.619
I didn't really realize
how much they added up

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:30.666
until we went on the road with
another musician named Jess

00:17:30.666 --> 00:17:32.290
Klein, and she's a
really awesome lady.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.030
And we did 12 shows together.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.500
And she's like, holy cow.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.080
I thought touring was
hard, but you guys

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.300
are working really, really hard.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.920
But it doesn't have
to be that way.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.010
And that's kind of the
message I want to spread

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.730
is that accessibility
can be a priority.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.420
And there's got to
be creative ways.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.470
Like there's one venue that
just wasn't accessible, not even

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.540
to the guests, you know.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.190
Like people couldn't
have gotten in.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.530
And so I said, I'm really
uncomfortable speaking

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.660
about disability rights
and then playing at a place

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.610
where people with
disabilities can't even go.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.780
So the venue was awesome and
moved the event to a church

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.390
and hosted it still, and
they were the sponsor.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.530
But they moved it.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.090
And there's creative solutions
like that all over the place.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.580
And I think we
just need to start

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.486
talking about it more, seeing
what we can do as a community.

00:18:19.486 --> 00:18:20.860
I understand that
some things are

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.650
cost prohibitive in the
moment, but there's always

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.960
fundraising or being
creative in different ways.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.020
So some venues build ramps, and
those are my favorite venues.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.190
They like go out of their
way to have it ready when

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.398
we get there, and that just--

00:18:34.398 --> 00:18:35.380
SPEAKER 2: It's good.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.330
GAELYNN LEA: It just
warms my heart, I guess.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:37.830
Yeah.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:38.710
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.280
Just in thinking about venues
in Chicago, for example,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.350
many of them could be
just very difficult

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.290
for people who were
able-bodied to access at times.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.890
So it sounds like
from your experience,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.621
you might have a whole new
set of opinions about that.

00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:53.370
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.689
And I try to be
understanding and give people

00:18:56.689 --> 00:18:57.730
the benefit of the doubt.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.580
But I think changing
the dialogue from,

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.970
wouldn't it be nice
if we were accessible?

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.670
To, we are really going to
try to become accessible.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.630
That would be cool.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.797
That's what I'd like to see.

00:19:08.797 --> 00:19:09.463
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:19:09.463 --> 00:19:10.270
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:14.950
SPEAKER 2: So as an artist,
and just the purpose of the art

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.160
can be such an important thing
for giving people a voice

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.600
and giving people access.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.180
How do you see
yourself as a musician

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.180
being able to give people
more of a voice in this area?

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.930
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.350
Well, I clearly can't speak
for everyone with a disability,

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.870
and I don't want
to try to portray

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.280
more opinions than my own.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.700
But I just think
representation in the media

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.730
is a really important
thing and in the arts.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.240
Because if you're thinking
about health care, for example,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.300
and all these like reforms that
people are talking about right

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.120
now, and you never see a
person with a disability,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.640
they're not going to
come to mind right away.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.020
You know what I mean?

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.140
And I think the arts have
a really important function

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.740
to make it one of the first
things you think about,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.690
because you've seen it before.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.720
And I can have a message to
my music or I don't have to.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.300
I don't think it's about
even the words I'm singing.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.850
It's just about being in the
physical space of a performance

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.770
venue and people making
that connection that,

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.010
oh, this does exist.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.190
You know what I mean?

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.370
And people with
disabilities can go out

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.570
and do the things that they want
to do and pursue their dreams.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.920
And this is a reality.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.070
And one of my newer songs that's
going to be on the next album

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.850
is actually about
disability rights.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.760
But that's the first song
I've ever written specifically

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.450
about that issue, because I do
think I don't need to always

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.350
be singing about it.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.350
But I do want to
be talking about it

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:46.000
in talks like this and just
kind of raising awareness.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.540
As a public figure you
can do that, and then just

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.400
by setting an example
in the public sphere

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.100
so people can see it.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.220
You know, we think about
festivals, for example, right.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.420
That's a big one.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.096
I was talking to a
festival organizer,

00:21:01.096 --> 00:21:02.470
and I understand
why she said it,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.660
but she said, well,
we don't pick acts

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.400
based on their disability.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.480
But of course, if
there's a talented person

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.390
with a disability
we would have them.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.260
And I said, yeah, but if you
had an all white male lineup,

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.340
you would hear about it.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.020
Like, you definitely would.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.570
Like first sure, people
would be outraged.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.810
And yet, disability doesn't
have to be anywhere on the bill

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.340
and nobody says anything
yet, because it's so far

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.690
out of the public sphere still.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.450
Like, we're working.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:29.010
And we're working.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.630
And it's getting
there, where there's

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.232
a little more infiltration
where people start to notice.

00:21:34.232 --> 00:21:35.940
But hey, there's no
one with a disability

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.830
represented, but
we're still pretty

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.597
new at this in terms of--

00:21:39.597 --> 00:21:42.180
people have been working really
hard to do it for a long time.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.207
But I'm saying like that's not
something that you think about.

00:21:45.207 --> 00:21:46.540
She hadn't made that connection.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.570
And when I said
that, she's like, oh.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.920
You are right.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.060
We would hear about that.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.700
And so why people aren't
demanding more people

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.485
with disabilities in
the media is probably

00:21:55.485 --> 00:21:57.360
just because it hasn't
been around that long.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.940
And the more you
see, the more you'll

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.760
notice that it needs to
be there and that it has

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.822
an important place, you know?

00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:06.671
SPEAKER 2: For sure.

00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:08.920
And again, like in the music
industry just in general,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.917
again, you don't really
see that as much.

00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:13.750
How do you see that
changing for the better?

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.350
And how can your
audience, people

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.308
who have been touched by
your music, how can we

00:22:17.308 --> 00:22:18.767
actually maybe--

00:22:18.767 --> 00:22:20.100
GAELYNN LEA: Contribute to that?

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.516
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, contribute
and take a different approach.

00:22:22.516 --> 00:22:24.630
GAELYNN LEA: Well, I
think one of the things

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.480
is I've heard the
misconception that there aren't

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.390
as many artists out
there with disabilities,

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.020
but I would argue that a lot
of people with disabilities

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.550
haven't had a lot of
opportunity to grow their skill.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.330
I started at open mics
like 10 years ago.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.440
I didn't just like walk out
and try the Tiny Desk and win.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.680
You know what I mean?

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.720
I'd been playing a lot.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.850
And I was lucky to have
supportive people that

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:52.350
helped me.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.267
But if the venue that the open
mic is that is inaccessible,

00:22:56.267 --> 00:22:57.600
how are they going to get there?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.559
And how will they learn their
craft to really pursue it?

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:03.850
or even just learning an
instrument in the first place,

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.080
if you're a music
teacher, be creative.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.984
That teacher that I
had in fifth grade

00:23:08.984 --> 00:23:10.650
could have easily
looked at me and said,

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.240
you should just do choir.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.950
I mean, really, she
could have said that.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.450
And it might not have
even seemed that weird.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.720
And I'm so grateful
that she didn't do that.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.180
But a lot of teachers
have more power

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.960
than they realize at helping
shape the future of the arts.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.790
And so that's cool that
she was willing to do that.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.940
And then the other thing
I would just say is like,

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.280
if you're planning events
of any kind, make sure

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.540
accessibility is not just like
a thing you think about and say,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.760
oh, darn, this one won't
be accessible, but really

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.934
be creative and try to make
sure you can, indeed, make it

00:23:42.934 --> 00:23:44.100
something people can get to.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.130
And if you don't know the
answer to how to do that,

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.540
talk to people
with disabilities.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.110
Because I'd be happy to share,
and a lot of people would.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.615
Because they want to
be included, you know?

00:23:54.615 --> 00:23:57.390
And we're not going to say,
well, the only way I'll go

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.760
is if this building builds
an elevator, not necessarily.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.990
There are other solutions
besides just saying

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.470
we don't have $100,000 to that.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:07.850
I guess I won't go.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.820
And moving events to better
venues is a part of that,

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.109
to be honest, in my opinion.

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:15.150
And that's not something
everybody wants to hear.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.720
But I think thinking
about where your venue is

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.930
is kind of an important part in
this whole sphere of the arts.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:23.930
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.160
So the venue, you
shared an example

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.040
of a venue, where they changed
venues and moved to a church.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.620
Have you had other experiences
where maybe that has also

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.501
occurred?

00:24:32.501 --> 00:24:33.000
Or is it--

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.470
GAELYNN LEA: So far
that's the only one,

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.511
but that's pretty recent.

00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:37.285
Because it kind
of dawned on me--

00:24:37.285 --> 00:24:39.660
I mean, I know that's silly,
but I hadn't thought of that

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.830
as an option.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.510
And I was racking my brain,
and I was like, well,

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.880
I cannot do a show where
someone in a wheelchair shows up

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.520
and they can't--
like, I can't do that.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.660
And so it just
kind of struck me.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.170
But I'm going to use
that as a suggestion.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.670
A lot more often
we have done things

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.730
where maybe the gig will be
on the main level instead

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.550
of the usual upstairs room.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.220
Or if the stage is
a billion feet tall,

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.770
sometimes I play in
front of a stage,

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.020
partly because it's not
really great for my wheelchair

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.940
to be lifted up, and partly
just so people think about it.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.030
Like, oh, she's
not on the stage.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.650
I wonder why.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.280
Oh, there's no ramp.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.344
You know and like point
that out in a subtle way.

00:25:19.344 --> 00:25:21.510
And I don't want to talk
about it while I'm playing,

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.440
but you know?

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.160
I think it's important
to just start

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.660
in a nice and respectful way--
because I don't think you get

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.380
anywhere by attacking people,
but in a way, just saying,

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.350
this is actually
an important issue.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:37.590
And we can be flexible to some
degree, but at some point,

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.211
things do have to
search changing.

00:25:39.211 --> 00:25:41.710
And that's just going to take
a little bit of growing pains,

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:42.850
I think, you know?

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.660
And that's OK.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.670
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.990
It's important.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:49.020
SPEAKER 2: For sure.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.030
And definitely I
would say at Google,

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.310
we really want to make sure
that space are accessible.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.010
It's definitely
an important piece

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.850
of what Google cares about.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.280
Diversity inclusion
is hugely important.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.150
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.580
SPEAKER 2: So that said, I
had another question for you

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.100
around just your
passion for music.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.850
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.308
SPEAKER 2: I think
I read someplace

00:26:06.308 --> 00:26:08.950
that at one point when
you were growing up,

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.010
you had an opportunity
to have surgery,

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.590
and you actually chose
violin over that.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:14.316
GAELYNN LEA: Mhm.

00:26:14.316 --> 00:26:15.630
SPEAKER 2: Can you expand a
little bit more about that?

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.122
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah, so
there's a surgery-- well,

00:26:17.122 --> 00:26:18.090
a bunch of surgeries.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.400
I would have had to
have four different ones

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.480
where they would have broken
the bones in my arms and legs

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.850
and put her right in there
and straightened them.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.850
And you have to do one
at a time so that's

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.530
four different operations.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:35.100
And I just am grateful that
my parents let me decide.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.560
And you know, a lot of people
had those surgeries when

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.839
they're very young, so
it's not like that's bad.

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:41.380
It's just that my
parents said, well,

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.480
we'll just let her choose.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.522
So as I got older, I
kept thinking about it.

00:26:45.522 --> 00:26:47.730
And the option was on the
table, and I knew about it.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.010
But then when I
started playing violin,

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.340
one of the potential
problems with that surgery

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.760
is that you can damage
the nerves in your hands.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.040
Because straightening
your arm that much

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.900
is very stressful on the nerves.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.140
And I just didn't want
to not be able to play.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.060
And there was no way I
know, and so I decided

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.500
not to have the surgery.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.970
I mean, also what
10-year-old wants

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.790
to have massive amounts of
surgery if they don't have to?

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:16.050
But that was, truly,
the deciding factor

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.750
was I just didn't want to not
be able to, because I really

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.080
enjoyed music.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.600
And that's maybe
the biggest message

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.650
is disability
isn't actually bad.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.410
To me, I had a really
awesome childhood.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.432
I had a lot of cool
experiences, and I had

00:27:31.432 --> 00:27:32.640
good friends and good family.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.550
And wheelchairs I could tell
were getting better and better.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.490
And the world was
getting more accessible.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.130
And I didn't feel this
need to be completed

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.300
by being able to walk.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.490
I didn't feel like that
was necessary to be happy.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.550
And ultimately, music was
necessary to be happy.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.250
And so when I do
a lot of speeches,

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:54.720
I'll talk about disability
pride and the problem

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.310
isn't the disability itself.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.560
It's society's inaccessibility.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.560
And when you reframe it that
way, it takes away the pity,

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.600
and it also puts
responsibility on society

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.620
to make sure that they're doing
a good job of being accessible.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.650
Because I have an
awesome life, and I

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.110
wouldn't be who I am without
my disability, for sure.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.680
And so I don't regret
it or dislike it or wish

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.919
I was some other way, you know?

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:19.918
SPEAKER 2: That's great.

00:28:19.918 --> 00:28:21.489
Yeah.

00:28:21.489 --> 00:28:23.280
And how do you see that
maybe changing just

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.340
in general in spaces,
even beyond music,

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.090
say how society can
do a better job?

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.920
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah, I mean, there
is a lot of work being done.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.240
And I think we're getting
there, slowly but surely.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.810
If you picture where we
were 110 years ago, I mean,

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.840
people with disabilities lived
in like back rooms of houses

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.830
and never went out.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.200
And it's so much
different than that,

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.740
but it's because of
a ton of activism.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.640
The Disability Rights Movement,
the ADA, all these things

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.580
didn't just happen.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.820
They were huge
amounts of work that

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.857
went into demanding
that that change.

00:28:59.857 --> 00:29:01.440
And there's still a
lot of work to do.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.148
The fact that we're
talking about cutting

00:29:03.148 --> 00:29:05.320
health care, Medicaid.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.472
I mean, people will die and
end up in nursing homes,

00:29:08.472 --> 00:29:09.680
and that's a really big deal.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.209
But obviously people
are fighting that.

00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:13.500
So there's a lot of work to do.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.490
But I've seen progress.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.300
I mean, any new building in
America has to be accessible.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.830
And I think that's really cool.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.740
I think we need to work better
with small businesses that

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.120
are older to get them up-to-date
and not see it as like a,

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.640
this doesn't have to happen
because I'm an old building.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.230
You know what I mean?

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.340
Work on that.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.900
And then work on job inclusion.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.651
It's much harder to get a
job if you have a disability.

00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:39.150
One of the reasons
I'm self-employed

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.540
is it was easier than
trying to convince people

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.950
that I could be hireable.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.260
And I have a college
degree, you know?

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.560
But it was difficult. So there's
a lot of work to be done,

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.880
but there's progress for sure.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.850
I mean, I just know
that kids now--

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.550
I've met older people
with disabilities who say,

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:02.190
I wish that I was able to have
pride in my disability the way

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.510
the younger kids are.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:08.400
I think the reason it is, is
because the culture is shifting

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.590
towards more
acceptance of yourself

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:14.670
and of your body and
pride in who you are.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.480
And that is a real thing,
I think, that's happening.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.850
And I can only speak for
myself, but there is progress.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.130
But definitely there's
still work to do.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.519
And just reaching out and
asking what the work is,

00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:27.685
is a really good first step.

00:30:27.685 --> 00:30:28.840
SPEAKER 2: So that's
a good first step.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.590
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.370
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.870
Having toured internationally,
have you seen any differences

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.864
in how other cultures--
or at least in Europe--

00:30:34.864 --> 00:30:37.280
might approach people with
disabilities compare to the US?

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:37.950
GAELYNN LEA: You
know, I thought it

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.320
was going to be more
different than it was.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.260
They don't have
legislation like the ADA

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.420
in a lot of other countries.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.880
But like Prague,
especially, which

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.710
was weird because
it's super old,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.870
it was surprisingly
OK where we were.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.350
I'm sure there are
parts that aren't.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:57.900
But like I could have probably
brought my electric chair.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.310
I didn't bring it,
because I had no idea.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.650
And then certain parts of like
London was pretty accessible.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.680
Amsterdam wasn't as
accessible as I expected.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.200
But, I mean, it was comparable.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.176
New York City is terrible,
so it depends on what you--

00:31:12.176 --> 00:31:13.050
you know what I mean?

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.780
Every city has got
its own threshold.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.810
And there's activists
in all those cities

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.545
trying to make it better.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:21.420
SPEAKER 2: It's good.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:21.720
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.950
SPEAKER 2: It's good.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.491
Well, we have about
five more minutes

00:31:24.491 --> 00:31:26.990
before we open up it up to
Q&amp;A. So for any Googlers

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.000
in the audience, be thinking
about any of your questions.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.560
So I'd love to hear
a little bit more

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.801
maybe about I guess your album
and your recent EP that you--

00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:36.550
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.500
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.090
GAELYNN LEA: Well,
my first album

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.450
came out in November
of 2015, and I really

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.460
wasn't planning on putting
any singing on it at all.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.500
It was going to be
traditional fiddle tunes

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.820
and some standards played
with a looping pedal.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.414
And they're really rearranged.

00:31:52.414 --> 00:31:53.830
Like you'll recognize
the melodies

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.820
if you like fiddle music,
but they're not always played

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.730
in the regular order.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:01.000
And the rhythms are different,
and the textures are different.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.880
But then I did end up
including one original song

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.080
in a traditional
song that I sing on.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.700
And then after I
won the Tiny Desk,

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.710
people started
asking me where they

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.080
could buy the song that won.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.720
And the answer was nowhere,
so I had to record it.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.700
So I recorded that on an EP
with a guitarist friend--

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.340
not Alan Sparhawk,
but a guy named

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.280
Al Church from Minneapolis.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.950
And he is awesome, and
it was very, very fun.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.010
It was a fun project.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:34.010
And now I'm working on my
third full length album.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.110
I did a Christmas album
too in November with Al,

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.420
and it was really
fun, Al Church.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.700
And then we're
doing a full length,

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.270
but this one, not every song
I've written can be looped.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:49.470
And so this one is going to
be more of a full band sound

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.850
because not every
song is loopable

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.650
and just because it's fun.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.352
There's a really good drummer
named Marty [? Dosh. ?] And Al

00:32:56.352 --> 00:32:58.560
Church is on there and a
guy named Dave [? Mailing ?]

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.290
and Andrew Forman and Alan
Sparhawk's going to join me

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.620
for a couple of songs too, so
I'm super excited about that

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.160
album.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.610
And that should be out.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.750
I'm releasing a couple
of tracks in November.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.931
And then there's a full
length hopefully out in April.

00:33:13.931 --> 00:33:15.180
And there's a GoFundMe for it.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.160
So I'm like in the
middle of that right now.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.804
We just recorded four of them.

00:33:18.804 --> 00:33:19.470
SPEAKER 2: Great

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.860
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.980
And four of the songs.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.085
It's super fun.

00:33:22.085 --> 00:33:24.314
I don't know, recording
was scary at first.

00:33:24.314 --> 00:33:25.980
And it still does
kind of intimidate me,

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.400
but when you're with
really creative people,

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.300
it's just more of like this
glorious creation process.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.610
So it's been really fun.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.360
SPEAKER 2: Gotcha.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.030
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.696
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:33:36.696 --> 00:33:39.260
So other marathon
sessions in the studio

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.940
going, toying around with
reverb settings and delays

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.510
and all that?

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.260
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.790
We had a full weekend.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.920
This was our first time
we got to get together.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.060
And there was two full
days, and then a half day.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.422
And man, it's hard work.

00:33:52.422 --> 00:33:53.130
It's fun, though.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.970
I mean, we laughed a lot.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.400
We eat a lot of tacos.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.505
That's our main--

00:33:57.505 --> 00:33:57.870
SPEAKER 2: Tacos are good.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:58.080
GAELYNN LEA: --sustenance.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.040
Yes.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.120
So, it was very fun.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:00.650
Yeah.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:01.400
SPEAKER 2: Gotcha.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.944
And here in Chicago, you
actually just came back

00:34:03.944 --> 00:34:05.610
from a recording
session, is that right?

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:09.210
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah I recorded
a cover of a Pigface song,

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.500
of course, right?

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.370
So--

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.090
SPEAKER 2: As you do in Chicago.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.949
GAELYNN LEA: As you
do in Chicago, yes.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:14.639
No, it was fun.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.620
I played at their
25th anniversary show,

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.960
and I did a cover
of "Point Blank,"

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.080
and we just recorded that.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.389
And that's going to be fun too.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:24.000
It's been great getting
to know Martin and then

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.340
his extended Pigface family.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.590
A lot of them were at my show.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.590
I had a show last night,
and a lot of them came.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.320
So it was really, really fun.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:31.949
Yeah.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:33.040
SPEAKER 2: Martin's
a friend of Google.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.130
GAELYNN LEA: Yes.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.710
SPEAKER 2: And he's had a
Google Talk here as well,

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.543
which is going to be
up on our channel soon.

00:34:36.543 --> 00:34:37.350
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.159
SPEAKER 2: Also I
guess it's worth

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.949
noting that we have some of
your CDs for sale in the back,

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.520
so for Googlers in the audience,
be sure to check that out.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.460
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.489
SPEAKER 2: Well,
it's very exciting.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:47.155
At this point, I think
we can open it up

00:34:47.155 --> 00:34:51.030
for Q&amp;A if anyone is interested
in asking Gaelynn questions.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.280
There's a mic up at the front.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.610
So we'll give you a
second to come on up.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.360
GAELYNN LEA: Cool.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:55.859
Thanks.

00:34:59.009 --> 00:34:59.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.050
It's really great
to hear you speak.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:04.200
I actually discovered you
from the Austin 100 for South

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.860
by Southwest.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.120
That was actually where--

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.360
I'd heard about Tiny Desk but
didn't actually hear your music

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.350
until the Austin 100.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:12.340
When it came on, it was like,
I need to hear more of this.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:12.600
GAELYNN LEA: Cool!

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.200
AUDIENCE: So it's
wonderful to get

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.382
to hear you speak in person.

00:35:14.382 --> 00:35:16.090
I was curious, as you
were talking about,

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.510
you've done I think
over 150 performances,

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.790
if there's any particular
performance that stands out

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.340
from the past year that
might be your favorite

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.420
and why that might be.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.575
And then is there
any venues or places

00:35:26.575 --> 00:35:28.950
that are on your bucket list
that you really, really want

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:29.930
to play?

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.550
GAELYNN LEA: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.530
In terms of favorite
shows, that Pigface 25 show

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.890
was pretty amazing.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.520
It was at the House of
Blues, and it was just

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.930
like such a great vibe.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.410
And then Paul and I, I
mean, the Europe trip

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.690
was pretty spectacular too.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.790
My favorite, maybe, was
this show in Belfast--

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.870
no, Kilkenny in Ireland.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.350
And I do a song that's a
sing along with the audience.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.849
And I like ended the song,
and they didn't stop singing.

00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:03.390
And so then I was
like, OK, so then I

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.570
like sang with them for awhile.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:05.945
And then I tried
to end it again,

00:36:05.945 --> 00:36:07.440
and they still
didn't stop singing.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.361
So Alan had to end the
song, because I was

00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:10.610
like, I don't know what to do.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.360
And how long will they go?

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.100
I have no idea.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.350
And that was pretty memorable.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.640
And just like, I don't know,
every show is pretty special.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.600
It's like they're all
different, but they really

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.240
do-- like I've played
at some schools.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.350
There's a school for
kids with disabilities.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.140
And they also brought
in a Catholic school

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.100
at the same time, so I
played for two schools.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.970
And they were just so pumped.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.479
They did the sing along
with me, and they like--

00:36:35.479 --> 00:36:36.020
I don't know.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.660
It was just such a happy vibe.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.310
I don't know.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.380
There's a lot of good
shows, but those are some

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.580
of the ones that stand out.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.100
And then bucket list venues--

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:44.930
I don't even know.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.820
I mean, I don't know.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.220
Last night at Reggies
was such a great vibe.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.020
I don't know.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.070
Any room where the energy
in the room is positive,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.740
and the people are engaged
and like, I don't know,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.690
it can be any size room.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.872
I don't really have a
venue in mind, I guess.

00:37:04.872 --> 00:37:06.330
It'd be fun to play
more festivals.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.663
Those are really cool, and I
haven't done a ton of that.

00:37:08.663 --> 00:37:11.410
South By was one of my
first solo festivals,

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:12.850
so that was kind of cool.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.065
Yeah.

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.190
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.250
GAELYNN LEA: Thanks.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.000
SPEAKER 2: Thanks.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.740
Anyone else?

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.150
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.400
I'm so inspired by
your positive outlook

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.622
on life and your attitude.

00:37:22.622 --> 00:37:24.580
And I was just wondering
if there anything else

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.567
you attribute that to.

00:37:25.567 --> 00:37:27.400
I mean, it might just
come naturally to you,

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.983
but if there was
anything in your life

00:37:28.983 --> 00:37:31.090
aside from society kind
of being more appreciative

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.339
and understanding of people
with disabilities and kind

00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:34.960
of where you draw
that energy from.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.910
GAELYNN LEA: Cool, thanks.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.910
Well, I mean I can't say that
it's not partly inherent.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.150
I'm sure that it is.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.160
And my parents are really
good at drawing out

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.110
like the positives.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.580
And so I got that.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:54.990
But then I also read a lot
of things about spirituality.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.280
You know, Christianity
and Buddhism

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.340
have both been really
influential to me

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.314
and just the idea of extending
grace to other people

00:38:04.314 --> 00:38:05.230
is an important thing.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.230
I mean, I am
definitely not perfect.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.010
I can give you about
a billion examples

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.420
of times I've been a jerk.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.700
But I'm just
saying, in general I

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.650
strive to be understanding and
compassionate and like loving.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.920
And I think that's because I
do think life is this really

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.590
cool opportunity to grow.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.930
And I don't know.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:30.070
Like, that really motivates
me to try better and just do

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.440
better and not
necessarily mastering

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.190
skills, even, so much as
being a better person that's

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.940
more loving.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.880
And I think we can all
improve on that, obviously.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.820
And so it's like a quest
that will never end.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.320
So yeah.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:42.790
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:43.540
Thank you so much.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.010
GAELYNN LEA: Thanks.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:45.694
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:45.694 --> 00:38:46.360
GAELYNN LEA: Hi.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
to Google and sharing with us

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.460
your music, your life.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.980
I was wondering if you
can share a bit with us

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.590
the type of curriculum
that you have followed when

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.650
you started to play the violin.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.430
For example, you hold the
violin in an untraditional way.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:07.750
Was the studies that you had
to do, had to be adapted?

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.310
How did it work?

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.900
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.080
Luckily I was sort of oblivious
of all that at the beginning.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.300
But you know, I play regular
violin music, or I did it.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.760
But some things
had to be adapted.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.710
Luckily my teachers
both at the beginning

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.820
had some understanding
of the cello.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.410
So many of the techniques I
use are a little more related

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.110
to the cello.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.340
I shift around the
fingerboard more

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.970
because I can't use my pinky.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.640
And so I have to move more.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.730
And my bow, I hold it
like a bass player.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:44.380
And so probably my bow technique
is definitely not the same

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.640
as violinists'.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.070
But I did the regular
curriculum in terms

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.190
of like I played the same
music that my orchestra played

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.850
and the same parts and just
kind of adapted them as we went.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.395
I was very blessed to have
teachers that were like--

00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.020
I mean, they would
be up front with me.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.280
They're like, I've
never done this before.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.200
Let's see how it goes.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.170
And we would adapt
as we needed to.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.130
And that worked out OK.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.670
So when I taught--

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.534
because I taught
for three years--

00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:13.450
I didn't teach people
how to play up and down.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.200
I taught them how to
play the regular way.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.760
So I looked up like pictures.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.050
And I'd be like,
hold it like this.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.014
But it works, if
you can communicate.

00:40:22.014 --> 00:40:22.930
It's a back and forth.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.630
And so I kind of experienced
the same thing in reverse

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.820
when I taught other people.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.660
You just kind of have to
figure it out in the moment,

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.227
and luckily I had people
willing to do that with me.

00:40:34.227 --> 00:40:35.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you for sharing.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.972
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah, thanks.

00:40:36.972 --> 00:40:39.430
SPEAKER 2: All right, so we'll
go to the Dory really quick.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:40.925
We have one write in question--

00:40:40.925 --> 00:40:41.800
GAELYNN LEA: Oh yeah.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.810
SPEAKER 2: --which I
think I find interesting.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.460
What are the
difficulties of working

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.334
with your spouse on the road?

00:40:47.334 --> 00:40:49.000
GAELYNN LEA: Assuming
it's a difficulty.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.850
It's a blessing
and a difficulty,

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.190
but mostly it's a blessing.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.310
We've gotten to see so
many cool things together.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.580
And I can be like, remember
that thing that happened?

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.840
And he actually knows
what I'm talking about.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.310
I can't picture
touring without him.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.230
I think that would
be super hard.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.670
However, the
difficulties lies in

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.950
like shows are stressful
for us in different ways.

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:19.840
I might be really
nervous before a show

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.110
and be like a little snappier
or tense or like a little more

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.640
stressed out,
depending on the day

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.762
if we didn't get enough
sleep or whatever.

00:41:26.762 --> 00:41:28.720
And he's more like-- he's
the merch guy, right?

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.550
And so he has to talk to
like a million people right

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.540
after this show.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.350
So we joke sometimes that like
it's like he has a show too.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.580
It's just not the same.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.950
So sometimes those
things collide.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.770
And then I'm not
the timeliest person

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.360
on the planet of the Earth.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.726
And so he's way more
on time than me.

00:41:45.726 --> 00:41:47.350
So he'll be like, we
should be leaving.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.504
We should have
left, like let's go.

00:41:49.504 --> 00:41:50.170
And that's good.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:54.344
I mean, ut actually probably
keeps me more on time.

00:41:54.344 --> 00:41:55.510
But yeah, you run into that.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.843
And then we're basically
living in hotel rooms together,

00:41:57.843 --> 00:41:59.860
so you don't have a lot
of space to yourself.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.010
But I don't think that's
a super big problem.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.711
We've gotten used to that.

00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:04.210
Yeah.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.290
I mean I realized there was one
night where I went away with

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:11.980
a friend, and it was the
first 24-hour period--

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.190
not even-- I mean I'm
talking like four-hour period

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:17.770
that we hadn't been
together since October.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:18.730
And this was in May.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:22.210
And I was like, oh my gosh, we
have been gathering nonstop.

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.820
So even though we can
like bicker or whatever,

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.990
we never hold on to it.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:29.380
And it's been fun to see
that you can actually

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.830
adapt to living like
extremely close quarters

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.280
with another person.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.530
So that's cool, actually.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.540
I mean, we might joke
about it sometimes,

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.410
but overall it's
been really fun.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.020
So yeah.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.020
SPEAKER 2: That's great.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.400
GAELYNN LEA: But yeah,
you are connected.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.950
I mean, this is his business
as much as it is mine now.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.810
Like, he quit his job.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.380
And that's kind of a big deal.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.060
So like we are both
invested in it,

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.440
and that is probably helpful
to keep it like a team effort.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.964
Because it really is at this
point, totally a team effort.

00:42:58.964 --> 00:42:59.630
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.480
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.080
SPEAKER 2: That's amazing.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.080
GAELYNN LEA: Cool, yeah.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:02.890
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:03.645
SPEAKER 2: Life on the road.

00:43:03.645 --> 00:43:04.420
GAELYNN LEA: I know.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:04.892
I know.

00:43:04.892 --> 00:43:06.040
I never would have thought.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:06.850
Oh, a couple more questions.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.020
SPEAKER 2: Maybe a
few more questions?

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:08.990
GAELYNN LEA: One more question?

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.700
SPEAKER 2: Great.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.056
AUDIENCE: Hi, one more question.

00:43:11.056 --> 00:43:12.430
As you were
speaking, how did you

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.967
find accessibility to be
for this office at Google?

00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:16.800
GAELYNN LEA: I thought
it was awesome, yeah.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.310
You guys are good.

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.110
I think it's really neat when--

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.090
I mean, yeah, when the
new spaces come out,

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:25.150
it's like everything gets
more accessible, not less.

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:26.410
So that's pretty cool.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.454
Yeah, I've noticed
positive stuff here.

00:43:28.454 --> 00:43:29.370
SPEAKER 2: Good stuff.

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:29.750
GAELYNN LEA: Good job.

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:30.160
SPEAKER 2: Yep.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.160
GAELYNN LEA: You
even had a ramp.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.010
That's kind of awesome.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:32.800
SPEAKER 2: Indeed.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.020
GAELYNN LEA: Good job.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.640
SPEAKER 2: We'll let our
head of facilities know.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.070
GAELYNN LEA: That would
have if you hadn't, I

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:37.240
suppose-- talking
about it, and then

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.980
been like, like when
you had to lift me up.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.188
But you didn't, so thank you.

00:43:40.188 --> 00:43:41.290
Yeah.

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:42.820
SPEAKER 2: All right, well,
thank you so much, Gaelynn.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.300
It's been fantastic
having you here.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:44.770
GAELYNN LEA: Thank you.

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:45.920
SPEAKER 2: We're
going to transition.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.295
And I'm going to get off the
stage so we can hear Gaelynn

00:43:48.295 --> 00:43:49.342
perform a few more songs.

00:43:49.342 --> 00:43:50.800
We do have a few
more minutes left,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.630
so if you have time
for maybe two more?

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.080
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:53.510
SPEAKER 2: Great.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.890
GAELYNN LEA: Yeah.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:54.556
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:43:54.556 --> 00:43:57.790
And so a couple things, just
be aware of Gaelynn's website,

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.070
which is violinscratches.com.

Google Play Store, had

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:07.080
to give a plug for Google Play.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080
GAELYNN LEA: Good point.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.100
SPEAKER 2: Thanks again.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.870

turn down the reverb?

Thanks, Paul.

Sweet.
