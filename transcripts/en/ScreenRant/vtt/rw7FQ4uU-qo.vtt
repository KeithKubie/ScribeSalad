00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.450
A great twist ending, big reveal or hidden
meaning can make a movie even more fun to

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.000
watch and rewatch, but sometimes, it's the
fans who end up crafting a theory that makes

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.220
the original film seem even more brilliant
than it could on its own. Not every fan theory

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.410
is as inspired or clever as the best of them,
but every so often, they make watching a classic

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:29.939
movie twice as much fun - and can even make
the original writers look bad. Here are Screen

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.880
Rant's 10 Movie Theories That Completely Change
Popular Films.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.290
The Lord of the Rings (New Line Cinema)&nbsp;

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.690
From the moment the giant eagles arrived to
fly Frodo and Sam out of Mordor, fans and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
critics all asked the same question: Why didn't
Gandalf the Grey just get the eagles to fly

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.899
the ring into Mordor and destroy it the moment
he found it?

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.969
One fan theory claims that was Gandalf's plan
the entire time. But with Sauron's spies lurking

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.070
everywhere, he couldn't share the plan until
the Fellowship was in the clear, on the other

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.010
side of the mountains where The evil wizard
Saruman couldn't stop them, or send word ahead

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.820
to Mordor. But when Gandalf ended up falling
into the depths of Moria, he'd forgotten about

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.260
it completely when he returned as Gandalf
the White. Apparently, his last words to the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.680
Fellowship tried to clue them in: "Fly, you
fools!"

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.049
The Nightmare Before Christmas (Buena Vista
Pictures)&nbsp;

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.580
Tim Burton's stop motion musical was a surprise
hit, making Jack Skellington, his ghost dog

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.049
Zero and the vampires, skeletons, and zombie
residents of Halloweentown a kids' classic.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.170
But fans started getting suspicious when years
later, Burton released The Corpse Bride, the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.869
story of a tall, thin man named Victor who
took a trip to the Land of the Dead, a colourful

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.570
world of skeletons and zombies, reuniting
with his skeletal dog, Scraps. And when Frankenweenie

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.560
starred a young boy - also named Victor - bringing
his dog Sparky back from the dead, one theory

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.450
emerged: Burton was telling the story of one
man, and his dog, but in reverse order. The

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.409
theory isn't perfect, but as explanations
of the similarities go, it's hard to beat.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.240
Mad Max Fury Road (Warner Bros.)&nbsp;

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.130
When the mantle of Mad Max was handed to a
new actor for Fury Road, it was clear fans

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.950
would need to use their imagination. Officially,
the character was still Max, in a universe

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.250
where age doesn't really matter. But as soon
as the movie released, die hard fans saw a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.239
secret story underneath the surface. The grunts
and wild side of Max could be a result of

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.390
years spent in the wasteland, but one theory
claims Tom Hardy wasn't playing Max Rockatansky

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.120
at all, but the young "Feral Kid" from Mad
Max 2: The Road Warrior, all grown up. Narrating

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.830
Fury Road just like he did the Road Warrior,
the kid grew up to idolize Max, keeping his

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.180
music box as a gift and dressing like his
former hero. Only when he truly became a hero

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.260
did he take up his idol's name for himself:
"Max...my name is Max." True or not, it's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.650
worth another viewing to see for yourself.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.940
James Bond (MGM/Columbia Pictures)&nbsp;

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.860
The multiple actors who've played 007 make
it hard to see the film series as one long

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.450
story. But one creative theory solves the
problem: what if James Bond is only a codename,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.200
reserved for the agents claiming the 007 title?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:01.390
It would explain why James regularly uses
his real name despite being a secret agent,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.680
and would help MI-6's top agent gain legendary
status around the world. When one gets too

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.450
old or is captured, a younger agent takes
his place as Bond. If it sounds good to you,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.870
fans can also look at Michael Bay's The Rock
as something of a sequel to Diamonds Are Forever,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.390
with Sean Connery playing a British spy who
spent three decades in prison, since according

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.819
to America and England...he never existed...

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.159
Drag Me To Hell (Universal Pictures)&nbsp;

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.879
Sam Raimi's grotesque horror story of a young
woman cursed by an elderly Witch fits right

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.450
in with the director's Evil Dead roots, but
what if the movie isn't supernatural at all?

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.379
If you pay attention to the character's childhood
obesity, and the struggle to leave her addict

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.430
mother and her Southern accent behind, the
movie makes way more sense as a woman with

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.069
an eating disorder slowly driving herself
insane - according to one theory. Notice how

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.530
the vomiting Witch always shows up in the
kitchen, or tries to shove things down the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.970
main character's throat?

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.769
Or how a piece of cake comes to life to keep
her from eating?

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.959
Eventually her illusions drive her past the
brink, and she commits suicide by jumping

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.290
in front of a train, convincing herself it's
the work of a curse, not the side effects

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.720
of starving herself beyond reason. Darkâ€¦

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.540
Harry Potter (Warner Bros.)&nbsp;

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.430
The story of the greatest boy wizard began
under a staircase in the home of the Dursleys,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.340
the worst adoptive parents you could ever
hope for. But why were Harry Potter's aunt

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.650
and uncle so cruel, and why would his mother
have left her son with such awful people?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.060
One answer can be found when fans remember
the effect of a single Horcrux in the Deathly

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.130
Hallows. The piece of Voldemort's soul contained
in a cursed locket fed on those around it,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.380
darkening their spirits until even the trio
of best friends were paranoid and filled with

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.750
hate and jealousy. If Dumbledore was actually
right when he called Harry a kind of Horcrux,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.889
it explains why his aunt and uncle might have
been a loving family when Harry arrived - before

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.280
years of sharing their home with a piece of
Voldemort made them the cruel monsters audiences

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.979
saw.

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:53.979
The Pixar Theory (Disney/Pixar)&nbsp;

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:54.979
Everyone knows all about Pixar's love of tiny
connections and Easter eggs all hinting that

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:55.979
the characters exist in the very same universe.
But a larger theory asks one big question:

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.970
what if every Pixar film is telling one massive
story, but it's just told out of order?

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.220
It's clear that the company BnL visible in
Pixar films is responsible for killing Earth

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.090
in Wall-E, but only after the age of The Incredibles'
superheroes ended, with their magic passed

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.870
on to intelligent animals, or cars. Some parts
of the theory are hard to believe, but the

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.639
best idea claims the stars of Monsters, Inc.
were using closets to travel back in time,

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.990
eventually leading Boo centuries back in time
trying to find her furry friend. That explains

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.990
why the Witch in Brave has carvings of Sully
and the modern day Pizza Planet truck.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.800
Star Wars (Lucasfilm/Disney)

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.800
There's nothing the Jedi love more than a
prophecy, and the Star Wars prequel trilogy

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.110
was based on probably the most important one
ever written:

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.970
"In the time of greatest despair
a child shall be born

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.090
who will destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force"

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.750
Officially, Anakin Skywalker was this Chosen
One, who tragically fell to the Dark Side

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.350
and took the Galaxy and Jedi Order with him
("you were the chosen one" line from Obi-wan

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.810
in Episode 3 before their end fight, and before
Obi finishes him off). But some fans point

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.530
out that Anakin wasn't born in a time of great
despair - his son Luke was. It was a twist

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.800
of fate that led Luke into becoming a Jedi,
and he ended up destroying the Sith by saving

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800
his father. The conclusion: the Jedi thought
Anakin was the Chosen One, and he cracked

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.389
under the pressure. But it was his son Luke
all along - who didn't just redeem his father,

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.300
but proved the prophecy true after all. If
you ask us, that's the best way of linking

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.030
the trilogies that George Lucas never even
thought of.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.030
Aladdin (Disney)&nbsp;

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.690
Older Disney fans may not remember that the
story of Aladdin begins with a quippy shopkeeper

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.300
in Agrabah looking to sell the audience on
a golden lamp. But when the stars get their

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.090
happy ending, the shopkeeper never returns.
Theories began to spread that the entire movie

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.800
was just made up to sell the lamp, since Robin
Williams voiced both the Genie and the energetic

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.500
peddler. Either that, or freeing Genie turned
him into a powerless human. Thankfully the

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.500
co-directors recently confirmed that the Aladdin
originally ended with the shopkeeper revealing

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.380
himself to be Genie, making the entire movie
a retelling of how he earned his freedom years,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.669
maybe even centuries before. Instead, Disney
kept things simple - and open to sequels.

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.759
The Thing (Universal Pictures)&nbsp;

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.039
Every horror movie can learn a lesson from
John Carpenter's antarctic horror story, where

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.759
an alien capable of mimicking humans starts
picking off a research team one by one. In

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:09.560
the end, only Kurt Russell's hero MacReady
and Keith David's Childs. The movie ends with

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.330
the men slowly freezing to death, wondering
if the other is the alien in disguise. But

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.590
one theory makes the ending a lot clearer.
When MacReady is introduced, he's losing a

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.160
game of chess against a computer, but he gets
the last laugh with a glass of Scotch (computer

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.190
fried clip). The same scene is repeated in
the real life game of chess at the end - only

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.770
it's not Scotch in the bottle. It's a Molotov
cocktail from earlier in the movie, and Childs

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.789
drinking straight gasoline reveals he's the
alien. MacReady laughs, since the script - and

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:41.270
the actor - confirm he's hiding a flamethrower
just outside of the frame.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.979
