00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
In today's video,

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.000
we're going to see what happens
if these water absorbing beads

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.200
get put into a deep fryer.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.560
[Music]

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.760
Guys, oil and water don't mix.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.720
You know that.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.620
But when you heat up the oil,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.200
you can actually get
a pretty explosive reaction

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.400
when you add water.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.620
Oil heats up to a temperature
far above that of water.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.020
Water will boil away,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.500
and oil at much
higher temperatures

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.400
will still be there frying
and bubbling and boiling.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.580
When you add water into it,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.740
the water will vaporize causing
to expand very very quickly.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.400
And if it's underneath
the oil at all,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.950
it can cause the oil
to get launched through the air

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.800
while still at
boiling hot temperatures,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.040
or even on fire.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.040
Well, Orbeez have a lot
of water in them.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.840
They absorb many times
their own weight in water,

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:50.300
and so we wanted to see

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.180
what happens if you put Orbeez
into boiling hot oil.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.000
To be safe,
we're going to start out

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.800
with just one or two
into the hot oil,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.800
see what happens,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.700
and as we scale it up,
we are going to be moving away.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.560
That's why we're
here at the Dome.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, we're going to take the
Orbeez, both of the tiny ones

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and the bigger ones,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.046
and we let them absorb
a whole lot of water,

00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:10.400
and once they're expanded,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.200
we're going to try putting them
into some hot fry oil.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.880
We can try frying some
that haven't absorbed water too.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.046
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:19.700
We are going
to take some Orbeez,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.500
and drop them into a deep fryer
just to see what happens.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.820
After that, we're going
to overheat that oil,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.020
drop them in again, and see
if there's anything different.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.520
For our first test,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.640
we are going to take some
of our non expanded Orbeez,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.400
we're going to put them
into a metal cup,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.700
put them into the oil,
see what happens.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.600
I doubt it's going
to be very exciting,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.420
but I'm curious.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.600
[Music]

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.620
Not a whole lot as Orbeez go.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.300
We're just going
to see what happens.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.980
This is very hot oil.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.940
You think they're going
to pop like popcorn?

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.820
Sounds like popcorn.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.300
Oh, that's so cool.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.740
Wait!

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.320
Wait!

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.000
No way.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.240
That one actually
like popped like popcorn.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.840
One single Orbee.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.540
[Music]

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.940
Okay, not that bad.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.500
Initially, it hissed a bit,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.220
but didn't do
too much else.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.820
Yeah.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.400
I'm wondering as
it's starts to--

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.345
But now yeah...

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.154
There you go.

00:02:29.154 --> 00:02:31.984
Yeah, Orbee itself is
starting to heat up now.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:32.600
Yeah.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.600
Oh, there you go.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.776
I think our orbee ruptured.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.600
Yeah.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.120
Still a lot of boiling
and bubbling going on.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.400
Okay, I'm not going
to get too close,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.487
but I want to see...

00:02:43.487 --> 00:02:44.287
It moved.

00:02:44.287 --> 00:02:47.220
Okay, so the whole things
rolled over to the side.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.976
Oh, now we see oil
starting to spread out.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.220
There we go.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.900
That's just one.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.300
So the last one did rupture,
but it was a lot tinier.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.600
So what's this one gonna do?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.240
That's a lot more water.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
Okay.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.000
It's gonna take
a little bit longer,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.600
but we still don't want
to be close to that.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.862
Because if it does
happen to explode,

00:03:13.862 --> 00:03:16.000
and you know,
oil flies everywhere,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.540
that's gonna hurt.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.580
&gt;&gt; There we go.
&gt;&gt; I think it split.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.460
There we go.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.400
That, that is cool.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.000
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.880
Bubble, bubble,
toil and trouble.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.000
There's still some of it left.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.850
Oh no.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.600
A lot of it left, in fact.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.310
Well, one little orbee
was pretty fun,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.100
and one big orbee
was pretty fun.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.520
I think it's time to upgrade
to a fry basket full of Orbeez.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.300
We've got a lot
of little ones,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.800
and a few of the big ones.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.580
I'm excited.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.640
This is gonna make a mess.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.600
I think it will.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.060
Ready?

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.100
Careful.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:09.720
[Music]

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.700
Oh my gosh.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.420
[Music]

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.100
It is really mad about that.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.300
[Music]

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.000
So it was initially mad,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.700
because when we
lowered it in,

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.880
the Orbeez themselves had
water on the outside.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.740
Now, the oil itself is
kind of cooled down,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.420
so they've calmed down,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.100
but as the oil heats back up,
I think we're going to get that.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.800
Some new explosions.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.840
[Music]

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.480
Nice.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.120
You can kind of see

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.277
that big pink one
in the middle hasn't gone yet.

00:04:48.277 --> 00:04:50.300
I want to know
what happens when it does.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.680
[Music]

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.640
Yes.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.380
That was about half a cup of oil
that just left the machine.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.080
I fear for our camera.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.400
I fear for our cameraman.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.300
He is getting very brave.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.900
Here's, here's the first
big Orbeez that we fried.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.160
Oh that feels so weird.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.700
It's like breaks apart
very very easily.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.300
Deep-fried non expanded Orbeez.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.320
[Music]

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.400
It's just...

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.450
It's like plastic.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.700
Well, a form
of plastic, sort of.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.060
When we just did one,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.300
it fell apart so much
that it wasn't even

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.300
in the basket anymore.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.900
But it looks

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.800
like we still have
some results this time.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.300
At least a larger ones.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.150
The smaller one's
maybe at the bottom.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.630
It's true.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.400
Let's find out.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.400
And also, still orbeez,
still full of water, still oil.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.780
[Music]

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.300
I don't think the big ones
have even popped yet.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.878
They have--

00:05:58.878 --> 00:06:00.300
Okay, putting them back in.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.500
I want to see that.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.400
It might take
some more time, but...

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.280
Well, we put a lot in there.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.300
We cooled that oil

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.780
&gt;&gt; down significantly.
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.600
I think we fried
our Orbeez pretty good.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.300
I don't think they're going
to do anything else,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.000
so I think it's
time to scale it up.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.300
The fryer has a limit
to how hot it gets,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.300
and so to make sure we
really get enough heat,

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.100
we're going to take it up
to a different level.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.420
We're going to try it
on a propane stove.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.100
Hopefully, that gets hot enough.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.560
If not, we might
use the foundry.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.300
We've got a burner,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.980
this should get our oil
pretty nice and hot,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.800
and then we just got
these rocks here.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.800
Those are just stability
because this can by itself,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.350
I don't trust to
hold everything up,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.900
but the rocks are holding
it pretty nicely in place.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.660
We want that rip roarin' hot.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.600
Ah, hot oil.

00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:51.700
So this point,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.200
the oil in the pot is I believe
far higher temperature

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.900
than you would ever
fry any actual food.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.850
There's a lot of smoke
coming off of it,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.335
and it's a vegetable oil blend,

00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:04.300
which has a pretty
high smoke temperature.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.702
We're going to start
with one tiny orbee first,

00:07:06.702 --> 00:07:07.800
and see what happens.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.700
Not that one.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.500
[Music]

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.380
Yes.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.260
Oh.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.780
[Music]

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.517
Oh, for a second I
thought oil had splashed

00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:23.825
and is starting to catch...

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:27.980
[Music]

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.580
What is dripping?

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.900
&gt;&gt; Oh, whoa, what is happening?
&gt;&gt; I wonder if there's a hole in this bucket.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.340
We've realized that we have
a slight problem.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.350
There's actually a hole
in the bucket that we're using,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.700
and that's super dangerous
with our propane tank

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.900
directly underneath it.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.800
So we're going to switch
to our foundry regardless,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.120
little bit safer
in regards to explosions.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.500
So our oil is started
to light on fire,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.680
and it is gorgeous.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.840
Really dancing around a lot.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.740
Now, it doesn't have a lot
of oxygen in there,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.320
which it does still
need to burn properly.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.200
But you can see that
it's starting to pick up more.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.838
As fire comes up out,

00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:09.300
it draws more
oxygen down inside.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.300
Okay, that is well
and truly on fire now.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200
Okay. I'm going to try--

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.400
I'm going to try a handful.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.752
Do it.

00:08:14.752 --> 00:08:15.400
Ready?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.600
I think we both missed.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.540
Again.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.000
We have more Orbeez.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.640
More Orbeez.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.640
Oh, there we go.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.100
&gt;&gt; I missed again.
&gt;&gt; Farther. Farther.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.140
[Music]

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.360
That's amazing.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.720
[Music]

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.500
Big one?

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.900
Guys, just remember,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.400
we do have fire
extinguishers on hand.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.740
Lots of them,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.980
and this is
a very fireproof dome.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.420
Like it hasn't really
cause them to pop

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:52.492
like I thought.

00:08:52.492 --> 00:08:53.744
No, but they are--

00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:56.400
Okay, so when they
are hitting it,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.500
just at the very top,

00:08:57.515 --> 00:09:00.100
we are getting
these beautiful sparks.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.880
[Music]

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.740
Try one more.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.060
Come on.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.720
[Music]

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.860
Oh, well, okay.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.160
[Music]

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.700
&gt;&gt; That just splashed.
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:26.300
[Music]

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.820
Less of a splash.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.500
It's still splashed
some fire out.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.500
I'm just interested,

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.300
like it doesn't seem to be
like frying and popping them.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.600
[Music]

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.860
That shouldn't be so much fun.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.680
Oh, there you go.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.200
Whoo!

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.960
Yikes.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.000
I'm just gonna throw
the biggest handful

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.100
of tiny Orbeez.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.280
[Music]

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.300
Usually, you're supposed
to hit it.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.580
Guys, you know, we've always
got more for you to see.

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:03.204
That box of the will take you
to our last video.

00:10:03.204 --> 00:10:04.196
You should go check that out.

00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:05.372
The other boxes
going to show you

00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.100
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.266
This bomb in the middle
will subscribe to the channel.

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:11.680
Hit that, joining the club,
never miss out on a video.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.720
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.700
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.680
Talk to you soon.
