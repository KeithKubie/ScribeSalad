00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.340
Let's see if we
can give ourselves

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.760
an intuitive understanding
of the mean value theorem.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
And as we'll see, once you parse
some of the mathematical lingo

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.120
and notation, it's actually
a quite intuitive theorem.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.810
And so let's just think
about some function, f.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.910
So let's say I have
some function f.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.330
And we know a few things
about this function.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:39.100
We know that it is
continuous over the closed

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.520
interval between x equals
a and x is equal to b.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.280
And so when we put
these brackets here,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.704
that just means closed interval.

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:50.120
So when I put a
bracket here, that

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.840
means we're including
the point a.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.515
And if I put the bracket on
the right hand side instead

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:56.360
of a parentheses,
that means that we

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.570
are including the point b.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.986
And continuous
just means we don't

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:01.830
have any gaps or jumps in
the function over this closed

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.100
interval.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:12.210
Now, let's also assume that
it's differentiable over

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.810
the open interval
between a and b.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.720
So now we're saying,
well, it's OK

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.392
if it's not
differentiable right at a,

00:01:18.392 --> 00:01:20.100
or if it's not
differentiable right at b.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.730
And differentiable
just means that there's

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.550
a defined derivative,
that you can actually

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.810
take the derivative
at those points.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.294
So it's differentiable over the
open interval between a and b.

00:01:30.294 --> 00:01:31.710
So those are the
constraints we're

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.918
going to put on ourselves
for the mean value theorem.

00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:35.940
And so let's just try
to visualize this thing.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.750
So this is my function,
that's the y-axis.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.800
And then this right
over here is the x-axis.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.090
And I'm going to--
let's see, x-axis,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.040
and let me draw my interval.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.730
So that's a, and then
this is b right over here.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.790
And so let's say our function
looks something like this.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.100
Draw an arbitrary
function right over here,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.520
let's say my function
looks something like that.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.915
So at this point right over
here, the x value is a,

00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:15.230
and the y value is f(a).

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.280
At this point right
over here, the x value

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.650
is b, and the y value,
of course, is f(b).

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.390
So all the mean
value theorem tells

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.880
us is if we take the
average rate of change

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.600
over the interval,
that at some point

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.870
the instantaneous rate
of change, at least

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.140
at some point in
this open interval,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.920
the instantaneous
change is going

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.670
to be the same as
the average change.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.530
Now what does that
mean, visually?

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.720
So let's calculate
the average change.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.230
The average change between
point a and point b,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.780
well, that's going to be the
slope of the secant line.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.039
So that's-- so this
is the secant line.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.080
So think about its slope.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.500
All the mean value
theorem tells us

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.130
is that at some point
in this interval,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.330
the instant slope
of the tangent line

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.960
is going to be the same as
the slope of the secant line.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.680
And we can see, just visually,
it looks like right over here,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.540
the slope of the tangent line
is it looks like the same

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.110
as the slope of the secant line.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.030
It also looks like the
case right over here.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.340
The slope of the tangent
line is equal to the slope

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.222
of the secant line.

00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:29.430
And it makes intuitive sense.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.740
At some point, your
instantaneous slope

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.190
is going to be the same
as the average slope.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.210
Now how would we write
that mathematically?

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.850
Well, let's calculate
the average slope

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.080
over this interval.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.560
Well, the average slope
over this interval,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.220
or the average change, the
slope of the secant line,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.570
is going to be our change
in y-- our change in y

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.785
right over here--
over our change in x.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.350
Well, what is our change in y?

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:09.890
Our change in y is
f(b) minus f(a),

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.910
and that's going to be
over our change in x.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.910
Over b minus b minus a.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.670
I'll do that in that red color.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.270
So let's just remind ourselves
what's going on here.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.870
So this right over here,
this is the graph of y

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.360
is equal to f(x).

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.770
We're saying that the
slope of the secant line,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.360
or our average rate of change
over the interval from a to b,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.720
is our change in y-- that the
Greek letter delta is just

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.685
shorthand for change in
y-- over our change in x.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.580
Which, of course,
is equal to this.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.690
And the mean value
theorem tells us

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.800
that there exists-- so
if we know these two

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.030
things about the
function, then there

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:12.700
exists some x value
in between a and b.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.596
So in the open interval between
a and b, there exists some c.

00:05:17.596 --> 00:05:19.490
There exists some
c, and we could

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.702
say it's a member of the open
interval between a and b.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.860
Or we could say some c
such that a is less than c,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.590
which is less than b.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.696
So some c in this interval.

00:05:37.696 --> 00:05:43.210
So some c in between it
where the instantaneous rate

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.320
of change at that
x value is the same

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.110
as the average rate of change.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.290
So there exists some c
in this open interval

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.500
where the average
rate of change is

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.440
equal to the instantaneous
rate of change at that point.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.430
That's all it's saying.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.686
And as we saw this diagram right
over here, this could be our c.

00:06:04.686 --> 00:06:08.210
Or this could be our c as well.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.270
So nothing really--
it looks, you

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.631
would say f is continuous over
a, b, differentiable over-- f

00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:16.880
is continuous over the closed
interval, differentiable

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.750
over the open interval, and
you see all this notation.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.291
You're like, what
is that telling us?

00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:22.990
All it's saying is at some
point in the interval,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.220
the instantaneous
rate of change is

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.430
going to be the same as
the average rate of change

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.094
over the whole interval.

00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:31.760
In the next video,
we'll try to give you

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.330
a kind of a real life example
about when that make sense.
