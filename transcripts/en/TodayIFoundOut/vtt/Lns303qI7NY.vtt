00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.820
While dueling outside of the legal system
to resolve a dispute has been around in one

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.190
form or another seemingly as long as there
have been humans, trial by combat (determining

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.470
guilt or innocence with, essentially, a duel
sanctioned by the courts) dates back to around

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.970
the 7th century CE and Germanic law, becoming
a relatively common practice in Europe through

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.750
the 16th century.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.670
By the early 8th century, trial by combat
had been codified, including in the Lex Alamannorum

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.090
(712-730 CE), and the Frankish Merovingians
and Carolingians had set out capitularies

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.640
on the practice by the turn of the 9th century.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.090
In the Swedish tradition, trial by combat
was called holmgang, and by the 13th century,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.520
the rules of the practice were written down:

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.200
If someone speaks insults to another . . . they
shall meet where three roads meet.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.420
If he who has spoken comes and not the insulted
one, then he shall be as he’s been called:

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.700
no right to swear oaths, no right to bear
witness . . .

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.179
If the insulted one comes and not he who has
spoken, then he shall cry Nioingr! three times

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.179
. . .

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.380
If the insulted one falls, the compensation
is half a weregild; if he who has spoken falls,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.590
insults are the worst . . . .

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.840
Of course, rules vary, and sometimes an accused
would have to fight, while in other situations,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.899
witnesses or champions for each side would
take up the challenge.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.400
In the 10th century, Otto the Great officially
sanctioned the practice for the Holy Roman

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.959
Empire, and in 1230, its legal code, the Sachsenspiegel,
identified it as a key method for establishing

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.790
innocence or guilt, particularly for claims
of injury, theft or insult.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.320
According to the Sachsenspiegel, the parties
were provided with swords and shields and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.830
were prohibited from wearing helmets, shoes
or heavy gloves.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.480
Although it’s not always clear what would
happen to an accuser who didn’t show up

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.140
at the appointed time (presumably in most
cases the accused would be deemed innocent),

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.750
if the accused failed to appear, that individual
was deemed guilty.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.900
In one noteworthy Flemish trial in the 12th
century, Guy of Steenvoorde was found guilty

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.350
of treachery after he was defeated by Iron
Herman, in a particularly painful fashion:

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.400
The prostrate [Iron Herman] gathered strength
. . . and slyly made Guy think he was certain

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.739
of victory . . . . Meanwhile, having raised
his hand very smoothly to the lower edges

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.310
of the mail coat, where Guy was unprotected,
and grabbed him by the testicles . . . and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.320
threw him from him, breaking open all the
lower parts of his body . . . so that the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.129
prostate Guy grew weak and cried out that
he was defeated and was going to die.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.769
Wager of battle, as the practice was called
in Britain, was probably introduced by the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.850
Normans, and the first recorded battle, Wulfstan
v. Walter (1077), occurred soon after the

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.420
Conquest (1066).

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.160
(It’s not clear who won in this case.)

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.580
By the next century, the Tractatus of Glanvill
(1187), an English legal treatise, suggested

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.709
the practice was the primary mode of trial,
at least among the nobles; however, by 1219

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.180
and perhaps to comply with the Magna Carta
(1215), jury trials were becoming more common,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.800
and trial by combat began to slowly fall out
of vogue in Britain.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.920
That said, it was still around and in one
1251 case between the Abbot of Meaux and the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.910
Abbot of St. Mary’s of York, each holy man
paid for a champion to represent him (like

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.879
a lawyer, but with brawn instead of words).

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.200
During the duel between the champions, despite
the fact that Meaux paid much more for a generally

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.930
considered superior fighter, as it began to
look like his man could lose, the two clergymen

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.840
quickly settled their dispute before the fight
ended.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.210
This particular trial by combat illustrates
a couple important things about such trials

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.760
in their practical use to determine guilt
or innocence at this point in history.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.640
First, contrary to what is generally depicted
in film and TV shows, trial by combat was

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.630
not always a lethal affair, and often combatants
specifically used weapons like quarterstaves

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.660
or the like which wouldn’t necessarily cause
any permanent harm, though of course could

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.660
potentially if a fight proceeded to the conclusion
of one fighter being completely incapacitated.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.260
However, either fighter could at any point
simply give up if things got a little too

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.931
dangerous for their liking- sometimes accepting
the drawbacks of losing was a preferable scenario

00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:53.740
to continuing to fight and potentially being
killed.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.360
Further, the combat sometimes didn’t even
happen at all; once the two champions were

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.310
set, if one side or the other was at a significant
advantage, matters might be settled out of

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.770
court as a result.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.150
And even if the trial by combat went forward,
the individuals involved in the dispute could

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.570
in some cases decide to settle it before the
fight ended depending on how the fight was

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.690
going, as happened with the Abbots.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.550
It’s also important to note here that it
was presumed at the time that God would help

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.960
the individual whose cause was just in the
physical fight and ensure that person’s

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.080
(or their champion’s) victory.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.780
Further, if one wanted to accuse someone of
something in a court of law, as Justice John

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.779
Bayley noted in the famous 1818 case Ashford
v Thornton (in which Thornton requested trial

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:37.260
by combat to prove his innocence), thanks
to trial by combat, “the party who institutes

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.080
[the trial] must be willing, if required,
to stake his life in support of his accusation.”

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.120
Given all this, trial by combat, which could
potentially be quite unjust, at the least

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.060
from a practical standpoint often resulted
in matters being settled without bogging down

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.130
the court system.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.839
In any event, by the 14th century or so, the
practice had fallen out of favor with the

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.909
Holy Roman Emperor, and this was noted in
the Kleines Kaiserrecht, which prohibited

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.330
trial by combat, arguing that too many people
were falsely convicted just because they were

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.380
weaker than their accusers.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.979
While there is some dispute, the last official
trial by combat in the British Isles (in which

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.029
there was a combat) is generally considered
to have occurred at Dublin Castle in Ireland

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:25.419
between Teig and Conor on September 7, 1583,
over a dispute for control of the O’Connor

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.419
territory.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.440
During the combat, Conor was killed and Teig
was injured, but emerged victorious.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.870
However, other duels that were somewhat judicial
in nature continued on, including one that

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.080
occurred in Scotland in 1597, when Adam Bruntfield
killed James Carmichael after, ironically,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.480
accusing him of murder.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.979
Given Bruntfield had a license from the King
to resolve the dispute in this way, some consider

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.560
this to be the real last trial by combat in
the British Isles.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.160
Whatever the case, several unsuccessful attempts
were made in this region to officially outlaw

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.409
the practice of trial by combat in the 17th
and 18th centuries.

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:02.740
Things changed however, after the aforementioned
Ashford v. Thornton case.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.880
In a previous trial, Abraham Thornton was
acquitted of rape and murder charges by a

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.890
jury, despite public sentiment at the time
being almost universally that he was guilty

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.890
of both.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.919
As to why the court of public opinion had
already convicted him, Thornton was known

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.780
to have left a party the night before with
one Mary Ashford.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.490
During the party, contemporary media reports
claim he bragged that he’d slept with her

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.159
sister and was determined to do the same with
Mary (though he denied he ever said this).

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.110
Mary’s body was found the next morning at
the bottom of a water filled pit and Thornton

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.260
was shortly thereafter discovered with blood
on his undergarments…

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.900
On top of that, upon examination of her body,
Mary’s vagina was found to have two lacerations.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.870
Needless to say, things were looking dire
for Thornton, who admitted to having supposedly

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.560
consensual sex with Mary the night previous.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.339
So why did the jury acquit him?

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:56.360
Things started to turn in his favor when a
medical examiner found no signs of struggle

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.110
anywhere on Mary’s body, outside of potentially
the lacerations in her vagina.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.560
As to those, he stated that in his medical
opinion, they were simply caused by Mary having

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.840
been very clearly (based on his examination)
a virgin at the time Thornton and she had

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840
sex.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.279
As for the blood on Thornton’s undergarments,
the examiner noted that Mary was menstruating

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.289
at the time the couple coupled.

00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:17.570
While this may have explained away the rape
accusation (potentially, though of course

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.310
not exactly conclusively), there still was
the matter of the young and healthy Mary having

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.909
been found dead at the bottom of a water filled
pit not long after the pair had been seen

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:27.909
together.

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:31.880
The key piece of evidence exonerating Thornton
on this one was the timing of Mary’s death,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.830
which was partially determined thanks to an
eyewitness seeing her walking alone shortly

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.979
before she’d have walked by the pit.

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:43.950
Given she was apparently alone and alive at
around 4:30 am on the morning of May 27, 1817,

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.100
it was determined to be impossible that Thornton
had killed her.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.630
You see, around this time, and until her body
was discovered about an hour and a half later,

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.589
Thornton was a few miles from the pit in question,
with his location for the duration corroborated

00:08:56.589 --> 00:08:58.980
by multiple eyewitness testimonies.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.140
Given this fact, to the extreme outrage of
the general public, the jury (who initially

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.600
were thought to be biased against him), were
forced to deem him not-guilty.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.529
What does any of this have to do with a trial
by combat?

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:16.010
Thanks to said outrage over the verdict, funds
were raised and Mary’s brother, William

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.070
Ashford, agreed to use them to appeal the
murder charge.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:24.649
Thus, Thornton was subjected to yet another
trial for one of the crimes he was just acquitted

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:25.649
of.

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:29.629
Given that public outrage now made it even
more difficult to find a jury who wasn’t

00:09:29.629 --> 00:09:33.180
convinced he was guilty before the second
trial, and given William Ashford’s small

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.579
stature compared to Thornton’s, Thornton’s
counsel advised him to invoke trial by combat

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:39.579
this time around.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:44.071
And so it was that when Thornton was asked
for his plea, he stated, “Not guilty; and

00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:47.040
I am ready to defend the same with my body.”

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.930
He followed this up by quite literally throwing
down a gauntlet at Ashford’s feet.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.709
In something of a surprise, the court granted
Thornton’s request for trial by combat,

00:09:55.709 --> 00:10:00.870
but his accuser, William Ashford, refused
to take part; so Thornton went free.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.540
In direct response to this case, in 1819,
Parliament finally succeeded in outlawing

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.879
this form of judicial dueling, as well as
abolished the practice of private appeals

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:14.209
like the one that saw Thornton tried twice
for the same crime, despite being acquitted

00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:15.209
the first time.

00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:16.209
The act in question specifically noted:

00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:20.000
…whereas appeals of murder, treason, felony,
and other offences, and the manner of proceeding

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.690
therein, have been found to be oppressive;
and the trial by battle in any suit, is a

00:10:24.690 --> 00:11:53.680
mode of trial unfit to be used… it is expedient
that the same should be wholly abolished…
