In the last lesson, we left off with dealing with this function, f of x equals

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:10.416
x cubed minus 4 x squared plus x plus 6. We had found that 2 is a zero of this

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:15.980
function, since when we substitute it in, the entire function comes to equal 0.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.571
&gt;From this we learned, from the factor theorem, that x minus 2 must be a factor

00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:24.492
of the polynomial. So we're one step on our way to writing f of x in fully

00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:28.955
factored form. We know that eventually we'll be able to write it as x minus 2

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:34.960
times a bunch of other stuff. But what is that other stuff? Well, to find it,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.347
we're going to need to divide this expression by x minus 2. In particular we

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:41.613
are going to use long division. That's what we'll look at next.
