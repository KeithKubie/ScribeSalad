00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
You're daydreaming in class when the teacher
calls on you and asks you a question.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.700
You don't know the answer, so you look desperately
around the room for help.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.240
Finally, one of your classmates whispers
it to you.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.560
So you say the answer, and the moment of terror
is over.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.530
You go back to daydreaming, the teacher goes
back to teaching, and everyone's happy.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.080
A lot of stuff just happened there.
Stuff that raises many questions.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.910
Like, why are you worried about giving the
right answer?

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.220
Why are you worried about answering the question
at all?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.240
And why does your classmate help you out,
when it could get them in trouble?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.650
If you want the right answers to these questions,
we need to talk about social interaction.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.040
And we also need to talk about reality.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.380
Because, according to some sociological theories,
the reality of your social world – in your classroom and
beyond – is basically a huge, life-long stage play.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:52.700
[Theme Music]

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.480
Social interaction is simply the process by
which people act and react in relation to others.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.600
Whenever people converse, or yell, or fight,
or play sports, that’s social interaction.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.640
And any place you find social interaction,
you're going to find social structure.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.520
Social structure consists of the relationships
among people and groups.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.720
And this structure gives direction to, and
sets limits on, our behavior.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.600
Because our relationships establish certain
expectations of everyone involved, depending
on the social setting.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.860
This is really obvious in a classroom: The teacher
teaches and the students learn, because that’s the
expectation for that relationship, in that setting.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.600
But if you run into a teacher, say, at the mall, you both
behave differently – and probably awkwardly –

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.300
because the expectations for your interaction
in that social setting have changed.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.220
Now, this still doesn't tell us why these
relationships work the way they do.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.240
But it does tell us where to look.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.640
If our interactions are a matter of expectations,
then we need to understand how those expectations are
set, and for that we need to talk about social status.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.479
Status is a position that a person occupies
in a society or social group.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.300
It's part of their identity, and it defines
their relationships with other people.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.950
So, the status of “teacher” defines how
a teacher should relate to their students.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.340
But statuses aren't just professions: gender,
race, and sexual orientation are all social statuses,
as are being a father, or a child, or a citizen.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.700
And all the statuses held by a single person
make up that person's status set.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.000
That status set can tell us a lot about a person,
because statuses exist in a hierarchy, with some
statuses being more valued than others.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.880
So if I tell you that someone is a white middle aged male CEO, then you can make some pretty reasonable guesses about his education, wealth, and the power he holds in society.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.680
And you've probably noticed that there are different
kinds of statuses; for example "white," "middle-aged,"
and "male" are pretty  different from the status of "CEO."

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.200
The first three are all ascribed statuses.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.840
Ascribed statuses are those in which a person
has no choice; they're either assigned at birth
or assigned involuntarily later in life.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.340
Race, for instance, is an ascribed status
assigned at birth, while the ascribed status of
“middle-aged” happens at a point later in life.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.240
CEO, on the other hand, is an achieved status
– it’s earned, accomplished, or obtained with 
at least some effort on the person’s part.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.300
Professions, then, are achieved statuses.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.900
So is being a student, or a parent.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.040
Beyond this difference, there’s also the
fact that some statuses are more important
than others.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.320
A master status is the status others are most
likely to use to identify you.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.040
This can be achieved, like “professor,”
or ascribed, like “cancer patient.”

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.920
And as that example shows you, a master status
doesn’t need to be positive or desirable.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.180
In fact, it doesn’t even need to be important
to the person who holds it.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.329
It just needs to be important to other people,
who use the status as their primary way of
locating that person in the social hierarchy.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.020
Also, statuses tend to clump together in certain
ways.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.040
Most CEOs are college educated, for example,
but they aren’t always.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.300
And a mismatch or contradiction between statuses
is called a status inconsistency.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.900
When we talk about PhD students working as baristas,
we’re really bringing it up in that way, because there's a
status inconsistency between PhD and barista.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.120
At least in the industrialized world, service
workers aren't "supposed" to be highly educated.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.120
Now that's all very interesting, you might
say, but we still haven't said that much about
social interaction.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.080
And you're right: status gets us started,
but if we want to get into how people behave,
then we need to talk about roles.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.300
If status is a social position, then roles
are the sets of behaviors, obligations, and
privileges that go with that status.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.800
So a person holds a status, but they perform
a role.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.620
Keep that word in mind: Perform.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.280
Now, since a person can have multiple statuses,
they can have multiple roles too.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.030
But a single status often has multiple roles
that go with it.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.420
For example, a teacher's role in the classroom
is to teach and lead students.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.340
But in the faculty lounge, the status of
teacher has another role;

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.160
acting as a colleague to other teachers,
or as an employee to the principal –

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.960
roles that require a whole different bunch of
behaviors than those found in the classroom.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.760
But all of the roles attached to the single status
of “teacher” make up that status' role set.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.300
All statuses have role sets.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.160
And various role sets can sometimes demand
contradictory behaviors of the person who
holds that set.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.600
When the roles attached to different statuses create
clashing demands, that’s known as role conflict.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.500
Parents who work, for instance, often need to decide
between the demands of their jobs and the demands
of their families, which can lead to role conflict.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.180
And even the roles within a single status
can create contradiction, in what we call
role strain.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.740
A student who has responsibilities for class,
but also for basketball, and orchestra, and the
yearbook committee,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.720
experiences role strain as they try to balance
the competing obligations of these roles, all within
the context of their status as a student.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:25.030
Now sometimes, whether it’s because of conflict,
strain, or other reasons, people just disengage
from a certain role, in a process called role exit.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.000
This can be voluntary, like quitting your
job, or involuntary, like getting dumped.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.320
In either case, it's rarely as simple as just
walking out the door, because roles are a
part of who we are.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.320
So exiting a role can be traumatic, especially
without preparation, or if the exit isn't by choice.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.560
Now, we've been talking about roles as
though they’re prescriptive, or that they totally
determine our behavior.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.640
But they don't!

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.820
Roles are guidelines, expectations that we
have for ourselves and that others place on us.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.720
We may or may not internalize those
expectations, but even if we do, our behavior
still isn’t completely controlled.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.020
But why do statuses come bundled with roles
in the first place?

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.840
Why can't I just not perform my role?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.100
The answer is complicated, but part of it
is that, well, reality itself is socially constructed.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.960
I mean, there's nothing in the laws of physics that says that some people are teachers, and that those people get to ask questions, and students have to answer them.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.020
But that doesn't mean these statuses aren't
real and don't have real roles attached to them.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:24.400
One good way of thinking about this is known as the Thomas Theorem, developed by early 20th century American sociologists William Thomas and Dorothy Thomas.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.200
It states, "If people define situations as
real, they are real in their consequences."

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.500
In other words, statuses and roles matter,
because we say they do.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.460
The perception creates the reality.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:41.300
So the reason you can't just not perform your
role is that, even if you don't think it matters,
everyone else does think it matters!

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.340
So the student who refuses to answer a
question gets in trouble,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.260
while the teacher who refuses to teach
and just hangs out drinking wine with their
feet up on their desk gets fired.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:55.800
If you have the status of a teacher, people
expect, even demand, that you do the things
teachers are expected to do.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.780
How you feel about your status doesn’t really
enter into it.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.990
And we know who's a teacher and who's a student
based on our background assumptions, our experiences,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.650
and the socialization that teaches us about
norms in various situations.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:15.300
So, this is how your reality becomes socially
constructed – you, and everyone around you, uses
assumptions and experiences to define what’s real.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.800
By interacting with the people around you, and
expecting certain behaviors in the context of roles,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.260
you actually create the social reality that
shapes those interactions that you’re having.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:30.260
The fact that this happens in interaction
is really important, because your social reality
is not just about you.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.659
It's about everyone you're interacting with,
and their expectations, too.

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:35.810
It's about maintaining a performance.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.820
And this idea of performance is really central to a
sociological understanding of how people interact.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.420
It’s the key to what’s known as the dramaturgical
analysis of social interaction.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:52.200
This approach, pioneered by Canadian-American
sociologist Erving Goffman, understands social
interaction as if it were a play performed on 
stage for an audience.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:08:03.129
By Goffman’s thinking, people literally perform roles for each other, and the point of social interaction is always – at least partly – to maintain a successful interaction that’s in line with expectations.

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:05.060
That is, to satisfy the audience.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:11.289
In order to do this, people need to carefully
control the information others receive about them,
in a process called impression management.

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:17.650
Like, if you're out on a first date, you’re not
gonna talk about how your last relationship ended,
because you don't want to create a bad impression.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.740
But impression management isn't merely a matter
of what you say and don't say.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.219
It's also a matter of what you wear and what
you do.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.560
That is to say, it's a matter of what Goffman
referred to as props and nonverbal communication.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.120
Props, as you know, are just objects that
performers use to help them make a certain
impression:

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.820
So if you want to look professional,
you wear a suit.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.060
If you want to look studious, make sure you're
reading a book.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:44.420
And the setting can be a prop too: Being the one
standing at the front of the classroom is like 50%
of what it takes to look like a teacher.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:50.920
And nonverbal communication includes body language
– like standing up straight in order to look respectable,
and maintaining or averting eye contact –

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.560
as well as gestures,
like waving hello to your friend.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.380
Together, props and nonverbal communication
are both examples of what Goffman called
sign vehicles:

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.800
things we use to help convey impressions
to people we interact with.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:09.300
Those vehicles are important aspects of the performance, but really the most fundamental distinction is the one between what’s part of the performance and what isn't –

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.200
in other words, what the audience sees,
and what they don't.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.580
Goffman called this frontstage and backstage.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:21.320
Frontstage is where the audience is and where the
performance happens, while backstage is where the
performer can drop the performance and prepare.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.220
Often the things we do backstage would totally
ruin the performance we're trying to maintain frontstage.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.000
A teacher cursing floridly while grading papers
would be considered backstage:

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.100
important preparation for teaching is happening,
but if any of her students – that is, the audience –
saw her, it would totally ruin the performance,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.220
because it defies expectations of how
teachers are supposed to act.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.980
And not all performances are one-person shows.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:49.340
The students, for instance, are all on what
Goffman calls a team; they’re all working together
to give a performance collectively for the teacher.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.340
This doesn't mean they're all friends, or
that they even like each other.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.160
It just means that they all need to work together to
pull it off the show of being a good, attentive class.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.840
This is why your classmate whispers the
answer to you:

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.760
They’re helping you maintain the class’s performance
of attentiveness by acting as a teammate.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.380
And the teacher goes on teaching.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:11.600
It's important to understand that, in Goffman’s
analysis, the performances that everyone does
all the time aren't necessarily adversarial:

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.000
The students perform for the teacher, and the
teacher performs for the students, but everyone
involved wants the performance to go smoothly.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.600
You may not ever win an Oscar.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.640
But according to dramaturgical analysis, your
social interactions are where your statuses,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:30.460
roles, and all of the expectations that they
entail, come together for you to give, literally,
the performance of your life.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.500
And that performance is the stuff of social
reality.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.400
Today we learned about social interaction.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.880
We talked about statuses, how you come to
have them, and how they can conflict.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.019
Then we talked about how statuses impact your
behavior by determining what roles you have.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.620
We explored why those roles matter by talking
about the socially constructed nature of reality.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:56.330
Finally, we learned about the theory of dramaturgical
analysis and how we can understand social interaction
as in terms of theatrical performance.
