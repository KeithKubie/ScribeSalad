1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,020
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't
know. I mean, look funny.

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,450
Then when you see pictures of Trump,
he's eating Kentucky Fried Chicken.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,990
When you see pictures of
this dude, he's, he loves her

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,670
Trump phrase, Kentucky fried chicken
was fucking private jet hilarious.

5
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:20,970
He really loves that stuff. He loves
it. He really fucking loves fast food.

6
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:22,770
Like when he got all those athletes,

7
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,290
when they came to visit them and the
government was shut down and brought them

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,860
off fast food, he didn't understand
that. Like what the fuck this shit.

9
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:32,610
And then he had another team showed up
months later and he broke out the fast

10
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:35,730
food again. The government was
hope. Just imagine the fucking,

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,380
you're going to see the president of the
United States and you're a professional

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,530
athlete. Yeah. Right.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,140
Your body literally is a temple and
they were college athletes, but oh,

14
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:50,910
they're college. I would still
listen. Let's be real about that. Huh?

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,760
Carriage athletes should
get fucking paid crazy.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,890
That's the biggest robbery
and all them politic's. Yeah.

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,660
College sports cans to get
into the NBA and the NFL. Yeah.

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,460
You had a chance if they do,
but you're making billions off these kids.

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,450
Fucking billions. Don't give him a
sweatshirt. Money, $20 fucking fast food.

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,990
I'm telling you man, this guy,
in terms of like material,

21
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:18,960
current and future,
it's almost like we glutton down.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,440
It's almost like Trump was ice
cream when he was in office.

23
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:25,110
He was so good for
comedy that it was like,

24
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:29,510
there are so many Trump jokes
every now everyone's like, no mo

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,620
anymore. Can you take another
bite cause I need something else.

26
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,760
I can't have ice cream.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,040
These like one more bite ice cream is
going to come chucking out of your throat.

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,470
It's really true. It's so,
he's so fucking eccentric.

29
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,320
Like good or bad.
Just look at him as a human.

30
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,420
It's such a rare human being. Yeah. You
know? I mean you've seen it with the,

31
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,480
with the hair and the fucking
constant golfing. Even though he shit,

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,260
he shit on fucking Obama
Golfing and he's gone away. Him,

33
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,320
he doesn't even try to pretend he's
not a hypocrite. No, not at all.

34
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,070
He's just everything.
He's just the fat American on a jet Ski.

35
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,910
Just letting it rip.

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,570
If you know what's also hilarious,
I think this is a real thing.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,290
Trump derangement syndrome.
I think it's real.

38
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,140
You mean people that are obsessed with
him, they're obsessed with, you know,

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,180
this is the thing that's going to get him.

40
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,920
He'll be out of office in three weeks
instead of like looking at it like this is

41
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:36,921
the argument for garlic Michael
Mouse that he's an objective analyst.

42
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,080
Stepping back, looking
at this, he's doesn't,

43
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,850
he doesn't have a vested interest
in this guy winning here,

44
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:45,780
that guy and when he's just going, hmm,
what is this? Sitting back and watching,

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,300
this is if I,
if I'm going to take that position,

46
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,540
not emotionally involved because some
people get so emotionally involved they

47
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,200
can't sleep, they start crying, they
think it's the end of the world.

48
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,420
The world is exactly the same.

49
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:02,190
We just have a different figure head and
I think it will present challenges that

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,680
will make us more understanding
of each other. I really do.

51
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,850
That's what I really think.
I think there's,

52
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,450
there's good and bad
about every situation,

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,570
but the pro I see is communication.

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,820
If we're just honest with
the way we communicate,

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,410
I think people on the right and people
on the left, they share a lot in common.

56
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,480
There's a lot, a lot that
they share rather than what
they don't share in common.

57
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,530
Yeah. You know, the only thing they don't
share is what they're watching. Well,

58
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,280
there's that too. Right. And it's also
the vibe you get. Yeah. I like this.

59
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,030
The vibe from these,
whatever, whether it's CNN,

60
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:41,180
whatever show you're into MSNBC, Fox
News, they all give out a vibe. Yeah.

61
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,730
And that vibe is, you know, we
are right. Here's what's going on.

62
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:47,830
Here's why that's a problem.
You know,

63
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,470
and everyone has a different problem
and everyone thinks they're right.

64
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,720
And then you have, so you
have different things. You,

65
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,580
some of them are have like eagles
and flags and Tom, that's Fox News.

66
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,290
Like that's my style. I'm into that kind
of truth. Gimme gimme that shit. Yeah.

67
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,590
Fucking yeah. Yeah. Come on over
here though, right way. Yeah.

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,370
All right guys. Yeah, yeah. Oh
yeah. Y'All fucking neighbor.

69
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,100
Let him move in to your fucking
neighborhood. Great job,
Matt. Out trucks and hats.

70
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:19,600
And guns that could comes your team. That
becomes your claim. That's what it is.

71
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:22,570
It's the team thing.
Most of it, and, and the,

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,090
the unfortunate part is both are saying,

73
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,320
are spending so much time rather than
thinking about this is the problem that we

74
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,154
have to deal with.

75
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,960
They're spending all their time thinking
those other people are assholes. Right,

76
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,290
exactly.
It's being,

77
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,320
it's the venomous attacks against fellow
Americans because they have a slightly

78
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,520
different view about healthcare.
That part is the,

79
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,900
the derangement of the culture right now.
