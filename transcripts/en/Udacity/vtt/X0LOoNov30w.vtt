00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Yes, the answer is 2.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There are exactly 2 elements that fall between $130,000 and $140,000.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Obviously the final bar is of size 2 again,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because there are exactly 2 elements.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, this histogram differs from the bar chart in that the vertical axis is just a frequency count

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
whereas before it might have been a median home sales value.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In 1-dimensional data sets that are numerical, this could be informative.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You can say, for example the majority of workers in this company

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
are in this salary bracket where as a much smaller number are in higher salary brackets.
