00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.570
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hi.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.070
This is Zach Weinersmith.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.940
Many of you may know him from Sunday Morning
Breakfast Cereal--the comic that he does.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:21.510
He also does SMBC Theater and has a blog working
that will teach you in physics and calculus

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.510
from college.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.510
And I don't know what else you're doing.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.510
I don't know what you've handed out to the
crowd here or what we're in for.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.510
[Zach Weinersmith laughs]

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.630
I'm sure you have some other experimental
project going on here.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.410
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yes.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.530
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: All right, we'll go with
that.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.530
Take it away.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250
I think this is, maybe talk a little bit about
yourself.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.650
And I think this is mostly gonna be Q&amp;A.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.650
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: So, yeah.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.650
I do two other projects.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.690
I do "Snowflakes," a children's comic and
"Captain Stupendous," which is not at all

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.690
for children.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.760
[audience chuckles] And the new thing I'm
doing with Breadpig, other than the books,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.809
we have a book out.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.670
We'll be debuting it at NYCC if any of you
are coming.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.750
And we have, as you've seen, the world's first
single-use gentlemenâ€™s unlubricated disposable

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.750
monocle.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.750
[laughter]

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.710
And I wanted to talk about it 'cause it's
really cool just in terms of what it's like

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.750
to be a creator right now, which is--.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.490
It started with, as you know, there's actually
a comic that was about this.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:23.630
And the joke was that there's a lady asking
a guy if he had protection.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.119
And surprisingly, he took out a monocle instead
of a condom.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.119
[laughter]

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.409
And I'm very good at telling jokes live I
guess.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.409
[laughter]

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.409
I should tell you.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.409
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Is that in there?

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.409
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: It might be too recent.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.409
I don't know.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.650
There's a funny thing about that one 'cause
there's a point in it where he puts on a monocle

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.140
and he's just pointing down.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.140
That's his indication.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.140
[laughter]

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.780
But my voting buttons are under my sharing
buttons, so he was actually pointing at reddit

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.920
and so, reddit got really excited about that.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920
[laughter]

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.040
But it was cool because--.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.439
So, I had this idea and then it occurred to
me that we might actually be able to make

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.679
a monocle in a condom wrapper, which would
be like, the funniest thing ever.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:06.960
[laughter] And so, I just put a post on my
blog, like, "Could anyone tell me how to accomplish

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.160
this 'cause I have no idea?"

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.650
And so, I got a couple offers from people
who thought they could put it together.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.580
And then, it occurred to me that it might
be smart to try to get it done in a more traditional

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.580
way.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.580
And I started looking into it.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.610
And maybe some of you have been to a costume
shop and have seen the--.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.130
You get these little rings of plastic.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.130
They have really crummy.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.470
There's no lens in them.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.370
I don't know if anyone's opened one, but really,
it's like an actual monocle.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.350
I mean, it's not a proper lens.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.970
It's just a piece of acrylic.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.810
So, don't try to see with it.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.810
And also, it wouldn't be very unique.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.590
I would've felt a little bad basically buying
someone else's product, unpackaging it, repackaging

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.200
it, and selling it.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.130
And so, it turned out not only could I not
do it, I didn't want to do it if I could do

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.130
it.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.700
And then, a guy named Ben Peters--we just
met with a minute ago.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.340
He's at the Media Labs over at MIT.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.020
Said he thought he could build these things.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.730
And so, we gave him the go ahead and two weeks
later, he had sent me a prototype.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.410
And it's a brass ring with an acrylic lens
and there's even a brass chain on it, which

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.410
is just magical.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.930
And he even, the version I never touched happily,
which he sent me a picture of, was actually

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.450
lubricated.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.960
[laughter]

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.680
And I think the only thing that's sad about
it is that it actually looked really cool.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.450
It had a transparent bag, so there was just
this monocle floating in jelly.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.450
[laughter]

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.810
But we figured maybe you don't want lubricant
in your eye.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.750
I' haven't had that experience.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.020
Maybe some of you have.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.340
But so, we made an unlubricated version, which
is the one you have.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.900
And it's cool because there was this nice
way where a whole bunch of us brought different

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.900
sets of skills together.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.500
So, I had the stupid idea.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.790
That's my skill.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.720
But then, Breadpig is handling distribution.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.950
And Kristine is local, so she was actually
able to talk to Ben about how these things

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.290
are gonna come out.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:18.750
And then, Ben, who is at Media Labs, knows
how to build monocles with brass and a laser

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.590
cutter, and then also had to seal them in
Mylar.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.150
And then, the art is by David Malki.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.150
I don't know if any of you know--.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.150
Yeah, OK.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.150
So, he does comical Wondermark.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.460
So we wanted to set a Victorian flavor and
do the essential Victorian comic.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:43.759
And he has this awesome library of real Victorian
art that he's turned into vector art, so he

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:44.759
can use it for all sorts of cool products.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.530
And so, we were really able to pull all these
different resources at once to make this really

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.530
cool product.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.530
And I'm hoping to do this more.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.889
I don't know what the stupid stuff will be
in the future, but it's a really cool time

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.789
now that you can just pool resources this
way.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.479
So, I encourage you guys to do the same thing
with your stupid ideas.

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.479
[laughter]

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:03.479
So, yeah.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.610
That's pretty much all I wanted to say about
the monocles.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.150
I think they'll be out in October if everything
goes well.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.449
And yeah.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.340
So, does anyone have any questions?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.340
I mostly wanted to do Q&amp;A today.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.340
[laughter]

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.229
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: So, just to talk about, do you
have to hand make all of the monocles?.

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.550
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I'm just showing you the
process.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.129
It essentially gets, although the way--.

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.449
He's working on automating it a little bit,
so the lens, for example, is laser cut.

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.960
So, it goes through and cuts all the lenses.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.220
So, that part is easy.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.310
And the way he does the rings is by hand,
though.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.310
But it's not too bad.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.729
He just basically has a tube and he forms
the ring, ties it off, and then has a little

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.320
adhesive to seal in the lens.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.539
So, it's fairly simple.

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.669
But it's more complicated than it needs to
be.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:00.689
So, I'm a little terrified that we'll actually
sell out of these, which would be really sad.

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.479
My wife completely rolled her eyes about this
project.

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.479
[laughter]

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:05.479
And the comic, actually.

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.720
She was like, "Don't do this.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720
It's stupid."

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.270
And then when I made the real thing, she was
like, "Don't do this.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.310
It's stupid."

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.310
[laughter]

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.620
So, if it's a success, I win the relationship.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.620
[laughter]

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.070
The question was answered?

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.740
Yeah, so it's--.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.210
We're a little worried.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.651
If it sells out--we were just talking about
this on the way over.

00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:31.340
We're gonna have to figure out some way to
simplify or augment the process.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.840
The problem is, and this is still the case,
if you want like a hundred of something it's

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.090
not so bad 'cause you can go to someone like
Ben, who can just make these things.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.499
Our original load was gonna be a thousand
of them.

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:46.419
And if you want a million of them, you can
go to China.

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.460
But getting these intermediate levels is a
little trickier volume-wise.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.050
You have to figure out.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.050
We even thought that--.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.050
We learned a lot of weird stuff.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.909
So, we thought we could just send them the
monocles in a condom wrapper company could

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:58.909
just wrap them up.

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:03.909
It turns out, you're not supposed to use condom
wrapper machines for anything but condoms.

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:04.909
[laughter]

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:06.599
I can't imagine why.

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:07.599
[laughter]

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:11.849
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: Like, this is medical equipment
--.

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.710
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Process glass on those things.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.809
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: What?

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:19.419
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Process glass on those things.

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.960
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yes.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.460
So, he's more or less making them by hand.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.259
But with the Media Labs, it's a little nicer.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:29.259
Yeah?

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:35.159
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: So, what percentage of your strips
does your wife look at and say, "This is stupid?"

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.159
[laughter]

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:41.800
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I actually, I have like
a secret joke Congress that analyzes my jokes

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.909
before they go to my hand.

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:45.909
[laughter]

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:49.339
It's considered press, if that makes any sense.

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:53.629
So, she's actually, she's always responsive.

00:07:53.629 --> 00:08:01.639
My friends don't have to respond, but she
has to 'cause she's the most sense.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:05.009
And so, she reads every single joke.

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:10.099
She's actually the only one who reads every
single joke in advance.

00:08:10.099 --> 00:08:16.909
It's nice because when she doesn't like a
joke and I do it, I can be like, "In your

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:17.909
face."

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:24.659
And when she likes a joke and I do and it
fails, it's also in her face.

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:25.659
[laughter]

00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:32.520
It's really, I always win--win the relationship.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.060
I think through the bonus comics, I make it
seem like she's always rolling her eyes at

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.370
the jokes, but I think she rolls her eyes--she's
a scientist, I should say.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.370
She has real skills.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.370
[laughter]

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.780
And so, she rolls her eyes at my life.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.520
But in the actual comics, I think she likes
them OK because I was doing them before we

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520
started dating.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.670
And while I was dating, it became my test
for potential joke friends because if they

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.640
couldn't stomach the comic, they probably
couldn't stomach me.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.230
And so, she at least liked them three years
ago.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.230
[laughter]

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.230
Yeah?

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.980
&gt;&gt;MALE #6: Who's winning the relationship
now?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.650
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Who's winning?

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:10.900
I'm way ahead.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.900
[laughter]

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.940
&gt;&gt;MALE #6: What if I asked her?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.180
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I don't know.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.771
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Last time we asked her, she was
like, "It's not a contest."

00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:26.771
[laughter]

00:09:26.771 --> 00:09:27.771
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: She may not recognize
it's a contest, but--.

00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:28.771
I don't know.

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:33.500
I don't know if I believe her saying that.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.680
That's the kind of thing a loser says.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.680
[laughter]

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.710
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: Talk a little bit about your selection
process.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.570
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:49.580
So, we were really overdue for a book 'cause
by the time we started looking through, there

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.750
were 21 hundred strips.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.920
And I was originally gonna actually do just
one through 21 hundred.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.100
I was like, "I have ten books worth of material."

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.040
And I was going through this and I was like,
"A lot of this is garbage."

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040
And especially the early set.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040
You always hate your earlier work.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.910
But I do think it's gotten better over time.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.310
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: How far back in your stuff did
you go?

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.340
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I think there are some
one's probably from the first weeks of it,

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.340
but not many.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.690
Like, I probably actually tried, if you look
at the graph of how many I pulled per month

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:22.550
over time, it increases from something like
at least five percent up to 50 percent on

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.550
a really good month.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:28.060
And then so, I went through and I had Kristina
and Alexis, who's also at Breadpig, my wife,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.100
and a couple other close friends, would go
through and just tack off which ones they

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.100
liked.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.070
And then I interpreted that along with what
I actually wanted.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.180
And then my recollection of how it had done
on StumbleUpon or reddit or what people said

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.310
about it.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.970
And I tried not to lean on that too much 'cause
there are comics that are, people like them,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:47.970
but they don't link them.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.970
You know what I mean?

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.970
And then, there are comics that people link
but don't like.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.911
And so, I was trying to just get the really
good ones.

00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:56.780
I was hoping that this book would reach out
to people who don't already own the comic.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.420
Ideally, it's a book you can pick up and read
it and laugh at.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.930
And that was pretty much it.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.280
There was a little math.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.280
And I hopefully selected the favorites.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.300
And it's been pretty well received, I think.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:16.660
I think I've get a few people saying, "You
left out my favorite comic."

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.390
But not too much.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.410
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: You mentioned jokes falling flat.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.560
How are you gauging how people react to your
jokes?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.420
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I probably shouldn't gauge
it at all.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.920
That's my fault.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.430
What I basically do--let me think about that.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.150
I know that's why I run them by a couple people
first.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.340
And they actually just give me letter grades,
like, "This is a B minus."

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.340
And that sort of thing.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.590
And once I run through that, then I put it
up.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.640
And I think what I probably used to gauge
is how Breadpig reacts to it because they're

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.770
a pretty egalitarian community.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.460
They don't have power users.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.480
And then, how many re-tweets and how it gets
out in Twitter.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.160
And there's a little more data you can get
through like, looking at your analytics and

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.160
stuff.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.860
But it is not exactly a science.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.860
But you can kinda tell.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.820
You can at least tell the ones that have done
very well.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.500
And so, I try to actually do a lot of feedbacks.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.940
Most people are opposed to that.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.641
They think it's a diminution of the artistic
something or other, but I think the way you

00:12:14.641 --> 00:12:17.260
improve is by figuring out what people like.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260
Yeah?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.310
&gt;&gt;MALE #9: Is there ever the case that one
of your reviewers grade something A and another

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.310
one grades F?

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.360
And then if so, what does the comic actually
do?

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.540
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I've only ever gotten
one F. And that was when someone was mad at

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.540
me.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.540
[laughter]

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.440
It wasn't my wife.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.330
I'll tell you that.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.880
She's given me a D before.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880
But yeah.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.180
It's actually very common.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:47.660
What I try to do to marginalize that is I
try to make the comic as abstract as possible,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.480
which is to say, if there's a character who's
a dad in the comic, but you might not read

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.440
that from the visual, I just say like "older
man" or something.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:03.160
And so, I try to make it so the individuals,
as much as possible, will just react to the

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.550
joke and not anything I'm not gathering.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.550
Because it is scary.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.149
And then I have ones where I'm like, "This
is gold.

00:13:09.149 --> 00:13:10.149
This is solid gold."

00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:12.920
And someone else is like, "C plus."

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.190
And I also, you can, after you work with someone
for a while, you can learn to find their blind

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.070
spots and their inverse blind spots.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.890
I don't have a good word for it.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.550
But like, my wife will always laugh at biology
jokes no matter how crappy it is.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.200
And like, I have a friend who is really into
Gundam.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.630
He'll laugh at any giant robot jokes.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.120
So, I don't trust him much.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.120
[laughter]

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.970
And so, I don't know if anyone's done this,
but I wanna set up a really cool audience

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.410
feedback mechanism this way.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:51.780
So, the way it's done now is you basically
hire a bunch of people--like, you wanna see

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.780
if they like a movie.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.400
You go to your local area.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.260
Hire 200 people and get them to rate it.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.480
I think it would be a much better system if
you just set up a market and you said, "This

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.280
person is usually right about this type of
movie.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.590
This person is usually right about this type.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.930
And when this person says this type of movie
is bad, it's actually good."

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.351
And you can run much smarter math on it.

00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:12.920
And I've been half-tempted to do it on my
own little--.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.160
I think I have seven people right now.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.820
I could probably do this and then I backed
away from it.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.460
I was like, "This is gonna get too obsessive
and I'm not gonna be writing my own comic

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.460
anymore."

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.460
[laughter]

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.460
But someone at some point, if they haven't
already, is gonna go that.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.470
I think it would be a really cool project.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.940
But yeah, you have to learn to know what kind
of feedback you're getting from individuals

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.940
'cause people have really big blind spots
sometimes.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:40.630
&gt;&gt;MALE #10: That could also be useful data
for your readers, though, if they see, "Oh,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.260
if this is one that she liked, then--

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.330
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: That's a good point--

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.500
&gt;&gt;MALE #10: "I'll read these and skip the
ones that--."

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.500
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah, kind of the archive
bits.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.700
That's not a bad idea.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.750
We're actually working on like, a tag system,
but I don't know.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:15:01.730
It scares me, the idea that I could set something
like, just tag all the science comics and

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.680
then someone would come through and they would
only read the science comics.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.680
'Cause I like to try--.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.830
Part of the fun of it is exposing people to
new stuff they'd never seen and I worry that

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:13.300
I would be allowing people too much freedom.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.300
[laughter]

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.570
&gt;&gt;MALE #10: That's just how you get them hooked.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:18.570
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.570
That might be true.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.680
We've actually talked about it.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.520
One of the other cool things from a business
standpoint is you could sell them the magazines,

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520
that sort of thing.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.130
You do jokes only about dogs.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.680
I have like, four comics about dogs.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.830
But not yet.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.830
Yeah?

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.610
&gt;&gt;MALE #11: Can you tell about your creative
process a little bit?

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.610
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.170
&gt;&gt;MALE #11: Do you just sit in a room and
think of hilarious stuff?

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.170
[laughter]

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.970
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I wish.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.460
It's not too far from it.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.150
What I do is--.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.730
I was actually just talking to Alexis about
this at the wedding the other day.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.280
She had some questions.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.350
And what my philosophy about doing creative
work is this.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.490
I think most people think the way you do creative
work is that you just sit down and try to

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.490
be creative, right?

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.490
I think it really just doesn't work.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.490
That's not the way your brain is set up.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.220
Your brain is set up to formulate lots of
ideas, different combinations, and then, a

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.560
really good creator is someone who is A, good
at coming up with lots of ideas and then B,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.870
editing and shaping those.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.290
And taking the bad ones from the good ones.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:27.120
And so, it might seem like a small distinction,
but I think which way you believe on that

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.440
question affects the way you handle your workload.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.870
So, if you believe that just being creative
is just a thing you do, you would probably

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.860
just try to do that a lot.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.764
You would sit down and be like, "It's creative
time."

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:39.980
And I think it's really ineffective.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.880
And that's why we have these terms like "writer's
block" that I'm convinced is just a made-up

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.530
term for not doing your homework.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.230
And when I say that, it really pisses people
off.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.230
[laughter]

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:56.520
So, if you believe that your job is to synthesize
ideas that you already have, or come up with

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.850
new combinations, then what you should do
with your time is not trying to write.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.250
It should be trying to intake as much information
as possible.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.740
So, on a given day for me, I spend at least,
say, ten hours learning various, different

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.740
stuff.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.919
And I, for example, I read books that I find
boring because it's new information.

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:16.720
Most people don't because they don't need
to, you know what I mean?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.720
They read stuff they find exciting.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.730
So, I read in areas I'm not interested in
and I'll read older books and I try to read

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.120
stuff other people aren't reading and try
to read a lot of variety.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:31.279
Like you were saying, I do these calculus
and physics blogs, but I also read "literature"

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:32.279
and philosophy and history and pretty much,
I think, literally everything.

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:33.509
There aren't too many subjects I won't do,
like cookbooks or fashion or something.

00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:47.009
But pretty much anything that would make me
look snooty at a party I will read.

00:17:47.009 --> 00:17:51.299
And so, I think really, what I would say is
I think the creative process is really more

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:53.990
about making yourself more interesting, having
more of a perspective.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:59.940
You shouldn't try to just cultivate being
good at "creativity" because it's not a real

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.940
thing.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.769
It would be a better use of your time--.

00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:07.610
I would even say, I think the way to say this
is the equation for doing good work is not

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:08.940
a simple linear equation.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.600
You will get more good work done if you spend,
say, 15 hours in your day reading and then

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.649
one hour writing than you will spending 16
hours a day writing because you won't have

00:18:17.649 --> 00:18:23.850
all those ideas you need to do good work.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:24.850
Yeah.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.650
&gt;&gt;MALE #12: So, at what point of the idea
generation process do you say, "This is an

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.840
SMBC idea" versus "This is a blog post" versus--?

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Right.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840
Right.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.700
I would say all the projects I work on right
now are different enough that the mindset

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.700
is different.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.080
I would say I do believe most of your time
should be spent reading, but when I do creative

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.970
work, usually I sit down and do a particular
task . So, with SMBC though, you're still

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.100
parsing lots of ideas, right?

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.129
So, with SMBC, it would be just trying to
come up with really anything, which is the

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.350
good and bad of it.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:59.110
Whereas like, if I'm writing script for something--I
have a couple other projects I'm working on

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.110
that are long.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.510
For one, a Choose Your Own Adventure for Breadpig.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.780
And so that's a different process.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.130
That's more about being clever.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.725
And that's a little, in a sense, it's harder
to train.

00:19:12.725 --> 00:19:13.725
That takes a little more time, I guess.

00:19:13.725 --> 00:19:14.725
I don't know.

00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:22.600
I try to come up with a little word play sort
of things instead of just writing paragraphs.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.600
So, yeah.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.600
I don't have a lot of--.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600
It's not as if I come up with something and
then I'm like, "Where does this fit?"

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.600
It's usually a little more circumscribed.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600
. Yeah.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.600
&gt;&gt;MALE #13: Have you ever heard from Sarah
Silverman or her camp?

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: No.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.600
She stole my joke.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.600
You're the only one in the room who knows
what I'm talking about.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.600
[laughter]

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600
I, she didn't actually steal my joke.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.791
I did a joke maybe five years ago-- I can't
believe it's been a long time--about--.

00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:45.320
The nice thing about comics is I can hide
behind the paper and not have to tell offensive

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.360
jokes in person.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.740
But here it goes.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:55.639
The joke was that you can solve AIDS in Africa
by dropping Playstations on Africa.

00:19:55.639 --> 00:20:02.080
And then it was weird 'cause I had done this
joke and like, weeks later, Sarah Silverman

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.789
was at some--.

00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:08.519
She'd done some sort of gaming award show
and she was doing stand-up comedy.

00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:13.570
And I think it was apparently not liked well
because she made fun of video game players.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:18.110
But she did basically the exact same joke,
like, "We'll solve the crisis in Africa by

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.360
giving them video games."

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.629
And so, I did this fake media of me demanding
that she remove the joke immediately because

00:20:25.629 --> 00:20:28.869
I'm the only one who's ever made an AIDS joke.

00:20:28.869 --> 00:20:29.869
[laughter]

00:20:29.869 --> 00:20:32.420
And she never called me back.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.540
So, no.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.540
Nothing.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.999
But I did make a fake mean Sarah Silverman
dating video like with clips of her and clips

00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:39.999
of me.

00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:40.999
It was really creepy.

00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:41.999
[laughter]

00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:42.999
So, we've basically talked about it.

00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:43.999
[laughter]

00:20:43.999 --> 00:20:44.999
Yeah?

00:20:44.999 --> 00:20:45.999
&gt;&gt;MALE #14: Can you give us like, the origin
story of SMBC?

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:46.999
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah.

00:20:46.999 --> 00:21:01.029
I didn't think I called it SMBC since about
1998 when I was like, 16.

00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:03.580
But it was a really different thing.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:11.529
If you click the archive button on the website,
you can actually see some of the really like,

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:21.120
from maybe 2000, 2001--the older stuff I did,
which was a very clichÃ© like, three panel,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.950
friends hanging out sort of comic.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:39.770
It was less clichÃ© back then than it is now,
but it was pretty clichÃ© then.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:50.470
And I think I was doing it just as a joke.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:22:00.100
Like, I was really just making fun of friends,
which is why I only had friends before I knew

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.840
anything about web comics.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:12.999
And at some point in college, I figured I
could maybe do this for a living.

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:18.200
So, I started looking into it a little harder.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:30.820
And I switched it doing single panels 'cause
I--maybe other people write differently from

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:56.179
what I do, but the nice thing about writing
for characters is you just see what they do,

00:22:56.179 --> 00:23:20.540
whereas coming up with 
a whole glove joke, you have to start from

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.749
the beginning.

00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:33.029
But I was finding that I could come up with
jokes that I wanted to do and no characters

00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:34.379
could reasonably say them.

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:49.429
And so, I basically had a cast of 20 main
characters and it was just not cool.

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:53.330
And so, I switched to doing single panels.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:24:02.679
And it was a good lesson 'cause I only had
like, two or three hundred readers then.

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:12.539
And I still got complaints from switching
formats, like it was the end of my "career"

00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:15.239
that I would switch formats.

00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:22.750
And it's stupid because I do meet people who
have--, they're doing web comics and they

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:28.880
have just like a few readers and they want
to switch to something better and they won't

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.840
do it 'cause they don't want to disappoint
the couple people reading.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:37.269
And it's just a mistake to not allow yourself
that leeway.

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:43.519
But then, I actually quit again in college
and I was working a terrible, horrible job

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:45.539
for talent agents in Hollywood.

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:47.559
It was really horrible [chuckles].

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:52.059
And I remember, very specifically, I'd just
shown them my comic and--finally, after working

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:54.549
there for six months--and I had the opportunity.

00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:59.950
And I heard one of my bosses, who I don't
want to say was an idiot, but once asked me--.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.139
She called me in her room and says, "What
does this word punny--?

00:25:03.139 --> 00:25:04.869
What does punny mean?"

00:25:04.869 --> 00:25:05.869
P-U-N-Y.

00:25:05.869 --> 00:25:06.869
[laughter]

00:25:06.869 --> 00:25:15.280
And so, she calls me to her office to talk
about the comics and she said to me, "The

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:23.230
problem with your generation [laughter] is
that you're always starting things and never

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.850
finishing them.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:36.190
And imagine where you would be if you had
done this for five years."

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.379
And I instantly thought, "I would be anywhere
else."

00:25:40.379 --> 00:25:41.379
[laughter]

00:25:41.379 --> 00:25:42.789
And that sounded great.

00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:50.299
And so, as I remember--I might be mythologizing
this a little--I think that night I actually

00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:53.289
started doing daily updates again.

00:25:53.289 --> 00:25:56.879
And I basically kept that going.

00:25:56.879 --> 00:26:02.570
I missed a few here and there, but pretty
much, yeah.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:08.240
&gt;&gt;MALE #15: Do you keep a queue like, ahead
of time?

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.889
Like how many comics do you keep queued up?

00:26:11.889 --> 00:26:16.659
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I'm queued up through
tomorrow night when I fly home.

00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:17.659
[laughter]

00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:18.659
I normally don't.

00:26:18.659 --> 00:26:20.970
I occasionally get a little ahead, but I actually--.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:26.909
The traditional cartoon, some of them are
ahead by like, a year, which it's cool that

00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:34.059
they do that in the newspapers and need them
to do it, but I just feel like that's a good

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:38.580
way to not be in tune with what's going on.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.179
I mean, I don't do topical jokes.

00:26:42.179 --> 00:26:47.139
I feel like you still need to be living in
your own time.

00:26:47.139 --> 00:26:53.070
I mean, if you're doing Ziggy, I guess it
just doesn't matter.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.070
I think Ziggy is still running.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.070
I shouldn't say that.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.070
[laughter]

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.070
If you're doing Peanuts--

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.259
&gt;&gt;MALE #16: Yeah, how do you tell--

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:00.450
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.629
But so, I--.

00:27:01.629 --> 00:27:08.539
Maybe I'm just excusing my own behavior, but
I don't think I would ever want to be more

00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:10.340
than, say, a week ahead.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:16.210
I'm actually a week ahead this week because
of, I'm doing stuff on the East Coast.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:20.210
But I do keep a writing buffer.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.590
But the actual art, not as much.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:29.720
And partially, that's because, as you know,
I'm doing a lot of projects at once.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.059
But also, I actually usually get uncomfortable.

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:42.399
A few times, I've been a week ahead and I
just feel weird.

00:27:42.399 --> 00:27:58.169
I feel like I'm not in touch with what I'm
doing with the audience.

00:27:58.169 --> 00:28:11.840
I think most web cartoons, I think probably
because of that phenomenon or not--I hit on

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.419
that word--there's no reason we should be
less ahead than the print people other than

00:28:17.419 --> 00:28:19.110
they're obligated to for legal reasons.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.210
So, basically I don't.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.210
Yeah.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:28.750
&gt;&gt;MALE #17: So, are there any other, what
other web comic types do you particularly

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.880
say, admire or despise?

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880
[laughter]

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.020
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Admire.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.759
There are comics that are really good.

00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:41.769
The one's I like to read, though, are one's
I feel I can learn something from.

00:28:41.769 --> 00:28:47.350
So like, one I really like actually--.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:52.840
Have you ever read Buttersafe?

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:59.419
You guys know about that one?

00:28:59.419 --> 00:29:09.379
It's not super popular, but I learn a lot
from it.

00:29:09.379 --> 00:29:17.609
And I remember I was talking to Randy from
"XKCD" about this.

00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:25.830
He was like, "Oh, Buttersafe, because he's
always doing big ideas."

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:30.320
And that's what's good about it.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:37.440
The problem with doing big ideas and being
more artsy is that nine times out of ten,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.169
it's not as fun to read.

00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:43.399
It's just weird or obscure, whatever it is.

00:29:43.399 --> 00:29:49.749
But it's nice because now that he does something
that really nobody else could do, or they

00:29:49.749 --> 00:29:55.799
do--it's two guys--and so that's an example
of something where, in terms of day to day

00:29:55.799 --> 00:30:02.100
reading, it's not my favorite, but I feel
like I'm picking up ideas from it.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:09.659
I feel a little that way about "XKCD" , or
at least he paved the way for nerdy comedy

00:30:09.659 --> 00:30:10.929
to go mainstream.

00:30:10.929 --> 00:30:16.610
And I've read some more obscure comics like
there was a comic first starting called "The

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.669
Parking Lot is Full."

00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:19.669
It's--.

00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:20.720
You read it?

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.720
OK.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.720
Yeah.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.379
I think it's been defunct since 2002 or something.

00:30:26.379 --> 00:30:27.919
It's been ages.

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:34.250
But it's almost hard to appreciate now because
web comics have really developed since those

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.559
days, but it was so abrasive for a comic.

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:41.889
It would like, it would be single panels and
the captions would yell at you, the reader.

00:30:41.889 --> 00:30:43.770
[audience chuckles] It was weird stuff.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:49.690
Even a comic like the "Far Side," which broke
down a lot of barriers, it's still very traditional

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.860
and presents a situation and then elaborates
on it a little.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.140
That's a traditional caption comic.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:05.989
And these were really interesting 'cause they
would maybe do something else completely differently

00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:15.269
or digress from the topic or would have captions
like this long.

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:22.919
And it's kinda the same deal, maybe you feel
the same way.

00:31:22.919 --> 00:31:37.220
"The Parking Lot is Full" on a day to day
basis maybe wasn't solid gold, but was really

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.870
doing new, interesting stuff.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:45.529
And so, that's the kind of comic I like.

00:31:45.529 --> 00:32:01.739
Like, I have other comics I really love, like
I love a comic called "Amazing Super Powers."

00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:11.950
But he's kinda in the same space as I am,
so I don't feel like we probably couldn't

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.809
learn from each other.

00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:19.419
So, there wouldn't be much creative use for
us to read each otherâ€™s comics.

00:32:19.419 --> 00:32:29.039
And then there's Dale Beran's "A Lesson is
Learned but the Damage is Irreversible."

00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:33.830
That was a really good comic.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:46.029
Sort of the same deal with pushing what you
could do with a comic.

00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:48.340
That's what I liked reading.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.489
But I actually don't read that many comics.

00:32:51.489 --> 00:32:53.229
There are very few that I actually read.

00:32:53.229 --> 00:32:55.909
Do you have a follow-up question?

00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:56.919
OK.

00:32:56.919 --> 00:32:59.389
Do you have a question?

00:32:59.389 --> 00:33:03.749
&gt;&gt;MALE #18: Actually, I had the exact same
question.

00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:04.749
[laughter]

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:13.159
&gt;&gt;MALE #19: What software do you use to do
the drawing and coloring?

00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:22.869
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I use nice, but pretty
much standard card stock paper--regular ream

00:33:22.869 --> 00:33:24.509
of paper.

00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:30.070
And then, I draw in a non-photographic blue
pencil that doesn't scan.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:40.749
And then, I just use a plain, black ink marker
and then I scan into Photoshop and color.

00:33:40.749 --> 00:33:43.169
It's really very simple.

00:33:43.169 --> 00:33:44.389
There's nothing--.

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:57.260
I actually, when people ask me, like other
artists ask me, I hope not to do it my way

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.000
because almost everyone I know has tablets
now.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.600
I just can't do it.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.639
I probably will eventually, but it just feels
weird.

00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:08.720
And the way you have to draw in a tablet--.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.660
Maybe there are tablet masters I haven't met,
but like, when I wanna do a line stroke, I

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.660
draw it.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:24.059
And on the tablet, you have your hand on control
Z all the time, 'cause you have to draw everything

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:25.059
a couple time to get the stroke right.

00:34:25.059 --> 00:34:26.059
It's not for me.

00:34:26.059 --> 00:34:27.059
Anyone?

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:28.059
I brought some pictures.

00:34:28.059 --> 00:34:29.059
[laughter]

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:33.179
&gt;&gt;MALE #20: It seems that the web comic industry
is pretty well-connected in terms of authors

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.179
knowing each other.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.179
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Oh, yeah.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:41.129
&gt;&gt;MALE #20: Can you talk a little bit about
that and what that's like?

00:34:41.129 --> 00:34:43.520
&gt;&gt;FEMALE#2: Tell us about your weekend.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.109
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:50.940
I was actually at a wedding and Dinosaur Comics
was there, and Wondermark was there, and TopatoCo

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.940
was there.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.060
Questionable Content was there.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.919
&gt;&gt;MALE #20: So, you were in the happy battle.

00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:56.919
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yes.

00:34:56.919 --> 00:34:58.359
It was a beautiful place.

00:34:58.359 --> 00:35:03.329
We actually have a lot of private channels--the
web comic artists do.

00:35:03.329 --> 00:35:06.790
I was talking to Kristine about this.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:14.349
If you've been reading web comics for a long
time, you probably remember up to something

00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:19.849
like 2007, there was a lot more public fighting
and drama between web cartoonists.

00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:21.340
Now, there's not much.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:25.289
And the reason is 'cause it happens in private.

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:26.289
[laughter]

00:35:26.289 --> 00:35:27.309
But it's cool.

00:35:27.309 --> 00:35:30.930
This will probably go away over the next,
say, generation.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:37.130
But right now is a really cool time because
everyone who is doing web comics professionally

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.819
really know pretty much everyone else because
we all go to the same conventions.

00:35:40.819 --> 00:35:42.559
We share the same data 'cause we have to run--.

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:44.610
Everyone has a slightly different business
model, but it's essentially the same.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:48.400
So it's like if you wanna, like the ad setup
I have right now.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.900
I got it from Chris Hallbeck, who does a comic
called "The Book of Biff."

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.930
And it's really helpful in having that shared
pooled knowledge.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.990
For me, just having his advice on that ad
setup has, over time, doubled my income--just

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.990
doing it properly.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.289
And so, yeah.

00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:09.039
There's just a lot of talk.

00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:10.599
And pretty much everyone knows each other.

00:36:10.599 --> 00:36:12.460
And what's really nice is because everyone
has bootstrapped their way up to their position--there's

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.230
no other way to do it, I guess--and so everyone
essentially is a small business owner.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.670
So, there's not a lot of BS with people.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:26.450
And it's also easier to be friends when you
don't need each other.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:34.089
Everyone's an idol in web comics.

00:36:34.089 --> 00:36:39.039
And so, it's usually very chummy at conventions.

00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:43.080
There are a few crazy people, but I won't
say.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080
[laughter]

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:49.099
&gt;&gt;MALE #21: How much time do you have to spend
on the business side of things, like with

00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:50.099
the ads?

00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:51.460
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: It's not too bad.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:56.920
Just this year, I was getting to where I was
like, having physiological symptoms from stress

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.920
and not sleeping this year.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:05.730
And so, I finally gave in and I have two people
who help me out now.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:13.289
So, in terms of store stuff and fulfillment,
I have a person who handles all the shipping,

00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:14.289
order-taking.

00:37:14.289 --> 00:37:15.740
I don't even want to look at it anymore.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:24.980
And I have a guy who is more local to me and
he helps out with simple Photoshop jobs and

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.650
just little stuff--just random things.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:33.559
And so, at this point it's--I'm gonna tell
you--I at least get to do something like 80

00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:35.190
to 90 percent nonbusiness.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:42.119
And there's stuff that's like when you count
like designing stuff in a book or picking

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:43.770
comics, it's a little--.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.730
Some of it's iffy.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:55.130
But the really not fun stuff, like mailing
and handling my ad chain, I don't really touch

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.930
anymore, which is amazing.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.569
But I really feel like I think this year has
been much better.

00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:02.940
I have much more pride in my work this year.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.460
And I think, in large part, it's because I've
had people taking slack.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:11.390
I haven't had to just do something at the
last minute because I didn't want to.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.390
And so, yeah.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.390
That's been really cool.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:35.990
I think the future of web comics is going
to be that--and this is already forming--there

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:45.039
will be something like the old agency system,
like the big literary agency system in place

00:38:45.039 --> 00:38:46.039
now.

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:48.470
It'll take care of this stuff for you.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:55.609
It hasn't really existed yet, but Breadpig
is in that space and they're the best edit.

00:38:55.609 --> 00:39:04.200
And TopatoCo is in that space and Blind Ferret
is in that space now.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:14.010
And my hope is that essentially what will
happen is that the agency system will get,

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:21.200
will basically become what it was originally,
just not run by assholes, [chuckles] which

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.869
really would make a difference.

00:39:23.869 --> 00:39:33.540
What I mean by that, to be specific, the difference
between me being with a traditional company

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:44.180
and me being with Breadpig in terms of what
my take is and how much control I have is

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.180
night and day.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:58.980
So, if I were to say, be with Random House
or something, I would have to--.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:10.230
They would be able to tell me to change my
cover if they wanted to.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.230
They could edit content.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:23.450
They could make demands about what had to
go in.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:28.960
And they would give, just money-wise, a much
smaller cut.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:36.369
I think it's not quite an order of magnitude,
but it's in that ball park.

00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:43.049
I've done traditional publishing and I probably
will never do it again because what ends up

00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:50.130
happening is the only way you can make a living
out of it is if you sell something like a

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.619
hundred thousand copies.

00:40:51.619 --> 00:40:54.520
And most people aren't gonna do that.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:01.260
Whereas, I know people who have audiences,
like under ten thousand people, who make a

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.760
living at it because the cut is good enough.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.670
And they can handle their own market.

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:14.310
And so, I hope the old publishing universe
is turning this way.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:19.750
In my little bubble, everything is going this
way.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:27.349
In the web comics world it definitely is,
but I hope that publishing in general--book

00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:31.349
publishing, and traditional comic book publishing--will
go that way.

00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:32.349
Yeah.

00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:38.460
&gt;&gt;MALE #22: [clears throat] How does that
tie in with how "Machine of Death" went out?

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.329
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Oh, "Machine of Death."

00:41:40.329 --> 00:41:41.900
That was awesome.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.263
If you guys don't know, "Machine of Death"--I
wasn't involved in this, just to be clear--.

00:41:45.263 --> 00:41:47.210
No, I don't involved in that project.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:48.380
That was Malki.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.050
I'm happy to talk about it.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.320
I know what happened.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:42:00.200
Malki and Ryan North, Dinosaur Comics and
Wondermark, they did a very simple idea for

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.200
a project.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.160
And it's interesting if you think about it
in comparison to what a publishing house basically

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.160
does.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.080
They were doing the same thing.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.800
They said, "We need a bunch of short stories
and art work.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:26.029
We're gonna compile it together and the only
thing we're gonna do is that it has every

00:42:26.029 --> 00:42:40.309
story has to have this theme of a machine
that--what was it?--it knows when you're going

00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:43.309
to die."

00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:50.830
&gt;&gt;MALE #22: It tells you how you're gonna
die.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:52.430
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: It tells you how you're
gonna die, that's right.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:53.430
And so, every short story could be anything.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.090
It just had to have this theme in it.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:43:00.910
And so, they actually put together this really
good book of stories.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:07.010
And what was really cool was I'd never seen
this done and we actually ended up doing this

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.520
with Captain Stupendous, a book I released,
where you--if you're selling it through Amazon.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.450
Say you're selling it from Amazon.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:17.039
You tell everyone, "Don't buy until the day
I tell you."

00:43:17.039 --> 00:43:18.940
And then you can run up the numbers, exactly.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:24.480
So, they actually hit number one for one day,
which was extra cool 'cause they displaced

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.210
Glenn Beck for one day.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.210
[laughter]

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:33.000
And Glenn Beck--this is true--actually went
on TV and said, "There's this book called

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.089
'Machine of Death' and it's the liberal culture
of death at work."

00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:39.089
[laughter]

00:43:39.089 --> 00:43:43.589
And which was, of course, stupid 'cause they
sold so many books after that.

00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:47.430
Everyone's like, "We pissed off Glenn Beck?

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.079
This is great."

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:50.170
And yeah.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:56.730
That was a really good example of how just
by having a good relationship with your audience,

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.060
like--think about it this way.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:03.760
If you were doing Batman, you might not be
able to pull that off because Ryan North can

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.930
directly talk to 50 thousand people and Malki
can, too.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:13.600
And so, if you can just mobilize ten thousand
people to do the same thing at the same time,

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.820
you can get really cool results.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.869
Whereas, something like Batman doesn't have
that personal relationship.

00:44:19.869 --> 00:44:24.460
You read it 'cause you wanna know what Batman's
up to.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.289
You don't care--.

00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:33.200
You probably care who the author is, but not
in the same way you do with Dinosaur Comics,

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.720
where you feel like you know the guy.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:48.100
And that's one of the cool things that web
comics can do that I think a lot of the older

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:52.970
comics are now clumsily trying to get into
that universe.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:45:01.390
But I actually hope they succeed 'cause it
makes everything more fun when you can interact

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:02.820
with all these people.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:09.600
&gt;&gt;MALE #23: So, how do you decide what fraction
of your time to spend on all of your different

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.600
projects?

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.600
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.260
It's actually like I was saying earlier.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.400
The equation isn't simple in the sense that--.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.390
You can fallow the fields, so to speak.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:24.670
So, the part of your brain that does calculus
is not the part of your brain writes dirty

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:25.670
jokes.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:35.579
And so for me, what I try to do is I'll work
on something until I'm about tired of it,

00:45:35.579 --> 00:45:37.061
unless I'm on a deadline.

00:45:37.061 --> 00:45:41.930
Then, I have to make things work.

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:47.220
But I'll work on calculus until I just can't
take it anymore.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:54.450
And it's actually good 'cause calculus, it's
very logical, it's very rigorous, it's very

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:55.910
step by step.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:58.829
Whereas doing comics is the opposite.

00:45:58.829 --> 00:46:08.080
So, what I've done when I'm being good, is
I actually have a daily schedule that says

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:24.190
"from 9 to 11 you will do math" and then "from
11 to 11:30 try to write three jokes" and

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:28.670
then "from 11:30 to 12:30" I don't know.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:31.020
I can float my schedule.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.730
But I stole the idea from Ben Franklin.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.329
It was in his autobiography.

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:39.329
[laughter]

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:41.480
He had this book.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.270
He was like, "I'm too lazy.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.359
I have to do more stuff."

00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:49.869
So, he scheduled his whole life.

00:46:49.869 --> 00:46:55.779
You don't realize how much time you're spending
poking around the internet until you schedule

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:56.779
your life.

00:46:56.779 --> 00:47:03.510
And it's amazing what you can get done in
16 hours if you are not doing anything else.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.990
It's also, because it's fun, it's not so bad.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.990
I do work on--.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.119
It's also good 'cause my wife is also crazy
about her work, so there's no awkwardness

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:13.440
or no "why don't we do out more often?"

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.750
It's usually by the time we go out, we both
want it.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:19.760
And so, that's been realized.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:31.210
I honestly don't know what I would do if I
were with someone who wanted me to take her

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:32.670
out on weekends.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:33.670
[laughter]

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:34.670
But, yeah.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:39.980
More often than not, I want to go out before
she does.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.980
Yeah?

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:45.339
&gt;&gt;MALE #24: Who are the people who do SMBC
Theater?

00:47:45.339 --> 00:47:50.690
Are they just your friends, or how did you
meet them?

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:56.460
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: So, James, the other guy
who writes, I've known him since high school.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:00.020
He's actually one of the characters in my
old comic strip.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.130
And we, for ages, wanted to do video projects.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:08.480
And then, it just happened that there was
a nice situation where I had built up a little

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:15.529
audience and had a tiny amount of disposable
income that I could put to work some new projects.

00:48:15.529 --> 00:48:17.880
And then, he had just moved to LA.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.119
He's a graduate of the Carnegie Mellon screen-writing
program, which meant he had this network of

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:23.579
people for us to abuse.

00:48:23.579 --> 00:48:25.559
[audience chuckles] And so, it was cool.

00:48:25.559 --> 00:48:31.559
So, I could finance this and do the publicity
and, of course, help with the writing.

00:48:31.559 --> 00:48:38.980
And then he was able to bring almost all of
our actors are alumni of that program.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:45.960
Which is extra nice because they bring more
people 'cause they have this just crazy network

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.960
of people.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.150
So, it was very rare that we were wanting
for actors or actresses once we got going,

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:51.940
which is really cool since we only pay a few
people.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:49:00.410
We only pay people who are doing technical
work, like work you just cannot get away with

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:01.430
not paying.

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:07.539
But most actors are willing to work for free
on publicity stuff.

00:49:07.539 --> 00:49:14.670
So, we help them with their reels when they
want to put that together.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.510
And I do believe in paying people, but we
weren't making a profit.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:20.810
So, you suit your budget to the company, if
that makes sense.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:24.839
But yeah, most of the people worked through
that network of people.

00:49:24.839 --> 00:49:30.589
We had a few people we just found through
a friend of a friend of a friend.

00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:32.880
But mostly it's graduate students.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.780
I love them.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.119
Yeah?

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:49.170
&gt;&gt;MALE #25: Are you ever worried you're getting
typecast?

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:50.170
You and James?

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:51.170
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Special strikes.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:52.170
&gt;&gt;MALE #26: You play Jesus a lot.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.170
[laughter]

00:49:53.170 --> 00:50:01.859
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I was really sad when
I knew I didn't have long hair, so I had to

00:50:01.859 --> 00:50:02.859
get a wig.

00:50:02.859 --> 00:50:03.859
It was embarrassing.

00:50:03.859 --> 00:50:06.030
&gt;&gt;MALE #28: You have long hair, now.

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:07.140
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I know.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.140
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.809
We are actually moving out of this new project
now where we're doing--.

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:20.420
We have a bunch of SMBC Theaters still in
the queue that we're still editing together

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.420
to put out.

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.690
But I'm actually, I don't love acting.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:31.480
I enjoy it while I'm there, but comics are
awesome because on a good day it's in the

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.200
morning I have a good idea.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:41.779
That evening I go home and I draw it.

00:50:41.779 --> 00:50:47.530
It's this whole little universe thing idea
that I show to people.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:50.380
And it probably takes me--.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:51:08.519
Even that crazy one, like the 57-panel one
that was like eight hours.

00:51:08.519 --> 00:51:12.510
It was a long time, but it wasn't crazy.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:16.200
Whereas, acting in a video is an entire day
of your life.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.450
And that doesn't count the writing or anything.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:21.910
And then, you won't see project over for a
month and it's just the input/output ratio--it's

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:22.910
not great.

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:26.190
And so, I'm trying to get more into the backseat
of everything, help with the writing, make

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:27.190
creative choices, but not much on screen stuff.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:30.579
I also, it got to where I was living in college
towns 'cause I followed my wife's research.

00:51:30.579 --> 00:51:32.779
And it got to where I couldn't walk around
campus 'cause people know what I look like.

00:51:32.779 --> 00:51:33.779
[laughter]

00:51:33.779 --> 00:51:37.320
And I remember we were in Davis, California
and saw a guy wearing like, a scarf and a

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.760
hat in the summer.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.840
That was me.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.840
[laughter]

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.750
I don't have a problem meeting people, it's
just I was going to get work done and I get

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:45.750
stopped every 20 minutes to talk to someone.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:46.750
It got pretty awkward after a while.

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:47.750
And it throws off your conversation to have
someone you don't know yell your name all

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.750
of a sudden.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:49.750
But it's cool, too.

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:50.750
So once--this is cool--Kelly and I were walking
home, just from the library.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.030
A guy walks by, just does not break his gait,
just keeps walking.

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.030
As he goes, he shouts, "You rock."

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.030
[laughter]

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:55.030
And that was OK.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:56.030
If every interaction was like that, I could
do it.

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:57.280
But yeah, I'm not worried about typecasting
'cause I don't wanna be an actor.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.589
Perhaps James should worry, he definitely
wants to--, but I mean, we're hoping to be

00:51:58.589 --> 00:51:59.589
in a position where we control the productions.

00:51:59.589 --> 00:52:02.660
So, if he felt he was typecast, he could write
himself a new character who was dashing and

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.660
heroic.

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.660
[laughter]

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.010
&gt;&gt;MALE #29: So, what's the most interesting,
or the most famous person you've interacted

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.010
with via somebody randomly knowing you're
a web comic?

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:08.010
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I've had two really awesome
interactions.

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:09.010
The best one I ever had was--.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:10.010
Just, I mean, I didn't get to meet him, but
I did this comic once that was about time

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:11.010
travel.

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:14.760
The joke was about a guy who wants meet other
time travelers, so he has the best party ever

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.819
and then everyone comes at the same time.

00:52:15.819 --> 00:52:18.250
So, there's this singularity that kills everyone
who would ever want to time travel.

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:19.250
And that's why time travel is impossible.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:20.250
[laughter]

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:28.660
And so, just whenever I have a scientist character
and it makes sense to, I will just pick a

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:34.260
scientist I actually really like and put them
in the character.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:37.970
So, I had Kip Thorne, who many of you know
is a famous physicist.

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:44.529
He has his name on an equation or a theory
with Stephen Hawking, so he did all right

00:52:44.529 --> 00:52:45.529
for himself.

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:46.529
[laughter]

00:52:46.529 --> 00:52:48.470
And he's still at Caltech.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:49.470
He still works.

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:51.254
And I think he's probably in his 70s or 80s.

00:52:51.254 --> 00:52:52.254
So, I had done this comic and just didn't
think anything of it 'cause when I do younger

00:52:52.254 --> 00:52:53.254
people, I expect maybe they'll get in touch
with me 'cause they might hear about it.

00:52:53.254 --> 00:52:54.590
But Kip Thorne doesn't need to care about
comics.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.590
Actually, no one needs to care about comics.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.590
But then I found out it was his 70th or 80th
birthday.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:57.590
Someone had printed this up and they had put
it out for him.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:58.590
It was like, at Kip Thorne's birthday party.

00:52:58.590 --> 00:52:59.590
It was the coolest thing ever.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:00.590
And then he sent me a letter.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:02.029
It wasn't like a personal "I love you."

00:53:02.029 --> 00:53:04.400
That would've been cool . But it was just
like, "I really appreciated your comic.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.400
Signed, Kip Thorne."

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.400
And I was like, "This I just don't deserve.

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.400
This is ludicrous."

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.400
That was really amazing.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.400
It was especially good 'cause it was--.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.400
My dad graduated with his PhD from Caltech
and so I can be like, "Guess who I got a letter

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.400
from.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.400
I wonder if you knew him."

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.400
I triangulated between my dad and Kip Thorne
to see if they'd ever passed each other in

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.400
the hallways and we couldn't figure out that
he had, sadly.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.400
But it's almost certain they did, which was
just kinda neat.

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.400
The other cool thing was I was at Comic Con--this
was like two years ago--and I was talking

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400
to Phil Plait.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.400
Maybe you know he does the Bad Astronomy blog
and we're like lame internet buddies now.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.400
That's really precious.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400
I thought I should tell this.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.400
He has a filthy sense of humor in person.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.400
Just disgusting.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.400
You can't do it publicly, so I get all of
it.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.400
[laughter]

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.400
Don't tell him I said that.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.400
But he's really cool.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.400
And he, as you know, is really into a lot
media stuff.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.400
And so, he actually came by my booth and we
just were chit chatting.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.400
I think it was the first time we met in person.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400
And just at the exact same moment, Will Wheaton
came up to be like, "I love your comics."

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.400
I was like, "This is the greatest."

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400
[laughter]

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.400
And there's actually a photo of me and Will
Wheaton and Phil Plait making faces at a camera.

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.400
And then there's a guy who photo bombed it,
which is really weird.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.400
Especially 'cause Phil was actively trying
to photo bomb his own photo and this guy totally

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.400
one-upped him.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.400
[laughter]

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.400
But that was really cool just from a nerd
standpoint.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.400
Like, the Kip Thorne thing was actually gratifying
in a self-actualization sort of way, but Will

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.400
Wheaton and Phil Plait just dorking out was
awesome.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.400
And at Comic Con, no less.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.400
So, yeah.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.400
I'd say those are my two favorite interactions.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.400
I've had like, awkward interactions, but nothing
to be proud of.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.400
&gt;&gt;MALE #30: There's one comic in here, I can't
find it again, which I believe had the old

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.400
Neil deGrasse Tyson and Phil Plait involved.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.400
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Yeah.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.400
I haven't reached Neil deGrasse--.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.400
It's become my way to--.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.400
Like I hear about someone think they're cool.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.400
I can touch base with them by doing the comic.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.400
It's like, everyone like to be drawn.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.400
And I haven't gotten Neil deGrasse Tyson . And
I've done two comics about him.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.400
And he won't get in touch with me.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.400
We should be best friends.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.400
[laughter]

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.400
It's been nice.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.400
I've had times when I--.

00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.400
Well, Kip Thorne is the best example.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.400
I've had other professors I've met just through
the comics and I could be like, "I was having

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.400
trouble with my physics homework and could
you help me with this?"

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.400
[laughter]

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.400
I actually did that once.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.400
A friend of mine, Sean Carroll, he wrote a
book called "From Eternity to Here," and he

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.400
does a blog called Cosmic Variance.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.400
And when I was just first learning physics,
he was a fan of the comic and we--.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.400
Now when I have a problem--.

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.400
I would never ask him like, "Solve this equation
for me."

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.400
'Cause he's a professor at Caltech.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.400
That might be rude.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.400
[laughter]

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.400
But I would be like, "I really can't understand
this concept.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.400
Could you help me with it?"

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.400
He was actually really nice.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.400
He would write paragraphs to me.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.400
It was really cool.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.400
And so, that's the really nice, unexpected
side effects of doing cartoons.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.400
And what's really cool, too, similarly, is
I'm learning something in math and I have

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400
trouble with a definition or a problem or
something, I'll push it on Twitter and I will

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.400
get 18 answers in ten seconds.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.400
It's really amazing.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.400
&gt;&gt;MALE #31: How many of them are correct?

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.400
[laughter]

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.400
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: That is the problem.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.400
What's more interesting is usually it's 90
percent correct.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.400
There are people who are wrong, but what's
really interesting is you will ask a question

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.400
and you will say, "Why is this so?"

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.400
I'll give you an example I did recently.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.400
I was doing these calculus blogs and what's
nice about it is I'm figuring out all the

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.400
things I never actually learned but felt like
I knew.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.400
So, as you probably remember from a long time
ago, inverse trigonometrical functions have

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.400
a restricted domain.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.400
And it's very reasonable to make a restricted
domain 'cause otherwise the math doesn't work.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.400
But you suspect there must be an intuitive
reason why this might be the case.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.400
And so, I went to Twitter and I said, "Can
anyone--."

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.400
Of course, I understood why you restrict the
domain for the math part.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.400
That's the obvious part.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.400
Everyone understands that instantly.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.400
But why should it be in a human intuitive
way?

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.400
And so, I go to Twitter and I'm like, "Hey,
could anyone give me an insight on this?"

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.400
And instantly, it was 40 people saying that
you have to restrict the domain so the math

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.400
works.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.400
And I was like--.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.400
That's kind of boggling 'cause that means
most of the people who are interacting with

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.400
this type of math are not even trying to have
a deeper understanding of it.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.400
But I got a couple of people who gave me other
ways to understand how it would work.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.400
And actually, the best version of it I read--and
there were a couple of them--was if you imagine

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.400
a non-inverse trig function, it also has a
restricted range because of where it can go.

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.400
So, I thought that was the best way to think
of it, is to think of inverting it.

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.400
And so, it was neat to think about how--or
it was maybe scary to think about many people

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.400
who are actually doing this math don't have
I guess what I would call an understanding

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400
of it.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.400
They have a pragmatic understanding of it,
which is probably enough.

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.400
But in terms of insight, they didn't.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.400
But that's what's cool about Twitter.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.400
You can instantly, just by all the other people
telling me I was stupid, I can get some really

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.400
cool insights.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.400
So, yeah.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.400
Yeah?

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.400
&gt;&gt;MALE #32: I know you guys were thinking
of taking SMBC Theater and doing something

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.400
bigger with it.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.400
What's the new format?

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.400
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: What we're doing, James
wrote a sketch.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.400
I was involved with it, mostly doing punch
up, like fixing jokes and rearranging structure

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.400
stuff.

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.400
But we wrote the script.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.400
It's sort of science fictiony, I don't know
how to say it.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.400
It's like a comedy science fiction sitcom.

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.400
I don't want to say sitcom, 'cause that makes
it sound like the jokes are in any way tame,

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.400
but it's written by James, so it's just horrifying.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.400
[laughter]

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.400
And so, that's the main thing we're working
on.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.400
And that's what the bulk of the kick starter
money is going to.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.400
Since we went so over, we're gonna try to
reward the people who took us above and beyond

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400
by working on some additional projects that
we can give them basically for no kick starter

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.400
money.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.400
Well, for their money, but for money they
were intending to give us that we can already

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400
do on a smaller budget.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400
And so, we have a couple of things in the
pipe, but nothing that's developed enough

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400
that's worth talking about.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400
I have a couple other projects.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.400
Like I was saying, I'm working on a Choose
Your Own Adventure.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400
I have a couple book projects I'm doing, which
maybe at some point will get adapted into

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.400
something new production-wise.

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.400
But right now, our big focus is this science
fiction thing.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.400
Pretty fun.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.400
&gt;&gt;MALE #33: Were you the terrible temp agency
Choose Your Own Adventure thing here?

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.400
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: No, I've never done one.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.400
&gt;&gt;MALE #33: OK.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: I'm actually doing--Kristine
and I were talking about this--there's a lot

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.400
of weird math that goes into designing Choose
Your Own Adventure, like the flow-charting.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.400
'Cause I stupidly, 'cause I knew this math,
I completely screwed it up.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400
I started--.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.400
The way I'd been doing it, is I flow chart
in the abstract what a story should be like

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.400
and then I assign stuff to the scenes.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.400
And if you wanna have a bridge, a fork, at
every point, you want to have a choice at

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.400
every point, you have to--.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.400
It's two to the N plus one plus two to the
N plus one.

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.400
So, by the time you've gotten to two to the
tenth, which is to say you've only read ten

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.400
scenes, you have something like 15 hundred
scenes you have to write to make the reader

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.400
able to do that, right?

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.400
So, you have to figure out a reasonable, but
still fun, way to clip.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.400
So, the cool thing is if you clip at a branch,
you clip off two to the N from that point,

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400
right?

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.400
Two to the N plus two to the N plus one and
so on.

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400
And so, it's not as scary if you just learn
how to clip judiciously.

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400
But so, there is, it's an interesting thing
and you can even look at flow charts and you

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400
can tell the genre.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400
I don't mean a genre like whether it's a Western
or not, but there's a genre of whether it's

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400
a what type of story they're telling from
just looking at the flow chart.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.400
So like, the old Choose Your Own Adventure
that you read when you were 12, the little

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.400
simple one that actually says "Choose Your
Own Adventure" on the top, the flowchart,

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.400
you could make it fan out in every direction
'cause there are lots of short stories with

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.400
choices.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.400
In fact, it might even be two to the N plus
two to the N plus one and so on, because you

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.400
really basically have a simple fork at each
point.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.400
And to get to the end might only be ten steps.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.400
And the way you play this is you try to do
all the different routes, right?

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.400
Whereas, if--.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.400
So, if you look at the flow chart, it would
either look like that or it would look like

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.400
a fat triangle, right?

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.400
Whereas, if it was a game book--.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.400
I don't know if you played gaming Choose Your
Own Adventure.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.400
There a slightly different genre where you
can interact with your setting and fight stuff

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.400
and you can pick up things.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400
It's like D and D for one.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.400
[laughter]

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400
I've seen a couple of these games.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.400
There's a very popular one--

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.400
&gt;&gt;MALE #33: If you pick up the sword three
steps ago, then--

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.400
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: It's exactly like that,
yeah.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.400
And what's interesting though is to make that
work, you have to have a much more linear

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400
flow because you're telling one story, right?

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.400
And also, if it's stuff like you have to have
the sword to kill the whatever, you have to

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.400
actually get the sword.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.400
Otherwise, you write 200 pages for no reason.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.400
So, you have to do a much more linear story
and it has to pinch at points, right?

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.400
So that you get the central story line.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.400
So you can actually tell by looking, it'll
have to be linear and there will have to be

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.400
pinching points.

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.400
So, it's really been a cool learning experience
working on Choose Your Own Adventure, oddly

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.400
enough.

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.400
But, which will hopefully be up through Breadpig
in March.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.400
Am I out of time?

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.400
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think we're running out
of time.

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.400
&gt;&gt;Zach Weinersmith: Cool.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.400
Thank you guys.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:27.401
