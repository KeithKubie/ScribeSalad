GREG HARTRELL: Thanks to
everybody for attending.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.320
Today I want to spend
some time reflecting

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.730
on what we're seeing in the
games ecosystem in general

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.480
and observations around what
players are actually doing,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.180
talk about the
archetypes that we see

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.290
and how your game
design can cater

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.630
to those archetypes
and a lot of the tools

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.240
that we have that allow
you to connect with them.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.030
So before I prepped
for this talk,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.630
I spent some time actually
watching people play games.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.074
Turns out great opportunities
to work with many of you,

00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:34.240
but also to get to see
people play all the fun stuff

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.540
that you make.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.230
And some observations
are this-- mobile games,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.140
by and large are still, on
average, a very single player

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.990
experience.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.760
This is a portrait of a
child sitting on a couch

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.650
staring into a screen, very
single player lonely type

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.320
of experience.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
And whatever the little girl
or the little boy is playing,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.630
I promise you they won't
remember a year from now

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.880
what they were playing.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.210
And that's a weird kind
of phenomenon for me

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.430
because when I reflect on the
games of say the '80s and '90s,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.946
I remember playing with friends.

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:08.320
I remember playing
with families.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.360
I remember running into
random people at arcades

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.220
and enjoying a very
social experience.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.680
In the console biz, we created
this kind of gamer archetype,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.180
right?

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.780
It's the guy sitting
in his basement

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.750
staring at a screen with
a controller in his hand.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.700
And we put a headset
on this gamer persona

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.240
and we call that social.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.540
But if you've played on
those types of experiences,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.320
that experience usually involves
some 13-year-old screaming

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.180
something about your mother.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.830
And that's not necessarily
the best experience.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.990
We did a little better.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.610
And then there was briefly
this phase in gaming

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.020
that we called social gaming.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.680
We were all very excited
about the possibilities

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.410
of bringing people together.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.860
I don't know how you
feel, but I never

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.610
had the day where sending
a putty knife to my friends

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.330
was a fun experience.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.759
And it just turns that we see
less of those types of games

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.940
today as a result.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.350
So the reality is that games
are better than this, right?

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.630
Ignore video games for a moment.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.030
We know that games
have the capacity

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.600
to bring people
together in a way

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.110
that other types of mediums and
other types of entertainment

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.890
are not capable of.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.590
And there's evidence around
us when you just take a look.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.650
I quote Greek philosophers
to get immediate street cred,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.040
you should too.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.490
Plato uses this quote
where, you can discover more

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.796
about a person in an hour
of playing a game with them

00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:46.420
then you can in a
year of conversation.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.000
It's a profound statement
there, that perhaps

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.680
unlike any other
kind of medium, you

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.190
can connect with
people in a deeper way

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.250
with games then you can with any
other action you can think of.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.305
A more academic version of
this is by a Dutch historian,

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:06.720
a guy named Johan Huizinga, if
I can pronounce that correctly.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.080
And in this quote-- his thesis
of his seminal book called,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.410
"Homo Ludens," which if you're
a Latin speaker, that loosely

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.590
translates into "man at play."

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.190
And the thesis of the book is
that playing in its own right

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.280
helps develop us
in ways that are

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.920
more fundamental to
the person that we are.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.960
It shapes our personalities,
it shapes the relationships

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.615
that we create.

00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:35.180
It even shapes the way that
communities come together.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.094
And even at a meta level the
way nation states kind of work

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:39.760
with each other.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.190
So all play, because
we're attracted

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.570
to playing with each other,
has meaning in that sense.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.339
So it's a very profound kind
of way of looking at it.

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.630
And what those quote are
really supposed to demonstrate

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.260
is that playing games
together are fundamentally

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.590
a human trait.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.060
We build friendships
around them.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.430
We express ourselves
through them.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.300
We build a sense of
belonging to a community when

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.520
we engage in those
types of experiences.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.290
And if I again use the physical
world as a barometer for this,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.250
there's some obvious
examples here.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.180
I investigated retiring.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.284
It's actually fantastic.

00:04:15.284 --> 00:04:17.200
I think I'm going to
skip the whole work thing

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.670
and skip to retiring.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.950
They're constantly
playing games, right?

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.920
Card games and board
games and anything

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.870
that they can get
their hands on.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.700
They don't just merely
do it to pass away time.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.670
The underlying tone here is it's
really to help groups of people

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.020
meet each other.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.154
And you would otherwise not
know who this other person is

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:42.570
in this retirement community,
but you build a relationship

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.050
through games.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.370
Games also have the capacity
to get large groups of people

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.430
to do really inane things.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.780
This is a picture of-- so in
the Northeast United States,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.500
there's Wall Street in
New York and it turns out

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.510
there's a neighborhood
of people there.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.070
And every year at
Christmas, they

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.952
get together in do this
annual freeze tag event.

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:05.410
And so if you know what the
Northeast is like in the United

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.530
States-- there it gets
actually pretty cold.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.310
But somehow they get
hundreds of people

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.290
out in the community to come
and play freeze tag events

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.310
because it's compelling to come
and play with a lot of people.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.100
This is also a good example
of a physical world.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.390
At MIT, they have this
annual mystery hunt

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.770
they've been running
since the 1980s.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.810
And I think in the
last version, they

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.050
had about 2,000
participants with teams

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.910
ranging from 50 to 150 people.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.860
And the goal of
the mystery hunt is

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.320
you solve all these very
archaic or arcane puzzles,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.350
I should say.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.520
And you eventually
solve all these riddles

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.470
to learn where some hidden
coin is around the campus.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.880
And the reward for doing all
of these crazy puzzles that

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.390
involve mental and maybe
even real gymnastics

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.410
is that you get to write the
puzzles for next year's event.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.930
And you see this graph
here where it just

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.580
shows the intensity of the teams
that are participating in this

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.350
solving puzzles
over a time series.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.250
And it captures the essence of
large groups of people coming

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.480
together to experience a
really fantastic entertainment

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.360
experience.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.270
And so the thesis is
basically, at their best,

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.790
games bring us together.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.210
And when I look back
in video game history

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.530
there's really great examples of
where we did this really well.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.440
There's the arcades of
old that brought together

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.620
random groups of people to play.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.820
The more recent incarnation
is the bar-cade.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.720
Some genius decided that they'll
take their love of arcades

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.470
and their love of
alcohol and combine them

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.960
into one establishment.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.920
And so I'm glad to see that
kind of take a resurgence.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.910
But living room
multiplayer games-- we

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.140
remember games like
"Goldeneye" and a lot

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.780
of the Nintendo products of old.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.310
And of course, MMORPGs,
which in my mind

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.100
are really just
really elaborate chat

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.960
apps that have a game on top
of it while you're playing it,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.465
right?

00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:04.590
And of them have these
similar types of properties.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.200
They bring people
together and it

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.520
keeps people engaged
in very deep way.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.060
So if we accept that mobile
games are largely still

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.960
single player experiences
and playing games is human

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.280
and we've been better at
this before, the question is,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.863
can we change?

00:07:19.863 --> 00:07:21.840
Can we be more effective?

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.480
And what my thesis
is yes, we can.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.870
And here's why.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.100
You heard this stat from
Michael this morning

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.630
where we have a billion
active Android users.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.930
This is 30-day
actives, not totals.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.910
That's a massive active
community of people.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.160
But use this stat as
your next measure here.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.330
Three in four of those users are
playing games from Google Play.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.500
That might be the largest
group of people playing

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.850
games ever put together.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.250
And it of course makes
Google Play the best place

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.135
to grow and distribute your game
in the mobile ecosystem today.

00:08:01.135 --> 00:08:02.960
But what these two
stats really tell

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.720
you is that really,
everybody's a gamer now, right?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.480
It's not a demographic in a box.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.240
It's not just 18 to
35-year-old males.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.230
Anybody can play a game because
the device in your pocket

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.990
is capable of entertainment--
such rich entertainment.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.250
And we have these cloud
services that can actually

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.650
connect people together
in a very deep way.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.420
So the call to action
to me is really clear.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.296
Let's make our
games social again.

00:08:30.296 --> 00:08:31.650
Now here's the challenge.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.620
If you have a
billion active users,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.080
how do you succeed in
an ecosystem this large?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.160
When you only had a
few million users,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.289
it became a lot easier to think
about, well, what kind of game

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.480
am I making?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.240
How am I going to
connect with them?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.150
When you get into
the billions, it

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.520
becomes a much harder challenge.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.080
And so this is the reason why
we made Google Play Games.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.330
This is Google's game network
for Android iOS on the web.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.950
And we announced recently
that this game network

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.480
added 100 million users in
just the last six months alone.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.050
And that velocity, we're
very confident in saying

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.020
that it's the fastest
growing mobile game

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.150
network, perhaps ever.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.720
And what's fascinating
about Play games

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.830
is that it fills this
really unique need

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.460
when you have an
ecosystem this large.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.890
And that is-- you're creating a
concentrated network of people

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.477
who love playing games.

00:09:22.477 --> 00:09:24.810
And as a result you want to
be able to connect into that

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.210
and get your content
exposed to them.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.240
So since we launched it
at Google I/O in 2013,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.200
developers have been integrating
services like achievements,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.730
leaderboards, multiplayer
gifts, and newer services

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.560
like saved games
and quests to be

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.710
able to enhance the retention
and engagement of their games.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.380
And we know that games are
doing better with those services

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.990
today.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.270
More tangibly though,
Play games gets

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.700
you access to very high
quality gamers, people

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.400
who love playing games.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.700
And that's the performance edge
you need it in an ecosystem

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.830
like we all see today.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.470
We know when we look at
data for the developers who

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.266
have integrated game
services-- and I'll

00:10:07.266 --> 00:10:09.640
take this moment to say that
if you have integrated them,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.000
thank you, because you
are the reason why we've

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.870
been successful and
we love everything

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.350
that you've done
with game services

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.210
and we want to see you do more.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.640
But tangibly, we
want to make sure

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.720
that the services are
actually providing value.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.770
It's not just something
you throw into your game

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.310
because Google told you to.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.630
We see these players, they play
longer, they play more often,

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.680
and they monetize
more frequently.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.820
And that is a reason
alone to make sure

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.620
that you get your game
connected to those users.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.420
And being able to see the
double digit percentage

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.250
increases we've seen in session
lengths and duration played.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.270
And in some cases,
revenue bumps depending

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.660
on the types of designs
that you've chosen.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.570
So this is where the question--
it's not merely a question of

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.500
did you integrate Play Games?

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.790
We all know that the game
that your designed matters

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.411
and the thematics and how
you approach your users still

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:02.910
works.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.810
But how do you engage
a billion people?

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.170
So we've done number
of studies here

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.480
and one way to think about
this is that in this ecosystem

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.220
there's an openness
factor for how people want

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.100
to engage with
social interactions.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.280
So there's people who want
to do very high levels

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.239
of social interaction
and very low.

00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:26.030
And so we have these
three personas, right.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.980
So I'll call them the
competitor, the completionist,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.020
and the stealth gamer.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.180
And you can plot
these personas, kind

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.180
of on that graph of
social openness, right?

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.130
With your competitor
being the most

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.210
open to being directly
competing with other people,

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.900
to your completionist
who's actually not

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.460
very interested in
competing with others,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.435
but is more interested in
single player type interactions.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.320
So I'll talk about these
three personas in more depth.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.610
So the competitor is an
interesting kind of persona

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.450
because they'll engage in almost
everything in your game, right.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.490
It's achievements, it's
leaderboards, it's multiplayer.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.840
This is the person--
they own every console.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.784
They set up their
social media page

00:12:09.784 --> 00:12:11.450
to brag about the
achievements that they

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.020
earn from any platform
they earn it on.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:20.950
And they're really engaged and
thrive in direct competition.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.590
On the opposite
side of the spectrum

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.180
we have these
completionists, right.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.150
These are people
who don't really

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.972
like engaging in any
kind of social activity.

00:12:28.972 --> 00:12:32.600
However, they thrive in
progressing through your game.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.100
They want to be
immersed in it, they

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.960
want to accomplish all the
goals that you give them.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.330
They want to see the storyline.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.580
They want to finish everything.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.130
This is like the
mobile equivalent

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.590
of the gamer that wanted to
earn the "Geometry Wars" million

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.820
point achievement
without ever dying.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.890
If you remember games
like "Final Fantasy VIII,"

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.200
there was that one summon
that you could do at the end

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.270
and it was like a
two minute video

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.140
that you had to watch
just to watch it cast.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.100
And you had to complete
every last corner

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.630
and inch of the game to
be able to earn the right,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.090
or the bragging
rights to do that.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.380
That's this person, and
in mobile, they exist.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.140
The last category
here, and they're

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.179
kind of in the middle
of this social openness

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:19.970
spectrum is what we
call the stealth gamer.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.785
This one's a tricky
one because they're

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:24.410
the person you ask, hey are you
a gamer, and they're like, nah,

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.194
I'm not a gamer.

00:13:25.194 --> 00:13:27.110
But then when you look
at them on a normal day

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.040
they're playing games every day.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.825
This is like my mom, right.

00:13:30.825 --> 00:13:32.320
She's like, no I
don't play games.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.670
But she's sitting there
on her tablet every day

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.350
playing with random people.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.210
And so what we know
about this persona

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.880
is that they will engage
in social interactions

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.982
but they will do so
passively, right.

00:13:43.982 --> 00:13:45.690
The social interactions
have to be quick,

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.350
they have to be
relatively frictionless.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.010
Or you have to kind
of involve them

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.800
in kind of like a community
type of atmosphere

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.567
as opposed to making
it more head-on

00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:57.650
competition or something
that they would otherwise

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.120
be frightened of.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.540
So with these three personas,
we can think of the tool kits

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.810
that we have with
the games network

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.260
and how we can connect
you to each one of them.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.450
So I talked about the
competitor persona.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.200
The toolkit you have here--
an obvious one is leaderboards

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.630
and we can talk about
turn-based multiplayer

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.010
and real-time multiplayer.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.380
So the nice thing
about our leaderboards

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.370
is that we have social
and public leaderboards.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.072
So public leaderboards are kind
of for your hardcore audience

00:14:29.072 --> 00:14:31.030
because there's a set of
people who will always

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.840
compete to be number one.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.916
For the average person, they
might never be number one.

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:37.790
But I could be number
one amongst my friends.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.100
And so what's great
about your competitors,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.790
they're going to intuitively
go for the top scores

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.340
but they're going to see their
friends leaderboard and say,

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.520
hey, I want to compete
with my friends.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.440
They're more inclined
to invite them,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.290
it's more likely to turn
into an acquisition for you.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.970
And that's a fantastic
reason for leaderboards

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.590
to be implemented
into your games.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.700
Encouraging the friends to
be invited into the game

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.310
is just another way to not
only engage the persona,

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.040
but to grow your
game incrementally.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.790
Real-time
multiplayer-- if you're

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.050
building a synchronous game
this is a fantastic technology

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.420
that gets you into the ecosystem
in a very tangible way.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.330
"NBA Jam" here-- if
you remember that game

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.450
from the '90s, now on mobile.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.450
They implemented our
real-time multiplayer.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.530
And what they use
really effectively

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.300
is what we call our
auto-matching feature.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.923
And auto-matching-- the
way to think about it

00:15:26.923 --> 00:15:29.750
is that you're getting
access to the hidden

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.100
social graph of the game.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.160
It's basically
connecting people who

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.260
are playing actively right now.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.680
And so you see incredible
boosts in engagement

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.410
because you're able to simulate
the arcade interaction of old,

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.910
but on a mobile medium.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.130
And so you'll play
a game like NBA Jam,

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.230
you're playing one or two
sessions, you bail out

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.020
and then seconds later
you're connecting

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.510
with somebody else who's
available to play right now.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.240
For a more, let's say
intimate experience,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.810
you can still invite
friends directly in the game

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.300
and this is kind of a
screen shot of doing that.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.350
Google will sort and rank users
depending on your interaction

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.290
with them recently.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.230
So recent players
and active players

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.080
will show up at the top.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.980
And friends who haven't
yet come to play the game

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.560
are deprioritized
in an effort to make

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.010
the match experience relevant.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.980
For turn-based
multiplayer, it largely

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.980
follows a similar type of model.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.960
Turn-based multiplayer
is much better for games

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.100
where the sessions can
be played in increments.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.300
So maybe it's over
hours, or over days,

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.920
or it's literally
a turn-style game.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.540
Same type of thing, except when
a turn is pending in the games

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.637
experiences that we have
in the Play Games app

00:16:41.637 --> 00:16:43.970
and inside the game themselves,
this is a call to action

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:44.840
for me to come back.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.160
So if I went on vacation
or I just got busy

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.400
and I didn't decide to
finish playing the game,

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.980
having that card sitting
in my inbox that says,

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.859
hey Dan's turn started reminds
me that I was playing this game

00:16:55.859 --> 00:16:57.650
and is a call to action
for me to come back

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.350
and that's an important
retention point for you.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.829
An important part of
turn-based and real-time,

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.810
though, is the social
discovery part of it.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.060
And that is when
somebody invites me,

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.400
I do get a notification across
the entire Android ecosystem.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.400
So the way that this works
is that we prioritize

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.621
how noisy the
notification is, depending

00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:22.079
on whether I have a connection
with them and their circles,

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.578
or whether I don't
know them at all.

00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:27.410
So here you can see Dan's
invited me on the left here.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.390
And I see his face and I see
his name and it buzzes my phone

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.790
and it vibrates, and
great, Dan's there,

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.310
I'm going to go and play a game.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.730
But somebody can invite me
who's not in my circles.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.049
And I'll get a silent
notification in the shade

00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:40.840
and when I pull that
down and I look at it,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.380
it's like, OK, great, I'm
going to go see who invited me

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.570
and understand that I
want to play with them.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.980
So when I dive into one
of those notifications,

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.639
you'll get an experience not
dissimilar to this, which

00:17:50.639 --> 00:17:52.680
basically allows me to
start a game with somebody

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.530
I know-- Dan on the left.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.500
Or somebody I don't know--
this stranger on the right.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.697
Not really a stranger.

00:17:59.697 --> 00:18:02.030
And I can decide whether I
want to play with them or not

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.070
or mute them or decline
or whatever have you.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.850
But here's the growth hack.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.870
If I don't have the game,
this will redirect you

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.810
to the Play Store.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.990
And then someone's going
to install your game,

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.270
start getting playing that
they otherwise wouldn't.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.310
And because it was
introduced to me by a friend,

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.190
they feel a lot more inclined
to start playing the game

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.290
because there's kind
of a social angle

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.160
to, well if Dan likes the game,
I should like the game too.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.280
OK.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.127
So we talked about the
competitor persona.

00:18:29.127 --> 00:18:30.710
There's the other
side of the spectrum

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:31.835
which is the completionist.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.480
There's two really important
ways to engage this user

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.380
and we just see it time and
time again through data.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.590
Great achievement design
and supports saved games.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.190
Great achievement
design-- the way

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.800
I always describe it is if I
finish a game like "Hit Men Go"

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.990
is the game really done?

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.340
And I could just turn it
away and forget about it.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.990
But it turns out that when I
add achievements to my game

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.030
it allows me to explain to users
that there's more depth to it.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.580
That there's more to do.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.810
And so you can easily
come back and you can see,

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.101
here's some achievements that
I haven't quite finished.

00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:09.400
They're still very incremental.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.160
It gives me other
types of objectives,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.660
it calls me back into the game.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.240
And we've seen games with
great achievement design boost

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.250
monetization.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.860
They've boosted engagement,
they've retained their users

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.620
in a deeper way
and consistently,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.150
compared to games that don't
implement achievements,

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:28.000
they outperform them
almost every time.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.100
If you want tips on
good achievement design,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.470
we have a YouTube
video called, Game

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.870
On-- Achievement Point Pointers.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.560
This is a good opportunity to
take a picture of the screen.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.220
If you don't take a picture of
the screen, you can Google it.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.900
It's a fantastic video by
our resident, Todd Kerpelman,

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.820
who is a former Pogo designer.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.610
I mentioned saved games.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.260
So this is kind of intuitive,
but you have these solo players

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.790
who increasingly, when
they're very engaged,

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.780
are switching between devices.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.030
Our saved game system
works cross-platform.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.610
And really, the
point of doing this

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.130
is that you never want somebody
to play level one again.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.463
If they're going to switch a
device or buy a new device,

00:20:11.463 --> 00:20:14.650
the worst situation is you'll
completely churn out your user

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.800
if they can't pick up
where they left off.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.990
Or my other favorite example--
I think we've all experienced

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.980
this-- is you get the support
call if somebody says, hey

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.730
I thought that I would fix
the game if I just uninstalled

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.025
and reinstalled it, like
that works normally right?

00:20:29.025 --> 00:20:30.650
And then you realize,
oh wait a second,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.944
you've lost all your data.

00:20:31.944 --> 00:20:33.610
You've basically reset
the game, there's

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:34.901
not very much I can do for you.

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.320
That's a bad experience.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.160
Saved games completely
removes this.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.400
And we consistently see this
as one of the top requests

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.850
from any one of our
players in Play Games.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.150
Easy to implement, brain
dead from that perspective.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.000
And here's what we added
at I/O-- the ability

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.600
to attach cover images.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.840
So you'll see here this is
me playing "Leo's Fortune."

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.670
What they do is they
take a screenshot

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.020
of where I last left
off in the game.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.123
So when I come back from
vacation and I scroll through

00:21:03.123 --> 00:21:05.586
and say, hey, what game
do I want to go back to?

00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:07.960
I see the screenshot that
reminds me, yeah, that's right,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.630
I did left leave
off on level three.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.130
I'm going to come
back and I'm going

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.580
to pick that game
over other ones

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.130
because I feel like I could
go back and probably win

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.300
that level.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.595
So it's kind of a
digital bookmark

00:21:18.595 --> 00:21:21.320
so that users can get
called back into action

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.390
and help you get a little bit
more of a re-engagement flavor

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.420
to your title.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.640
While we're on the
topic of growth hacks,

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.000
I want to insert this one.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.020
And this is the concept of
games your friends are playing.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.110
This applies really
to all the personas,

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.730
but I'll call out-- because
the completionist is still

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.970
a play alone type
of player, they're

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.160
still attracted to this.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.680
There's something
that's about, hey,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.540
let me see what my
friends are playing.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.200
It's a way for me
to discover games.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.990
It's a denotion of maybe the
games have a higher quality,

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.370
or whatever have you.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.630
So you see a screen shot here.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.590
We have the Play Games app
where you can see games

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.048
that I've played recently, like
"Brave Frontier" or "Frozen

00:22:00.048 --> 00:22:00.590
Front."

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.170
Or in the store where
you can see games

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.180
like "Heroes of Camelot"
and "Sky Force."

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.820
This is a very strong
call to action.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.380
It's zero effort to you, other
than implementing Play Games.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.050
We take the signals,
we pour them

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.790
into our discovery
channels and help

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.455
your name get better discovered.

00:22:17.455 --> 00:22:19.360
And so if you're
into growth hacks,

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.840
finding those extra percentage
points of additional user

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.830
acquisition, this is a very
easy thing to do for your game.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.550
OK.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.100
And so that brings me
to the stealth persona.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.516
So we talked about
how the stealth

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.490
persona is kind
of tricky, right.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.440
They don't like the
direct social engagement,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.505
so you can't use like the old
memes of direct competition.

00:22:42.031 --> 00:22:43.780
They don't think of
themselves as a gamer,

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.149
but they play all the time.

00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:46.690
But we have a few
tools that we think

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.430
will constantly
resonate with them.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.250
So the first one is that we
created a game gift system.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.550
We know from our research that
if the social interactions are

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.940
extremely discreet,
very easy to get into,

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.480
and low friction
Game Gifts is a way

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.250
to kind of trade a quick
object between two players

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.590
and keep them engaged and
invite them into the game.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.060
And this service
is pretty simple.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.480
I can just kind of
visualize it this way

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.690
is that when you
implement it, players

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.800
select a gift that they
send to another player.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.050
We store if for seven
days on our server.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.110
And we send a notification
in a similar type of way

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.860
that we do for multiplayer.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.140
When the other user receives the
notification, they tap through,

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.270
they select the gift
that they want to play.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.160
And similar to what
we did in multiplayer.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.020
It will ask them to install
the game if they don't already

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.520
have it.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.100
So it's a great opportunity
for another social acquisition.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.020
But it's also something that
resonates with this persona

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.430
because I'm not
getting challenged.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.100
I'm not being put on the spot to
be able to do this right away.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.420
It's a very simple thing.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.350
Oh, I'm receiving
something from somebody.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.202
That sounds kind of cool.

00:23:52.202 --> 00:23:53.910
Don't send them putty
knives, by the way.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.220
I don't want any putty knives.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.160
And then ultimately,
they receive the gift,

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.284
they're elated, and they
get engaged into the game.

00:24:00.284 --> 00:24:02.500
And you can recreate
the experience inside

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.820
of your own game like we do
with any one of our other APIs.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.532
Another service that we
launched is called Quests.

00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:12.490
And the way to think
about Quests first of all,

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.400
it's a way to create time-based
objectives in your game

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.970
without having to
update the game.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.870
And what it does is it creates
this community feeling, right.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.390
There's a lot of people doing
this big kind of community

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.740
event on a weekend.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.620
Sometimes this is
referred to as live-off.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.680
So this might be thought
of as live-offs in a box.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.850
But the way we've
implemented this

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.140
is that it's analytics driven.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.850
So the way Quest works is
that you send the Quest system

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.830
events of what's
going on in a game.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.790
When somebody levels up, when
they modify their sword, when

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.690
they find the rare black
sheep in your game.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.860
And through learning what
players are doing inside

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.840
of the game, you can
craft quests then

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.190
you run in a time span,
like on a weekend,

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.670
or for an entire week based
entirely off of that data.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.240
I'll show you how this works.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.100
So you start by
defining a set of events

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.260
that happened in your game.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.980
Let's say I'm
making a zombie game

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.500
and I have red, green,
and blue zombies.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.750
And so I would fire an
event every time somebody

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.690
killed one of those
three colors of zombies.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.880
And I integrated that in my
game and the Quest interfaces

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.680
exists to show a user when
a new quest is available.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.480
Then I monitor those events.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.530
So let's say I'm pretty
satisfied with the number

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.507
of red zombies and green zombies
being killed in the game,

00:25:30.507 --> 00:25:32.840
but I'm not really happy with
the number of blue zombies

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.850
being killed, because there's
more monetization events tied

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.930
to them, they're
harder to kill, people

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.020
have a tendency of buying
more things in my game

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.510
because they're harder
to kill in general.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.210
So I can go into the
developer console

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.960
and create a Quest
that's like, hey, we're

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.650
going to have a 5,000 zombie
blue zombie killing fest

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:51.690
this weekend.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:56.160
And the Quest system will track
every time somebody's completed

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.680
killing an existing blue zombie.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.770
And when you
accomplish that goal,

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.070
it can push down a custom
blob of data to your game

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.460
that you can
interpret and decide

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.290
how you want to
reward your users.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.840
So common examples would
be a blob that says,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.580
grant in-game currency
to the user who succeeds.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.050
Or give them some
kind of in-game reward

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:19.055
or progress them through the
game in a new type of way.

00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:20.430
The best part
about this, though,

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.410
is I didn't have to update my
game at any moment in time.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.130
It's entirely based on
just sending the events

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.730
and the quests
automatically populate

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.920
in the Quest UI
that's integrated.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.230
And so you could run
these quests every day,

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.910
every week, every weekend and
constantly reengage your users.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.170
But use the data to decide which
quests are the most effective,

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.740
and are you helping shape the
behavior of your users in a way

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.310
that you're retaining
and engaging them more?

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.260
We had one developer who showed
their Quest data recently

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.410
and they saw users that engage
in quests went on to do,

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:58.230
I think it was 160% more
other types of sessions

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:02.920
in their game, just by virtue
of engaging them in this way.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.220
So I highly advise--
it's a dynamite feature

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.210
if you're in to live-ops.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.230
Very easy to implement
and everything

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.070
is documented on
developers.google.com.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.410
The last thing that
I want to talk about

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.810
is, of course-- OK, we've
got these three personas,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.890
we have all these tools.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.530
How do you know
you're successful?

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.405
So you have to have a
way to measure success.

00:27:23.405 --> 00:27:25.950
So Google-- we're a very
data driven company.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.900
Game developers who
were wildly successful

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.980
are also very data driven.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.090
One way that we help
you here is-- you're

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.920
familiar, probably with the
statistics we have in the Play

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.790
console today.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.430
But there's a
separate game focused

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.320
set of statistics that are
given to you just by virtue

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.150
of integrating Play games.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.110
And so when you
implement Play Games,

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.910
there's basically a zero effort
dashboard that's given to you.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.400
I'll dive into it
a little deeper.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.230
So for example,
your daily dashboard

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.700
gives you a summary
of your active users,

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.650
your new users, retention.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.990
And more recently we've
added demographic data.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.830
The demographic data-- when
we hear from developers

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.910
is essential because as a game
designer you want to know,

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.630
hey, is this game actually
resonating with the audience

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.530
I thought that was
going to be playing it?

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.820
If I made a game that
I expected females

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.320
between the ages of
18 and 30 to play,

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.780
I would hope my data
would show that.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.950
Another angle here is that if
you're into user acquisition

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.950
and you're trying to come
up with the right type

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.180
of creative assets, knowing
what kind of demographic

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.480
your game has, in
reality, can help

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.290
you decide what kind
of creatives you use

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.940
and how you engage and go
after the right audience.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.340
Another essential here is
our retention dashboard.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.170
This is for your ability
to retain new users.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.740
So a common example
here is that you

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.450
want to take a look at how many
new users are coming back--

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.396
day one, day two,
day seven, day 30.

00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:51.770
And so you can
kind of understand

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.590
the attrition rate of your game.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.935
And let's say that you had
a tutorial in your game

00:28:55.935 --> 00:28:58.060
and you wanted to try and
improve that in an effort

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.900
to help people get back on day
one and day two more often.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.780
Here you would see, you
know, on March 8 here,

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.760
I did an update to my
game the day before

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.160
and I saw a boost in my metrics
because apparently my tutorial

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.540
was better at convincing
people to stick around.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.150
And that's a use
case for this data.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.550
Again it comes from just
integrating Play Games

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.973
and having people sign in.

00:29:17.973 --> 00:29:21.426
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a formula for that?

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:22.550
GREG HARTRELL: The formula?

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.675
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:30.824 --> 00:29:32.740
GREG HARTRELL: Yeah,
this one's simple, right.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.760
It's basically that you
have a cohort of new users

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.774
that came in on a specific day.

00:29:37.774 --> 00:29:39.440
Here's the percentage
that came back day

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.840
one, day two, day three.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.010
It's a simple multiplier.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.802
The last one is in
the engagement stats.

00:29:47.802 --> 00:29:49.760
Today we support achievements
and leaderboards.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.009
So when you think about
engaging these personas

00:29:53.009 --> 00:29:55.550
you also want to use the data
to know that you're effectively

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.050
doing that.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.630
So you can see whether the
achievements that you added

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.032
to your game recently are
actually getting earned.

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:02.740
Whether they're too
difficult, whether it

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.810
takes too long to earn them.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.080
Or if you're into the
competitor type of persona,

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.570
maybe you have a
custom leaderboard

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.400
for some very special
part of the game

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.066
and this is a way for you to get
an indicator of whether they're

00:30:14.066 --> 00:30:15.570
actually engaged
in that content.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.861
And whether the changes that
you're making to your game

00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:22.170
design are actually resonating
with that type of user.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:22.670
All right.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.270
So I'll wrap up.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.750
The summary today is
basically this-- Google Play

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.030
games connects your game to
a highly concentrated network

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.750
of very high quality gamers.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.250
We have the services,
achievements, leaderboards,

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.700
multiplayer, and gifts.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.260
And the new stuff like
saved games and quests.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.270
And they're all showing us
data that games are increasing

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.050
engagement and retention
in very dramatic ways.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.180
These players play longer,
they play more often,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.460
they monetize more frequently.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.680
And the service can cater
to those three personas

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.455
if you're very deliberate
about in your design.

00:30:55.455 --> 00:30:57.580
But going back to the
beginning of this-- remember,

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.970
everybody's a gamer now.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:00.860
We have a billion
of them out there.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.160
And that makes this a much
more challenging, but also

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.570
a very exciting time for us.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.150
Android and Google Play
have created an ecosystem

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:11.410
that large that gives you
that kind of opportunity.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.560
And we know that games at their
best have brought us together.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.740
And so if I leave you
with one message today

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.149
it's, go forth and
make your game social.

00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:21.190
And with that-- if you
have any questions for me,

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:25.910
I'll be wandering outside, happy
to talk with every one of you.
