00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.488
Well, I know it's going to
have the form y = mx + b.

00:00:02.488 --> 00:00:08.770
So, I leave y and I leave x,
but what do I put from my m?

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.775
Well, that's just the slope which is -5.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.475
So, y = -5x + the y value of the y
intercept, which looks like it's 2.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.830
So our equation is y = -5x + 2.
