00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.650
We'll be teaching you how to
use Google's platforms and

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.830
tools to build these
kinds of experiences for

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.220
your users, while staying relevant and
unobtrusive.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.620
&gt;&gt; Now keep in mind this is
not an introductory course.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.690
We're going to assume that you're
already familiar with the Java

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.410
programming language, and that you
already know the Android platform.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.390
&gt;&gt; If you're unsure if you're ready for

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.920
this course, we recommend you start
with Developing Android Apps.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.200
&gt;&gt; Also make sure to check
out the instructor notes for

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.720
other resources that will
introduce you to Android and Java.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.480
&gt;&gt; Let's get started!
