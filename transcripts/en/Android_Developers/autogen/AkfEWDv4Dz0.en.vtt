application we used apache access to

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560
application we used apache access to
 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.800
application we used apache access to
generate stubs from the wsdl files and

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810
generate stubs from the wsdl files and
 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.630
generate stubs from the wsdl files and
we use case up to to perform the soap
