00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
What does your perfect world look like?

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.440
An end to genocide, corn dogs for dinner everyday,
David Tennant at my house for board games

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.719
and Carl Sagan would be there too, he'd be
immortal...and not dead.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.739
We could cure cancer with puppies and vomit
wouldn't exist.

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.200
Unfortunately, sometimes we need to vomit
to survive, David Tennant doesn't know I exist,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.300
and while scientists are experimenting with
dogs that can diagnose cancer through scent,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.600
puppies are not helping to cure the disease.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.320
Gases, likewise, don't live in a perfect world
either.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.149
It'd be great if their particles always fulfilled
the assumptions of the ideal gas law,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.730
and we could use PV=nRT to get the right answer
every time.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.059
But the ideal gas law, much like our culture,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.170
has really unrealistic expectations when it
comes to size and attraction.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.929
Namely, it assumes that particles do not have size at all, and that particles never attract each other.

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.069
Well I don't know about you, but it's hard
for me to take up no space,

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:57.039
no matter how much I want to disappear and
attraction, so far, that's never gone away.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.580
So the ideal gas "law" often becomes little more than the ideal gas estimate when it comes to what gases do naturally.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:14.220
[Theme Music]

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.960
You remember the ideal gas law,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.520
it's a combination of three related laws that
were discovered by a variety of scientists.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.840
Let's review real quick.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.830
Boyle's law was first published by Robert
Boyle in 1660,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.840
but it was actually discovered by two of his contemporaries, Richard Towneley and Henry Power.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.660
It says that the product of the pressure and
the volume of a gas is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.670
always constant as long as the temperature
remains the same.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.050
Boyle's law requires a closed system where the amount of gas is constant (like in my balloon).

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.050
Next is Charles' law, which was discovered
by Jacques Charles and actually named for him,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.110
though it was first published by Joseph Louis
Gay-Lussac, who wasn't a scoundrel.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.270
Yes, I'm looking at you Robert Boyle.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.240
Charles' law, which also requires a closed
system, states that

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.120
the volume of a gas divided by its temperature gives a constant as long as the pressure is held steady.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.160
And then there's Avogadro law, discovered
by resident house elf, Amedeo Avogadro,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.470
and this one does not require a closed system.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:16.270
In fact, it's all about changing the amount
of gas (like - like I just did there).

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.300
It says that the volume if the gas divided
by the amount, results in a constant

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.520
as long as the temperature and pressure are
held steady.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.540
The more gas you have at a given temperature and pressure, the more space it takes up, and vice versa.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.160
That's pretty intuitive, right?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.000
The trouble is that it's kind of inconvenient
to use three different laws to figure out

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.920
what one sample of gas is doing.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.140
So eventually the three laws combined into
one by, surprise, our old friend Dmitri Mendeleev.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.980
He pulled all the elements together into the
periodic table and it turns out he pulled

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.080
all the gas laws together too.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.040
Smart guy! The main thing Mendeleev did was
to calculate just one constant, R,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.819
also called the universal gas constant, which incorporates the various constants from all the gas laws.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.020
With a little rearranging, we now have the
ideal gas law that we know and love.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.620
R equals 8.3145 liter kilo-Pascals per Kelvin
mole.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.960
But don't let the crazy units scare you.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.380
It looks complicated but it's really just
a measurement label like meters or Newtons

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.970
and it helps us out a lot in our calculations,
which is mostly what we'll be doing today.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.390
This is all pretty cool, but remember that
it's called the ideal gas law for a reason:

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.810
it only works perfectly when gases behave
ideally,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.160
with the particles not taking up too much
space and not being attracted to each other.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.069
It's a bit of an impressive regime,

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.900
but under normal conditions most gases come close enough to ideal behavior that we get very little error.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.260
It only breaks down badly in conditions like
high pressure or low temperature or high density

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.620
that shove the particles so close together that they take up a large proportion of the available space.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.720
This also causes any attraction between them
to be magnified,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.959
just like how I didn't think that Alison Cayne was that attractive until she became my lab partner,

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.849
and then she was right there next to me all
the time, and I couldn't handle it.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.599
Johannes van der Waals came up with a way
to correct the equation for real gas behavior,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.720
and we're going to explore that soon, but it's important that we know first how to use the base equation.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.020
And besides, it's close enough most of the
time without the correction factor,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.989
so why make it harder than it needs to be?

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:18.189
One last thing: remember that STP, or Standard Temperature and Pressure, is 0 degrees Celsius and 100 kilo-Pascals,

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:26.209
but gas law equations are done in Kelvins, not degrees Celsius, so we'll call it 273.15 K and 100 kilo-Pascals.

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:32.760
STP is sort of a baseline level that we use so scientists everywhere can compare gas behaviors under the same conditions,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.360
and as we'll see, it's useful in calculations
too.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.880
So, we've got this fancy-shmancy new law just
lying around doing nothing.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.160
Let's figure out some stuff! I wonder how much space 1.00 mole of an ideal gas takes up at STP.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.300
That would be its volume, and we can
calculate it like this:

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.720
We know that PV=nRT.
We know that we want 1.00 mole.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.080
We know what R is, since it's constant, and since we're at STP, we know the temperature and pressure too.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.560
Plug in all the numbers, leaving the volume as a variable (since that's what we're trying to find out).

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.220
By doing the math (I'm doing it in my imaginary calculator here) we find that the volume equals 22.71105675.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.260
And because of the big, scary unit on R, the
kilo-Pascals, moles, and Kelvins all cancel out,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.820
leaving us with liters, which is exactly what
you'd expect for a volume unit.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.199
This confirms that the problem was set up
correctly, so that's nice.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.660
Rounding our answer to the correct number
of significant digits

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.160
and adding the unit gives a final answer of
22.7 liters per 1.00 mole of gas.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.880
'But wait!' you cry. 'Didn't we learn last time that 1.00 mole of any gas is a volume of 22.4 liters?'

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.280
Yes! I am astounded that you remembered that
so well.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.500
In fact, 1.00 mole of a gas will take up slightly different amounts of space depending on what the pressure is.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.510
I said, just now, that it was at STP, which
is a pressure of 100 kilo-Pascals.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.509
The 22.4 liter number is for a gas at 1 atmosphere.

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.919
While one hundred kilo-Pascals and one atmosphere
are similar, they are not the same.

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.540
In fact, 1 atmosphere is 101.325 kilo-Pascals,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.820
and I assure you that if you did the calculation using 101.324 kilo-Pascals of pressure, you'd get 22.4 liters.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.780
But you don't have to trust me, you can do
the calculation yourself.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.520
So instead of doing that, which would be boring,
let's make things a little more interesting.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.820
Like bigger! You know, like super big, like
way... bigger. Let's make it Hindenburg big.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.340
The Hindenburg was a zeppelin, a flying machine
that's held aloft by a lighter-than-air gas,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.820
but, unlike a hot air balloon or a blimp,
has a rigid metal frame to support its shape.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.820
It was nearly as big as a cruise ship and
many times larger than the Airbus A380,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.440
today's largest flying passenger vehicle.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.660
It was built in Germany in 1936 and made 10 trips to the US and 7 to Brazil in its first year of service.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.009
The Hindenburg annoyed Hitler and the Nazis.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:56.320
For one thing, it was named for Paul von Hindenburg,
the president of Germany before Hitler took over.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.480
Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels tried
to make the Germans name it "the Hitler",

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.289
but they refused, thankfully.

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:08.580
And second, the Hindenburg was fancy new technology that the Nazis wanted to use both militarily and as propaganda.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.100
The makers did not want that to happen.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.150
They did allow it to be used for one huge
propaganda mission,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.990
called the Die Deutschlandfahrt, or Tour of
Germany (no giggling!),

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.030
but after that, it was used only for passenger
and freight service.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.949
But none of that is the reason that we still
talk about the Hindenburg today.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.500
Sadly, it's most famous for catching on fire
and crashing while it was trying to land in

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.780
Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6th, 1937.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.860
That's bad enough under any circumstances,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.699
but it also happened to be filled with hydrogen
gas, H2, which is highly flammable.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.680
The original plan was to fill it with non-flammable helium, but helium was extremely expensive at that time.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.880
And because hydrogen gas has a molar mass roughly half that of helium, it provides more lift too,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:56.640
so the zeppelin company felt that using hydrogen was an acceptable risk, but the result was the loss of 36 lives.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.820
No one knows how the fire started, but it's
clear that it ended in tragedy.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.979
So let's do some calculations to build our understanding of what the Hindenburg was all about.

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:10.579
First, let's figure out how many moles of
H2 were aboard the ship when it left Germany.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:17.979
We know that the hydrogen bags had a total
volume of 211,890,000 L, so we can start there.

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:20.030
We don't know what the atmospheric pressure
was that day,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.830
but we can assume that it was close to average
atmospheric pressure, about 100 kPa,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.100
and the internal pressure would be about the
same.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:33.280
So the volume is 2.1189 X 108 L,
n is what we are trying to find out,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.400
R is always the same (8.3145 liter kilo-Pascals
per Kelvin mole)

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:44.950
and average early May temperatures rage around
10° Celsius which is 283.15 Kelvin.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.820
With this information we can now solve for
the amount of hydrogen gas.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.660
Doing the math and rounding properly we find
that n equals 9.00 x 10^6.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.360
All the units cancel except for moles which
we add to the end.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:05.120
So the Hindenburg started out with 9.00 x
10^6, that's 9 million moles of hydrogen gas.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.540
That is a lot.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.500
So how much extra could the Hindenburg carry
because it was using hydrogen instead of helium?

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.290
9 million moles of H2 times its molar mass,
2.016 grams per mole,

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.660
calculates to a little over 18 000 kilograms,
or 18 metric tons of gas.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.140
On the other hand helium's molar mass it 4.003
grams per mole.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:31.280
So if they'd used 9 million moles of that, the gas would have had a total mass of over 36 000 kilograms.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.339
So with hydrogen instead of helium the Hindenburg
could carry 18 metric tons more.

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:40.459
Here's another interesting question: It's
warmer in New Jersey than in Germany.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:47.060
On an average day in May the outdoor temperature there would be around 18° Celsius or 291.15 Kelvin.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.240
If we assume that the volume and amount of
gas in the Hindenburg were constant,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.630
how much did the internal pressure increase?

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.390
We're looking for P, so we leave that as variable.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.350
The amount and the volume have to stay the
same as before.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.840
R is always the same and our new temperature
is 291.15.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.790
Using those numbers we find that the new pressure
is 102.822.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:13.140
Given the right number of significant digits and the right unit, the final answer becomes 103 kPa.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.280
So looks like we've gotten pretty good at these calculations, time for some fun! This is a fire piston.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.420
Like everything around us it contains air and it has a plunger that allows you to compress that air very quickly.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.420
The sudden but extreme increase in pressure
will cause the temperature of the air inside

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.200
to rise equally suddenly and extremely.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.970
Of course hot air looks just like cool air,
so that's kind of boring on its own.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.420
But if I put a small piece of cotton inside
to provide fuel, watch closely.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.480
And... boom! Did you see that?

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.260
The inside of the piston actually got so hot
that it ignited the cotton.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.400
Solid prove that increased pressure does indeed
lead to increased temperature. Pretty cool!

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.320
Thank you for watching Crash Course Chemistry!

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.000
If you were paying attention,
you learned that

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.400
taking up space and attraction to others cause just as much trouble for gases as it does for us.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.520
That Mendeleev came to the rescue once again

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:06.519
by combining three separate gas laws into
one simple equation and how to use that equation.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:10.170
You also learned a lot about the amazing Hindenburg
and its tragic end,

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.860
why the stuff that makes party balloons cool
might have made the Hindenburg cooler too,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.180
and how to make fire with cotton and your
fist.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.920
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi González.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.269
The script was edited by myself and Blake
de Pastino.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:25.980
Our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko Langner.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.519
