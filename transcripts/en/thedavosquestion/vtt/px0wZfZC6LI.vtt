I think role models are very important in
the Middle East. This is one of the most ancient

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.570
regions in the world. However it's creating
it's new identity to create. And I think we

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.570
need role models so that we are able to create
this identity on bases of responsibility,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.570
responsibility of one's self and others around
them. And that ability to circumstances the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:21.430
change, the change that we see in our society.
And our ability that we should do what we

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:30.010
are expected to do. [pause] problem solving,
this is something that is very important in

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:39.550
the Middle East. We look at the solutions
rather than the crisis and hope to find answers

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.920
to the questions that we have.
