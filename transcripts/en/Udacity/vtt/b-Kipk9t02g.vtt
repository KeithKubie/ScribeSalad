00:00:00.228 --> 00:00:04.083
So let’s look at a coin. It has outcome 0-1 and

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:07.617
we’ve already learned that the probability

00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:11.687
of the sum equals exactly K for N coin flips;

00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:14.145
; looks like this cryptic formula over here:

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:17.665
N factorial divided by N minus K factorial and

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.334
K factorial. And then we had some other term here,

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:23.299
if the coin is fair, it is like 2 to the minus

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:25.401
N. Right now, I’m just going to care about these

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:27.485
coins over here. I won't care about the probability

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.979
for the time being. I want you to help me

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:34.049
construct a table for these counts as N gets larger.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:36.726
So we start with N equals 1, go all the way to N

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:40.092
equals 4, obviously outcomes range from zero

00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:43.962
all the way to 4 at 4 coin flips. So here’s our

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:46.845
table. It’s also quite obvious that these guys

00:00:46.845 --> 00:00:49.275
over here can never occur: if you flip the coin

00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:52.130
only once, the outcome can’t be 2. So we’re going

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.422
to fill out this table over here together for the

00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:57.816
coin over here. Tell me, for N equals 1, what are

00:00:57.816 --> 00:00:59.782
the two values that go right over here,

00:00:59.782 --> 00:01:02.000
just those two values.
