00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.770
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: So, good
morning again, I'm Pam Jackson,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.710
I'm Director for the Center for
the Book and Chair of the Library

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.520 position:56%
of Congress Literacy Awards Program,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.660
and I'd like to welcome
you here this morning.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.260
Thank you so much for being here,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770
being part of the conversation
we're going to have.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.050
We're very excited about who we
have in the room and the ideas

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.100
and programs-- the ideas
that are going to be shared

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250
and the programs we're
going to be learning about.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.430
In case you all don't know, we have
representation from as far away

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.920
as Afghanistan, and
Ethiopia, Cambodia, Canada,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.940
Maine and right here in New
Jersey, just as an example.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.200
So we've got a wide array
of people and organizations

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.570
that we'll be learning
about today, we're very,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.100
very glad to be in
this conversation.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.570
So let me take a few minutes just
to provide a bit of an overview

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.810
and then we'll talk
about how the day's going

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.220
to go and we'll get started.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.810
First, I would like to just
acknowledge for the Center

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.190
for the Book, administers
the Library

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.890
of Congress Literacy Awards
Program which began in 2013.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.710
And, excuse me-- was a
result of idea generation

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.480
by the Founding Director of the
Center for the Book John Y. Cole,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.510
could you raise your hand
so we can acknowledge you?

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.980
[ Applause ]

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.770
With generous support from David
M. Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.800
as our program developed
over the years,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.280
we have now in our
fourth year awarded prices

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.960
to Literacy Organizations.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.810
And there are two ways, there
are Award-Winning organizations.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.520
We have David M. Rubenstein
Prize, the American prize

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.060
and the international prize.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.880
And those awards and the
winners will be a part

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.930
of the afternoon program.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.020
This morning's program is
the best practice honorees,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.300
and we're very thrilled to have 14
organizations represented today,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.290
who will be sharing about their
practices, their organizations,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.920 position:56%
the work they are doing to make a
difference in the world of literacy,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.030
providing literacy, expanding
literacy, expanding the ability

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.800
and capacity for others
to be literate

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.720
or deliver literacy to the world.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.860
And we're very thankful for this.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.030
But, in order to accomplish this
work, we rely heavily on the work

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.700 position:56%
of our advisory board, and I'd like
to acknowledge them, we have a table

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.610
of representative if you could
stand to be acknowledged.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.420
We have some of our board of
advisors here with us this morning.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.720
Thank you.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.280
Yes, and if-- feel free
to move, thank you.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.740
So, this group of individuals
provides their expertise in serving

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.410
on selection committees
that review the applications

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.040
for the awards program,
devoting their time and attention

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.620
in committee work to look
at what the practices are,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.630
what the work is that's being
done, how sustainable is it,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.270
how innovative is it, how wide
and deep is the penetration

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.270
of the services and making their
selections and doing the work

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.950
to have each year's award
winners be chosen from there.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.860
So, we thank you and we honor
you for the work and the time

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.630
and the commitment, thank you.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.100
So, I also want to just acknowledge

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.610
because we can't--
I don't do it alone.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.350
There are a number of Center
for the Books staff inclu--

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.620 position:56%
and Center for the Book includes not
just administration of the Library

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.850
of Congress Literacy Awards
Program, we also include the Poetry

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.880
and Literature Center and
the Young Reader's Center.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.620
And so, staff, for those programs
that have been supporting today are

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.980
in the room and I just like
you guys to wave your hands

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.630
so I can say thank you, for putting
it altogether, wave your hands.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.650
So we're all-- they're actually
still working, so oh well.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.070 position:56%
And, kind of another acknowledgement
that we should make is that,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.670
we at the Center for the Book
are a part of the National

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.260
and International Outreach
unit at the Library.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.350 position:56%
It's a one-year old organization, a
creation by the Library of Congress,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.260
specifically for the purpose of
ensuring that the vast, diverse

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.520
and rich collections of a library
are out in the world, being shared,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.220
expanded and multiplied, and being
accessible by all everywhere.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.260
And, I have the National
Programs director for the National

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.830
and International Outreach
center, Eugene Flanagan with us,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.090
and the Director Jane
McAuliffe of the National

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.390
and International Outreach.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.410
So if you could stand to
be acknowledged as well.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.620
Thank you.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.920
Thank you so much.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.220
Thank you so much.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.310
So, we'll get to the
focus, the heart of our--

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.740
why we're here which is to
hear not from us but from you.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.260
And we have organizations
that were cited for excellence

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.320
and best practice areas
that included outreach

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.610
to rural communities,
initiatives and innovations

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.170
in providing literacy
in the workplace,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.130
research-based professional
development and the use

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.760
of mobile devices to
promote literacy.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.450
Together, the groups that we
honor and celebrate here rep--

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.350
have helped millions
of people, worldwide,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.690
to discover the wonders
of literacy and reading.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.430
And we'll have the opportunity
to learn about each of them

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.180
and the presentations they'll
make here on the stage,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.730
we're going to be a little
bit rigorous with the time

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.730 position:56%
because we have a lot to hear from,
and they had been given instructions

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.540
to be able to share
profoundly, deeply,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.090
powerfully and briefly [laughs].

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.210
A little bit more though,

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.930
in the back of the room there's
a doorway entrance to LJ 113,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.450
and we have some displays, and
some more information from some

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.200
of the organizations and they'll be
prepared on the breaks to be there

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.380
and talking and sharing more about
the work that they are doing.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.680
So, we don't-- we actually, highly
encourage and want to make sure

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.520 position:56%
that we emphasize part of the
purpose that we're here for today is

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.820
to learn from each other.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.530
But then it also means making time
to talk to each other off stage.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.330
And we'll make sure that
there is time for that.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.970
How the program will go, so this
morning's presentations will be

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.910
from the honorees, the best
practices that we'll learn about.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.940
We'll take a break and do
some photo ops and stuff

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.240
like that up here at the stage.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.950
Lunch will be in here at noon
but they will be about a 30,

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.500
40 minute break, around 11:30,
11:15-ish, maybe if you guys have

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.640
to deal with what you
need to deal with

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.640
and then come back
at noon for lunch.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.150
And then our afternoon
program begins at 1 o'clock

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.620
and we'll actually
have the Librarian

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.950
of Congress Dr. Carla
Hayden with us,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.770
and our programs benefactor
David M. Rubenstein to be part

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.310
of that celebration of
the award winners to learn

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.670
about those organizations and
also to have a brief panel talk.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.270
The afternoon concludes with the
opportunity for more networking,

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.190
either an LJ 113 or here in the
room, and/or for those of you

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.200
who are interested and
haven't had a chance to do so,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.160
we will provide docent-led
tours of the Library

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.210
of Congress, Jefferson building.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.460
So we think that's a very-- it's
just a magnificent place to be.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.280
We're thrilled to share it with
you, and we'll provide tours

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.690
to give you a sense of it.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.000
Our 4 p.m. reception is in a
little room which is one level down

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.020
and we'll have staff to guide
you, and we'll conclude at five.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:42.950
And yeah. Get ready [laughs]!

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.690
So, as we begin our presentation,
so I want to invite us to listen

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.190
in a particular way, and you
have sheets in your folders.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.520
First of all, you do have the
program for the day on the card,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.990
on the top of your photo.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.830
But inside, we actually
have some reflection sheets

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.410
and note-taking paper that we have
created with questions for you

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.530
to reflect on as you are
listening to the presenters.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.310
And we really want to invite you
to listen a particular kind of way.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.810
We're interested in you,
listening for the big ideas,

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.370
listening for the work that you
find most compatible with yours,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.250
listening for the work that
you've never heard of before,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.000
or the ways people
are serving others

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.270
and you've never heard of before.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.210
Listen for the best
practices you want to adopt.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.660
Listen for the best practices you
already performed that you want

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.960
to refine and enhance, and to
be in conversation about it.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.710
So we have two things going on.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.010
We have the opportunity for you
to have your reflection note

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.700
for yourself and those are
meant for you to take with you.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.190
But we also have boards
up in the back

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.080
and there is one here
towards the door to LGJ 13,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.550
Vida's raising her
hands, she is near it.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.710
And there is another one
here to my kind of left here,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.400
that are probing questions that
we'd like you throughout the day,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.420
to visit the board, there's
some posted notes and ink pens,

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.330
write your notes and leave
them for us on the board.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.740 position:56%
And there are questions that we
would like to have answered from you

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.910
that will help simulate
our ideas and thoughts

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.380
about what were the biggest
ideas you heard today.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.690 position:56%
What are you taking away from today?

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.360
What do you want us to know about
what you want to see next from us?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.260
So we invite you to be thinking
about that as you're learning--

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.980
listening to and learning
from the organizations.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.740
So both take-- note
taking at your seats

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.050
and also visiting the white
boards when you get a chance.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.440
And with that, we'll actually
start our presentations,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.670
let me check on my time, yehey.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.520
All right, great, so and--
so we'll start us off

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.310
with Krister Karlsson,
from Ethiopia Reads.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.820
Krister is the Director of
Development for the organization

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.020
which is nearly 20 years old.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.580
Their mission is to collaborate
with communities to build schools,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.550
establish libraries, train
educators, boost literacy,

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.780
provide youth and families
with the tools

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.190
to improve their lives in Ethiopia.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.510
Please welcome Krister Karlsson.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:06.750
[ Applause ]

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.470
&gt;&gt; Krister Karlsson: So I
guess we'll get this started.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.240
My name is Krister Karlsson,
and I'm the Development Director

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.030
for Ethiopia Reads, one

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.370
of the Literacy Award Honorees
being celebrated today.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.470
I'm proud and humbled to
stand here before you,

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.890
and I want to thank
the Library of Congress

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.890
for this incredible recognition.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.860
Ethiopia Reads has
been a leader in youth

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.820
and children's literacy
for nearly 20 years.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.410
Since 1998, Ethiopia Reads has
built more than 70 libraries

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.130
in every region of the country,

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.210
shipped more than a
quarter million books,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.710
and serves over 130,000
children every year in rural

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.460
and urban communities
throughout Ethiopia.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.970
We build libraries where there
were none, and often partnering

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.390
with schools to build classroom
libraries for their students.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.340
And where there were no
schools, we built those two.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.190
However, after building dozens
of libraries in the schools,

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.470
we still face huge challenges
promoting literacy in Ethiopia.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.380
After years of working
closely with local communities,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.620
we've finally understood, instead
of building one new library

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.690
after another, communities simply
wanted to improve the quality

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.860
of reading spaces that
already existed.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.600
So, over 10 years ago,
Ethiopia reads,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.740
shifted toward a more
efficient cost-effective program

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.940
by designing projects that were
based on the needs and desires

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.240
of recipients, by listening to
the actual people on the ground.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.960
By avoiding top heavy donor-driven
ideas of development and instead,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.910
by emphasizing the needs and
desires of local stakeholders,

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.380
Ethiopia Reads has been able

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.570
to successfully promote reading
culture throughout Ethiopia,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.900
not just for the thousands of
young students in the classroom,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.350
but for their families and
their neighborhoods too.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.200
Our program, the book-centered
learning program, provides training

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.090
and professional development,
so librarians

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.330
and educators can gain
critical skills

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.380 position:56%
and feel supported in the workplace.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.890
The Book-Centered Learning
Program incorporates three elements

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.930
essential to best practices.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.590
First, professional
training and mentorship,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.830
on-site with regular follow-up.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.480
Second, we collect data on site

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.680
which informs the design
of our training program.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.120
This is an ongoing
collaboration between educators

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.190
and Ethiopia Reads staff members
in Addis, with short feedback loops

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.320
to provide continuous
improvement and innovation.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.210
Finally, Ethiopia Reads is
an institutional advocate

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.370
for our teachers and librarians,
giving them greater voice

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.780
when working with education
bureaus or government offices

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.980
or local school administrations.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.220
The Book Centered Learning Program
has been implemented in 22 schools

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.000
across six regions including
Addis Ababa, as well as Southern

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.350
and Eastern Ethiopia as well.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.070
This, I suspect is the main
reason Ethiopia Reads is being

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.000
recognized today.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.840
Because of our ability to evolve
beyond the brick and mortar concept

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.260
of development, past
simply building library,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.770
it's an opening reading
spaces, to embrace the model

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.640
of the delivery services
tailored to the needs

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.840
of the recipients on the ground.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.310
There are no shortcuts or gimmicks

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.750
to addressing youth and
children's literacy.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.220
It simply depends on the hard work
being done on the field combined

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.830
with thoughtful planning
that accounts

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.950
for local needs and interest.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.830
Our experience teaches
the importance

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.630
of a comprehensive literacy model
that addresses issues of access

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.490
and awareness with emphasis
on quality of instruction.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.130
Ethiopia Reads has impacted

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.590
over 1 million children
throughout the country

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.040
and we hope our programs will
serve as a model for the future.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.660 position:56%
We hope to pave the way for the
next generation of literate parents,

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.710
teachers and future
leaders of Ethiopia.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.790
Once again, thank you for this
award today, we look forward

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.510
to the bright future
ahead, thank you.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:45.190
[ Applause ]

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.490
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: All right.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.680 position:56%
Let me just pause and just say there
are a couple of people standing

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.980
in the back, there are chairs
that are available down front,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.780
so please feel free to join us now.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.880
And also, Tanyella Evans,
could you raise your hand?

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.680 position:56%
Oh hi, Ricardo needs to see you back
there if you could take a moment.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.340
We'll give just a moment to
allow people to be seated,

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.270
yeah, thank you, welcome.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.120
All right, great!

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:23.420
So next, we will hear from Paul
Austin of Students and Parents

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.500
in Cooperative Education,
also known as SPICE.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.020
SPICE targets families
in Waldo County,

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.650
Maine that have children
ages zero through eight,

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.810
whose parents have less than a 12th
grade education, a reading level.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.490
Paul is superintendent of
schools for Regional School Unit 3

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.050
which comprises 11 towns in Maine.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.510
Please welcome Paul Austin.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:51.810
[ Applause ]

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.400
&gt;&gt; Paul Austin: OK.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.700
Good morning.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.860
If anybody of you who are-- ever
been to Maine, you will realize

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.400
that you can get there from here.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.530
It wouldn't be fitting for
me, and I promised my staff

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.830
that I would not speak in a

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.120
down east accent, I
really don't have one.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.090
And so I'm really sorry for that.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.940 position:56%
I'll do my best with our PowerPoint.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.850
And given five minutes, it
usually takes me five minutes

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.150
to introduce myself.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.220
So, I'll do my best.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.820
A little bit about RSU 3.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.630
First of all, we're located in
western Waldo County, Maine.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:32.040
We serve 1300 and 50 students
in grades pre-K through 12.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.780
We're comprised of 11 small, very
rural towns, encompassing more

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.230
than 440 square miles of
incredibly beautiful farmland

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.590
and fields and forest.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.240
I'll skip through a
little bit to save time.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.490
In 2015, to give you a little
snapshot of our district,

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.880
72 to 75% of our students qualified
for free and reduced school lunch.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.840
And in 2016, the district that
applied for them was approved

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.910
for the Community Eligibility
Program,

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.930
meaning that all students receive
free and healthy breakfast,

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.250
lunch and snacks everyday.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.620
Students and parents in Cooperative
Education Family Literacy Program

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.530
was originated through the
federal Even Start grant in 2000.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.680
And SPICE is now funded by
our local district funds

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.820
and for the past 10 years,
through the very generous support

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.900
of the Barbara Bush
Family Literacy Foundation.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.030
The SPICE program was based
upon the four component model

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.620
of family literacy, adult
literacy where we support parents

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.250
in developing the most basic
skills in reading, writing

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.050
and numeracy and to
speak in English.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.590
Our early childhood literacy,

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.810
we support brain-based
early language development

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.030
and pre-reading skills
for infants and toddlers.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.640
Intergenerational literacy,
we offer activities designed

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.930
to build literacy-focused
relationships between parents

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.460
and children by helping
families recognize and capitalize

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.920
on the opportunities to
learn and grow together.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.000
And through parent education,
we help parents become the head

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.230
of a literacy rich household,
becoming their children's first

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.260
and most important teachers.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.030
We promote their children's speech,
reading and educational development

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.610
and to form partnership with
their children's teachers.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:24.080
Our mission is that the
staff are actively engaged

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.170 position:56%
and support the individual's ability
to read, write and speak in English,

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:33.940 position:56%
compute and solve problems at levels
of proficiency necessary to function

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.690
on the job, in the
family, and in society.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.550
Our core values are
the parents matter.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.880
Parents are the first and
most influential teachers

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.840
in their child's life.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.160
Literacy works, parents who build
their own literacy skills increase

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.480
their children's success in school.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.530
Success occurs, so the
parental support is critical

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.570
for their children's success in
school and that strength enhances

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.810
that all parents have strengths
that can be transferred to children

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.300
and built upon to increase
skill levels.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.880
Some exciting outcomes
of our program.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.700 position:56%
Sixty eight percent of the
children served by the SPICE program

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.270
over the years have
consistently earned average

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.280
to above average test
scores in school.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.150
A student from one of the first
SPICE families recently graduated

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:29.100 position:56%
in 2012 as the first generation high
school graduate from their family.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.900
The SPICE program serves
very young parents,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.820
including as low as15 years
old, and serves a high number

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.360
of children ages birth to three

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.980
which is the critical area
obviously of literacy.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.090
And the SPICE program
has consistently scored

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.430
over a 90% proficiency
on performance indicators

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.840
that are required by local,
state, and federal authorities,

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.030
as well as our private foundations

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:57.120
that have fiscally-supported the
program during the past 15 years.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:07.190
In 2005, SPICE was honored to
become internationally-recognized

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.720
and became part of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.970
and Cultural Organization, database

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.340
for effective literacy
practices worldwide.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.210
The SPICE "Virtual Learning
Center" which was created in 2011,

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.600
won the national 2013 United States
Conference on Adult Literacy,

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.930
award for program innovation
and collaboration.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:32.420
In 2016, we're very honored today
to be "A Best Practice Honoree"

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.240
by the Library of Congress
Literacy Awards Program,

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.900
supported through the
generosity of David M. Rubenstein,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.590
CEO and co-founder
of the Carlyle Group.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:46.600
I would end today on behalf of
the board of directors of RSU 3,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.320
the RSU 3 Adult and
Community Education Program

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.730
and the SPICE staff, parents
and especially our students.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.400
We want to thank the
Library of Congress

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.780
for this extraordinary honor.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.170
We'd also like to take
this opportunity

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.620 position:56%
to express our greatest appreciation

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.500
to the Barbara Bush
Family Literacy Foundation

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.600
for their continued
generous financial support

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.470
for the past 10 years.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.580
SPICE would simply not be possible
without their incredible support.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.650
And I welcome all of you as we
go on today to please feel free

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.430
to contact me to speak to me
and we'll talk more about it.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.230
Thank you.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:27.930
[ Applause ]

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.880
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Thank you Paul.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.490
So just a note, I neglected to--

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:38.090 position:56%
Our presenters have been given
instructions for how the day will go

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.950
but I neglected to mention that
the timekeeper's right here.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.330
So keep your eyes on him.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.300 position:56%
OK, next is Sharon Rawlins,
collaborative Summer Library Program

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.590
which is a consortium of
states working together

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.940
to provide high quality summer
reading program materials

00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.250 position:56%
for children, teens and adult at the
lowest possible cost for libraries.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.000
Sharon is the president of the
board of directors of this program

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.040
and is a youth services
specialist in Life Long Learning

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.990
at the New Jersey State Library.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.510
Please welcome, Sharon Rawlins.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:16.590
[ Applause ]

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.120
&gt;&gt; Sharon Rawlins:
Good morning everyone.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.640
Thank you so much to the Library of
Congress for this wonderful honor.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.250
We're very every excited.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:28.050
It was so kindly already mentioned
that our mission and you can click

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.660
to the next slide if you like.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:36.240
It's listed there,
oh left, here we go.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.870
Yes, this is our mission, it's to--

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.400
We are consortium of states
which means we are US-wide

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.490 position:56%
and we are all volunteer librarians.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.960
We're library staff members,

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.490
so we don't really have a
headquarters although we have

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.460
administrative offices in Iowa.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:00.210 position:56%
But our main mission is to provide
a unified summer reading theme along

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.800
with professional art and
evidence-based materials

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.250 position:56%
so that member libraries can provide
high quality summer reading programs

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.940
at the lowest cost.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.180
We have been around
for nearly 30 years

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.980
and we are basically a grassroots
movement of several states

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.000
in the mid West to decide
that they did not want

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.330
to keep reinventing the wheel
when it came to summer reading.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.920 position:56%
Many of the libraries are small ones

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.400
where they only have one staff
member or they have volunteers

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.040
who come in, and may not
be librarians or educators.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.830
So we felt that this
would be really helpful

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.790
to encourage all the public
libraries in all the states

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.460
to get involved in the
Summer Reading Program.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.020
Because as we all know,
summer reading is so important

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.930
for the students to
avoid the summer slide.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:50.430
We provide manuals that target
early literacy, children's,

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.620
teens and adults and it has
everything from, example,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:23:00.880
reading logs to how to get
your town council involved

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.220
and introducing your
summer reading program.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.370
We also collaborate
with our schools.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.660
It's a summer reading program
from public libraries but we know

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.850
that schools are doing
their own program,

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.630
but we strongly encourage them
to partner, not only with schools

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.470
but also with other
after-school organizations.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.680
The theme is selected
by the librarians.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.350
It's a very democratic process.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:28.460
All 50 states are involved
and everybody gets a vote.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.470
Not only are the 50 states involved
but also we have American Samoa,

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.180
Bermuda, the Cayman Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia,

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.290
Guam and the Mariana Islands.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:44.820 position:56%
And we recently heard that Australia
is interested in joining as well.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.680
We also have a national reading
spokesperson, a reading champion

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.520
for the last two years,
it was Kate DiCamillo

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.690
and then this year it's
going to be Kwame Alexander.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.420
And the other thing that
probably sets us apart from some

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:04.150
of the other organizations is
we do have a noted illustrator.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.790 position:56%
The illustrators come to us and
say, can we illustrate your artwork?

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:12.210
And this coming summer for
2017 is Build a Better World

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:17.030
which incorporates stem and steam
and architecture and engineering

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.450
and blocks and legos and
all that kind of stuff.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.660
And Dion Mccauley who
many of you may know

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.130
for his wonderful the way
things work books that we used

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.940
when I started off in libraries
because internet didn't even exist

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.500
at that point, so that
was our reference book.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.860
He is our illustrator, national
illustrator for this year.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.640
It's a low-cost program.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.280
We charge a membership
fee for each state

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.160
and then there's a minimum amount
for each library within the state

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.830
but it's very cost effective
and very easy for libraries

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.730
that have one staff
member to get involved.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:25:03.720 position:56%
The manuals have hundreds of program
ideas and that it's really a package

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.780
where you just give it to the
library and say here it is.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.780
Then we provide the
art work for them.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.540
All they have to do is use it.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.740 position:56%
And the same high quality standards
are across the board in every state.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.570
The librarians that write the
manuals are all volunteers,

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.250
but they are-- very knowledgeable.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.760
The evidence-based practice is
the fact that we are working

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:34.900 position:56%
with several communities and
getting their Evidence-Based surveys

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.490
to prove that-- definitively
that summer slide does exist

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.980
and that the summer reading
program is really helpful.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.940
Measurable amounts is
what I just mention.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.580
And this is really sustainable
because it's the program

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.440
that the librarians
are doing anyway.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.640
And we are the one that's
involved with the program.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.730
We are professional librarians
and so, we take the materials ,

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.330
we know our libraries, we know our
communities, we know what they're

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.460
like and we gather
together and get the ideas

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.670
from staff members
throughout the country.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.540
So, it really is a grassroots
movement done by the librarians

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.340 position:56%
for the communities that they serve.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.140
There's 19,000 public
libraries that are involved

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.250
and that doesn't even include
the number of students.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.510
One more slide, this is
just a picture of the kids

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.730
and what they're doing in the
summer and how much fun they have.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.530
Thank you so much.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:41.970
[ Applause ]

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.490
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: An
eternity and also very fast.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.990
So our next presenter
is Timothy Ireland.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.740
And I will have to admit
that I've not yet learn how

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.040
to pronounce his name very well

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.670
without botching it,
so please forgive me.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.670
It's of the Sao Paulo
School Program in Brazil,

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.760
which represents a
25-year collaboration

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.920
between Brazil's Federal University

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.800
and the Construction
Workers Trade Union.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.780
And it's to support
workers education

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.440
and to have Literacy
in the workplace.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.920
The programs are actually
often offered at the workplace.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.950
And in some cases, it's the case
of workers live at the work place.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.780
So, the program has reached more

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.900
than thousands of illiterate
workers.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.230
And Timothy is a professor at
the University as a specialist

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.590
in literacy in education.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.510
Please welcome Timothy Ireland.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:47.110
[ Applause ]

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.720
&gt;&gt; Timothy Ireland: Good morning.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.020
[Foreign Language].

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:59.190 position:56%
It's always a pleasure to be able to
speak in Portuguese and in English.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:03.970
And a great honor to be
here at this ceremony

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.150 position:56%
and to represent the Zipfian School.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:13.550
The Zipfian School is a literacy
and basic education project

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:17.610
for building workers in the
civil construction industry

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.940
in João Pessoa.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.960
This just gives you an idea
of the type of a classroom.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.240 position:56%
I use more, I decided to go for
more photographs to give you an idea

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.010
and the feeding of
what the school is

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.590
like throughout than
talking so much.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:40.020
And this is our logo map,
just to give you an idea

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.420
where we're situated on the map.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.720
The top left hand corner you
can see the map of Brazil.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:51.090
And the-- the brown yellow is
the Northeast Region of Brazil.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:56.180
João Pessoa is the capital of
the state Paraiba and which is one

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.640
of the nine states which make up
the Northeast Region of Brazil,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.950
which is historically one

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.870
of the most impoverished
regions of the country.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.740
If you could see, Paraiba on one
side, we have Rio Grande do Norte

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.100
on the other side Pernambuco.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.970
Pernambuco is the state where
Paulo Freire was born and lived

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:21.500
and practiced for many years before
being exiled and beginning to go

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.140
around the world until he return

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:28.190
to Sao Paulo towards
the end of his life.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.940
So, Literacy work in Paraiba's
being very much influenced

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:37.530
by Paulo Freire's thinking of
the last 50 years more or less.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:42.100
The school-- the Zipfian
School is a partnership

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.640
between the Federal University
which is a public university

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.740
and the Sintricom and the
Building Workers Trade Union.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:56.700
And, building trade-- the Building
Workers Trade Union in Brazil--

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.200
João Pessoa is one of
the biggest trade unions.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.750
It has about 10,000 members,
has become increasingly strong

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:13.080
over the last 30 years since
a group of workers took over.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:19.990 position:56%
This photograph just shows a typical
member of the building works,

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.860
trade union and typical
construction work in Brazil.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:31.200
And we have a poem which is
part of our literacy material.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.100
And which is the translation
is the following.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:40.490
It says, my name is Benedito.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.270
[Laughter] I was born
in the country side.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.390
I live in the capitol.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.580
Here I work in the
construction industry.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.190
I build tower blocks and houses.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.910
I build bridges and I dig drains.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.730
My hand makes the city grow.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:31:01.310
I dream of building a good house,
a house for my family to live in.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:07.310
So Benedito is very much the
typical student of the project.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.110
The workers are all mainly men.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:12.070
We have a few women,
but very few women.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.510
They come from the countryside
in search of work in the city.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.140
Most of them were formerly
agricultural workers.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:27.390
And, this partnership as
you can see the university,

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.540 position:56%
the typical logo mark for university

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.760
and the building work
as trade union.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.530
This is being the strongest mark of
the project over the last 25 years.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:44.490
The university has one agreement
with a workers trade union.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.740
And it's very rare for the
university, as a public university,

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:54.360
to make such an agreement
with a worker's trade union.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:01.070
So the school offers literacy and
basic education as well of a series

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:06.710 position:56%
of other activities including health
nutrition, cultural activities,

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:12.090
mobile learning workshops using
tablets and digital media,

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:16.530
access to reading and
books in the building site,

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:22.140
and classrooms are all
situated in the building site.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.520
They take place from nine--

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.940
seven until nine, a night from
Monday through to Thursday.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:37.990
The teachers-- just gives you an
idea of what the building sites are

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.280
like in this part of the world.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:47.210
The teachers are all students
and from the university,

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:52.990 position:56%
from various courses, from pedagogy,
from literature, we have chemistry,

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:59.310
biology, languages, they
all receive a small stipend.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:05.350
And the majority are women,
there were very few men.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.780
The object of the scholar to
contribute to the general education

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.310
of building worker
and to its formation

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:15.340
as a critical citizen
and trade unionist.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:21.840
The results-- you can see
the school, and the results

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.520
after 25 years of activities more

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.670
than 5000 building
workers are being attended

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.530
and indirectly their
families as well.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:37.940
And 400 students have
been trained as educators.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.130
And, we've also produced
textbook material,

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.980
numerous academic articles,
and a large number

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.790
of master's dissertations
and PhD thesis.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.310

The GIZ police corporation--
cooperation project is a project

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.150 position:56%
in Afghanistan that's established
in response to the low literacy rate

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:27.270
of the Afghan national police,
72% of whom are illiterate.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.510
Please welcome, Mostafa.

morning ladies and gentlemen.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:41.450
It's a pleasure to be here and
a great honor to be here today

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:45.220
and to talk about our project, you
know, achievements in what we do

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.370
and now we do the literacy
program back in Afghanistan.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.670
I like this picture.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:55.150
When I see it that motivates me,
when you see the girls and boys,

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:59.930
I mean with the-- these
opportunities that we have back

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.410
in Afghanistan in joining
police forces,

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:08.540
not only serving their country
but at the same time they receive,

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.470
sort of speak, free education.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:15.600
Unfortunately, back in
Afghanistan, 62% of--

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.710
in general, the population of
illiterate and that affects a lot,

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.070
the police, the unit
that they are responsible

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.560
to implement rule of
leading the country.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.540
Almost 75% of the police
are illiterate,

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.450 position:56%
50% of the police are semi-literate.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.750
The rest are literate.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.600
We call them the officers.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.300
Yeah. With the objective of
the project is party clear

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.600
from the responsibilities
of police as.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.920
Back in the society, we are working
not only to literate them but also

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.500
to create a good relation between
the community and the police

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.200
and the unit that they are
responsible to implement the rule

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:02.180
of law back in the country
and in the districts.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.770
Currently, the project that,
so to speak, I represent here,

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:10.250
we cover the whole
province of the country.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.410
We are active in 34
province of Afghanistan.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:18.410
And currently, around the world
30,000 police are participating our

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:20.770
literacy courses on a daily basis.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:24.720
In general, around
80,000 police have gone

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.900
through literacy program
in Afghanistan.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.850
And we have done several surveys
in order to see the impact

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.430
and the result of the project.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.980
And the result keeps us
motivated to continue the work

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.970
that we do back in Afghanistan.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.050
Because one of the
aim that we have--

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:46.850
we are aiming and focusing
to be the--

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.910
to build up a bridge
between community and police

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.860
so people can trust the police,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.060
the forces that they are
responsible in their societies.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:02.060
The photos of the police
you see, they've got a gun

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.370
and they've got a notebook.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.740
They are responsible to
implement rule of law,

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.340
at the same time they
are willing to learn.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.430 position:56%
And we were asked for sometimes, of
why you've got a gun and a notebook.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:16.010
So they are police and
they have to have it

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.460
and they have to carry it on.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:24.230
The project is continual in
coordination with the minister

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:30.350
of education and MOI as partners
in order to have them on board

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:34.600
because of the sustainability
of the project in order

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.150
to make the government
be responsible

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:40.100
in the future to run the literacy.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.800
Because with the high rate
of illiteracy that we have

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.960
in Afghanistan, it's kind of not
that much of optimistic that in 5

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.720
to 10 years, we would produce that
much that police officers or police

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.800
that they're going to be recruited,
they'd be able to read and write.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.220
When we say read and write, I know
the new definition for literacy

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.730
that we're having now around
the world, that is not the one

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.660
that we have it in Afghanistan.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.210
What we mean by literacy is
the whole classic, read, write,

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:10.050
and mathematic, that's what we do.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.990
When we started the
project, of course,

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.720
we used the curriculum
of the government.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:20.230 position:56%
And in addition to that, in order to
make able police to know their rules

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.060
and responsibility as
police in the society,

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.370
we added up some additional
topics in our curriculum.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.270
The topics that-- when
I see that-- I like.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.730
It's about human rights.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.030
It's about gender.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.330
It's about the police rules

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:33.740
and responsibility,
healthcare environment.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:39.640
So they know who they
are and what they do,

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:46.040
and what is their responsible--
one minute.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.720
In addition to that
curriculum, we created

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.870
or we upgraded the curriculum that
we have from fourth to sixth grade,

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:57.890 position:56%
because literacy back in Afghanistan
means that from the first

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:03.790 position:56%
to third grade of school, since the
police are responsible and they have

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.680
to know more about their
roles and responsibility.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.970
We upgraded the curriculum from
four to six grade which means

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.630
that once they have gone through
the course, they would be able

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.900
to continue further education at
any school they are willing to.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:24.330
Thank you very much and still
I think I've got a minute.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:30.040
And also, I've got a news of-- one
of the project that is underway.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.730

of almost 500 different

and a police unit.

organization based in Cambodia

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:13.250

libraries that can be accessed

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.730

books an educational lever.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.080

and making them accessible

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.540

The first is a PowerPoint and
the second will be a small video.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:54.000
So I will ask if we have for--
so my time so I try to go,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.850
to get it very quickly
with the presentation.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:02.660

year, you know, partnership--

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.720
partner with the UNESCO education.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:12.930
So, we start work first in
the school by creating the--

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:18.190
around 300 library in
the primary school.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.660
And we are working
also in the community

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.480
by creating a lot of library.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.780
We have mobile library.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.550
We have the library by
backpack for the young volunteer

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:35.740
who are traveling from village
to village to, you know,

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.630
to disseminate the
books for the children

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.390 position:56%
and for young people and adult also.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:47.200
We have a book publishing
program because we are faced

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:53.050
with the big problem of books in
Cambodia, because after 20 year

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:56.470
of all, and the [inaudible]
Khmer Rouge.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:00.240
We have a lot of problem
with books, we try to level

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.300
up books in Khmer language.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:10.970 position:56%
So, and we are working now in
community, in prisons, in hospitals.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:15.680
And the last project we are
running now, and the many project

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:21.120
that allow us to be one of best
practices here is a project

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.680
on library for the worker
and garment factories.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:31.860
You know, a garment factory is, you
know, is a very important sector,

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:37.270
a [inaudible] sector of Cambodia
because its represent 80%

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.970
of exports from Cambodia.

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:45.560
So, now I would like to invite
you to watch a small video

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.860
about the garment factory.

we are changing from mobile library

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.940
to permanent library and the
staff can get more informations

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.240
by the book.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.720
And so they can borrow
the books to home to read

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.520
for their children before sleeping.

only provides three staff

00:43:52.790 --> 00:44:00.410
that Sipar will help them to learn
how to be librarian, and table,

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:35.200
for the work situation because they
will improve their reading skills

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.540
which is important for example
reading information that we spread

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.510
in the factory or for
filling out forms.

Institute based in Philadelphia

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.420
at the University of Pennsylvania
represented by Dan Wagner.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:51.800
This organization focuses on
improving literacy policy practice

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.330
and professional development
through research.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.620 position:56%
Dan is a professor in the University
of Pennsylvania graduate school

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.260
of education, and was
founding director

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.090
of the literacy research center

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:04.700
at the University of
Pennsylvania in 1983.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.390
Since 1990, he served as a director

of the federally-funded National
Center on Adult Literacy,

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.670

&gt;&gt; Dan Wagner: Hello!

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.900
Good morning everybody and like the
others, I'm so pleased to be able

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.710
to be here at the Library
of Congress,

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.060
one of my favorite
institutions in the world.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.660
It's really a pleasure, and
of course, to be with a group

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:44.370
of literacy people comes very close

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.830
with my other favorite
professional association.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:53.350
So, in fact, it's true, 33 years
is almost a lifetime although I did

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.750
notice looking through the other
biographies, there are a few of you

00:48:56.750 --> 00:49:00.550
who are roughly in the
same gray hair of category.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:04.860
It's a long haul to
do work in literacy.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.660
Let me just start by saying
that those two acronyms

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.580
and logos you see, NCAL
and ILI actually started

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.110
with a different one, the
literacy research center

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.470
which was started in 1983.

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:21.120
And we did this because
it was our sense

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.140
that there was a tremendous amount
of work being done, excellent work,

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.790
the kind of work we're
looking at today.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:32.020
But that the research side
had been largely ignored

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.020
at least at major universities.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.480
So we decided to start-- I
think in the United States,

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.360
the first lifespan literacy program

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.010
from early childhood
through adult education.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.580
We did receive funding from
the department of education

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.910
to create NCAL, the national
center, and then a combination

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:56.190
of UNESCO funding and World Bank
and others to create the ILI.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:00.060
So, just a few highlights
here, just because some

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.950
of you might remember there was a--
in the early days of the internet,

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.980
an organ-- a platform called
literacy links that we worked

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:13.260
on with KET Television, PBS and
the US Department of Education.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.260
We're actually almost the 10
literacy policy forms here

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.330
at the Library of Congress
back in the 1990s,

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:21.900
something I don't think
happens anymore.

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.690
But with John Cole, who was
introduced a little earlier,

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:29.600
and his staff, we skipping
a bullet but just to say

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.570
that we have organized training
programs for professionals

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:37.080
from nearly 50 countries
around the world,

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.190
both in Philadelphia and elsewhere.

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:44.610
And published a wide
variety of material.

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:47.410
I didn't put it on here but
if you go to literacy.org,

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:51.930
pretty easy website to
remember, you'll find many,

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:55.390
many reference materials
and applied research

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:59.240
and development both
nationally and internationally.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.960
Now I thought since I could
do this and as a researcher,

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.790
I ought to share with you some
of our most recent findings,

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:08.750
I'm going to give you
a one-minute summary

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:10.810
of what I think is our
favorite current project.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:13.690
It's called the Bridges
to the Future Initiative.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:18.640
It is currently running in South
Africa as completed about 10 years

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.460
of work in Andhra Pradesh in India.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.650
I'm going to talk mainly about
the South Africa side but just

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:26.300
to show you where we're
talking about, Andhra Pradesh

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.190
in southern India and
actually in Limpopo Province is

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.450
in the very north part
of South Africa.

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:37.570
The work in India focused on
out of school girls and women.

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:40.160
The South Africa project
focused on kids,

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.870
largely although we
also worked with adults

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:46.790
in their adult education
program in South Africa.

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.030
All this work is actually
done in partnership

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.110
with local NGOs and
with the government.

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:56.470
In the case of India under Pradesh
and in the case of South Africa,

00:51:56.470 --> 00:52:00.640 position:56%
the National Department of Education
and the Provincial Department.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.440
So, South Africa like many of the
countries even today, talking today

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.090
and when you go to
international meetings

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.160
like UNESCO meetings have
a common set of problems,

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:16.590
these are the ones we are
noting in South Africa that is--

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.650
there are literacy
needs across the board

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:22.170
from early childhood
through adulthood.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.050
There are-- I'm sorry,
there's a typo there.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:30.270
It's not a 111 languages in South
Africa it's only 11, only 11.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.950
And there're all kinds of problems
in South Africa, education.

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:42.860
So this is what our project
looks like on the ground.

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:46.430
I'm not showing a video
today because of the--

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:48.020
just the time limitations.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.870
But you get a sense of the
kids who were in first,

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:54.820
second and third grade here
who are incredibly motivated

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.450
and eager to try out our program.

00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:58.960
What is interesting
about the program,

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.640
just one technical
point here is that,

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.920
if you go internationally even
here in the United States,

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.160
of course there are kids who
speak different languages

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.900
in the same classroom or
in different classrooms.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.320
Part of the goal in our program was

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.300
to provide multi-lingual
Literacy on a single platform.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.830
So you had a choice of learning

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:21.370
in either three African
languages or in English.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:22.940
You could toggle back and forth.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.230
It's a very interesting
innovative program.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.530
I'm going skip this.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:28.980
It works, just to show
you some data.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.700
I don't have time to tell you
what curves you're looking at,

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.110
but it does work.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:40.760 position:56%
And we are planning to expand in
South Africa and elsewhere in Africa

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.580
and probably in South Asia as well.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.240
So, my time is up and
thank you very much.

email address, the last three or so.

Thank you Dan.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:07.450
So, we did have the video and you
made reference to bringing a video

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.880
and we know that kind of the faces
make the experience a little more

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.180
real for us.

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:15.390
What is life like being illiterate?

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:20.200
And what kind of world
we get to live

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.740
in when there's a hundred
percent literacy in it?

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:29.720
Do you want that?

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.530
So, we're actually
going to take our break.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:37.610
So we budgeted a 15-minute window
for us to do a couple of things.

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:41.480
And we before we get up, let me
just do-- let me just say this,

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.190
there are a few board members-- the
advisory board members that came

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:47.490 position:56%
in that we didn't get to acknowledge
at the beginning and Christy's one,

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.420
if you could just raise
your hand and say hi.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.590
And was there somebody else that
we didn't get to acknowledge?

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:53.890
OK, great.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.250
So, welcome.

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:59.920
We also want to ask you to remember
to take your reflection notes.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.960
And we invite you to
refresh your beverages

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.090
and refresh your breakfast.

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:06.210
And also take a few
minutes to dialogue.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:10.520
We'll reconvene at 10:30 with the
second half of the presentations.

And the National Centre is based
at the University of White Castle.

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:19.470
We're funded primarily by
the New Zealand Tertiary

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.890
Education Commission.

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:26.560
We build capability in Adult
Literacy and Numeracy Education

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.000
through researching for
professional development research

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.840
and critical engagement with
policy and practice at the national

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.970
and international levels.

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:38.020
Our approach is evidence-based
and we're guided by our own

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.680
and of other's research

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.210
and scholarly literature especially
its professional expertise

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:46.270
in Adult Literacy and Numeracy
Education, and our knowledge

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:49.510
of the national international
environment for Literacy

director Niki McCartney

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.860

short video and then Niki's going

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.230
to explain some of what we do,

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.190
because we think that's
more important what we do

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.490
than who we are.

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:16.360
&gt;&gt; Nicola McCartney: New Zealand is
in the center of the South Pacific.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.540
And as you can see,
we're not Australia

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.500
but we're quite close to Australia.

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.370
That's it, that's that little
country in the very middle there.

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:27.710
We're surrounded by sea and as
such, we are very aware or ripples

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.740
and we are very aware of ripples
when they see a motion change.

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:37.000
We think we have a couple of good
evidence-based practice ripples

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.640
that we would like to
talk to you about today.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.870
The first one is a--
talking about the approach

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:51.210
that New Zealand has taken to
embedded literacy and numeracy.

00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:56.240
Whereby at the National Centre, we
are charged with upskilling tutors.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:01.100
We place trainers with how to
teach literacy and numeracy

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:05.210
at the same time as the
teaching the vocational programs

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:06.680
at the same time.

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.330
So, this short video, I really
don't know what's [inaudible] of it

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.570
because we know time
is what gives us.

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:16.640
It simplifies out evidence-based
practice

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.160
of embedded literacy and numeracy.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:26.400
Specifically, as it points out how
our approach is contextualized.

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.030
It is explicit and transparent.

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:36.600 position:56%
And it is woven through the training
so that we at teaching literacy

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:42.160 position:56%
and numeracy with literacy and
numeracy occurs with in the program.

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.490
Therefore we have double
aims literacy and numeracy

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:47.750
and vocational aims and out--

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:53.000
double outcomes literacy and
numeracy and vocational outcomes.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; A manufacturing company is like--

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:09.510
we have a thing that's called the
probable manufacturing value it's--

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:14.640 position:56%
if everything goes right, how much
money they can make say, in a shift?

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:15.940
All right.

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:23.540 position:56%
Well, if you look here, this is an
average probable manufacturing value

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.380
for a night out shift.

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.850
Now, it's overall it's just scale.

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:32.880
Every centimeter on here
represents a thousand dollars.

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.660
Tell us how many thousand
dollars the company could aim

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.400
from your hard work
in a night hour shift.

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:43.820
&gt;&gt; OK. So 80-- we got 80 thousand.

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:47.470
&gt;&gt; OK. So, does what
the company gets?

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:50.770
Eight-hour shift, your hard work.

00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:53.070
That doesn't get to keep it all.

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.000
You got paid for your logs.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.030
Now, you know, the
price of logs goes up

00:59:58.030 --> 00:59:59.730
and down as you might have had.

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:05.100
This is about an average
log prize for the last year.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.170
&gt;&gt; Nicola McCartney: So that
just gives you an example

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:13.130
of how we approach a bit of
literacy and numeracy, is--

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.690
are depended by a framework
called the three knowings,

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:18.270
and we have these three
circles, know the demands,

01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:21.180
know the learners and
know what to do.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:25.210
And supporting that is what we
have as learning progression.

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:28.530
So when we're talking about knowing
the demands, we have progressions

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:31.350
of competencies, we
have an assessment tool

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:34.070
for knowing the learner and
then we have this wonderful seed

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:38.350
of resources for knowing
what to do for the tutors.

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:42.990
And once we know the demands by
mapping the demands of the program

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:48.010 position:56%
and by the learning assessment tool,
that we can then know what to do.

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:51.480
And as an example, we have
different steps from one to six.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.250
Step four here shows what--
somebody can do from reading,

01:00:55.250 --> 01:01:00.340
and step five here shows what
somebody can do for numeracy.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:03.390
The second-- the second
ripple is to do

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.000
with the whole organization
approach.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.610
We talked about learner
literacy and numeracy outcomes,

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:11.900
but we can only do that if we
have seen the management by them.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.060
And for that, we need
to have the three levels

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:18.190
of the embedded framework--
theoretical framework, the learner,

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:20.510
the program and the organization.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.030
The organization is a
self-assessment process

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:26.710
with seeing new management to
identify critical collections

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:30.910
from processes and systems
within the organization.

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:34.590
So from that, we can develop
a strategic action plan

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:39.010
and then implement the literary
numeracy advisory that's required

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:40.520
for that organization.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.390
Diana you want to finish off?

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:44.740
&gt;&gt; Diana Coben: Just very briefly,
as the slide says it was one

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.150
of the most active countries
in the world with regard

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:51.770
to policy development in this
area, and the most important thing

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:57.000
with the next slide coming I hope.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.450
Is to help New Zealand adults
reach their skills potential,

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:07.650 position:56%
I'll just end with a wonderful Maori
saying here which translates as,

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:09.670
"What is the greatest
thing in the world?

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:13.210
It is the people, it is the
people, it is the people.

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.510
Thank you.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:16.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:28.040
[ Applause ]

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.410
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Thank
you Diane and Niki.

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:39.340
The Chicago Literary Alliance is
represented today by Alison Hanold

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.990
who is the alliances
partnerships director.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:47.170
The alliance was established in
2009 to encourage collaboration

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:52.060
and resource sharing among Chicago
area literacy organizations.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:56.360
The centerpiece of that
program is the Literacenter,

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.510 position:56%
a 41,000 square foot space, that can
be shared by many literacy groups.

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:06.510
So please welcome Alison
and her colleague, Stacy.

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:10.310
[ Applause ]

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:11.610
&gt;&gt; Alison Hanold: We're
tag team in it today.

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:12.910
&gt;&gt; Stacy Ratner: Yeah.

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:14.210
&gt;&gt; Alison Hanold: It's not just a.

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:16.550
&gt;&gt; Stacy Ratner: Hi,
there are two of us.

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:19.700
This is Alison and I'm Stacy.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.310
Alison is the partnerships director

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:23.410
of the Chicago Literacy
Alliance, I'm the co-founder.

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:25.320
We're going to tell you in four
and a half minutes what we do,

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.620
why we do and where we do it.

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.840
I got my start my literacy
10 years ago

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.700
when I founded a small organization
called Open Books in Chicago.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.000
And one of the first
schools we worked

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.040
at was Schiller Elementary,
this is Schiller.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.740
In a notoriously challenged
part of our city.

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:41.060
At the height of its power,
Schiller had about 250 students.

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.440
I was working there for about a
year and then I called a meeting

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.140 position:56%
of other literacy organizations that
I knew, that my friends knew to talk

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.440
about how we could work together

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.290
and make a bigger difference
in the city.

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.240
Imagine my surprise and
disappointment to discover

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.630
that all 19 of our organizations
were working at Schiller.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.020
We did not know the
others were there.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:58.970
Reading scores at Schiller were
not only low , they were dropping,

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:01.180
because frankly it was
oversaturated with resources,

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.480 position:56%
and we were having a negative effect

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.800
on the very cause we were
trying to accelerate.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.120
That was the moment
that was the founding

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.450
of the Chicago Literacy Alliance.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:09.960
We can go farther together and
not worry about what's happening

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.500
in one place because we have a
goal to change the whole city.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.480 position:56%
My background before literacy was in
high tech venture founded startups.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.510
And one of the things you get in
that community is shared workspace.

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:21.800 position:56%
So I suggested that we should have
a shared workspace just for literacy

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.550 position:56%
in the city of Chicago for all us
to get together and know each other,

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:28.840
do more work, a modest
proposal for 41,000 square feet

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.010
of shared workspace in
the city of Chicago.

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:34.620
It took a mere three years to get
there, but we did open last May,

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:39.700
this is our front door of our
place with 18 founding members.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.440
Despite says 95, now it's
actually 96 as of last night,

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.960
Alison will tell you how we've
quintupled in little more

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.040
than a year, and why
we do what we do.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.070
&gt;&gt; Alison Hanold: The goals of
the Chicago Literacy Alliance are

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:54.760
to build community,
capacity and collaboration

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.560
for Chicago's literacy
organizations.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.730
Our members cover our missions
from early childhood development

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:03.620
up to adult literacy, work
force development et cetera.

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:07.000
We do that-- excuse
me, by leading programs

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.090
that address all three
of those focus areas.

01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:16.380
To build capacity, we host on
conferences, on a by-monthly basis

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.730 position:56%
that focus on sharing best practices
in certain administrative areas.

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:25.150
We also host workshops where
members share new literacy tactics

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:27.910
and curriculum with other members.

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:31.600
We build community every single
way that we possibly can.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.280
We do believe that partnerships
begin with relationships.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.110
And so we have a regular
band poetry contest.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:39.580
We have monthly birthday parties.

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:42.500
We have rock band night
and many more.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.250
I couldn't possibly actually
list all of them right now.

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:48.590
And we believe that building
capacity and community leads

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:51.710
to collaboration and we
also do a number of efforts

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:55.600
to insight effective partnerships
that includes matchmaking.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.280
We host monthly confabs which is

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.650
where we're bringing
members together

01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:00.200
to share what they're
working on and think

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.470
about how they might
partner on a monthly basis.

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:06.330 position:56%
And we host an annual symposium,
where we talk about what's happening

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.480
in the literacy field
in the city as a whole

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.650
and how we might be
connecting the various efforts

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:13.600
to address our literacy problems.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.910
Our space, is the home
for illiteracy in Chicago,

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:19.510
it's where all of these
programs take place.

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:21.950
Stacy mentioned that is
just 41,000 square feet.

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:25.480
It has 16 conference rooms and
program rooms that members can use.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.260
It offers office space and cubicles
at 70% less than market rate

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.810
in the city in the neighborhood.

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:34.990 position:56%
It offers co-working space and there
is a used bookstore in the space.

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.090
It is functional and fun.

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.730
We believe that work should be fun.

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:41.880
We believe that staff with time
morale are much more effective

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.030
in addressing the mission
of their organizations.

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:47.020
Our space is covered in puns.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.840
Every conference room is named
after a famous work of fiction

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.800 position:56%
with the word room, somehow in the
name including cats are in the room,

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.730
"Wuther Room Heights",
"Roomkenstein",

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:57.960
"Roomeo and Juliet", et cetera.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.100
We have scooters that everyone
can ride around the space.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.730
They also have pun names
including Sir Walter Scoot

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:04.270
and that's Scoot Fitzgerald.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.270
And there are just
bright colors everywhere.

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:08.890
We are evidence of
that as you can see.

01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:14.540
And essentially, our space is
Disney World for weird nerds.

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.530
All of this fun is by design.

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:19.650
We believe that culture eats
strategy for breakfast and we want

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:22.360
to make sure that people can
collaborate by feeling relaxed,

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.240
by letting down their
competitive walls

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.130
and really connecting
with an open mind.

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:28.720
We have some success stories.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.000
Illinois does not have
a state budget,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.300
I don't know if you know that,

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:36.010 position:56%
and that has affected adult literacy
programs quite significantly.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.340
Literary Chicago is the oldest
adult literacy program in the city.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:42.050
It was on the brink of shutting
down due to the budget crisis

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:45.550
by moving the Literacenter, it cut
85% of its administrative budget

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:48.520
and now host all of
its programs in space.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.430
Chicago Hopes for Kids does
in shelter literacy tutoring

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:54.020
for homeless youth, they
never had a stable office.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:56.300
By moving into the space, they
were able to raise thousands

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.500
of dollars due to the
legitimacy of the space

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.890
and they've doubled their staff.

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:03.370
And we are creating
efficiencies for organizations,

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:04.840
Open Books, as an acre tenant.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.670
There you save an annual $100,000
a year by moving into the space

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:12.330
which all of those funds are now
rededicated into their programs.

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:15.990
So please, come visit us
next time you're in Chicago.

01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:17.330
&gt;&gt; Stacy Ratner: Or
bring much [inaudible].

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:18.630
&gt;&gt; Alison Hanold: Yes, thank you.

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:20.430
&gt;&gt; Stacy Ratner: Thank you.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:26.900
[ Applause ]

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.510
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Yeah, so we
could use a little more fun.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:33.140
[ Laughter ]

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:38.340
Wow, scooters in the
Library of Congress.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.510
I'm game.

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:43.700
[ Laughter ]

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:49.090
Next, to present is Jessica
Rothenberg-Aalami and she is

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:52.990
from Cell-Ed who uses
a mobile first approach

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:56.610
to deliver literacy services
through basic cellphones,

01:08:56.610 --> 01:08:59.480
to initiate a session,
users call a central number

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.370
and listen to a spoken lesson.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:05.720
Jessica is the chief executor
and co-founder of Cell-Ed.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.510
So please welcome her.

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:15.170
[ Applause ]

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:16.990
&gt;&gt; Jessica Rothenberg-Aalami:
Good morning everyone.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:22.630
It's an absolute honor to be
here among literacy luminaries.

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:25.830
As you heard, I am
Jessica Rothenberg-Aalami.

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:30.900
I'm the CEO and the co-founder of
Cell-Ed where we bring literally--

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:36.630
literacy skills to anyone
with a mobile phone, and why?

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:42.050 position:56%
As you know, over 800 million adults
are non-literate in the world.

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:44.060
Two out of three are women,

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:48.640
like Lucia who before
starting Cell-Ed have less

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:52.750
than a first-grade level
of education in her 40's.

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:56.990
After four months on our program,
not only did she learn to read

01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:59.190
and write, she asked for more.

01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:04.730
And that's why we designed English
on the go, vocational skills,

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:12.470
health, financial literacy
and other courses because one

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:16.070
in four Americans lack functional

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:20.480
and other essential skills
to navigate daily life.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.890
This is an incredible challenge
for all of us to overcome.

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:29.480
There's so many reasons
barriers exist.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.840
Less than 5% of adults
have access to classrooms.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.300
Less than a third have
access to the internet.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.760
And even if they do have access

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:46.210 position:56%
to the classrooms often the content
is just not relevant to their needs.

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:51.360
And really, that's why we
get personal at Cell-Ed.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.660
We want to know.

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:56.360 position:56%
We want to understand which each and
every one of our learner is needing.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.310
What is their specific
learning paying point?

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:01.390
What are their goals
for their learning?

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:05.580
And we can do this on any
mobile phone we can discover.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.790 position:56%
And be with each and every learner
where they're at and grow with them.

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:15.290
So that makes us disruptive.

01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:19.030
Because we need each learner where
they're at and offer them an access

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:23.700
on any mobile phone,
simple feature to smart.

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.500
And provide them a life coach.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:30.180 position:56%
They can have a two-way conversation
to make sure goals are reached.

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:36.320 position:56%
We are a bit different in our space.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.530
We're also disruptive because--

01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:42.110
and feel we can meet the needs
of low-literate learners.

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:45.660
We are a women and
minority-owned tech company.

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.080 position:56%
We're also a content design company.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.380
And we bring with us a lot
of experience over 20 years

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:53.890
in the field of trying to
bring relevant affordable

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:57.570
and accessible technologies
in over 50 countries.

01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:58.870
And we're interdisciplinary.

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:00.170
That's what's required.

01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:01.990
We have too many PhDs on staff.

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:03.290
I'm trying to remedy that.

01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:07.690
We have community practitioners,
teachers that we rely

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:11.360
on bilingual educators, native
speakers and we ourselves have

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.920
to hold to our own ethic.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.800
We are all mobile first as well.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.230
We are distributed team across
Canada and the United States.

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:20.160
And we have done this
work in over 50 countries.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.640
And we are so honored to
be able to do this work

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.440
across the United States today.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.850
We have right now over 20,000
on our system a little bit more

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:32.840
than what we have in our program
here for you and we look--

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.620 position:56%
we hope to reach millions more
obviously to our great partnerships.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:46.560
Because again, we are just a
click, text or phone call away.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:52.240
Learners appreciate Cell-Ed for a
few different reasons they tell us.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.950
One, that it's available any time,
in just three minutes or less,

01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:59.110
they can get a lesson
audio that they listen

01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:02.210
to in the two-way texting
and can reach their coach.

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:05.160
So they can do this in
between on their lunch break,

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.970
when picking up the children.

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:10.470
They can also let us know
what more they need to learn,

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:12.540
so that we could tailor
their learning.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.720
And so in this way, we're told
that it's been a God-send.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.240 position:56%
I can now study in the middle of the
night where my kids are sleeping.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.810
I can now do it when I'm on my bus,

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.090
if I have two to three
rides to get to school.

01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:26.640
We're flexible.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.870
I mentioned the course catalogue
that we have, but we also adapt

01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:33.300
and customize our content
to our incredible partners.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.440
For example, with the
state of New York,

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:39.120
we can provide customized
audio lessons and texts that go

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.050
out to our [inaudible] farm
workers, and other folks who are

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:45.650
on our system there for the
largest labor union the SEIU.

01:13:45.650 --> 01:13:48.750
We can for their health workers
customize some other content.

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.420
And then it could become
available to up

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.700
to a million members
very quickly and easily.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.700
It's a very adaptable,
flexible platform.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:59.240 position:56%
And we have a back end, so we can
track learner progress in real time.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:04.250
And we do every 30 days a rapid
prototyping and iteration models,

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:05.890
so that we improve our
program and service

01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:07.350
and direct response
to learner needs.

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:11.290
We think it's about time

01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:15.560
to give adult learners the best
we have to offer in Ed-tech.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.100
And we hope we're doing this and
taking a step in that direction

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.300
by making it fully accessible
universal access on any, you know,

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:27.050
to our courses by any mobile phone
and small bits of information

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:29.330
that can be gained in
a few minutes a day,

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:31.600
any time of the day is
our way of doing that.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.240
We also make sure you know
that small is very effective.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.980
People don't have the time
to get to a classroom.

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:38.310
They don't have an hour.

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:40.710
But in a couple minutes if you
can gain the skill you really need

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:45.240
and want, you can make to the next
rung of your own education goals.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.540
We're learner-directed.

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:49.020
We're mobile first but
we're learner-directed.

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.300
It's most important for us to
understand the needs of each

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.790
and every one of our learners
and to respond to them.

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:56.730
And our partner networks
who've been very fortunate

01:14:56.730 --> 01:15:00.770
to have large scale
partnerships from local to global,

01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:03.660
but most importantly,
with each of our learners.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.810
And with that, I certainly
hope you will join us

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:09.620
in mobilizing literacy
skills for all.

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.510
Thank you again for the
honor and to be among you.

01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:19.670
[ Applause ]

01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:22.330
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: There's such a
diversity in the program activities

01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:24.170
of the organizations
we're meeting today.

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:26.090
It's really, really fabulous.

01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:27.620
Very inspiring.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:32.170
And just, I hope gives us the sense
of the power and the magnitude

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:35.520
of what we can accomplish.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.590
Next up. Library for
all is represented today

01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:45.360 position:56%
by Tanyella Evans whose organization
provides an online digital library

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.030
provided to children and
developing countries.

01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:52.280 position:56%
The platforms works well on standard
telephones, tablets and computers

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.440
and is designed to be used
in low-bandwidth areas.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.780
Tanyella is a co-founder and CEO.

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.580
Welcome.

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:05.360
[ Applause ]

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.890
&gt;&gt; Tanyella Evans:
Thank you so much.

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:09.130
So our mission at "Library
For All" is

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:12.820
to make knowledge accessible
to all equally.

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:14.120
Sounds audacious, right.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:19.790
Especially in a time that we live
in where 215 million children

01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:22.850
across the developing world
are not learning the basics

01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:25.530
of how to read and write.

01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:29.780
Yeah, at "Library For All" we
are optimistic about the future.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.900
Like many of you here,
we know that six

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.790
of the seven billion mobile
phone subscribers live

01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:37.470
in developing countries.

01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:40.870
And we see this as
a huge opportunity

01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:45.550
to change the situation
that we currently face.

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:49.840
At "Library For All," we've
built a digital library platform

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:53.510
that makes Ebooks accessible
in low bandwidth environments

01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:59.200
on low-end devices including mobile
phones, tablets and in a browser.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.090
In building the library with
pilots in five countries,

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:06.880
we've made some remarkable
discoveries.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:12.170
Firstly, as my colleague
mentioned earlier in the research,

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:16.560
mother tongue books are the most
popular books in our library,

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.200
not only because they
increase literacy but actually

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.640
because there is a huge
demand for those books.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.170
This is our library platform.

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:31.390
This is graph from
our pilot in Cambodia.

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:34.810
We noticed initially in the
pilots that there was an increase

01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:38.190 position:56%
in reading but after about two
months, reading started to drop off.

01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:40.790
And we ask our partners,
"what's happening?

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.500
What's going on at the schools?"

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.940
They told us that the children

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.970
in the schools had read
every single combined book

01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:49.930 position:56%
on the library in just a few months.

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:53.580
So this is obviously a big
challenge but also an opportunity.

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:58.120
So, we know that we must work
to fill the virtual shelves

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:01.370
of this digital library
with relevant content,

01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:03.770
especially in the mother tongue.

01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.700
Secondly, we learned that "Library

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:09.780
For All" is having positive
unintended consequences

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:11.770 position:56%
on children's outlook on their life.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.610
For example, one of our
partners in Haiti works

01:18:14.610 --> 01:18:16.430
with former child slaves.

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:20.720
It's a practice in Haiti
that still continues today.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.200
And of the child advocates
Samuel told us about Jerry.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.540
When Jerry started the program, he
was so shy that he wouldn't read

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:33.630
at all, he wouldn't read in front
of his class and he was embarrassed

01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:34.960
that he didn't know how to read.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.140
Now today, Jerry is
so motivated to get up

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.960
and read aloud in front
of his class.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.460
And he just shared
with us just the change

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:45.700
in his self-esteem
and his confidence.

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.530
And this is the power
of reading, right.

01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:51.050
This is the power of books
that we all know the ability

01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:55.980
to just change a boy's life,
a young boy's life in Haiti

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:59.250
in the programs that
we're working in.

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:02.500
So, there is so much we
can learn about readers

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.400
in the developing world
to better serve them.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.850
We are delighted to be on our
tier today for our practice

01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:12.640
with many organizations in the
field that we know and respect.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.120
There's no way that we could
undertake this work alone.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:22.450
And I'm here fortunately also with
my board chair Philippa Tyndale,

01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:23.820
she's come from Australia.

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:29.740 position:56%
So which is not New Zealand we know
but she also has a wonderful accent.

01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:32.830
So please and speak to her.

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:36.490
We're based in New York
but we have a global team.

01:19:36.490 --> 01:19:39.510
And we invite all of
you also to become--

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:41.490
to be a part of a convening
that we're going

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:44.180
to bring together early
next year with our partners

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.570
at the New York public
library to talk

01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:49.900
about how we can achieve
this audacious goal.

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:55.320 position:56%
How we can scale up the plans to put
library in the hands of every person

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.230
on the planet regardless of
geography, income or ability.

01:19:59.230 --> 01:20:01.030
Thank you very much.

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:08.910
[ Applause ]

01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:10.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Thank you, Tanya.

01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:13.420
Well it's not lost on me that your
presentation was on your phone.

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:16.690
I'm still in the paper days.

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:21.910
Allison Kavanagh from
Rumie Initiative.

01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:23.440
It's a Canadian organization

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.470
that provides children
with mobile tablets.

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:29.130
They are preloaded
with lessons and books.

01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:35.050 position:56%
The books are sold at cost to NGOs
and partner organizations worldwide.

01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:37.540
And Allison is head of
operations for Rumie.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.510
Please welcome her now.

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:44.760
[ Applause ]

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.780
&gt;&gt; Allison Kavanagh: Thank you.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:48.080
Hello everyone.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.460 position:56%
I just want to start up by saying
what an honor it is to be here today

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.370
to be able to tell you
about our work at Rumie.

01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:57.900
We were founded n 2013 so,
we're a fairly young company

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.160
but we have done a lot in the short
period of time and I'm really happy

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.000
to be able to tell you about it.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.660
So what we do is we work
to organize the mass

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.450
of free-learning content
available online and deliver it

01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:12.590
to the people who need it most.

01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:13.950
And how do we do that?

01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:16.490
Well, with technology of course.

01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:20.510
When we saw that a tablet
hardware was available for $50,

01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:23.050
and all of this content
was available for free,

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:25.670
we knew that there was a
new solution to education

01:21:25.670 --> 01:21:29.780 position:56%
that could leapfrog over traditional
libraries and help bring access

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:33.300
to education to everyone
around the world.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:36.470
I want to play a short video
to show you one of our projects

01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:38.230
which actually takes
place in Toronto

01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:41.980
to teach English to
newcomers to Canada.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.480
OK. So the video didn't work.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.880 position:56%
But, it is available on our
Facebook and on our YouTube channel.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:00.770
So, if you have a chance to
see it, it's really inspiring.

01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:03.570
So the two economic trends
that we based our model off

01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:11.430
of are free digital leaning
content and low hardware costs.

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:15.750
We're also inspired by
one company, Wikipedia.

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:20.080 position:56%
In a short period of time, Wikipedia
use technology and the wisdom

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:23.550
of the crowd to create something
that used to cost thousands

01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:26.970
of dollars completely for free.

01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:31.140
So now anyone can go online and
access an Encyclopedia for free

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:34.350
and learn essentially anything
what they want to know.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:37.030
And by engaging the crowd to create
that, they were able to do it

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:41.040
in an astoundingly
short period of time.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.630
Inspired by Wikipedia, we created
a website called the LearnCloud,

01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:50.950
which is an online platform
where we're organizing all topics

01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:52.960
of learning content
into lesson plans.

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:57.540
So you can go online and find the
top-rated content in any subject

01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.900
and actually use it yourself.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:02.670
This is available as an
application and it's also

01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:07.450
where we find the content
to put on our tablets.

01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:09.640
Best of all, we engage people

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.760
to help us source content
for the tablets.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:16.100
So for all of our projects, we'll
list the topics that we're looking

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:20.650
for and then engage teams of
students at universities including

01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:26.330 position:56%
at George Washington University here
in DC to actually find this content.

01:23:27.450 --> 01:23:30.060
Then we worked with
NGOs around the world

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:34.090
who are already running programs on
the ground to actually, you know,

01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:39.030
make sure that all the content fits
their needs, matches their syllabi

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:42.410
and it's appropriate
for their local context.

01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:44.500
And by working with
existing frameworks

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.950
and engaging skilled volunteers,
we've been able to expand

01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:51.010
to 20 countries in
less than three years.

01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:55.870
And here are some photos
from our projects.

01:23:55.870 --> 01:24:00.790
Some of our projects include
students in Liberia who used

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:03.580
to be child soldiers and
are now being rehabilitated

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:07.840
to learn vocational skills,
English and healthcare knowledge.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.830
Other projects include programs
for Syrian refugees and Turkey

01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:15.320
and Lebanon, where millions
of children are at risk

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.530
of becoming a lost generation.

01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:20.430 position:56%
We're also doing programs in Canada.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:24.440
In the city of Toronto where
students don't have great access

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.000
to education or after school
programs, as well as in north,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.460
where students don't have
access to the internet

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.830
and are therefore losing out
on a lot of this knowledge

01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:37.030
that we take for granted.

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:39.800
We measure impact through
technology.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.600
So with our tablets, we have
device analytics that track impact

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.150
in individual student progress.

01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:48.240
Here's a picture of
a child in Guatemala

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.940
where we're running a literacy
program in rural schools

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:54.370
for students to learn how to
read and write in Spanish.

01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:57.430
We've heard great, great
feedback from this project and one

01:24:57.430 --> 01:25:00.760
of the most exciting
features in my opinion is

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.650
that these students are bringing
the tablets home to teach their--

01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:08.180 position:56%
to read with their younger siblings,
their parents are often illiterate,

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:12.150
and essentially making reading a
part of the family environment.

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:17.460 position:56%
Here's Haya [assumed spelling] who's
a Syrian refugee living in Turkey.

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.420
And some of the impact that
we've seen in our project

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:24.550
with Syrian refugees is that not
only are the resources helping

01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:27.140
improve numeracy and
literacy outcomes,

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:30.590
but they're also inspiring
kids to come out of their shell

01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:34.670
and socialize more with a
positive impact on mental health.

01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:37.330
They're also lettings
schools take on more students

01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:40.430
within their existing capacity
which is extremely necessarily

01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:43.550
with the size of the problem there.

01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:47.290
And they're also letting students
both work and go to school

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:49.300
on their own time, so
they don't have to choose

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.490
between supporting their family
and pursuing their education.

01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:56.370
And finally, with the
analytics, we can be sure

01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:59.210
that girls are getting access
to the resources as much

01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:01.800
as their male counterparts.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.510
Thank you for very much.

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:12.210
[ Applause ]

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:14.510
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Wow.

01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:18.430
So one of the-- again, one

01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:21.270
of our best practice areas
is mobile devices and use

01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:22.570
of them in promoting literacy.

01:26:22.570 --> 01:26:28.340
It's just amazing to see
what's possible really is.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:32.180
So, our next presenter,
New York City,

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:36.160
Department of Homeless Services
represented by Karen Shaffer.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.460
The department has established
30-shelter-based libraries

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:44.430
to make reading materials and
educational activities available

01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:47.150
to children and families
who lived in shelters.

01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:51.410
And these libraries served
about 4,900 children.

01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:53.910
Karen is the director
of Homeless Services.

01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:56.510
Please welcome her
and her colleague.

01:26:56.510 --> 01:27:03.060
[ Applause ]

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:04.360
&gt;&gt; Karen Shaffer: Good morning.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.210
We are so honored to be here today.

01:27:06.210 --> 01:27:09.950
I'm joined with my
colleagues, Susana Vilardell.

01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:15.720
We are extremely excited because as
others have said, partnerships is

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.220
so important in resonating
throughout today's events.

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:22.660
And I think one of our tremendous
partners has been from Scholastic,

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.680
I saw Korina Palin [assumed
spelling] here today,

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.980
vice president.

01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:29.500
And we thank her so
much for her support.

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.430
Our project actually came
out of the Mayor's office.

01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:36.650
Mayor de Blasio had created the
children's cabinet comprised

01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:41.100
of 24-city agencies that actually
had brought together different

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:44.200
initiatives concentrating
on children's needs.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.240
And one of the key initiatives
of course was literacy.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.380
And we had launched our
library project in 2014,

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:53.160
and I'll let Susana
explain more about it,

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.720
but it has been a very
exciting year.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.350
Thank you.

01:28:02.130 --> 01:28:03.470
&gt;&gt; Susana Vilardell: Hi everyone.

01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:04.910
My name is Susana Vilardell.

01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:07.080
I'm the director of
educational services

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.870
at the Department of
Homeless Services.

01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:13.340
So-- And such an incredible
huge system as New York City,

01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:18.210
we have 20,000 students
living in temporary house

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:20.120
and residing in our shelters.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:24.510
And we are think-- we thought
about what would be the best way

01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:28.070
to bring literacy resources to our
shelters where there is of course,

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:32.330 position:56%
resources and what would be the best
way to create a sustainable program.

01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:36.830
So this is how the family
shelter library pilot was created.

01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:40.400
The goal was to really
increase literacy resources

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.740
to all our shelters.

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:45.130
We started with 20 shelters,
we're now at 30 shelters.

01:28:45.130 --> 01:28:48.010
We increase the number
of books all donated

01:28:48.010 --> 01:28:51.510
by various partners
such as Scholastic.

01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:54.810
We also had a relationship with
New York City Service to partner

01:28:54.810 --> 01:29:00.690
with them to bring volunteers to
provide services to the children

01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:03.900
because our shelter directors
are obviously very busy trying

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.170
to help families move
into permanent housing.

01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:08.120
So there is not a lot
of staff in the shelters

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.100
to support the unique needs of
students in temporary housing.

01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:17.300
Also, part of the goal was
to link our shelter staff

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:19.630
and families to the local braches.

01:29:19.630 --> 01:29:22.750
So we've partnered with
New York public library,

01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:25.680
the Brooklyn public library
and the Queens public library.

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.600
The librarians for the different
branches near to the shelters,

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:34.970
visited the shelters once a
week or maybe once a month

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:39.790
to create various events such
as library cards, reading--

01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:43.360
read alouds and other, you know,

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.110
opportunities for also
parents to be involved.

01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:51.750 position:56%
And we also-- As part of this pilot,

01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:56.670
we wanted to have a very strong
focus on education because children

01:29:56.670 --> 01:30:02.110
who are in temporary housing
perform absolutely much less

01:30:02.110 --> 01:30:04.360
than their permanently house peers.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.110
They don't do well in math but
specifically they don't do well

01:30:08.110 --> 01:30:10.790
in reading, into the ELA testing.

01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:13.380
So that's why we wanted
to focus on reading.

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:19.780
Some of the successes that we have
with our program, it's expanding

01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:23.720
because we have invited more
partners to be part of this effort

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.460 position:56%
such as the Department of Education.

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:30.300
We partnered with various--
with Scholastica as we mentioned

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.220
and now we-- the Scholastica
has donated

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.750
over 3000 books to our Shelters.

01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:40.490
We also worked with other-- the
private sector to give book cases,

01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:44.450
book shelves to the Shelters
to create their libraries.

01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:50.040
And also, we invited the
community to be part of this pilot.

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:54.780
As I said we recruited
volunteers through the community.

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.730
And we also partnered
with St. John's University

01:30:57.730 --> 01:31:01.010
to create volunteer opportunities
at one of our shelters.

01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:03.400
Through these partnerships
with the local libraries,

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:10.220
we were able to bring and promote
technology and computer access

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:12.520
because a lot of the
shelters don't have computer,

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:17.260
so the families would be able to
go to access a computers there.

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:21.110
You can see all the
successes here in the screen.

01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:26.860
Here are some photos of our program
of our event and the goal also was

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:30.670
to increase literacy for
babies because our parents,

01:31:30.670 --> 01:31:33.110
the head of cases in the shelters,

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:35.840
half of them don't even
have a high school diploma.

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.680
So they're not going to be
able to read to their babies.

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.050
And this of course creates
an issue with baby vocabulary

01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:46.740
when they're going to Pre-K they
have, you know, a disadvantage

01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:49.540
in comparison to the
rest of the children.

01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:54.070
Finally, we created our
Family Shelter Library Toolkit

01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:58.560
to provide the shelters, you know,
to empower them to create a library

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.430
in their building so what
would that look like, you know,

01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:05.530
to create a mission
statement, acquire materials,

01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:07.930
program services et cetera.

01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:10.140
So we're very excited to be here.

01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:11.680
These are our contact information.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.280
We would love to partner with you
and looking forward to meeting all

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.930
of you for the rest of the day.

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.730
Thank you so much.

01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:24.720
[ Applause ]

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:28.630
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Wow,
20,000 homeless children.

01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:36.080
So we're actually winding down
towards our last presenter but one

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.360
of the things I wanted to
mention, a couple people had asked

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:42.220
for the opportunity to have a
bit of a dialogue, and so we do--

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:45.250
we will have time for that after
our last presenter, an opportunity

01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:47.990
to have a quick Q&amp;A and I'll
just kind of be across the room.

01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:51.510
So for those of you who had
been wondering and speculating

01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:53.810
and wanting to ask
somebody something who is

01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:57.920
at the microphone earlier, your
chance to do so is coming shortly.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:01.040
But first, let me introduce
Nancy Dupree

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.600
of the Afghanistan Center
at Kabul University.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:09.430
The Center was founded in 1989 in
Pakistan to serve Afghan refugees

01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:13.120
and it's now based at Kabul
University serving both refugees

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.390
and those living in Afghanistan.

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:17.160 position:56%
Nancy is the director of the center.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.960
Please welcome her.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:25.110
[ Applause ]

01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:28.550
&gt;&gt; Nancy Dupree: Good morning
or good afternoon everybody.

01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:32.440
It's a pleasure to
be invited to speak

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.140
in this very [inaudible] setting.

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:39.930
I'm very honored and
pleased to be with you.

01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:49.180
My proud chart is a box libraries
that are filled with about 200--

01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:52.880
originally, with 200
books and they go

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:58.910
out into the rural
areas of Afghanistan.

01:33:58.910 --> 01:34:04.760 position:56%
I got this idea when we were working
with the refugees in Pakistan.

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:11.000
And I noticed that in the schools,
the students were receiving lots

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:18.050
of history, Arab history, Pakistani
history but no Afghan history.

01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:24.190
And this were it may because I
thought these young people were not

01:34:24.190 --> 01:34:28.850
developing any sense of
belonging to Afghanistan.

01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:31.170
They didn't know about
their culture.

01:34:31.170 --> 01:34:33.840
They didn't know about
their environment.

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:39.360
And I thought when they return
this would be disastrous

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:45.650
because they were also not allowed
to farm in the refugee camps.

01:34:45.650 --> 01:34:50.200
So these were rural people,
rural young people going back

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:56.730 position:56%
to rural areas without knowing how
to take care of any kind of farming.

01:34:56.730 --> 01:35:06.860
So, we created in 1996, something
called a Boxed Library Extension.

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:12.070
We publish books there
for new literates.

01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:20.000
There are lots and lots of literacy
courses, too many literacy courses

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.770
and when you ask them
what did they give them

01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:27.700
to read, not by mandate I said.

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:31.190
I said sir, you know,
if you'll change them

01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:34.180
and then you don't give them
something to read, they are going

01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:36.720
to lose this skill that they are--

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.440
and all your work will
fail, not by mandate.

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:47.730
Well, I though it was
by mandate so we started

01:35:47.730 --> 01:35:56.090
and we established a committee
to supervise the production

01:35:56.090 --> 01:36:01.650
of small books, no more than a
100 pages which got us into a lot

01:36:01.650 --> 01:36:05.000
of trouble in the beginning
because the authors would say,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.380
my subject, I need 500 pages.

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:12.800
But if you give a new
literate 500 page book,

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.330
they're not going to touch it.

01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:20.610
But a 100 pages with nicely
illustrated, they will pick up.

01:36:20.610 --> 01:36:30.710
And we have now 252 of these mobile
libraries out in the countryside,

01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:36.170
in the provinces and all 34
provinces of Afghanistan.

01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:38.940
Some of the provinces
don't have them.

01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:43.470
Only have one or two because
the security is still too bad.

01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:54.090 position:56%
But the 252 are accountable for able
150,000 books that are out there

01:36:54.090 --> 01:36:56.200
where there no were
any books before.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:03.630
And we get all kinds of
enthusiastic letters,

01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:09.430
because providing knowledge
is important.

01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:16.690
And encouraging the culture
of reading is also important.

01:37:16.690 --> 01:37:20.610
There's nobody there before
because there weren't any books.

01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:26.440
However, there is one dimension
which most of the people working

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:37.100
in Afghanistan and that that is
the books create an improvement

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:44.520
and enhancement of
confidence, their ego boosted.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:48.100
And I think that is
very, very important.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:51.840
For instance, there was
one man who wrote to us

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.150
and said his orchard
was not doing very well.

01:37:56.150 --> 01:38:01.520
And then he got an aid book
that taught him about grafting,

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:07.960
taught him about trimming, taught
him about irrigation, fertilizer

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:13.340
and now his or orchard is
blooming and above that,

01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:17.620
he has become the expert
of his province.

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:22.580
People come from all over
the province to consult him

01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.600
and that's certainly ego-boosting.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:30.580
Donors always ask us,
what's your impact?

01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:32.030
They want statistics.

01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:37.790
Well, I can tell them how many
books we have out there and so

01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:44.190
and so forth, but though one high
school girl said her illiterate

01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:49.940
family asked her to bring books
home so she can read to them

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:53.380
and the neighbors pass on
the information to neighbors

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:56.570
and they have a great
time discussing the books.

01:38:56.570 --> 01:39:05.270
So I think that our project is only
a drop in the bucket obviously.

01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:08.850
But there are other
NGO, if not others.

01:39:08.850 --> 01:39:10.320
I'm not an NGO.

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.760
Well, other if-- there are
other NGOs that are following,

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:17.500
buying our books, following
our system,

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:22.630
so I have no idea how many
books but it is just many,

01:39:22.630 --> 01:39:26.300
many thousand where there
were no books before.

01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:31.550
So we thank you very much for
your support and thank you

01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:34.720
for listening to us today.

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.520
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Wow.

01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:59.750
So she said, ego boasting and
what I heard most is empowered.

01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:01.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:40:01.050 --> 01:40:05.290
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Just what it
means to certain people young

01:40:05.290 --> 01:40:07.380
and old to be empowered,

01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:14.560
to live lives of choice,
because they can read.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:21.480
Wow. Sorry, some of these
folks know I cry all the time.

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.340
This program and this work
is so moving and so powerful.

01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:27.590
And I'm just thrilled to be
in this conversation with you.

01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:30.820 position:56%
And, now it's time to ask questions.

01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:35.240
So, we have two microphone
runners, Ania [assumed spelling]

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:37.000
and Ricardo come forward.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.070
They will-- if you have a
question, raise your hand,

01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:41.260
they're going to bring you
the mic and Vida is going

01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.630
to actually bring the
mic the person you would

01:40:43.630 --> 01:40:45.710
like to ask the question of.

01:40:45.710 --> 01:40:47.900
So who's got a question?

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:49.200
Yes, Timothy.

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.690
So Timothy who's your question for?

01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:52.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Timothy Ireland: Library for all.

01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:55.420
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Library for all,
so Vida if you could come this way

01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:00.170
and bring the microphone to
Tanyella that would be great.

01:41:00.170 --> 01:41:04.010
Isn't on? OK, is yours on?

01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:06.090

It's very interested--

01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:08.000
it's been a fascinating morning.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.170
Then the desire to talk with
everybody afterwards and to be able

01:41:14.170 --> 01:41:18.630
to build bridges and to be able
to delve into the experiences

01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:21.070
which are being presented, but
I was particularly interested

01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:22.760
in the question of
the digital library.

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:27.400
We've been working on the
digital library for workers,

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.020
or for people who are with low
reading and writing skills,

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:38.430
such as the ideas to have a library
which doesn't depend on reading

01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:42.130
on having words as classifications.

01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:45.130
So I'd be very interested
to know in what--

01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:49.720
when you talk about your digital
library, isn't meant for people

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.500
who already read and write or for
those who don't read and write

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:57.830
and a little more about so that
we couldn't stop the conversation.

01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:59.130
&gt;&gt; Tanyella Evans: Absolutely.

01:41:59.130 --> 01:42:02.100
Thank you for the question.

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.800
You know, it's really
interesting that you've raised

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.990
that because I think that we see
ourselves as part of the solution.

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:13.290
I didn't touch on this but
we don't give out devices,

01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:17.540
we don't really implement our
own programs except in Haiti

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.890
where we started and
wanted to learn.

01:42:19.890 --> 01:42:22.430
So we always work in
partnership with organizations

01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:24.370
that are focused on literacy.

01:42:24.370 --> 01:42:27.870
Actually, we worked
with Sipar in Cambodia.

01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:31.870
We worked through the First
Lady's Foundation in Rwanda.

01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:34.640
She is focused on creating
a culture of reading.

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:37.250
So I think that the library--
we see ourselves kind of a--

01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:42.230
almost as a service provider if you
are focused on providing literacy,

01:42:42.230 --> 01:42:46.730
but don't have content in
local languages for example

01:42:46.730 --> 01:42:48.820
or even English or French.

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:51.720
We have a lot of international
languages as well,

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.890
then Library For All is a resource
for you to do your work better.

01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:58.580
So for example in Haiti, we
have the largest collection,

01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:01.350
now digital collection of
content in Haitian Creole,

01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:03.440
we have a large collection
in Kenya-Rwanda.

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:09.810
And we see our role as partnering
with libraries in country as well

01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:14.550
as here to digitize content
and make that available.

01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:15.850
Although, we don't think

01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:19.910
that we will ever become
a self-learning platform.

01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:25.480
We do want to start
incorporating technology

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:29.710
that will enable more
self-learning and more support

01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:31.960
for those with early literacy.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.950
So very simply, we could
start with audio, right?

01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:39.190
Audio can also-- holds a lot a
promise because it can be used

01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:41.120
in low bandwidth environments.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.470
Videos are a lot more challenging.

01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:45.630
So that's one of the first
things we've been thinking

01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:48.600
about is how we can incorporate
audios that people can listen

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.740
to the books while they're reading.

01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.540
The other things we've
been talking to,

01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:57.380
a company that's created
software that lays over the book

01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:02.240
and analyzes the texts and then
creates, generates question--

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:04.450
comprehension questions
at the end of the book.

01:44:04.450 --> 01:44:10.320
So that's another way that we
could support our readers, again,

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:14.940 position:56%
not replacing librarians or teachers
or our community partners but,

01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:18.270
you know, support readers as
they're using the software,

01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:22.940
using the library to actually
gain basically literacy skills.

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:26.660
Does that answer, some of
what you're thinking, yeah?

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.960
Thank you.

01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.260
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Great.

01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:30.560
Thank you.

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.510
Next question, questions here
and who is your question of?

01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:37.090
[ Inaudible Remarks ]

01:44:37.090 --> 01:44:41.880
&gt;&gt; So question for the group
from Aotearoa from New Zealand?

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:43.330
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson:
Where is-- oh, back.

01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:44.630
I'm sorry.

01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:48.570
I couldn't find where Niki went.

01:44:48.570 --> 01:44:51.940
&gt;&gt; OK. I just Keora [assumed
spelling] and so welcome.

01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:54.700
I just want to ask
how you are working

01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:58.170
with Maori on your initiatives?

01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:00.610
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: So, oh.

01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:01.910
&gt;&gt; Nicola McCartney: Yes, we're on?

01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:03.210
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Yup.

01:45:03.210 --> 01:45:05.490
&gt;&gt; Nicola McCartney: Thanks
for the question Keora.

01:45:05.490 --> 01:45:09.840
Maoris, regardless-- the
[inaudible] group I've represented

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.940
without literacy in New
Zealand, and so there are

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:16.580
at many special initiatives
that are happening in addition

01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:20.790
to the mainstream initiatives
that we have.

01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:22.090
So there are different things

01:45:22.090 --> 01:45:25.720
for Maori-Pacific tribes
training for example.

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:31.370
The specific professional
development for educators

01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:34.680
of Maori and for Maori educators.

01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:40.890
So, the [inaudible] world is very
lively and it's a different one,

01:45:40.890 --> 01:45:43.710
again a symposium being held
around the country as well.

01:45:43.710 --> 01:45:48.380
So, represented at the moment
through literacy Aotearoa

01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:55.510
and through Ako Aotearoa if you
know both of those organizations.

01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:58.840
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:04.790
No. No, the New Zealand government
decided that even though we started

01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:10.310
in 2005 or 2009 at the national
scene, not 1963 is approach--

01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:16.750
[inaudible] but in 2009, we started
as literacy language and numeracy.

01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:23.590
And by 2011, the language had
come out and have been substituted

01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:25.770
by the umbrella literacy.

01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:29.190
And so done in English.

01:46:29.190 --> 01:46:33.370
We question that, we
don't-- we don't actually--

01:46:33.370 --> 01:46:38.690
Maori is an official
language of the country,

01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:44.090
so it's a political issue
right at this very moment.

01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:46.490 position:56%
Thank you for raising that question.

01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:47.930
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Thank you.

01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:50.920
Time for one more question.

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:55.250
But we've also set a time
for one-on-ones too, so,

01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:58.910
was there one last question we
should entertain for the big room?

01:46:58.910 --> 01:47:03.050
Yes? So is the microphone
back there?

01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:06.140
And who's your question for?

01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:10.590
&gt;&gt; My question is for library for
all, although there might be some

01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:13.250
of the other organizations
that could,

01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:15.310
some of the other people
chimed in on it.

01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:18.550 position:56%
But, I'm Judy from SIL International

01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:22.610
and you mentioned specifically
mother tongue books are the

01:47:22.610 --> 01:47:23.910
most in-demand.

01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:25.560
And there were a couple
other presenters

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.340
that alluded to the same issue.

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:29.300
I'd love to hear from you.

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:36.570
But, I am wondering what are you
doing for those language groups

01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:40.090
for which there is very,
very little written.

01:47:40.090 --> 01:47:45.110
What are you doing to find
them and resolve that issue?

01:47:45.110 --> 01:47:47.210
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:47:47.210 --> 01:47:49.510
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Push up.

01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:55.220
&gt;&gt; Allison Kavanagh: I would shout
but I think I have a quiet voice.

01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:58.940
OK. And I'm happy to pass this
over to any of the other speakers,

01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.770
because a lot of us were talking
about mother tongue content.

01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:06.000 position:56%
As you know the recent research from
UNESCO, shows that if children learn

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.750
to read in their local language
first, they're much more likely

01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:12.720
to gain literacy in the
language of instruction.

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.360
And this is being the
kind of brain wave really.

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.540
Things that educators
and librarians have known

01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:21.410
for a long time is now
proven in the research

01:48:21.410 --> 01:48:28.710
and it's impacting the sustainable
development goals impacting USA,

01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:32.900
these are agendas they look
to solve this challenge

01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:36.230
of 250 million children not
learning how to read and write even

01:48:36.230 --> 01:48:38.410
after four years at school.

01:48:38.410 --> 01:48:41.560
So, you raised a good question,
the biggest challenge that we face

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:44.660
in our work is the
content supply chain.

01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:50.340
So, those students at our program
in Cambodia have read through all

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:53.060
of the content in Khmer
and it's very challenging

01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.270
for us to get more content.

01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:59.140
It's the biggest challenge, and
I won't say that we've solved it.

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:04.320
And that's why we're starting to
have some of these conversations,

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.130
bringing all the groups together,
let's have some round tables

01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:11.100
about this, because it's not
something we can solve alone.

01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:16.140
We actually pay local publishers,
a license fee for their content.

01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:19.320
So we license content.

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:23.190
You know, normally that should be
the role of the National Library,

01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:25.860
right although Ministry of
Education to license content,

01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:28.230
that will be available nationally.

01:49:28.230 --> 01:49:31.140
So, we need to think
beyond that model.

01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:35.360
I have a crazy idea that we could
use the part of the community

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:38.250
in crowd as my colleague
at Rumie said.

01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:41.480
What about if we could create
a platform that would enable us

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.880
to crowdsource this content.

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:48.490
I was speaking to a colleague at
the Department of State yesterday

01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:51.880
who did something similar for
film so he open up this platform

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.380
and invited people
from all over the world

01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:58.870
to submit content for
a film festival.

01:49:58.870 --> 01:50:03.380
He had since September 1st
he's had 1400 submissions

01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:09.060
of film short films show on
an iPhone from 90 countries.

01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:12.610
And now of course the challenge
there is quality, right?

01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:15.130
Because we don't believe
in putting a lot

01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:17.740
of content that's not
good on the library.

01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:21.960
We have a very strict QA process
with a content advisory board

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.260
that reviews that everything.

01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:27.730
We only have 3,000 titles on the
library for that reason of quality.

01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:30.140
But, is there something
that we can do where we can

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:34.130
at least generate this supply
of content from the Diaspora

01:50:34.130 --> 01:50:36.040
from individuals living
in these countries

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:39.450
and then create a system
to edit that content?

01:50:39.450 --> 01:50:42.550
So, we invite all of you to
come and talk to us about this.

01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:46.430
Maybe you want to work with this
on that idea or have another idea

01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:49.480
because we-- it's a really
huge challenge and something

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.960
that we need to work on and so.

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:54.260
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Alright, good.

01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:55.560
Thank you.

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.200
And we have one last-- Dan you want

01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:59.510
to take the last question
or are you responding?

01:50:59.510 --> 01:51:03.380
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:04.680
Yeah. Yeah.

01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:06.420
Anya's bringing the microphone now.

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:10.900
This will be our last discussion
point then we'll take a break

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:12.560
and we'll have a couple
of house keeping items.

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:13.860
Go.

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:15.420
&gt;&gt; Dan Wagner: So, I really
appreciate this last set

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:16.720
of comments.

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:20.260
It's certainly central to a lot
of the discussions that take place

01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:23.460
at the UN around sustainable
development goals and so on.

01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:28.320
I think that one of the things
that came through when every one

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.420
of the presentations today
was how important was to focus

01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:34.170
on which target population
you're talking about.

01:51:34.170 --> 01:51:38.060
Whether it's kids or it's
adults or it's in Khmer or it's

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.450
in French or it's in Creole.

01:51:40.450 --> 01:51:46.980
But I think in the space where we
are now, I would say to my point

01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:52.740 position:56%
of view, we have to be even more
careful about our target population.

01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:55.640
So that-- I especially I say
this to my friends who work

01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:58.670
in the IT sector which I also do.

01:51:58.670 --> 01:52:04.150
When you crowdsource, it greatly
depended on who that crowd is.

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:10.250
And that crowd is not
necessarily able to know

01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:13.150
which target populations
are the most in need.

01:52:13.150 --> 01:52:16.030
Really it's a little bit to
Timothy's question earlier about,

01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:17.330
"are you teaching literacy

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:20.100
or are you simply providing
content-- library content?"

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:25.600
And I think to my mind, you know,
this is a group of people many

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:29.160 position:56%
of whom care a lot about Literacy
and we're still working on the field

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:31.520
and investing a lot
of time and energy.

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:41.390
I think we need to as a group
make sure we know where we--

01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:44.330
where our compared advantage is.

01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:47.110
But also, be careful
not to over claim.

01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:50.830
That happened, you know, years
ago when I started in this field.

01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:55.250
You know, if you-- you felt
like if you were a good person,

01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:57.440
that was good enough that anyone.

01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:00.290
Remember the old phrase,
"Each one teach one".

01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:02.480 position:56%
Those programs did not work too well

01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:06.340
because each one wasn't really
able to teach the other one.

01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:07.860
Because there's a lot missing.

01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:10.730
We are very limited
in our own skills.

01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:13.160
And even crowds are
limited in their skills.

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:17.340 position:56%
So just a point saying, there is a
lot of really great work to be done.

01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:21.650
And so, I am impressed by all
these different initiatives.

01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:26.700
I'm just asking for us to be even
more careful as we move forward

01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:31.670
about which groups we think can
benefit from which approaches

01:53:31.670 --> 01:53:33.820
that we're able to deliver.

01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.120
&gt;&gt;Pamela Jackson: A strange advice.

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.420
Thank you.

01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:39.960
And it's perfect for a post-it
on my white board in the back.

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:43.030
So make sure you guys
contribute you ideas there.

01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:44.330
So let me say thank you.

01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:47.880
I think that it is our goal, it
is our mission here at the Library

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.730 position:56%
of Congress with the Literacy Awards
Program to know who's out there,

01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:53.830
what are they doing,
and who they're serving.

01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:56.110
And then to make sure
that they know each other.

01:53:56.110 --> 01:53:57.410
Some of you already do.

01:53:57.410 --> 01:53:59.970
Some of you are making
new friends today.

01:53:59.970 --> 01:54:04.470
It's clear that there are
comparative advantages

01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:05.840
that you all have.

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:07.140
That you are developing.

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:10.090
They're profound and very
significant and remarkable.

01:54:10.090 --> 01:54:12.910
And we're very glad to be
able to know more about you.

01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:15.830
To have you be with us and to
share amongst this community.

01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:19.920
I would like to take this moment to
do a couple of housekeeping things.

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:25.400
So we are going to break lunches--
lunch will be available at noon

01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:27.970
and so the set up for
that is going to start.

01:54:27.970 --> 01:54:31.840
We do have certificates to give
to our best practice honorees,

01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:35.370
so we'd like to do that
now and take advantage

01:54:35.370 --> 01:54:37.210
of the time for a quick photo up.

01:54:37.210 --> 01:54:41.700
For those of you who need to take
a break-- remember there-- the--

01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:45.920 position:56%
you can feel free to do that while
we actually ask the honorees to stay

01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.780
for their certificates and
reconvene here at noon.

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:51.300
We do want to do--
make sure you remember

01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:52.930
to do a couple of things though.

01:54:52.930 --> 01:54:55.930
Write your reflection note.

01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:57.550
Think of your other questions.

01:54:57.550 --> 01:55:00.790
We invite you to sit
somewhere else for lunch.

01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:03.930
Meet somebody new.

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:08.320
And give us your post-it note
feedback at the back of the room.

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.390
Also remember that
there are some displays.

01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:13.340
Some of the organizations will
be available to share more

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:15.390
about themselves at
the display tables

01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:17.970
in the room that's adjacent to us.

01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:21.720
We're calling that LJ 113 it's
also the Woodrow Wilson Collection,

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:24.660
so you can browse the
books in there too.

01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:26.900
They're behind closed
glass door there.

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:31.200
So at this time, if I
could do to ask Ricardo

01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:33.140
and Anya to come and help me.

01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:36.290
And then we'll have the honorees--

01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:37.880
we'll call you out and
ask you to come forward

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:41.090
to receive your certificates
and stay for a group shot.

01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:42.910
And I need your help
if you could stay.

01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:45.940
Is Shawn [assumed spelling]
here, Shawn Miller?

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:50.190
OK Ricardo and Anya
you can come on up.

01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:55.650 position:56%
Alright has everyone got their shot?

01:55:55.650 --> 01:55:56.950
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:58.250
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Alright great.

01:55:58.250 --> 01:56:00.050

01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:08.420
So thank you so much
for-- really it was--

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:11.860
been a fabulous conversation
thus far and a really great day.

01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:14.460
We've been joined by some
new guests this afternoon

01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:16.630
for the second half of our program.

01:56:16.630 --> 01:56:20.450
And to kind of get our orientation,
I would like just to take a moment

01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:22.640
to acknowledge again
who's in the room.

01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:27.830
So if I could for a moment have
the best practice honorees stand

01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:30.850
and let's acknowledge them in their
presentations and contribution--

01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:32.650
contributions this morning.

01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:44.290

and the honorees that
were-- the individual--

01:56:51.170 --> 01:56:54.630
the organizations that
were selected were done

01:56:54.630 --> 01:56:56.200
so with the selection communities

01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:58.300
that spent an enormous amount
of time and dedication.

01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:01.430
So I'd like to acknowledge
you all and have you stand.

01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:10.510
[ Applause ]

01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:11.810
Thank you so much.

01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:14.070
And again, I mentioned
this morning we are--

01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:17.270
I'm Pam Jackson, I should
have mentioned that,

01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:20.090

01:57:39.670 --> 01:57:41.210
And Eugene Flanagan,

01:57:41.210 --> 01:57:43.010
So, thank you for being with us.

01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:47.380
[ Applause ]

01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:49.640
And I just-- I just want to
re-reiterate there is just--

01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:54.350 position:56%
it's absolutely perfect that we have
the international and national scope

01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:55.930
that we have in the room.

01:57:55.930 --> 01:57:59.100
From Afghanistan to Brazil
to New Zealand to Canada

01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:01.400
and then throughout the
states here in America.

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:04.350
It's just the most fabulous
conversation we've had

01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:07.140
and it continues.

01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:10.550
So, let me now t urn to our
afternoon guest and to say,

01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:14.920 position:56%
it is my privilege and my honor to
introduce the Librarian of Congress,

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:20.240 position:56%

welcome us to the afternoon program.

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.770

&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And good afternoon.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:30.020
And this is truly a joy for me.

01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:33.730
I hope that you have
enjoyed your lunch

01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:35.410
and getting to meet each other.

01:58:35.410 --> 01:58:39.660
This is such an impressive group
of people who are gathered from all

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:47.880 position:56%
over the world to celebrate literacy
and to really recommit to the idea

01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:52.270
that learning to read as
Frederick Douglas said,

01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:55.680
will make you forever free.

01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:58.950
I extend my congratulations
to all of the winners

01:58:58.950 --> 01:59:03.520
and the best practice honorees as
well as the extraordinary members

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:07.480
of the Literacy awards
advisory board.

01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:08.940
Could you guys stand up again?

01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:11.510 position:56%
This was a hard thing for you to do.

01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:19.480
[ Applause ]

01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:21.060
Thank you.

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:27.480 position:56%
And of course, we can't thank David
Rubenstein enough for his generosity

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:29.150
in creating these awards

01:59:29.150 --> 01:59:32.150
and supporting it for
the past four years.

01:59:32.150 --> 01:59:36.070
He is a true reliever
in the power of word.

01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:38.880 position:56%
He has not only created this program

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.600
but has also been the
primary supporter

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:45.430
of the National Book Festival
which was successfully held

01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:51.340
for the 16th time this month
with more than 120 authors

01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:55.860
and over 100,000 attendees
in one day.

01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:57.660
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:09.220
Now, you'll also know that he
is very generous doing something

02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:10.640
and being present.

02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:12.500
And that's giving his time.

02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:18.510
So please join me in welcoming here
today, Mister David Rubenstein.

02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:25.410
[ Applause ]

02:00:25.410 --> 02:00:27.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Well, thank
you very much and welcome everybody.

02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:29.340
It's my pleasure to be here.

02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:32.180
As some of you probably
know, I grow up in Baltimore.

02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:35.560
And in Baltimore, the public
libraries called the Enoch Pratt

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:38.890
Free Library named
after Enoch Pratt.

02:00:38.890 --> 02:00:43.270
And it was that library that
I got my first library card.

02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:45.710
And when I was I think in the 5th--

02:00:45.710 --> 02:00:49.060
or in five or six years old that
they had a system there maybe--

02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:50.360
where you can go to a library,

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:53.600
you get your library card I
think when you're five or six.

02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.790
But in the system they had in
Baltimore, then you can only take

02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:58.470
out I this it was 12 books a week.

02:00:58.470 --> 02:01:01.590 position:56%
So I would go and take my 12 books
and I would read them the first day,

02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.560
but I have to wait to the
next week before I can go back

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:04.860
and get more books.

02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:07.130
So, it was like conversion
process, but it worked out.

02:01:07.130 --> 02:01:11.420
And because of that, I was able
to, you know, learn the importance

02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:13.660
of reading and I appreciated it.

02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:17.750
And it's probably that love of
reading that maybe made me be able

02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:19.490
to do what I've been
able to do in my life.

02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:24.080
So, I'm trying to get back a bit
by trying to get other people

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.060
to enjoy reading particularly young
people, but people of all ages.

02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:31.260
And I am devastated when
I read the statistics

02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:34.720
about how high the illiteracy
rate is in United States,

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.530
depending on how you look at it.

02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:39.470
Roughly one out of seven adults
is functionally illiterate.

02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:43.060
And how-- we have an addition
to the illiteracy problem,

02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:46.870
the alliteracy problem which is
that people can read don't read.

02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:49.770
So, something like 30%
of people that graduate

02:01:49.770 --> 02:01:51.840
from college don't read a
book the rest of their life

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:54.780
which is not a good
commentary on our country.

02:01:54.780 --> 02:02:00.110
So, I hope that what we can do by
getting the Library of Congress

02:02:00.110 --> 02:02:04.450 position:56%
as supportive as possible behind the
literacy movement and has been very,

02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:07.750
very actively involved in--
for the last number of years,

02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:12.830
we can use the Library of
Congress as extraordinary brand

02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:16.460
and its great resources to let
people know in the United States

02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:18.920
and around the world that
literacy is something that all

02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:22.140
of us have an obligation
to do something about.

02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:25.130
And all of us really should
pitch in and do much more

02:02:25.130 --> 02:02:29.930 position:56%
than we have done today as a society
and as a country and as a world

02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:33.090
because if we're going to have
a great world, we really need

02:02:33.090 --> 02:02:34.730
to have a world where
people can read.

02:02:34.730 --> 02:02:37.340
If people can't read, progress

02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.450
and civilization should have
isn't really going to be advanced.

02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:45.810
So, I'm very disappointed
that it is the case

02:02:45.810 --> 02:02:50.120
that there isn't enough resources
really for literacy movements.

02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:53.850
Literacy people, all of you, are
always scrambling to raise money.

02:02:53.850 --> 02:02:57.830
And it's very difficult if you
take a look at the great gallows

02:02:57.830 --> 02:03:01.060
that are done in fundraising in the
non-profit world and I'm involved

02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:03.000
in a number of organizations
that do this.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.720
When you have performing arts, you
can raise a fair amount of money

02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:07.060
around performing arts easily.

02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:11.800
You have famous people show up when
you have e vents around art museums

02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.320
and galleries, they're
important as well.

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:14.620
I like them, I'm involved.

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:15.920
But they get-- you get
the most famous people

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.470
in United States showing up and
the big wealthy art collectors.

02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:21.160
When you have big events
promoting literacy,

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.560
you don't usually get the A
list of most famous people

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:25.930
in the United State
showing up you say,

02:03:25.930 --> 02:03:27.910
how much money can
I give to literacy?

02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:29.210
And why is that?

02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:31.560
Well, they don't know about the
problem as much as they should.

02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:33.770
So, I think it's incumbent
upon those of us who believe

02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:35.750
in the importance of
promoting literacy

02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:38.820
and avoiding illiteracy
and alliteracy.

02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:42.040
We should do much more and redouble
our references, I will try to do.

02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:44.670
So I want to just thank all
of you for what you are doing

02:03:44.670 --> 02:03:48.560
to help this part of
our society learn more

02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:52.630
about the problems we have with
literacy and alliteracy and try

02:03:52.630 --> 02:03:56.350
to find ways that we can use
our combined intellectual

02:03:56.350 --> 02:04:00.490
and financial resources to make
sure people recognize them.

02:04:00.490 --> 02:04:02.230
When they talk about the
most important problems

02:04:02.230 --> 02:04:03.910
in the country, they
talk about this.

02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:08.000
So in the presidential
campaign for example,

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.240
no candidate in the primaries

02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.790
or in the general election
has mentioned literacy

02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:15.050
as a problem, nobody.

02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:18.110
Nobody has mentioned illiteracy,
nobody has mentioned alliteracy.

02:04:18.110 --> 02:04:19.760
Now, some might say one

02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:22.570
of the candidates should
focus on that more.

02:04:22.570 --> 02:04:28.140
But whatever you might believe,
I do think it's a sad situation

02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:29.840
that we have roughly one seventh

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:33.400
of our adult population is
essentially illiterate and

02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:36.000
yet we don't talk about it
in the presidential campaign.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.300
There are a lot of
important problems.

02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:39.290
But I hope we can put
on the national agenda

02:04:39.290 --> 02:04:42.400
so you can see the words coming out
from the president of United States

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.510
at some point the importance
of literacy

02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:46.000 position:56%
and how we can do much more in that.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.680
So, thank you for everything
you're doing

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.230
and I hope we can work together

02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:51.760
to make this a more
important invisible cost.

02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:53.060
Thank you.

02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:54.360
[ Applause ]

02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I
got to give you a hug.

02:04:55.940 --> 02:04:57.280
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Thank you.

02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:59.080
Thank you.

02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:07.670
[ Applause ]

02:05:07.670 --> 02:05:08.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:10.270
Thank you, Mr. Rubenstein.

02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:13.340
We all needed to hear that.

02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:18.240
And now, we will hear from the
three recipients of the Library

02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:22.470
of Congress Literacy Awards
starting with the winner

02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:27.330
of the American Prize,
Parent-Child Home Program,

02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:30.640
represented by Sara Walter.

02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:33.570
Now, you may know that the
Parent-Child Program has more

02:05:33.570 --> 02:05:37.760
than 50 years of success
in educating parents

02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:42.230
to develop school readiness in
children with disadvantages.

02:05:42.230 --> 02:05:46.970
Their work has been replicated
in 400 high-need communities

02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:53.470
in 14 states and Chile,
Canada, Ireland, and Bermuda.

02:05:53.470 --> 02:05:55.510
Congratulations.

02:05:55.510 --> 02:06:01.530
[ Applause ]

02:06:01.530 --> 02:06:02.830
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Thank you.

02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:05.130
So, I feel like I need to start
by saying I haven't been working

02:06:05.130 --> 02:06:07.640
for them for the whole 50 years.

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:11.110
But I actually had the privilege
of taking over from the founder

02:06:11.110 --> 02:06:13.600
and creator of the
model 19 years ago.

02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:17.770
So, I have been there to
watch the program grow.

02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:21.800
And I think before I tell you a
little a bit about the program,

02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:27.060 position:56%
I do want to start by saying one of
the things I think is most important

02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:31.070
about literacy and I want
to echo it, the library

02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:33.730
and Mr. Rubenstein
said is that it opens

02:06:33.730 --> 02:06:36.070
so many other doors for families.

02:06:36.070 --> 02:06:38.400
So, people talk about
Parent-Child Home Program

02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:40.400
as an early literacy program.

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:43.500
But really, it's an
early math program.

02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:47.290
It's a social-emotional
skill development program.

02:06:47.290 --> 02:06:49.350
It's a graduation program.

02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:51.070
For the children in our program,

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:54.200
this is often the first
graduation not just in their lives,

02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:55.500
but in their family's lives.

02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:59.810
And what it leads to is high school
graduation and college graduation

02:06:59.810 --> 02:07:01.930
and other wonderful things.

02:07:01.930 --> 02:07:05.460
So, I'm going to tell you a
little a bout how we do that.

02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:07.550
So, our vision is a world

02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:11.760 position:56%
where every parent has the knowledge
skills and materials that they need

02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:13.320 position:56%
to get their child ready for school.

02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:14.620
And that means to make sure

02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:17.790
that their child has the
language literacy, numeracy,

02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:20.510
and social-emotional
skills they need to walk

02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:25.750 position:56%
into a classroom successful on that
very, very first day because we know

02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:28.300
that that's when we can have
the most impact and we know

02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:32.170
that children who don't get those
tools before they enter school are

02:07:32.170 --> 02:07:35.300
going to have harder and harder
time catching up the later

02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:37.470
that we're able to bring
any of those services

02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:39.810
to them and their families.

02:07:41.250 --> 02:07:43.580
You all know, I'm preaching
to the choir here,

02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:46.090
you all know about
the challenges that--

02:07:46.090 --> 02:07:47.860
in this country and
in other countries

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.900
that very low income immigrant

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:53.910
and refugee families face their
children have heard 30 million

02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:55.210
fewer words.

02:07:55.210 --> 02:07:59.170
And I want to note, it's 30 million
fewer words before they turn four.

02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:03.080
So Pre-K is a wonderful thing and
everybody should have access to it.

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:05.030
But it doesn't solve this problem.

02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:08.340
In order to get kids to have heard
30 million more words before they

02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:10.360
turn four, you have
to work with them

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:13.610
and their families before
those children turn 4.

02:08:13.610 --> 02:08:15.730
So, that's our goal.

02:08:15.730 --> 02:08:18.080 position:56%
A little bit about who we work with,

02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.800
so you'll get some
context for the program.

02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:22.520
We're working with about
7,000 families nationally

02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:24.820
across the country, 14 states.

02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:26.630
I think the most interesting thing

02:08:26.630 --> 02:08:28.910
about those families
is who they are.

02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:30.210
We're a home visiting program.

02:08:30.210 --> 02:08:32.060
We're going into people's homes.

02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:35.900
But what we're doing is
really enabling families

02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:38.800
who are the hardest to reach to
access programs and services.

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:41.400
So, home visiting is an
amazing program to work

02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:44.140
with homeless families because
we can reach those families

02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:47.090
when they're in shelter and we
can follow them wherever they move

02:08:47.090 --> 02:08:48.580
over the next two years.

02:08:48.580 --> 02:08:51.540
It's an amazing program to reach
immigrant and refugee families

02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:54.640
because we can train staff who
speak those family's languages

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.940
to go into their homes.

02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:59.750
And we can talk later about finding
the materials in their languages

02:08:59.750 --> 02:09:01.050
to bring to them because I thought

02:09:01.050 --> 02:09:03.250
that was a great discussion
this morning.

02:09:03.250 --> 02:09:07.310
As you can see, 80% of the
families we work with are living

02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:10.030
on incomes of $25,000 or less.

02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:12.950
Think about what that
means in this country.

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:17.260
It means really they're
struggling to make ends meet

02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:21.680
and they're not able to buy the
kinds of books and educational toys

02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:25.330
that a middle class child in
this country sees everyday,

02:09:25.330 --> 02:09:29.270
that children who are in really
quality preschools and early--

02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:31.540
and childcare see everyday.

02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:33.690
That's why we bring these
materials into the homes

02:09:33.690 --> 02:09:35.770
and their gifts to the families.

02:09:35.770 --> 02:09:40.150
One of the changes in our program
over 50 years is that now 63%

02:09:40.150 --> 02:09:41.940
of our participating families,

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:44.460
the parents were born
outside of the United States.

02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:46.530 position:56%
We are doing the program every year.

02:09:46.530 --> 02:09:50.300
And on average, 32 different
languages around the country.

02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:52.480
The languages in our
database are over 50

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:58.330
of the languages we've served
families in the last 19 years.

02:09:58.330 --> 02:10:02.040
So the model is the
guts of the model.

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:07.420
Two visits a week of a half a hour,
half hour is the attention span

02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:10.170
or even more than the attention
span of a two or three-year-old.

02:10:10.170 --> 02:10:12.730
That's' why the home
visits are pegged with that.

02:10:12.730 --> 02:10:15.910
Also the families that we're
visiting have a lot of demands

02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:17.570
on them, a lot of challenges.

02:10:17.570 --> 02:10:21.270
And so, helping parents see that
reading, talking and playing

02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:26.000
with your child can happen in
very small doses across the day,

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.150
the week, the months, the
years and make huge differences

02:10:29.150 --> 02:10:31.360
for your child is a
really important message.

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:35.450
They get two home visits a
week, two cycles over two years,

02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:37.030
the two-year-old and
the three-old-year here,

02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:41.170
total is 92 home visits
over the program.

02:10:41.170 --> 02:10:43.960
That's a lot of contact
with families.

02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:47.890
So we really see and can document
the change that we're making.

02:10:47.890 --> 02:10:49.960
The families get the
gifts of books and toys

02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:52.950
which are a critical
piece of the program.

02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:56.230
We leave them with them
as opposed under programs

02:10:56.230 --> 02:10:59.100
which may bring materials
in, but then take them.

02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:01.980 position:56%
It doesn't do the family any good if
that book doesn't stay in your home

02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:05.050
and become an integral
part of your daily life.

02:11:05.050 --> 02:11:09.650
I think the other really important
fact before I show you some voices

02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:13.510
or show you some families
from the program is that 25%

02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:16.140
of our home visitors across the
country are parents who went

02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:19.440
to the program as parents and
are then trained and hired

02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:22.200
to be the home visiting
staff at our sites.

02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:25.480
That's how we serve families
speaking 32 different languages.

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:29.090
And also is the other wonderful
part of the program which is

02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:34.150
that it has a workforce
development piece for communities.

02:11:34.150 --> 02:11:35.940
And the deeper we get
in communities,

02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:40.040 position:56%
the more former parents were able
to hire and the more the community--

02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:43.830
the program can grow
and reach more families.

02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:48.480
This is sort of the circle of the
things that we do in the program.

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:52.360
I think the most important
things are these cultural

02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:55.130
and linguistic match and the fact

02:11:55.130 --> 02:12:00.770
that the home visitors are not
only bringing these literacy tools

02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:02.780
and modeling for parents
how to read, talk,

02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:05.140
and play with their children,
they're connecting these families

02:12:05.140 --> 02:12:07.140
to other services in
their communities.

02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:11.660 position:56%
Our goal is to reach families who
are not connected to other services.

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:15.480
And so, the goal of the home
visitor's work is not only

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:19.270
to model literacy, but to make sure
that the family has a medical home.

02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:22.020
That if they just got an eviction
notice, we've connected them

02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:24.600 position:56%
with someone who's going to help
them with that, that they have heat,

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:27.150
that they have appropriate clothing
for the weather, all of the kinds

02:12:27.150 --> 02:12:30.990
of challenges that the families
were working with experience.

02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:34.510
And here are some voices
of parents in program.

02:12:34.510 --> 02:12:39.050
[ Music ]

02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:45.230
&gt;&gt; Amira: We were new to the
area and the home visitor,

02:12:45.230 --> 02:12:48.970
she come to our door and
tell us about the program

02:12:48.970 --> 02:12:54.080 position:56%
and what benefit it has the children
to be ready when they go school.

02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:56.230
&gt;&gt; Thuy: We learn how to
play with her, to show her

02:12:56.230 --> 02:12:58.560
and read the book to
her every night.

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:00.040
That helped me a lot too.

02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:01.910
I'm not really good teacher though.

02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:03.560
&gt;&gt; Paula: It was hard
in the beginning

02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:05.730 position:56%
because he wasn't putting attention.

02:13:05.730 --> 02:13:08.050
And now when he know
that she's coming,

02:13:08.050 --> 02:13:11.980
he's already getting books
for her, bringing toys.

02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:16.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thuy: She's can count 1 to 10
like that and write the letter A, B,

02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:20.930
C. The more that we read the book
to her, she draw the picture.

02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:23.060
&gt;&gt; Amira: I was worried
because Hanan is--

02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:25.270
have a problem of hearing.

02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:29.060
So taking to the school
was a big deal for me,

02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:32.200
so like will she behave properly.

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:36.690
But the teacher said, wow, she
is ready, she know how to read

02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:40.010
and she know how to behave with the
other children and then she said,

02:13:40.010 --> 02:13:41.360
it's like she's been the school.

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:47.230
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: So somebody
was talking earlier today

02:13:47.230 --> 02:13:49.040
about empowering parents.

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.880
And I think you can see from
that that a critical piece

02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:54.510
of this program is these
parents who are empowered.

02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:57.170
They become advocates
for their children

02:13:57.170 --> 02:13:59.010
as their children move
through school.

02:13:59.010 --> 02:14:01.530
We have a former board member
who was actually a child

02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:04.910
in the program 30 years ago and
he talks about how his mother used

02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:07.360
to talk school and tell them
weren't giving him enough homework

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:10.830
because he was finishing
it too quickly.

02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:12.130
He didn't appreciate it then.

02:14:12.130 --> 02:14:13.800
But after he graduated
from law school,

02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:15.120
he realized she'd been right.

02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:19.510
Just to get back to we try to
bring in the books for families

02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:22.830
and their native languages
not always possible.

02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:25.140
We do something that
maybe the publishers

02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:26.490
in this room should
cover their ears.

02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:29.850
But if we can't find them in their
native language, we translate

02:14:29.850 --> 02:14:31.800
and the language-- the
native language gets taped

02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:33.890
into the book next to the English.

02:14:33.890 --> 02:14:40.630
If you publish them in all 32
languages, we would buy them.

02:14:40.630 --> 02:14:42.250
It's a relationship-based program.

02:14:42.250 --> 02:14:45.150 position:56%
It's about building the relationship
between the parent and child that's

02:14:45.150 --> 02:14:48.120
so powerful for making
that child feel successful

02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.990
and that parent feel successful
and I'm being told I need to stop

02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:54.910
so I'm going to close with
it's starts with families,

02:14:54.910 --> 02:14:56.890
but that's what makes
better and stronger schools,

02:14:56.890 --> 02:15:00.680
better and stronger communities,
and a better and stronger citizenry

02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:05.480 position:56%
which is what we're all aspiring to
of kids who love reading and parents

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:08.770
who love learning and are empowered
to make sure their kids can.

02:15:08.770 --> 02:15:10.570
Thank you very much.

02:15:10.570 --> 02:15:19.650
[ Applause ]

02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:22.100
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you Sara.

02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:27.060
And next, we have the award
winner of the International Prize,

02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:33.070
Libraries Without Borders,
represented by Allister Chang.

02:15:33.070 --> 02:15:38.320
Libraries Without Borders supports
communities in more than 20 nations

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:43.830 position:56%
in a variety of ways including their
signature program the Ideas Box

02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:48.870 position:56%
which is an amazing portable
classroom, media center and library.

02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:54.250
They can be assembled in 20
minutes, and I've seen it.

02:15:54.250 --> 02:15:58.000
They are an innovative
organization using libraries

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.500
and related technologies to
bridge gaps in social, economic,

02:16:02.500 --> 02:16:04.610
and political environment.

02:16:04.610 --> 02:16:05.910
Congratulations.

02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:07.710
Come on up.

02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:13.430
There he is All right.

02:16:23.090 --> 02:16:25.330
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: --
Be with you all today.

02:16:25.330 --> 02:16:28.870
I will also start with
a quick story of my own.

02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:32.760
My parents immigrated to the
US and worked in restaurants.

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:37.810
And for me, the library was the
bridge between the Chinese home

02:16:37.810 --> 02:16:42.840
that I had and the American
English speaking world outside.

02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:49.850
And for me, the library has been
so important in shifting my life

02:16:49.850 --> 02:16:55.630
to be the first person in my
family to go to college and be able

02:16:55.630 --> 02:16:59.360
to choose what kind of
life I wanted to live.

02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:04.090
I'm here today to tell you
about Libraries Without Borders

02:17:04.090 --> 02:17:10.640
and specifically about the Ideas
Box which was earlier mentioned.

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:18.930
And the story begins in 2010
when I joined the organization

02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:22.390
and we were working
in Haiti at the time.

02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:27.620 position:56%
And after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake
that destroyed the library

02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:32.140
that we had hoped to build, our
local partners asked us to stay.

02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:36.340
And at the time we asked ourselves,

02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:39.450
is this really the right
time to rebuild the library?

02:17:39.450 --> 02:17:43.490
Should resources not first to be
spent on food, water, and shelter?

02:17:43.490 --> 02:17:49.620
At the insistence of University
of Haiti, we went and we worked.

02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:53.790
And it was in this project that
we learned an important lesson

02:17:53.790 --> 02:17:56.760
that shaped the story of
our organization's future.

02:17:57.890 --> 02:18:03.850 position:56%
Informational tools and spaces are
critical for disaster relief efforts

02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:07.870
and should not be relegated
for many years later.

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:11.740
In humanitarian contexts,
we often focus

02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:14.850
on basic needs, food,
water, shelter.

02:18:14.850 --> 02:18:19.600
But we saw on the ground was
that people need more than that

02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.250
in order to build their futures.

02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:27.570
Our library in Haiti became a hub
for community leaders, engineers,

02:18:27.570 --> 02:18:30.600
and aid workers to
reference reliable information

02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:33.550
and to develop collaborations.

02:18:33.550 --> 02:18:37.470 position:56%
Today, Libraries Without Borders has
expanded upon that what we learned

02:18:37.470 --> 02:18:41.940
in Haiti to leverage informational
tools for disaster relief,

02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:46.360
peace building, entrepreneurship,
and economic development,

02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:51.080
and the foundation of all
that is literacy programming.

02:18:52.130 --> 02:18:56.410 position:56%
Recognizing our work with internally
displaced persons in a Haiti,

02:18:56.410 --> 02:18:58.650
we received requests from partners,

02:18:58.650 --> 02:19:03.090
from UNHCR in the African
Great Lakes first.

02:19:03.090 --> 02:19:08.230 position:56%
And that's where we started to
continue the story of the Ideas Box.

02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:11.450
And so, does anyone here know
what the average length of stay

02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:15.220
for a refugee in a campus today?

02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:16.520
Shout out some numbers.

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:23.510
Oh. There's supposed
to be a question mark.

02:19:23.510 --> 02:19:26.660
[ Laughter ]

02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:32.280
Ruined the surprise, but it's, you
know, whether or not you-- it's a--

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:36.620
this number is-- for us,
was heart breaking to learn

02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:39.770
that this is the length of
stay for an average refugee

02:19:39.770 --> 02:19:41.990
in a protracted crisis today.

02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:46.150
And when-- you know, when we first
started this work, people said,

02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:48.450
what-- exactly what we had asked
in Haiti at that time which was,

02:19:48.450 --> 02:19:51.190
is this the right time
to this kind of work?

02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:54.320
And they said, you know,
these are temporary spaces.

02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:58.550
If it's 26 years, we're
losing generations of kids.

02:19:58.550 --> 02:20:02.550
They're no longer temporary spaces.

02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:08.740
So today, you know, there are
over 65 million refugees and IDPs.

02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:10.480
And UNICEF recently
estimated that there are

02:20:10.480 --> 02:20:14.180
over 28 million child refugees.

02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:15.880
For us, it was to address
this challenge

02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:19.630
that we approached Philippe
Starck, the French designer,

02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:21.440
who worked with us to design a kit.

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:26.780
And he said to us when he agreed
to help us that he wanted to--

02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:30.570
he was engaged by our mission to
not only help people stay alive,

02:20:30.570 --> 02:20:33.920
but actually help them to live.

02:20:36.250 --> 02:20:39.630
And so, we built the Ideas Box

02:20:39.630 --> 02:20:43.340
which is a pop-up multimedia
center unpacked in 20 minutes.

02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:46.810
That is fully autonomous,
portable, and durable.

02:20:46.810 --> 02:20:53.840
And we have a quick video to show
that explains what this box does.

02:20:57.510 --> 02:22:14.510
[ Music ]

02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:24.620
[ Applause ]

02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:28.180
So for us, most of our
work is with local partners

02:22:28.180 --> 02:22:32.700
to customize all the Ideas Box
contents including paper books,

02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:36.010
eReaders and dozens
of educational apps.

02:22:36.010 --> 02:22:38.960
And each Ideas Box
serves 10,000 people

02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:40.960
and quickly becomes
a learning center,

02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:43.730
a library, and a community hub.

02:22:45.310 --> 02:22:49.850
After 30 months of experimentation
in the humanitarian context,

02:22:49.850 --> 02:22:52.990
we have had qualitative and
quantitative evaluations done

02:22:52.990 --> 02:22:57.150
that demonstrate the impact
of the Ideas Box in education,

02:22:57.150 --> 02:23:00.600
community building, and
psychosocial support.

02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:05.050
The first two units of the Ideas
Box were implemented in Haiti

02:23:05.050 --> 02:23:08.090
where we registered 24,000
visits in three months

02:23:08.090 --> 02:23:11.060
and around 3,300 unique users.

02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:15.950
A few months ago, we conducted a
quantitative study assessing the

02:23:15.950 --> 02:23:18.950
educational literacy
and numeracy outcomes

02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:20.860
of the Ideas Box through NRCT.

02:23:20.860 --> 02:23:25.080
And it showed a 23% higher
average academic improvement

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.650
in the test group compared
with the control group as well

02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:33.070
as increased curiosity
and participation.

02:23:33.070 --> 02:23:35.840
We recognize the importance
of replicating the study

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:39.960
in different contexts and
with larger sample sizes.

02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:42.400
But, you know, this initial
result is interesting

02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:46.150
because it helps us claim
the impact of the Ideas Box

02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:49.020
and how it exceeds
the sum of its pieces.

02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:52.210
We're learning how educational
outcomes are not just the result

02:23:52.210 --> 02:23:55.150
of the quality of teacher and
the quality of curriculum,

02:23:55.150 --> 02:23:57.400
but also the quality
of the physical space.

02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:00.460
And teachers have told us
that moving their class

02:24:00.460 --> 02:24:04.120
to the Ideas Box classroom has
fundamentally shifted dynamics

02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:08.100
between students and
fostered group discussions

02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:11.050
and more interactive
learning opportunities.

02:24:11.050 --> 02:24:15.190
And it is with sharing the results
of the program with refugees

02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:18.160
that local governments and
libraries began suggesting

02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:24.960
that we run programs and other
contexts including in The Bronx,

02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:30.990
in Saxel, in France and
in Queensland Australia.

02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:34.100
In the US, we partnered with
the New York Public Library

02:24:34.100 --> 02:24:37.590
to create pop-up library
spaces and Laundromats

02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:41.980
where we facilitated storytelling
and literacy workshops for children

02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:45.230
and resume workshops for
adults who are waiting

02:24:45.230 --> 02:24:48.030
for their laundry to wash and dry.

02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:51.970
We've also partnered with the
National Library Colombia recently

02:24:51.970 --> 02:24:55.430
to leverage ICT tools for peace
building in the rural areas

that have been most affected by
last 52 years of guerrilla conflict.

And my time is up.

02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:07.640
And our next step is to formalize
micro entrepreneurship models

02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:10.420
to sustainably grow
the Ideas Box program.

02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:12.400
We have 70 in the field right now.

02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:15.520
And our goal is to
build 1,000 by 2020.

02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:17.320
Thank you.

And finally, the winner
of the Rubenstein Prize,

02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:39.280
Reading Rockets represented
by Noel Gunther.

02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:43.320
Reading Rockets was created
by WETA to address the need

02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.290
for evidence-based resources
among literacy providers,

02:25:47.290 --> 02:25:49.990
educators and parents.

02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:55.530
Their website is accessed nearly 6
millions times a year by parents,

02:25:55.530 --> 02:26:00.250
teachers, and caregivers in need
of literacy resources and all

02:26:00.250 --> 02:26:02.450
of the resources are free.

02:26:02.450 --> 02:26:06.070

and congratulations.

02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:20.100
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Thanks
so much Dr. Hayden.

02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:23.190
Thanks to you Pam Jackson, all
of your colleagues at the library

02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:25.450
and Mr. Rubenstein for this award.

02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:28.060
We're enormously grateful.

02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:29.490
My parents were immigrants too.

02:26:29.490 --> 02:26:31.730
That's seems to be theme today.

02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:34.140
And everything they accomplished
and everything I've been able

02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:38.170
to do really began with one
thing which was learning to read.

02:26:38.170 --> 02:26:42.080
At Reading Rockets, we look at
how young children learn to read,

02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:47.410
why so many kids struggle, and most
important, what can we do about it.

02:26:47.410 --> 02:26:49.460
I'll tell you our story
in just a moment.

02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:51.470
By that, we like to
start with a video clip,

02:26:51.470 --> 02:26:55.520
a short clip from a documentary
we produced for PBS called "A Tale

02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:58.960
of Two Schools" narrated
by Morgan Freeman.

02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:02.870
We spent a whole year inside two
struggling elementary schools.

02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:06.580
One in Mississippi Delta,
and one in Fort Worth, Texas.

02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:07.880
And here's how the show begins.

02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:09.180
&gt;&gt; [Background Music] Shhhh.

02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:10.500
I'm the teacher.

02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:13.990
&gt;&gt; This is Tavares.

02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:18.010
He's starting first grade
in Fort Worth, Texas.

02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:21.400
He needs to learn how to read,
but he's already way behind.

02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:23.700
&gt;&gt; He will probably struggle
for the rest of his life

02:27:23.700 --> 02:27:26.670
if we don't work on it now.

02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:28.870
&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, in Sumner,
Mississippi,

02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:31.770
rookie teacher Jill Todd
faces her own challenge.

02:27:31.770 --> 02:27:33.440 position:56%
Trying to teach reading in a setting

02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:36.030
where almost every child
needs a lot of help.

02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:38.960
&gt;&gt; I'm worn out, just
extremely tired.

02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:41.510
&gt;&gt; And the superintendent
is at the end of his rope.

02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:44.560
&gt;&gt; So, hell, if they won't give us
decent books, how are we supposed

02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.330
to improve our test scores?

02:27:46.330 --> 02:27:48.550
&gt;&gt; Across the country,
schools are struggling

02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:52.730
with their most basic job,
teaching kids to read.

02:27:52.730 --> 02:27:55.850
We spent an entire year inside
two schools that have known a lot

02:27:55.850 --> 02:27:58.890
of failure and are now
trying valiantly to improve.

02:27:58.890 --> 02:28:00.570
&gt;&gt; There are a lot of
times I want to quit.

02:28:00.570 --> 02:28:03.430
&gt;&gt; I think we alternated
between chaos and limbo.

02:28:03.430 --> 02:28:05.470
&gt;&gt; All kid can learn.

02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:07.340
All kids can be successful.

02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:10.140
&gt;&gt; What does it really take
to turn our schools around?

02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:12.960
And what happens if we fail?

02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:14.450
&gt;&gt; These kids deserve better.

02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:18.070
And if these kids don't
get an adequate education,

02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:20.510
they will not do better.

02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:41.450
[ Music ]

02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:43.810
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: That
year changed my life.

02:28:43.810 --> 02:28:47.340
And that short his captures
the three-core ideas behind

02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:48.940
Reading Rockets.

02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:51.800
First, too many children
are failing.

02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:54.510
One third of our fourth
graders scored below basic

02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:58.250
on their NATE test which means they
can't understand a simple story

02:28:58.250 --> 02:29:00.310
or they can barely read it all.

02:29:00.310 --> 02:29:02.670
That just can't be OK.

02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:04.920
Second, teachers are overwhelmed.

02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:06.230
They want to do a great job,

02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:08.300
but they often they
don't have the knowledge

02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:10.810
or the support that
they need to do it.

02:29:10.810 --> 02:29:15.510
And third and most important, we
know how to solve this problem.

02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:18.570
The federal government alone has
spent more than 2 billion dollars

02:29:18.570 --> 02:29:21.630
on reading research and
we know it's not easy.

02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:24.790
But if we follow that research
and if principles, teachers,

02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:26.530
and parents can work together,

02:29:26.530 --> 02:29:29.720
almost every child can
become a proficient reader,

02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:33.110
and that's where Reading
Rockets comes in.

02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:35.960
Reading Rockets is
all about solutions.

02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:39.100
We start with the best reading
research and then we use the power

02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:42.380
of media to show step by
step what each of us can do

02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:46.200
to help kids be more successful
as readers and writers.

02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:49.240
As a media company, we do
everything in all our power then

02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:52.600
to build a big audience and to
spread the words to parents,

02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:57.790
teachers and everyone else who
touches the life of a young child.

02:29:57.790 --> 02:30:00.900
When we started Reading
Rockets, my first question was,

02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:03.280
why do many kids struggle
with reading?

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:07.640 position:56%
It turns out that our brains are
hardwired to master spoken language.

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:09.770
Almost every child
learns to speak just

02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:11.980 position:56%
from being exposed to oral language.

02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:14.960
But we've only been
reading for 5,000 years,

02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:17.280
just a blink of an eye
in evolutionary terms.

02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:20.880
So to become a good reader,
you need to take brain circuits

02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:24.730 position:56%
that were originally designed for
spoken language and then rewire them

02:30:24.730 --> 02:30:26.790
to handle the printed word.

02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:30.050
And for many kids,
that is really hard.

02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:35.330 position:56%
And because it's so hard to learn
reading, it's also hard to teach it.

02:30:35.330 --> 02:30:37.580
Poor readers can be very
different one from another.

02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:40.680
You need to diagnose the problem
really carefully before you can

02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:41.980
solve it.

02:30:41.980 --> 02:30:45.770
Teaching reading is rocket science
said researcher Louisa Moats.

02:30:45.770 --> 02:30:49.070
And we see the best teachers,
they're great diagnosticians

02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:51.470
and may have a whole range
of strategies they can use

02:30:51.470 --> 02:30:54.390
to meet the kid-- needs
of individual kids.

02:30:54.390 --> 02:30:56.880
I saw all this firsthand
with my younger son, Aaron,

02:30:56.880 --> 02:31:00.900 position:56%
who seemed to have everything going
for him when he started first grade.

02:31:00.900 --> 02:31:03.090
Good vocabulary, lots
of background knowledge,

02:31:03.090 --> 02:31:05.560
hundreds of hours spent
listening to stories,

02:31:05.560 --> 02:31:09.020
and trust me unlimited
energy and enthusiasm.

02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:11.500
But none of that seemed to help
him when he got to second grade

02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:14.430
because his reading
was getting nowhere.

02:31:14.430 --> 02:31:17.790
And one night in our living room,
he threw a book up against the wall

02:31:17.790 --> 02:31:21.410
and he said, "I hate school" and
he started to cry and it was one

02:31:21.410 --> 02:31:24.670
of the most heartbreaking
moments of my life.

02:31:24.670 --> 02:31:28.000 position:56%
Thanks to Reading Rockets, I was in
an unusual position and we were able

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:31.850
to find a great tutor who
figured out Aaron's problem

02:31:31.850 --> 02:31:33.150
and then worked diligently with him

02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:34.730
for almost a year until
it went away.

02:31:34.730 --> 02:31:39.210
But the sad truth is that Aaron is
an exception and the great majority

02:31:39.210 --> 02:31:43.970
of kids who fall behind in
school never managed to catch up.

02:31:43.970 --> 02:31:46.970
So, what can we do to help
solve the reading crisis?

02:31:46.970 --> 02:31:48.620
We started by asking the experts.

02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:52.580
It makes researchers and skilled
teachers knew the research insight.

02:31:52.580 --> 02:31:55.290
And now, they've spent a
lot of time in classrooms.

02:31:55.290 --> 02:31:58.350
We now offer engaging
in-depth interviews on video

02:31:58.350 --> 02:32:01.500
with the country's top experts
sharing their knowledge for free

02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:04.570
with anyone who comes to our side.

02:32:04.570 --> 02:32:07.860
We've also compiled a big growing
library of top-flight articles

02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:09.420
about teaching and reading.

02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:12.340
We start with really basic
information because we want

02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:14.260
to welcome everyone into the tent.

02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:17.860
But we also get very
detailed and granular.

02:32:17.860 --> 02:32:20.590 position:56%
So if you're concerned about a
second grader who's still struggling

02:32:20.590 --> 02:32:22.470
with her short vowel signs,

02:32:22.470 --> 02:32:25.570
we have good detailed
answers on Reading Rockets.

02:32:25.570 --> 02:32:28.250
And we try to present all that
information in plain English

02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:31.430
with a minimum of jargon
so everything is accessible

02:32:31.430 --> 02:32:32.950
for beginners and experts alike.

02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:37.180
I think most important--
And we just don't talk

02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:39.200 position:56%
about good teaching, we show it too.

02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:40.500
We produce a dozen shows

02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:43.270
for PBS highlighting the
most important elements

02:32:43.270 --> 02:32:44.570
of teaching reading.

02:32:44.570 --> 02:32:46.860 position:56%
With host like Vivica Fox, Al Roker,

02:32:46.860 --> 02:32:48.620
and Henry Winkler bring
it all to life.

02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:53.130
On our website, we offer dozens of
video clips showing real teachers

02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:57.530
and real classrooms working with
real kids, nothing scripted.

02:32:57.530 --> 02:33:00.660
What they all have in common
is knowing how to teach well.

02:33:00.660 --> 02:33:03.650
Teachers tell us all the time,
I want to see kids who look

02:33:03.650 --> 02:33:06.020
like the ones in my classroom.

02:33:06.020 --> 02:33:09.070
So we spent thousands of hours
filming pretty much everywhere

02:33:09.070 --> 02:33:13.350
in the United States in schools who
serve African-Americans, Hispanics,

02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:16.760
English language learners, kids
with disabilities the full range

02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:19.350
of children who make
up the American Mosaic.

02:33:19.350 --> 02:33:23.730 position:56%
We've created online tools like this
one called, "Looking at Writing"

02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:25.760
which gives teachers
a lot of guidance

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:28.610
about teaching writing effectively.

02:33:28.610 --> 02:33:31.630
So we take real stories of
kids have written for school.

02:33:31.630 --> 02:33:34.670
And in case you're not a first
grade teacher, this one is all

02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:37.510
about a penguin and a leopard seal.

02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:40.860
And then, we annotate almost
every line, tell parents

02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:44.280
and teachers see what the child is
doing well where he or she needs

02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:46.490
to improve, and then how to help

02:33:46.490 --> 02:33:50.160
that child take the next step
towards becoming a good writer.

02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:55.080
Just last month, we launched
something called "Reading 101",

02:33:55.080 --> 02:33:58.960
a free introductory online course
to give teachers in grades K

02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:02.850
through 3 a solid systematic
look at the basic principles

02:34:02.850 --> 02:34:04.780
of teaching reading effectively.

02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:07.820
We hope that this first course
will be a prototype for entire set

02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:10.320
of courses about teaching,
reading, and writing.

02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:13.540
It will be readily available
to every teacher in the world.

02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:17.300
Our goal is to create a service
that's engaging authoritative

02:34:17.300 --> 02:34:20.970
video-rich and free of
charge for everyone.

02:34:20.970 --> 02:34:23.270 position:56%
This is really an ambitious project.

02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:25.500
And if we're able to
raise the money for it,

02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:27.460
I think it'd become
our signature service

02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:30.050
and the best long-term
legacy of Reading Rockets.

02:34:30.050 --> 02:34:32.210
I'm hearing the bells, so
I'm going to advance quickly.

02:34:32.210 --> 02:34:35.260
We have tip sheets in 11 languages.

02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:36.700
And they make a huge difference

02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:38.970
for the huge number of
kids in this country.

02:34:38.970 --> 02:34:42.050 position:56%
I just wanted to say when we started
Reading Rockets, we didn't know

02:34:42.050 --> 02:34:43.720
if anyone will be interested.

02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:45.640
We started with about
1,000 users a month.

02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:47.750
We're up to about a
million users a month,

02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:50.310
9 million users in
the last year alone.

02:34:50.310 --> 02:34:53.290
And beyond that audience,
beyond that numbers,

02:34:53.290 --> 02:34:56.750 position:56%
is a connection we make everyday and
every night with worried parents,

02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:58.700
worried teachers who can't
sleep because they're worried

02:34:58.700 --> 02:35:02.770
about that kid at home who's just
not getting it done at school.

02:35:02.770 --> 02:35:07.100
So, I want to thank all of
you, best part of the day

02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:09.880
for us is having a chance to meet
with the groups around the world

02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:12.020
and see if we would be
able to work together.

02:35:12.020 --> 02:35:14.070
I hope we have a chance to
do that during the break.

02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:17.100
And If you like to
get in touch with us,

02:35:17.100 --> 02:35:19.350
there are e-mail addresses,
just come up and say hi.

02:35:19.350 --> 02:35:21.150
Thank you so much.

[ Applause ]

02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:32.910
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you,
Noel, and congratulations to all

02:35:32.910 --> 02:35:35.330
of the award winners and honorees.

02:35:35.330 --> 02:35:39.210
We really appreciate
everything you do.

02:35:39.210 --> 02:35:44.080
Now, we're going to have a
discussion, an interview,

02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:48.340
with the winners with
Mr. David Rubenstein.

02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:51.350
And afterwards, I think
there will be time for you

02:35:51.350 --> 02:35:54.320
to ask some questions
and think about things.

02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:58.550
So please join us on the stage.

02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:15.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:19.670
So, I should've said at the
beginning when I was talking

02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:22.610
about the Enoch Pratt Library, I
didn't quite finish the thought.

02:36:22.610 --> 02:36:26.130
That is the library obviously that
Carla Hayden headed for number

02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:27.500
of years and did a great job there.

02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:31.030
And we are very appreciative
that she has come to Washington.

02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:34.140
And I'm very happy that she has
embraced the literacy cause.

02:36:34.140 --> 02:36:36.560
She obviously was involved
with it before.

02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:38.090
But it wasn't a foregoing
conclusion.

02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:40.670
The Library of Congress would,
you know, adapt this cause.

02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:44.440
But I very much appreciate
the-- her doing so.

02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:48.620
So Libraries Without Borders,
do Doctors Without Borders asked

02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:51.620
for like a royalty for
that name or did they--

02:36:51.620 --> 02:36:52.920
where did you get that name?

02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:55.100
Did they ever call you up
and say we have that name?

02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:57.400
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: The word
on the street is that Lawyers

02:36:57.400 --> 02:36:59.000
Without Borders is one
of the organizations

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.510
that didn't ask for
permission before.

[ Laughter ]

02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:06.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
what is your annual budget?

02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:08.810
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Five
million Euros right now.

02:37:08.810 --> 02:37:10.110
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Five million Euros?

02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:11.410
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Mm-hmm.

02:37:11.410 --> 02:37:12.710
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All
right, and your annual budget?

02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:14.010
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: So for the
supporting the programs

02:37:14.010 --> 02:37:15.310
around the country,
it's about 20 million.

02:37:15.310 --> 02:37:16.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Twenty million?

02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:17.910
And your annual budget is?

02:37:17.910 --> 02:37:20.230
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: The Reading
Rocket is about $400,000.

02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:21.530
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Really?

02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:26.070
Wow. OK. So, well, you got a big
boost in your budget, I guess.

02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:28.370
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Thank
you so much, you noticed.

02:37:29.410 --> 02:37:36.720
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So in
your observation, all of you,

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:39.890
if parents cannot read,
what is the--

02:37:39.890 --> 02:37:42.360
is there a likelihood that
the children cannot read?

02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:44.570
For example, when you go into
try to get parents to be involved

02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:47.450
and the parents can't read, isn't
the child had a big disadvantage,

02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:49.520
and how do you overcome that?

02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:52.610
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: So, yes, they're at
a big disadvantage because parents

02:37:52.610 --> 02:37:55.240
who have very low literacy
levels often think

02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:58.570
that they can't prepare
their children to be literate

02:37:58.570 --> 02:38:01.050
and for school success,
but they can.

02:38:01.050 --> 02:38:03.230
And one of the things
that we show parents is

02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:05.600
that you can picture read
a book with your child

02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:10.260
and have a conversation that's
rich in language and imagination.

02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:12.970
Two-year-old doesn't know if you're
reading the words on the page

02:38:12.970 --> 02:38:15.120
or you're just having a
conversation with them.

02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:16.500 position:56%
The one thing I would say is we find

02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:18.960
that that process is
the perfect link

02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:21.840
for then getting the parent
excited about starting

02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:24.050
to learn to read themselves.

02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:25.350
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:38:25.350 --> 02:38:28.760
So, let me ask you-- all of
you, is this your career?

02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:31.660 position:56%
In other words, you're not going to
go become a private equity investor,

02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:33.400
hedge fund investor
in a couple of years?

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:35.630
This is what you're going to
be doing or if you thought

02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:38.890
about doing it for a while
and then doing something else?

02:38:38.890 --> 02:38:41.390
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang:
This is my calling.

02:38:41.390 --> 02:38:43.660
My focus before this,
have been in human rights.

02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:46.490
And if you dig down
deeply into the root causes

02:38:46.490 --> 02:38:48.230
of what human rights abuse is--

02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:50.320
are and where I was
working in Southeast Asia,

02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.710
it comes back to access
to information.

02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:54.460
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, did
your friends say you should go

02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:56.340
to Wall Street and
be hedge fund person

02:38:56.340 --> 02:38:57.910
or people would say,
why are you doing this?

02:38:57.910 --> 02:39:01.530
Or you ever get that question?

02:39:01.530 --> 02:39:03.790
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Absolutely.

02:39:03.790 --> 02:39:08.370 position:56%
I think that those questions come up

02:39:08.370 --> 02:39:11.820
and it certainly not the
most lucrative industry.

02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:15.550
But time back to what I was saying
before, I think what is beautiful

02:39:15.550 --> 02:39:19.260
about the space that I've been able
to inhabit because I was able to go

02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:22.470
to college is that I can
work in a career work.

02:39:22.470 --> 02:39:25.620
I do what I love and survive
by making enough money--

02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:28.120
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Where did
you go to college, United States?

02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:29.850

to grad school at Harvard.

02:39:29.850 --> 02:39:31.150

02:39:31.150 --> 02:39:32.450
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Mm-hmm

02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:33.750
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
What part of Harvard?

02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:35.050
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang:
The Kennedy School.

02:39:35.050 --> 02:39:36.350
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: I know that.

02:39:36.350 --> 02:39:37.650
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Yes.

02:39:37.650 --> 02:39:38.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:40.250
So, what about you?

02:39:40.250 --> 02:39:41.550
Are you going to-- this
is your life, your career?

02:39:41.550 --> 02:39:42.850
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: This is my life.

02:39:42.850 --> 02:39:44.150
I'm a lapsed lawyer.

02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:46.890
And I do get asked-- and the
most striking thing is people

02:39:46.890 --> 02:39:50.130
who don't understand that this
is actually a real full-time job

02:39:50.130 --> 02:39:53.490
that I've been doing for
19 years and I consider it

02:39:53.490 --> 02:39:56.610
as are more important
than being a lawyer.

02:39:56.610 --> 02:39:59.210
But the number of people who think
that if you work for a nonprofit,

02:39:59.210 --> 02:40:04.220 position:56%
you must be volunteering or
experimenting with something outside

02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:06.040
of the workforce is
very interesting to me.

02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:07.340
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:40:07.340 --> 02:40:08.730
And what about you?

02:40:08.730 --> 02:40:12.010

lawyer, but I recovered quickly.

02:40:13.970 --> 02:40:15.510
I spent five years doing that.

But that was a lifetime's worth.

02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:18.860
And this work is so
much more meaningful.

02:40:18.860 --> 02:40:20.420
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You don't
think that we'd be better off

02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:21.720
if we have one more lawyer?

So, I'm curious, how many
books a week do you read?

&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Oh, three, four.

02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:35.140

Can you read three or four a week?

three or four for a week, but two

read newspapers and newspaper forum.

running around carrying newspapers.

02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:57.930
So today, would you say
that the biggest challenge

02:40:57.930 --> 02:41:01.120
for literacy effort is that
the people don't realize

02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:03.170
that problem exists
as much as it does?

02:41:03.170 --> 02:41:05.980
What-- When you tell people
there's a illiteracy problem

02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:09.070
in this country, do all you find
that people look at you quizzically

02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:11.510
and say what are you
talking about or not?

02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:13.170
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Oh, absolutely.

02:41:13.170 --> 02:41:14.470
I think people have no idea

02:41:14.470 --> 02:41:17.680
because the illiteracy problem
is a hidden problem mostly.

02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:22.210
I came to education as a total
amateur which was a disadvantage

02:41:22.210 --> 02:41:25.630
in some ways where I got to visit
schools with completely clear,

02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:28.830
unprejudiced and the
overwhelming fact of education

02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:32.420
in the United States is that it's
all about class and the people

02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:34.940
in power have kids going to good
schools and they're thriving.

02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:36.590
And if the kids aren't
struggling, they find a way

02:41:36.590 --> 02:41:38.420
like I did to get help for my kids.

02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:41.160
But everyday, we sit and we
allow kids in poorest schools

02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.510 position:56%
to get a crummy education to start
off unequal and have fewer resources

02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:47.850
and we just accept
this as a fact of life.

02:41:47.850 --> 02:41:50.880
And so, it's-- the
problem is hugely prevalent

02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:55.400
and still largely hidden problem
to the elites, the policy makers,

02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:56.700
the people in the academy.

02:41:56.700 --> 02:41:58.170

don't see themselves

then, in the international--

02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:05.820
[ Applause ]

02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:07.710
Libraries Without Borders
is part of the group called

02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:09.020 position:56%
"The Global Campaign for Education".

02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:13.230
And their recent analyses have
shown that 2% of international aid

02:42:13.230 --> 02:42:16.070
that was spent from the US goes
into education work at all.

02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:17.370
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

02:42:17.370 --> 02:42:18.670
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Right.

02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:21.140
So, that for us, this is a big
policy shift that we need to think

02:42:21.140 --> 02:42:23.330
about and bringing literacy work

02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:26.550
into the broader aid
that we provide.

02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:30.280
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, what
extent if you don't have parents,

02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:33.380
let's suppose you-- your parents
are deceased of you're taken away,

02:42:33.380 --> 02:42:34.680
you have a guardian or something,

02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:36.720
to what extent are
you a big disadvantage

02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:39.490
in learning how to read?

02:42:39.490 --> 02:42:41.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Well, we do our work

02:42:41.310 --> 02:42:44.970
with anybody who's the significant
adult in that child's life.

02:42:44.970 --> 02:42:48.810 position:56%
So, we work with grandparents who
have custody of their grandchildren,

02:42:48.810 --> 02:42:53.870 position:56%
with foster parents, with guardians,
with aunts, uncles, older siblings,

02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:56.650
whoever is the person who
could help bring literacy

02:42:56.650 --> 02:42:58.380
into that child's life.

02:42:58.380 --> 02:43:01.170
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: One-- I'd like to
add something which is, you know,

02:43:01.170 --> 02:43:04.660
we at Reading Rockets mostly
focus on the real basic job

02:43:04.660 --> 02:43:07.260
of teaching kids to read, how
do you do that effectively.

02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:08.720
But I think what our
schools are missing

02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:10.730
and our society is often
missing is that you have

02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:12.030
to teach the whole child.

02:43:12.030 --> 02:43:14.360
And there are kids who were
coming to school, they are hungry,

02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:17.100
they were up all night, they're
in unstable environments,

02:43:17.100 --> 02:43:19.760
they're in a homeless shelter,
they're not having good healthcare,

02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:22.310
their tooth is hurting and
that's all they can think about,

02:43:22.310 --> 02:43:24.760
and we behave as if those
things aren't impediment

02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:27.540
to learning whereas if any of
our kids were in that position,

02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:29.650
we would want to get help
for them immediately.

02:43:29.650 --> 02:43:32.400
And so, one of the most
hopeful things that I see

02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:35.570
in education is the movement
towards community schools,

02:43:35.570 --> 02:43:39.610 position:56%
to providing wraparound services
for the whole family and for the kid

02:43:39.610 --> 02:43:42.970 position:56%
so that when the child is in school,
he can actually think about school

02:43:42.970 --> 02:43:45.410
and the teachers could do the job
they were actually trained to do.

02:43:45.410 --> 02:43:46.910
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So frequently, I--

02:43:46.910 --> 02:43:49.340
when I'm watching public
broadcasting which is all I watch

02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:51.600
of course public broadcasting,
when I watch it

02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:55.540 position:56%
and there are these efforts to raise
money, probably you've seen them,

02:43:55.540 --> 02:43:58.970 position:56%
they go on TV, they raise money from
time to time, I never hear them say,

02:43:58.970 --> 02:44:02.050
give us-- give me money for Reading
Rockets, why don't they do that?

02:44:02.050 --> 02:44:03.350
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Please
talk to Sharon.

02:44:03.350 --> 02:44:04.850
[ Laughter ]

02:44:04.850 --> 02:44:06.150
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Like
they don't mention that.

02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:07.610
OK. Well, I hope they
mention it to her.

02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:10.540
But it seemed like a good
idea to raise money for it.

02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:15.640
So, literacy in the United
States, we're a wealthy country

02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.100
and people presume that we
would be pretty literate,

02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:21.270
but literacy as we've talked
about isn't so wonderful.

02:44:21.270 --> 02:44:24.780
But is it actually worse in let's
say take Sub-Saharan Africa,

02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:26.160
I don't know if you're
familiar with it.

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:27.880 position:56%
But is Sub-Saharan Africa much worse

02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:30.030
or let's say Southeast
Asia, is that much worse?

02:44:30.030 --> 02:44:33.580
Or where is it really
worse than United States?

02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:38.210
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: You know, United
States is a country of extremes.

02:44:38.210 --> 02:44:41.950
We have the most highly educated
and also I think some of the least.

02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:45.050
And we've been-- I've been
particularly interested

02:44:45.050 --> 02:44:47.940
in doing more work on Native
American reservations.

02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:52.590
And on the Lakota Sioux tribe for
example, you know, literacy aside--

02:44:52.590 --> 02:44:54.110
and I think this is a
piece of it talking back

02:44:54.110 --> 02:44:57.540
to what you were saying, it's
the second lowest mortality rates

02:44:57.540 --> 02:44:59.990
in the Western Hemisphere
there after Haiti, right?

02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:01.480
And that's in the United States.

02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:04.310
And so, I think that
in those contexts

02:45:04.310 --> 02:45:06.290
and the White Mountain
Apache reservation

02:45:06.290 --> 02:45:08.090
where we've been working,
some of the teachers told us

02:45:08.090 --> 02:45:11.680
that literacy rates, you know, we
need to talk about what this means

02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:13.220
and what the statistics
are behind this.

02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:14.520
He was talking about
then about this.

02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:17.350
But they said less than
10% of the kids, right?

02:45:17.350 --> 02:45:18.900
And I think that's lower than a lot

02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:20.240
of the refugee camps
that we work in.

02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:21.540
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So, let me ask you,

02:45:21.540 --> 02:45:24.030
let's suppose you are
from a wealthy family.

02:45:24.030 --> 02:45:28.340
Your parents are pretty wealthy and
let's suppose they both have PhDs.

02:45:28.340 --> 02:45:32.430
The chance of you being illiterate
is zero, more ore less or not?

02:45:32.430 --> 02:45:35.020
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: I wouldn't say
zero because there are some kids

02:45:35.020 --> 02:45:37.180
that have a genuine
brain-based disability.

02:45:37.180 --> 02:45:39.800
And it's really hard for
them to learn to read.

02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:42.880 position:56%
And there are also a lot of kids
who are kind of teaching casualties.

02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:46.040 position:56%
Or teachers, we don't really respect
the dignity of a teaching profession

02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:47.680
as much as we should
in this country.

02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:49.640
And so, a lot of teachers
are not really prepared.

02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:52.300
So if they find a kid who
doesn't get at the first time,

02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:55.150
they may not know what to do to
help that kid, wealthy or not.

02:45:55.150 --> 02:45:56.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: What
percentage of children that you deal

02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:00.620
with would you say have dyslexia,
and they can't read because of

02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:02.780
that problem as opposed to the
other things we've addressed?

02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:06.740
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: It's probably
3, 4, 5, 6%, in that range.

02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:08.370
There's no perfect
test for this dyslexia,

02:46:08.370 --> 02:46:10.260
there's no blood test or biomarker.

02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:12.400
But that's what the
best research suggests.

02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:14.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
More in boys than girls?

02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:15.320
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Not especially.

02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:16.620
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:17.920
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Boys
are more noticeable

02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:19.220
because fidgeting and acting out.

02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:20.520
Girls tend to be a little quieter.

02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:21.820
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Right.

02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:23.120
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:24.570
And do you think illiteracy is a
higher problem in the United States

02:46:24.570 --> 02:46:28.040
in rural areas or in urban areas?

02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:32.360
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: I don't know the
statistics off the top of my head.

02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:35.160
But I will tell you
from our experience,

02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:39.030
it goes back to what Noel is saying
about, it's high poverty areas.

02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:41.690
So, very low income
families in rural areas

02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:45.080
and very low income families in
urban areas are actually just

02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:49.380
as isolated, have low
access to services.

02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:52.030
And if the parents have
limited literacy in either

02:46:52.030 --> 02:46:53.870
of those communities,
they're less likely to go

02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:55.460
out and seek those services.

02:46:55.460 --> 02:46:57.600
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: The most
literate state in the United States

02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:01.030
by literacy standards is?

02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:02.780
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Massachusetts
maybe or Connecticut?

02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:04.080
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: I think Iowa.

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:05.380
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Iowa, OK.

02:47:05.380 --> 02:47:06.680
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Iowa.

02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:07.980
What's the least literate?

02:47:07.980 --> 02:47:09.280
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Got
to be Mississippi.

02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:10.580
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: It's
got to be Mississippi.

02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:11.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:13.180
It's probably right.

02:47:13.180 --> 02:47:14.480
OK. So, let me ask you a problem
that I have talked about before

02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:16.040
that is not a function of
what you're really doing,

02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:18.250
but I'm interested and so
I'm going to ask you about it

02:47:18.250 --> 02:47:20.600
which is the problem of alliteracy.

02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:24.360
So, it turns out as I was
describing before that people

02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:27.360
who actually can read
choose not to read.

02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:29.070
And when they do read
something, they read,

02:47:29.070 --> 02:47:31.560
you know, something not a book.

02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:34.730
They might read something
less than a book and so forth.

02:47:34.730 --> 02:47:36.180
Why do you think so many people

02:47:36.180 --> 02:47:40.280
who are college-educated
can enjoy their life or feel

02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:42.420
that they can enjoy their life or
have a happy life without reading?

02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:45.380
Do you observe this problem very
much in your literacy efforts?

02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:46.680
I know you're focused
on those things but--

02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:49.930
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Well, I
would just pass it that--

02:47:49.930 --> 02:47:52.090
and I'm sure you have
more to say on this.

02:47:52.090 --> 02:47:54.360
But then, many people educated

02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:58.740
in our education system whether
they're wealthy or not don't--

02:47:58.740 --> 02:48:01.630
aren't given a love of reading

02:48:01.630 --> 02:48:05.350
because they're given uninteresting
materials to read in school

02:48:05.350 --> 02:48:08.180
that don't make you want
to pick up another book.

02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:12.880
For our families, what we find
is if we can build that bond

02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:16.840 position:56%
so that parents and children
discover the joy of reading together

02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:18.730
that the greatest thing is sitting

02:48:18.730 --> 02:48:21.810
on your parent's lap
and reading a book.

02:48:21.810 --> 02:48:23.390
That lasts.

02:48:23.390 --> 02:48:25.770
That child is a child that
goes into a classroom and runs

02:48:25.770 --> 02:48:29.500
and grabs a book because they
associate books with warmth

02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:32.280
and happiness and interest.

02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:35.520
So, I think we have a lot
of work to do to grow people

02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:38.270
who aren't alliterate
and really love reading.

02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:39.600
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: I would
say in that regard, it was--

02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:40.940
we gave an award last year,

02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:42.380
I can't remember the
name of the organization.

02:48:42.380 --> 02:48:45.590
But it was a very creative idea
where it turns out if you read

02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:48.360
to your children, that's a
good thing as we all know.

02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:52.530 position:56%
But if your-- let's say, your father
is away or your mother is away

02:48:52.530 --> 02:48:56.260 position:56%
and they're serving the military,
there was a program that they have--

02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:58.870
on a video screen, they have
the father or the mother reading

02:48:58.870 --> 02:49:01.430
in their uniform to their child
who's watching them on TV.

02:49:01.430 --> 02:49:03.640
It seemed that'd be a
pretty creative idea.

02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:05.910
I assume that kind of thing
works the best, right?

02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:07.210
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Yes, absolutely.

02:49:07.210 --> 02:49:10.390
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So today, why
do you think, as I said earlier,

02:49:10.390 --> 02:49:12.180
no politician running for president

02:49:12.180 --> 02:49:13.800
of United States mentioned
this issue?

02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:16.300
They forgot or they
don't know about it?

02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:17.600
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Because the people

02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:20.420
who experienced this issue are
not the people they're talking

02:49:20.420 --> 02:49:21.780
to when they're running for office.

02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:23.080
They're people they don't think--

02:49:23.080 --> 02:49:26.410
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: The donors
are not focused on that, right?

02:49:26.410 --> 02:49:27.710
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: No.

02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:30.060
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And how would
you propose that we get it to be

02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:32.160
on a higher part of
the national agenda?

02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:35.810
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Well,
in part, it takes people

02:49:35.810 --> 02:49:37.270
like you talking about it.

02:49:37.270 --> 02:49:38.570
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Oh.

02:49:38.570 --> 02:49:40.510
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: I think
that's critically important.

02:49:40.510 --> 02:49:45.560
[ Applause ]

02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:46.860
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:49.000
So today, I'll do what I can.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.300
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: I know you are.

02:49:50.300 --> 02:49:51.600
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Some candidates,

02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:56.360
I'm not sure they read the books
that much themselves, but OK.

02:49:56.360 --> 02:49:59.220
What would you say is the thing
that motivates you the most

02:49:59.220 --> 02:50:00.520
to get up everyday and do this?

02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:02.530
Is it that do you think you're
making a difference in the world

02:50:02.530 --> 02:50:06.530
and is that why you're
so interested in this?

02:50:06.530 --> 02:50:09.030
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Let's say
having spent that year in Texas

02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:12.220
and Mississippi ever since
and those kids are kind

02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:15.300
of living rent-free inside
my head and I can't get them

02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:16.650
out because I think about them.

02:50:16.650 --> 02:50:18.870 position:56%
So, that's the sort of mission part.

02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:20.500
And the other part is
working in media is fun.

02:50:20.500 --> 02:50:21.800
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:23.100
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: You know,
so we're creating content

02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:24.400
and reaching the audience.

02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:25.700
It's really intriguing.

02:50:25.700 --> 02:50:27.000
Intellectually, it's
a challenge everyday.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:28.500
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, do your
family say to you, why don't you go

02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:33.180
out and practice law and make more
money, they don't ever say that?

02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:35.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: No, [inaudible]
same compulsions that I have though.

02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:37.110
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

02:50:37.110 --> 02:50:41.480
OK. OK. So in your case, this
is going to be your life's work.

02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:43.320
But what is the greatest
gratification you'd get?

02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:46.500
What is it that makes you feel so
great when you come home at the end

02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:49.440
of the day and what kind of
thing happens through the day

02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:52.140
that you actually find
the most gratifying?

02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:54.890
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: It's the success
stories from our families or going

02:50:54.890 --> 02:50:58.560
to a site and having parents tell
you how this changed their life

02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:02.370
or going to a graduation and
a little girl comes up to you

02:51:02.370 --> 02:51:05.720
with the stethoscope from the
doctor's kit that we brought in,

02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:08.340
she knows all the names of
everything in the doctor's kit

02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:10.410
and she tells you that
she's going to be a doctor.

02:51:10.410 --> 02:51:12.520
And not only she can be a
doctor, she can be the first child

02:51:12.520 --> 02:51:13.820
in their family to graduate

02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:15.700
from high school before
she gets to being a doctor.

02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:17.000
That's what keeps me going.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:18.300
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:19.860
So let me ask you, that video
that you showed earlier,

02:51:19.860 --> 02:51:24.560
that take about 24 hours to do,
you did it in a time-lapse, right?

02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:25.970
How long do you really
take to do that?

02:51:25.970 --> 02:51:27.270
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Twenty minutes.

02:51:27.270 --> 02:51:28.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Twenty minutes?

02:51:28.570 --> 02:51:29.870
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Mm-hmm.

02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:31.170
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And do you
have to train people to do that

02:51:31.170 --> 02:51:32.470
or go to school to learn
how to do that or--

02:51:32.470 --> 02:51:34.020
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: It's
a degree at Harvard.

02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:35.320
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

02:51:35.320 --> 02:51:36.620
Is that that hard or?

02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:39.250
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: So for the first
implementation, it takes an hour

02:51:39.250 --> 02:51:41.840
or so for everyone to work
together and figure it out.

02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:43.990
And then as a couple of
weeks pass, everyone--

02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:46.720
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
how many of those exist?

02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:48.020
How many--

02:51:48.020 --> 02:51:49.320
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang:
We have 70 right now.

02:51:49.320 --> 02:51:50.620
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Seventy?

02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:51.920
And what do they cost
to manufacture?

02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:53.220
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Twenty thousand.

02:51:53.220 --> 02:51:54.520
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: $20,000?

02:51:54.520 --> 02:51:55.820
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Mm-hmm.

02:51:55.820 --> 02:51:57.120
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And you can--

02:51:57.120 --> 02:51:58.420
you ship them or how
do you get them?

02:51:58.420 --> 02:51:59.720
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Yup.

02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:01.020
So, part of this is thinking
through the supply chain, right?

02:52:01.020 --> 02:52:02.320
So, we started as a book
donation organization

02:52:02.320 --> 02:52:04.310
and books would get wet
during transportation.

02:52:04.310 --> 02:52:06.780
They'd have no security when
they-- or storage when they arrive.

02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:08.680
And then once they do
arrive, they're not integrated

02:52:08.680 --> 02:52:10.880
into the broader education system.

02:52:10.880 --> 02:52:14.030
And so, this was a way for
us to think through all

02:52:14.030 --> 02:52:16.360
of the different supply
chain challenges including

02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:17.660
the transportation.

02:52:17.660 --> 02:52:18.960
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: The young
children that you often deal with,

02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:21.260
what percentage of them do not
have access to the internet?

02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:22.990
And therefore at home,
they don't have a computer.

02:52:22.990 --> 02:52:24.290
They don't have access to it.

02:52:24.290 --> 02:52:25.590
So, they're not learning to read

02:52:25.590 --> 02:52:28.150
on the computer the way
some people are now.

02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:30.400
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: I would say
that beyond access, it's a question

02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:32.390
of accessibility too, right?

02:52:32.390 --> 02:52:34.950 position:56%
Because especially we're seeing this
in the areas where we're working

02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:37.240
and where you're getting access
to internet for the first time,

02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:40.410
often those users will believe that
anything on the internet is true

02:52:40.410 --> 02:52:43.460
or than that's even worse, for
dealing with misinformation.

02:52:43.460 --> 02:52:45.010
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
You mean, it's not--

02:52:45.010 --> 02:52:46.310
[ Laughter ]

02:52:46.310 --> 02:52:47.610
I thought everything was.

02:52:47.610 --> 02:52:48.910
OK. It's not, OK.

02:52:48.910 --> 02:52:50.210
All right.

02:52:50.210 --> 02:52:51.640
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: I would
say at least half

02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:54.430
of our families do not have
regular access to the internet,

02:52:54.430 --> 02:52:55.730
certainly not in their homes.

02:52:55.730 --> 02:52:59.420 position:56%
And even if they have a smartphone,
they don't always have the data plan

02:52:59.420 --> 02:53:00.850 position:56%
because they can't always afford it.

02:53:00.850 --> 02:53:04.450
So, assuming that they're going
to be able to get to content

02:53:04.450 --> 02:53:09.190
without us helping to
facilitate it is a challenge.

02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:11.560
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: I know
starts are about right.

02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:15.730
And so, we really focus on
working with teachers and all

02:53:15.730 --> 02:53:18.520
of the professionals to
touch families as opposed

02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:21.000
to necessarily feeling would
always find the families directly.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:24.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: The best source
of raising money for you is who,

02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:28.620 position:56%
business people or people feel
guilty, they're not in the business?

02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:31.620
Who is it that you get
to raise most money from?

02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:32.920
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang:
For the Ideas Box,

02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:35.560
it came from the Soros Foundation.

02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:37.010
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:53:37.010 --> 02:53:38.600
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Primarily,
private foundations.

02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:42.950
Although we are getting in
several states like Massachusetts,

02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:45.060
states dollars, that
help support the program.

02:53:45.060 --> 02:53:46.360
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:47.660
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: We
got some big grants

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:48.960
from the Department of Education.

02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:50.750
But now, we're supported
by foundations

02:53:50.750 --> 02:53:53.940
and we make some money
online from Goggle ads.

02:53:53.940 --> 02:53:56.960
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And do
you feel the US government

02:53:56.960 --> 02:53:59.950
when they give you money, they
make it too easy to get it

02:53:59.950 --> 02:54:02.730
because the forms are, you
know, easy to fill out?

02:54:02.730 --> 02:54:04.710
Is that a problem--

02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:06.080
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: That
was the biggest thing.

02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:07.380
I felt guilty.

02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:08.680
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
what about foundations,

02:54:08.680 --> 02:54:10.270
are they easily get money from
because their forms are easy?

02:54:10.270 --> 02:54:11.570
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: No.

02:54:11.570 --> 02:54:12.870
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: And all the same.

02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:14.170
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: Right.

02:54:14.170 --> 02:54:15.470
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

02:54:15.470 --> 02:54:16.770
Yes.

02:54:16.770 --> 02:54:18.070
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: I think
that's why we're trying to think

02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:19.370
about social enterprise
model, right?

02:54:19.370 --> 02:54:21.570
In Burundi, the users have
been charging folks who come

02:54:21.570 --> 02:54:24.510
in to watch a movie at the box and
hoping to pay for operational cost.

02:54:24.510 --> 02:54:25.920
And those are kind of
the models we want to--

02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:27.220
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Let's
suppose the next president

02:54:27.220 --> 02:54:29.960
of United States called you up
and said, I don't really know much

02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:33.570
about your problem, I'll give
you, you know, 20 seconds.

02:54:33.570 --> 02:54:35.500
Explain to me everything I
need to know about your problem

02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:36.800
and what I should do about it.

02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:38.100
What would you say?

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:39.480
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: That
literacy is not incorporated

02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:42.520
into disaster relief or any
international aid work that we do

02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:44.270
or enough international
aid work that we do.

02:54:44.270 --> 02:54:47.280
And that we have-- through
supply chain challenges

02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:48.580
to be able to provide it.

02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:50.570
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And what
would you say to the next president

02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:52.050
of the United States about what?

02:54:52.050 --> 02:54:54.940
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: That the only way
we're going to solve the illiteracy

02:54:54.940 --> 02:54:59.770 position:56%
and high school graduation issue in
this country is by reaching children

02:54:59.770 --> 02:55:01.860
and their parents before
they enter school.

02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:04.100
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: What would
you say to the next president?

02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:05.960
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: I'd
say we can solve this.

02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:09.140 position:56%
And if we don't solve this, we can't
really effectively address any other

02:55:09.140 --> 02:55:10.440
social problem.

02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:11.740
So, we better solve it.

02:55:11.740 --> 02:55:13.040
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:14.340
OK. All right.

02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:17.420
So, any questions from people?

02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:20.590
Anybody have any questions?

02:55:20.590 --> 02:55:23.360
Questions?

02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:25.510
Don't be shy.

02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:30.380
Whoever asks a question
will get a grant.

02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:31.680
So--

02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:37.020
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Oh, wait a
minute, I have a question.

02:55:37.020 --> 02:55:38.320
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:40.530
And congratulations to
the three award winners.

02:55:40.530 --> 02:55:42.110
So, I work for USAID.

02:55:42.110 --> 02:55:45.980
So, we do most of our programing
overseas and other countries.

02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:47.980
And the lessons from the examples

02:55:47.980 --> 02:55:51.840
of your projects I think are
completely replicable and something

02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:53.700
that we could use internationally.

02:55:53.700 --> 02:55:57.800 position:56%
But I wanted to ask you as sort of
a panelist of a literacy specialist,

02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:01.130
how replicable do you think
your activities are in terms

02:56:01.130 --> 02:56:05.760 position:56%
of big challenges, simply not having
enough materials and local languages

02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:08.800
and how would you address that
if kids don't have materials

02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:12.500
and languages which they could
read, it's hard to have that as one

02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:15.070
of the building blocks of their
future's success in reading.

02:56:15.070 --> 02:56:17.550
So, I just wanted to
have your reactions to--

02:56:17.550 --> 02:56:20.350
or the projects that you're working
on, Allister, maybe you can talk

02:56:20.350 --> 02:56:23.660
about open education resources
as a source and materials.

02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:24.960
Thank you.

02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:27.140
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Well, open
education resources and to add

02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:29.570
to that too I think the--
one of the beautiful things

02:56:29.570 --> 02:56:32.600
about a library space and
informal education spaces is

02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.000
that they are also opportunities
for people to create content,

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
not just access them, right?

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:43.540 position:56%
And so for us, a lot of our programs
are built around involving students

02:56:43.540 --> 02:56:50.030
to help build that database of
content available in the community.

02:56:50.030 --> 02:56:51.330
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:56:51.330 --> 02:56:52.630
Yeah.

02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:53.930
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: We have
another website called "Colorín,

02:56:53.930 --> 02:56:55.530
Colorado" which was actually
started because of user demand.

02:56:55.530 --> 02:56:57.850
A lot of people came to
Reading Rockets and said,

02:56:57.850 --> 02:57:01.020 position:56%
I know how to teach these kids, but
what do I do about English learners?

02:57:01.020 --> 02:57:04.170 position:56%
And in most of the countries I
understand that you're working with,

02:57:04.170 --> 02:57:06.400
the language of instruction
is different from the language

02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:07.700
that the kids are speaking at home.

02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:11.010
So, you absolutely have to
start with the native language.

02:57:11.010 --> 02:57:13.670
And that I think the
principles that we try support

02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:17.030 position:56%
on Colorín are applicable to any
second language learner in the world

02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:19.240
which is now most of them.

02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:21.360
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So, let me ask you this.

02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:24.930
Right now, the Nobel Peace Prize
has never been given for literacy,

02:57:24.930 --> 02:57:27.700
though you could argue that maybe
they would give one for literacy.

02:57:27.700 --> 02:57:30.790
So, which person around the
world do you think has, honestly,

02:57:30.790 --> 02:57:36.520
over the last 20, 30 years done the
most to help the literacy movement?

02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:38.500
There must somebody
who you would say

02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:40.430
as a role model for
you, or you, or you.

02:57:40.430 --> 02:57:44.770
Is there anybody that you think
has done such a great job?

02:57:44.770 --> 02:57:47.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: I have one nominee.

02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:50.300
His name is Reid Lyon and he
ran the reading program at NIH

02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:52.220
for about 15 or 20 years.

02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:54.470
And from this middle level of
position in the government,

02:57:54.470 --> 02:57:56.780
he wound up being the
most influential person

02:57:56.780 --> 02:57:58.450
in setting reading polls.

02:57:58.450 --> 02:58:01.080
And he has inspired so many people
in this country including me,

02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:02.650
I don't know, the worldwide
situation as well.

02:58:02.650 --> 02:58:06.250
But he is a hero to me and
many, many other people.

02:58:06.250 --> 02:58:07.550
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

02:58:07.550 --> 02:58:12.430
Any other candidates for
the Nobel Peace Prize?

02:58:12.430 --> 02:58:21.370
No? All right.

02:58:21.370 --> 02:58:30.560
Do you have a question?

02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:31.860
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

02:58:31.860 --> 02:58:34.520
And with the STGs for instance.

02:58:34.520 --> 02:58:37.180
I mean, we've taken step backwards.

02:58:37.180 --> 02:58:41.530
We're going-- You know, literacy
is no longer the priority.

02:58:41.530 --> 02:58:44.360 position:56%
We no longer make education for all.

02:58:44.360 --> 02:58:48.650
We're talking about substantial
proportions of the population.

02:58:48.650 --> 02:58:52.280 position:56%
How do we-- I mean, if we can't even
persuade, you know, the government,

02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:59.490
how-- if the international-- the
global orientations for education

02:58:59.490 --> 02:59:02.250 position:56%
and literacy aren't powerful enough,

02:59:02.250 --> 02:59:09.970 position:56%
what sort of law we can change the
way the world thinks about literacy?

02:59:09.970 --> 02:59:18.110
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: So, I mentioned
the Global Campaign for Education

02:59:18.110 --> 02:59:21.000
that they have three staff and
they're a lobbying group, right?

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:22.300
And that's it.

02:59:22.300 --> 02:59:25.160
Well, there's a few other groups.

02:59:25.160 --> 02:59:28.970
There's an idea that is starting
to float around within these spaces

02:59:28.970 --> 02:59:33.230
that I've been having
conferences at of where's the money

02:59:33.230 --> 02:59:37.460
and how do we frame this work
to able to access that money.

02:59:37.460 --> 02:59:41.300
And I think the purists would find
this to be less more offensive.

02:59:41.300 --> 02:59:45.230
But can we think about
literacy as a way to fold

02:59:45.230 --> 02:59:47.730
into countering violent
extremism and other places

02:59:47.730 --> 02:59:51.380
where there is a lot of money
being set aside for right now.

02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:54.830
One of our camps Welcoming Centers
in Europe, our facilitator called

02:59:54.830 --> 02:59:58.480
and said, you know, ISIS
is actively recruiting

02:59:58.480 --> 03:00:00.060
on site at the Welcoming Center.

03:00:00.060 --> 03:00:01.420
I can work with 60 people.

03:00:01.420 --> 03:00:04.730
There's 400 people
here, what do I do?

03:00:04.730 --> 03:00:08.230
And we can only work with so
many people at any given time.

03:00:08.230 --> 03:00:10.750
I think that there's
a direct link there.

03:00:10.750 --> 03:00:14.700
And I'm curious to see how we
can work as a community to go

03:00:14.700 --> 03:00:19.100
where the money is as well as
pull more money into this space.

03:00:19.100 --> 03:00:20.570
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, OK.

03:00:20.570 --> 03:00:22.010
Question? Yes.

03:00:22.010 --> 03:00:23.350
[ Inaudible Remark ]

03:00:23.350 --> 03:00:24.650
Get her a mic.

03:00:24.650 --> 03:00:25.950
&gt;&gt; Right here, right here.

03:00:25.950 --> 03:00:27.250
Right here.

03:00:27.250 --> 03:00:28.550
Here.

03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:29.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

03:00:29.850 --> 03:00:31.930
One of those things that
we're trying to do at--

03:00:31.930 --> 03:00:34.060
through UNESCO right now
is something called the

03:00:34.060 --> 03:00:35.790
"Global Alliance for Literacy".

03:00:35.790 --> 03:00:40.980
And the major tenet of
that is to take literacy

03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:43.610
out of the education ghetto.

03:00:43.610 --> 03:00:47.560
Literacy cannot be the property
of the education departments.

03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:53.470 position:56%
We know too well that literacy is
essential for the economy, for jobs,

03:00:53.470 --> 03:00:56.300
for the jobs [inaudible]
for the recent meeting.

03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:59.530
I read an article on the Wall
Street Journal that said in Ohio,

03:00:59.530 --> 03:01:02.060
there's always unemployment
of white-collar workers.

03:01:02.060 --> 03:01:05.130
And they said there were
these factories that had jobs,

03:01:05.130 --> 03:01:08.730
but they couldn't fill them because
people didn't have the skills,

03:01:08.730 --> 03:01:12.380
literacy and education, then
this health, health care.

03:01:12.380 --> 03:01:13.680
How people are going to be able

03:01:13.680 --> 03:01:16.940
to provide healthcare
if they can't read?

03:01:16.940 --> 03:01:20.420
And let me add, I know we're
talking about the children.

03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:24.560
But, you know, there is no such
thing as a child in poverty folks.

03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:25.990
They were children who
have the misfortune

03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:28.160
of living with poor parents.

03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:31.070
And if those parents
can't read and write,

03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:33.250
they're not going to
learn earn a living.

03:01:33.250 --> 03:01:36.880
So, let's think of those children
in the context of their homes

03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:39.180
in the communities and
make sure the parents

03:01:39.180 --> 03:01:42.340
and the communities get
these skills they need.

03:01:42.340 --> 03:01:43.640
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: What-- OK.

03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:46.030
What was the most influential
book you ever read or book

03:01:46.030 --> 03:01:47.900
that influenced you
the most, any book?

03:01:47.900 --> 03:01:49.810
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Toni
Morrison, "The Bluest Eye".

03:01:49.810 --> 03:01:51.110
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:53.090
What was the most influential book?

03:01:53.090 --> 03:01:55.530
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: I'm going
to say it was Little House

03:01:55.530 --> 03:01:58.070
in the Big Woods because--
by Laura Ingalls Wilder

03:01:58.070 --> 03:02:01.660
because that was the book that
made me love reading and enabled me

03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:04.140
to read all the other
books I've read.

03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:09.630
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: My kids would
kill me, but it was [inaudible].

03:02:09.630 --> 03:02:12.010
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
let me you all a book story.

03:02:12.010 --> 03:02:16.080
Maybe some of you have
heard me say this before.

03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:18.990
My-- I own a-- partner
at a private equity firm.

03:02:18.990 --> 03:02:20.580
And a number of years ago,

03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:22.950
we've bought a company
called Baker &amp; Taylor.

03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:24.250
Some of you may have heard of this.

03:02:24.250 --> 03:02:26.510
It's the second largest book
distributor in Unites Sates.

03:02:26.510 --> 03:02:30.700
It started in 1839, and had
not made a profit since 1839.

03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:32.000
We've bought it.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:33.300
It was always break
even and so fort.

03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:35.250
I think it was second
to Ingram at that time.

03:02:35.250 --> 03:02:39.750
And one day, a salesman came
into our board meeting and said,

03:02:39.750 --> 03:02:42.160
I found a new way to make
money because distribution

03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:43.840
of books isn't that profitable.

03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:46.360
But somebody came in
and said that he wanted

03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:48.120
to rent our bibliography of books.

03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:49.590
Now, the biggest bibliography
of books

03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:52.000
in United States is no doubt
owned by the Library of Congress,

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:53.930
but they don't sell
that bibliography.

03:02:53.930 --> 03:02:56.560
So, we owned the second
biggest bibliography.

03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:01.100
And this person said he was--
he wanted to rent it from us.

03:03:01.100 --> 03:03:02.840
And he wanted to give
us a third of a company.

03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:04.780
He was starting to sell books.

03:03:04.780 --> 03:03:06.680
And our salesman is saying, why?

03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:09.770
Wait a second, we're not taking
stock in a startup company.

03:03:09.770 --> 03:03:11.300
We're too smart for that.

03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:12.600
Give us some cash.

03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:14.600
So, they negotiated a
deal, $100,000 a year

03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:16.060
for five years and then we rent it.

03:03:16.060 --> 03:03:19.380
OK. A couple months later, I read
about a company being started

03:03:19.380 --> 03:03:22.130
in Seattle, I think
it was called Amazon.

03:03:22.130 --> 03:03:25.310
And I said, wait a second, maybe
they would like to rent this too

03:03:25.310 --> 03:03:26.810
because they're going to
sell books on the internet.

03:03:26.810 --> 03:03:29.710 position:56%
So, I called up the salesman and
said maybe there'll be another idiot

03:03:29.710 --> 03:03:31.710
that would pay $100,000
a year for something

03:03:31.710 --> 03:03:33.940
that doesn't cost us
anything, it's free money.

03:03:33.940 --> 03:03:35.770
He said, no, that's the idiot
I already did deal with.

03:03:35.770 --> 03:03:38.280
So, I said oh, OK.

03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:39.770
So, I read a little bit
more about it and I said,

03:03:39.770 --> 03:03:41.900
maybe this company is
worth more than I thought.

03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:43.630
So, I went up to see Jeff Bezos.

03:03:43.630 --> 03:03:46.350
And I said, you know, our
salesman, he made a mistake, he--

03:03:46.350 --> 03:03:48.360
we're really lucky to be
a third of the company,

03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:50.820
and we don't want this
$100,000 a year.

03:03:50.820 --> 03:03:52.120
He said, I don't think
I need you quite

03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:53.760
as much I did about a year ago.

03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:55.820
But you were helpful to
get me off the ground.

03:03:55.820 --> 03:03:57.890
So, I tell you what I'll do,
we'll tear off the contract

03:03:57.890 --> 03:04:01.590
and I'll give you a stock in
our company and he gave us 1%.

03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:04.950
We didn't have confidence in the
company, so we sold it at the IPO.

03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:08.970
That stock is now worth about
four and a half billion dollars.

03:04:08.970 --> 03:04:16.490
So, anybody got a more
heartbreaking story about books?

03:04:16.490 --> 03:04:19.000
So, I would have more
money to give to literacy.

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:23.400
But-- So, let me ask you a
final question, if I could.

03:04:23.400 --> 03:04:29.790
Today, as you look at the
world of literacy and so forth,

03:04:29.790 --> 03:04:33.010
what would you say the world
of literacy, those people care

03:04:33.010 --> 03:04:36.900
about this need to do that
they're not doing and talking

03:04:36.900 --> 03:04:40.610
to the Congress or talking to the
public or the business community

03:04:40.610 --> 03:04:43.440
or the president of the United
States to kind of make this seem

03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:45.800
like it's a more urgent issue
than some people think it is.

03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:47.720
What would you recommend
that the people

03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:51.220
in the literacy world do
to kind of elevate this?

03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:56.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: Well, I want to get
back to your comment because I think

03:04:56.700 --> 03:05:00.960
that the fact that all of these
folks out there who were trying

03:05:00.960 --> 03:05:05.500
to get literate and reading are
the workforce of the future is one

03:05:05.500 --> 03:05:07.350
of the most compelling
arguments we can make.

03:05:07.350 --> 03:05:10.420
And actually, the place where we've
been most successful in growing,

03:05:10.420 --> 03:05:13.580
we now serve 1,200
families a year in Seattle

03:05:13.580 --> 03:05:15.970
because the Seattle
business community more

03:05:15.970 --> 03:05:18.880
than any other business
community in this country looked

03:05:18.880 --> 03:05:22.100
at the literacy rate and the
high school graduation rate

03:05:22.100 --> 03:05:24.880
in their county and said, 20
years from now, we're not going

03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:27.880
to have a workforce unless
we start investing it

03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:29.270
in families and children and young.

03:05:29.270 --> 03:05:32.750
So I think if all of us could get
together and speak with one voice

03:05:32.750 --> 03:05:36.840
about how important this is
for the future of our country,

03:05:36.840 --> 03:05:41.430
that would be the most
compelling argument I can make.

03:05:41.430 --> 03:05:43.850
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All
right, any additional comment?

03:05:43.850 --> 03:05:45.150
No?

03:05:45.150 --> 03:05:46.550
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: I would say
come and see for yourself.

03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:49.250
You have one hour to give me, don't
spend it in your office or mind.

03:05:49.250 --> 03:05:50.550
Let's go visit a school.

03:05:50.550 --> 03:05:52.230
But I'm going to pick the
school and no cameras there.

03:05:52.230 --> 03:05:54.140
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And do you books online

03:05:54.140 --> 03:05:56.180
or do you actually
get the physical book?

03:05:56.180 --> 03:05:59.110
&gt;&gt; Noel Gunther: I still read-- One
more thing about influential book,

03:05:59.110 --> 03:06:02.190
"The Cat in the Hat",
the original disruptor--

03:06:02.190 --> 03:06:03.490
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

03:06:03.490 --> 03:06:04.790
All right.

03:06:04.790 --> 03:06:06.090
OK. Allister Chang:
The-- Sorry, go ahead.

03:06:06.090 --> 03:06:07.390
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Go ahead.

03:06:07.390 --> 03:06:08.690
Go ahead.

03:06:08.690 --> 03:06:09.990
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Answering
that question and building

03:06:09.990 --> 03:06:11.500
up of what you just said, the OECD
came out with a study that said

03:06:11.500 --> 03:06:15.330
that we spend in the US 0.1% of
our GDP on job retraining programs

03:06:15.330 --> 03:06:16.630
for adults who've lost their job

03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:19.190
versus in other OECD
countries 0.6% of their GDP.

03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:23.110
I think that there's a lot of
arguments to make especially

03:06:23.110 --> 03:06:27.310
in rural towns in the US,
we haven't been investing

03:06:27.310 --> 03:06:30.370
in folks who've lost
their-- still no jobs.

03:06:30.370 --> 03:06:33.920
And that's creating a lot of the
anger and frustration right now.

03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:36.490
Internationally, I'd just say
that, you know, in Europe,

03:06:36.490 --> 03:06:43.310 position:56%
we're learning firsthand that people
can walk from Syria to Dusseldorf.

03:06:43.310 --> 03:06:44.610
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

03:06:44.610 --> 03:06:47.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: They have been--
The borders are-- of the world are--

03:06:47.250 --> 03:06:51.500
the world is much smaller
than today than ever.

03:06:51.500 --> 03:06:56.110
And I think that especially with
now millions, over 50 million

03:06:56.110 --> 03:07:00.230
of these families being
without literacy tools.

03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:04.770
We are-- We're creating
problems for our future.

03:07:04.770 --> 03:07:09.880
And that there's absolute
world need for us

03:07:09.880 --> 03:07:11.210
to start dealing with that now.

03:07:11.210 --> 03:07:12.510
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: OK.

03:07:12.510 --> 03:07:14.810
So final question, if each
of you could meet one writer

03:07:14.810 --> 03:07:19.510
who has ever lived, who
would you like to meet?

03:07:19.510 --> 03:07:23.350
[ Laughs ]

03:07:23.350 --> 03:07:25.520

03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:28.330
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
F. Scott Fitzgerald

[ Inaudible Remark ]

03:07:30.650 --> 03:07:32.750
&gt;&gt; Sara Walter: That's unfair.

03:07:32.750 --> 03:07:34.780
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Oh, wow.

03:07:34.780 --> 03:07:37.400
Well, you know, I've
been doing lot of reading

03:07:37.400 --> 03:07:40.010
into whether Shakespeare
was a real person or not.

03:07:40.010 --> 03:07:41.310
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

03:07:41.310 --> 03:07:42.610
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: And
what's interesting there is

03:07:42.610 --> 03:07:44.810
that the purists in English will
say that the writer doesn't matter;

03:07:44.810 --> 03:07:47.090
it's the text that's
important, right?

03:07:47.090 --> 03:07:50.130
But I would love to
meet this Edward Burke.

03:07:50.130 --> 03:07:51.430

Homer to find if he's really blind

03:07:54.290 --> 03:07:55.650
and if he really could
write that much [inaudible].

03:07:55.650 --> 03:07:56.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Oh, OK.

03:07:56.950 --> 03:08:00.420
Thank you very much for
great a conversation.

03:08:00.420 --> 03:08:01.720

03:08:01.720 --> 03:08:03.520

03:08:33.860 --> 03:08:38.860 position:56%
So thank you so much Mr. Rubenstein,
and thank you to our prize winners.

03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:40.650
This was a fabulous discussion.

03:08:40.650 --> 03:08:43.990
We intended for this block of
time to actually continue the Q&amp;A.

03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:46.730
And what we hope to do-- am I on?

03:08:46.730 --> 03:08:50.500
OK. And what we hope to do
is build on the conversation

03:08:50.500 --> 03:08:52.990
that we've had both this afternoon

03:08:52.990 --> 03:08:54.650
and this morning in
terms of the blend.

03:08:54.650 --> 03:08:59.230
One of the things that we were
intending to do is kind of listen

03:08:59.230 --> 03:09:06.460
for the themes and listen for kind
of where the threads the strongest

03:09:06.460 --> 03:09:09.820
in the conversations throughout
the morning and the afternoon.

03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:13.020
And one of the places
that I heard was the issue

03:09:13.020 --> 03:09:15.750
of content in the native tongue.

03:09:15.750 --> 03:09:17.870
And I know there are a
couple of different people

03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:20.790
in the room [inaudible] which
mic I should be speaking

03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:22.090
into in this moment.

03:09:22.090 --> 03:09:27.560 position:56%
There are couple different people
in the room who could speak to that.

03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:32.370
And we'd like to find out if you
would like to that at this time.

03:09:32.370 --> 03:09:35.410
Can you hear me now?

03:09:35.410 --> 03:09:36.710
Which one?

03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:38.010
I'm turning this off?

03:09:38.010 --> 03:09:39.310
OK, great.

03:09:39.310 --> 03:09:40.610
Thank you.

03:09:40.610 --> 03:09:41.910
Bless you.

03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:45.540 position:56%
So, we wanted to find out if
there's an opportunity at this point

03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:49.240
for people to pick up on the theme
about literature being available

03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:52.060
in the common tongue and the
native language of the child.

03:09:52.060 --> 03:09:53.770
I really-- I am looking
around the around the room

03:09:53.770 --> 03:09:55.200
and I'm seeing people
that I've been talking

03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:57.630
to over the last the few months
who were working in this area.

03:09:57.630 --> 03:10:02.410
Some of the award winners
brought up the issue and others

03:10:02.410 --> 03:10:05.040
who were actually working on it
haven't had a chance to speak.

03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:08.480
So, we wanted to find out if that
is something that people would

03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:09.780
like to do it as this time.

03:10:09.780 --> 03:10:13.180
And this time was allotted
for more Q&amp;A for us

03:10:13.180 --> 03:10:14.970
to be dialoging with each other.

03:10:14.970 --> 03:10:16.620
So, where're my mic runners?

03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:17.920
Oh, there you are.

03:10:17.920 --> 03:10:21.870
Ready? Yes?

03:10:21.870 --> 03:10:28.210
No? Yes. I was hoping
you'd raise your hand.

03:10:28.210 --> 03:10:30.340
Yes, Christie.

03:10:30.340 --> 03:10:32.750
Thank you.

I'm Christie Vilsack.

03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:38.350
I am the Senior Advisor for
International Education at USAID.

03:10:38.350 --> 03:10:40.660
And I carry this with
me all the time.

03:10:40.660 --> 03:10:43.390
And I know we have SIL here.

03:10:43.390 --> 03:10:47.230
But USA and Tony spoke to
this a little bit earlier,

03:10:47.230 --> 03:10:53.190
this is a little bit of magic
because this flash drive can be put

03:10:53.190 --> 03:10:55.390
into any computer in the world.

03:10:55.390 --> 03:10:59.480
And with a very short tutorial, any
of us in this room would be able

03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:02.630
to start writing books for
children in local languages.

03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:06.260
And I know some of the
recipients today are actually going

03:11:06.260 --> 03:11:07.630
to be helping us do this.

03:11:07.630 --> 03:11:12.510
We hope everybody will as we help
create The Global Book Alliance

03:11:12.510 --> 03:11:16.320
because we are going to
create a digital library

03:11:16.320 --> 03:11:19.800
in the Cloud open source
so that anybody

03:11:19.800 --> 03:11:22.400
in the world whether it's a
domestic teacher or a librarian,

03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:25.700
whether it's an international
parents, any place in the world

03:11:25.700 --> 03:11:27.410
or teachers, any place
in the world will be able

03:11:27.410 --> 03:11:30.390
to start producing books
in these local languages.

03:11:30.390 --> 03:11:38.130 position:56%
So, you can talk to me or Tony or go
online to USAID education or to SIL

03:11:38.130 --> 03:11:42.340
or to World Vision or
just about anybody.

03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:45.960
I know that one of our
best practices library

03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:50.790 position:56%
for all will be doing in Haiti, will
be helping us use the Bloom software

03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:53.530
to start creating books
in local languages there.

03:11:53.530 --> 03:11:56.700
And there are of peace out
there right now to our agency

03:11:56.700 --> 03:11:59.910
for whole countries
to engage and figuring

03:11:59.910 --> 03:12:02.850
out how they want to
meet these needs.

03:12:02.850 --> 03:12:07.310
I've just come from
Rwanda and Malawi and Kenya

03:12:07.310 --> 03:12:09.580
where for the first
time every child in all

03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:12.810
of those countries will have
a book in the first grade

03:12:12.810 --> 03:12:16.360 position:56%
in their local language as well as
a book in English, and by next year,

03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:18.030
second, third and fourth grade.

03:12:18.030 --> 03:12:20.800
So, we're really working to scale
and we appreciate the help of all

03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:24.030
of our partners in the room and
out there to help us get this done.

03:12:24.030 --> 03:12:27.670
It may take us a while to have a
digital library with every book

03:12:27.670 --> 03:12:29.490
and every language,
but we're committed

03:12:29.490 --> 03:12:32.830
to doing it even those really
obscure languages it may be some

03:12:32.830 --> 03:12:35.250
of us don't even know exist yet.

03:12:35.250 --> 03:12:38.000

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.480
&gt;&gt; Judy Cochran: I'm Judy Cochran

03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:43.950
And we developed the software
that she's talking about.

03:12:43.950 --> 03:12:49.080
And I would just like to direct you
if you're interested to the website

03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:52.830
which is bloomlibrary.org.

03:12:52.830 --> 03:12:56.290
And if you want to remember
it, it's bloom because you want

03:12:56.290 --> 03:13:00.650 position:56%
to grow a library, bloomlibrary.org.

03:13:00.650 --> 03:13:01.950
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Oh, great.

03:13:01.950 --> 03:13:03.250
Thanks.

03:13:03.250 --> 03:13:04.550
&gt;&gt; Judy Cochran: And I
was talking about SIL too.

03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:07.730
But African storybook, there are
lots of [inaudible], there are lots

03:13:07.730 --> 03:13:10.110
of other online products
that are helping us do this

03:13:10.110 --> 03:13:13.690
and we will gather
all of them together

03:13:13.690 --> 03:13:15.570
in the Global Book Alliance.

03:13:15.570 --> 03:13:19.410
But that's-- Bloom software
is just one of them.

03:13:19.410 --> 03:13:23.050 position:56%

03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:28.890
on the Literacy Awards
Advisory Board.

03:13:28.890 --> 03:13:31.950
And our Rubenstein winner

03:13:31.950 --> 03:13:35.300
in the second year was an
organization called Room to Read

03:13:35.300 --> 03:13:36.890
which works internationally.

03:13:36.890 --> 03:13:39.110
And I remember reviewing
their information.

03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:42.000
And one of the most impressive
things that they were doing,

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:45.160 position:56%
they were working in many
different countries around the world

03:13:45.160 --> 03:13:50.120
and they were actually teaching
local people to become authors

03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:54.720
and illustrators and they have over
1,500 books that they've created

03:13:54.720 --> 03:13:56.180
in 19 different languages.

03:13:56.180 --> 03:13:58.160
I just went on their
website a few minutes ago

03:13:58.160 --> 03:13:59.850
to get an update on that.

03:13:59.850 --> 03:14:03.960
And so, my question and
challenge to this group is how

03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:09.770
to leverage the expertise and the
resources created by other programs

03:14:09.770 --> 03:14:11.130
that come to our attention.

03:14:11.130 --> 03:14:15.750 position:56%
How do we reach out to Room to Read
and see if we can build on the books

03:14:15.750 --> 03:14:18.200
in native languages that
they've already created

03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:20.420
that could be useful to all of us.

03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:21.750
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson:
Allister, you want to respond?

03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:23.660
OK, great.

03:14:23.660 --> 03:14:25.730
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: I think
it's a great question.

03:14:25.730 --> 03:14:29.260
And to even push that
further, I think we're--

03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:32.250
there's collaborations to
be made across our sector.

03:14:32.250 --> 03:14:35.760
But last year, one of last
year's winner was also Kyle

03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:37.060
from First Book.

03:14:37.060 --> 03:14:39.500
And I-- what I think was really
interesting about their work is

03:14:39.500 --> 03:14:44.920
that they're aggregating enough
buyers to be able to have leverage

03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:47.580
to go to publishers to say
we need bilingual books

03:14:47.580 --> 03:14:52.360 position:56%
and we will buy 300,000 copies of it
if you publish the bilingual books.

03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:54.900
And as a community, if we could
all get together and be that--

03:14:54.900 --> 03:14:57.860
aggregate our purchases to
be able to have that weight,

03:14:57.860 --> 03:15:04.010
I think we would have
something to show for it.

03:15:04.010 --> 03:15:05.310
Yeah.

03:15:05.310 --> 03:15:06.610

Anne [assumed spelling] is right
behind you with the microphone then.

03:15:08.070 --> 03:15:15.880
&gt;&gt; At the risk of being a professor
which is a big risk in this crowd,

03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:20.290
I know many of the people
who've been advocating as I have

03:15:20.290 --> 03:15:24.170
for mother tongue literacy
materials, it's also the case

03:15:24.170 --> 03:15:28.930
that the research is
not there that suggest

03:15:28.930 --> 03:15:34.800
that just having mother tongue
books is-- are sufficient.

03:15:34.800 --> 03:15:40.670
We have huge problems with teacher
training around multiple languages.

03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:43.370
Most teachers are not
trained in mother tongue.

03:15:43.370 --> 03:15:44.710
They're trained in
a second language.

03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:47.980
They go out there and they don't
know how to teach in mother tongue.

03:15:47.980 --> 03:15:53.470 position:56%
There's also a huge issue that isn't
entirely visible for many people

03:15:53.470 --> 03:16:02.200
who are producing books that has to
do with the pedagogy that is needed

03:16:02.200 --> 03:16:05.630
to transfer from one
language to the next.

03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:10.850 position:56%
And if you have a-- Now I know that,

03:16:10.850 --> 03:16:14.690
I would say historically
speaking, the world has turned.

03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:19.500
We are finally focusing on mother
tongue materials and I'm not

03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:21.770
at all questioning
the utility in that.

03:16:21.770 --> 03:16:26.540
I'm saying that even with
open source materials,

03:16:26.540 --> 03:16:29.990
even as good as we are going to
get, we'll be having meetings here

03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:32.270
and hopefully prices here that
we'll look at the next step.

03:16:32.270 --> 03:16:34.820 position:56%
And the next step is actually harder

03:16:34.820 --> 03:16:38.180
than producing mother
tongue materials.

03:16:38.180 --> 03:16:42.680
It's how to implement a program
that can use one or more languages

03:16:42.680 --> 03:16:48.220
in classroom where the teachers are
usually not sufficiently trained

03:16:48.220 --> 03:16:52.190
and where-- and important
to say the politics

03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:57.010
of countries are not entirely
clear on these issues.

03:16:57.010 --> 03:17:02.220 position:56%
In the United States or in Rwanda
or in the other countries mentioned,

03:17:02.220 --> 03:17:03.520
there are many ministers.

03:17:03.520 --> 03:17:04.910
I know-- I see some nodding heads.

03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:07.480
I know that we have
nodding heads in this crowd.

03:17:07.480 --> 03:17:10.910
So in spite of what we
would like to see happen,

03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:13.480
the world is a more
complicated place.

03:17:13.480 --> 03:17:14.780
And I would just say that, well,

03:17:14.780 --> 03:17:19.360
let's keep our eyes open
beyond it maybe necessary

03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:21.320
to have mother tongue materials.

03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:24.110
I think it is but it's
probably not sufficient.

03:17:24.110 --> 03:17:25.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Yeah, sufficient.

03:17:25.410 --> 03:17:26.710
Necessarily but not sufficient.

03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:28.010
All right, great.

03:17:28.010 --> 03:17:29.310
Yes?

03:17:29.310 --> 03:17:30.660
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody.

03:17:30.660 --> 03:17:32.220
I'm Karina Polumn [assumed

03:17:32.220 --> 03:17:38.370 position:56%
So, as I listened to this discussion
and as Professor said, it's--

03:17:38.370 --> 03:17:41.760
the quality of the book is
going to critically important

03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:44.040
in making sure we have
authentic text.

03:17:44.040 --> 03:17:45.740
Because some books
are transferable--

03:17:45.740 --> 03:17:49.370 position:56%
I mean, when you translate them they
can work, but a lot of them do not.

03:17:49.370 --> 03:17:50.670
And I worked with my counterpart,

03:17:50.670 --> 03:17:53.960
that's in the international
marketplace and, you know,

03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:56.690
translating some books
is really inappropriate,

03:17:56.690 --> 03:17:58.920
so you have to be careful
of that happening.

03:17:58.920 --> 03:18:02.950
But it is going to be critical to
partner with local organizations

03:18:02.950 --> 03:18:06.560
and people who are producing
books and publisher to make sure

03:18:06.560 --> 03:18:09.030
that we are representing
authentic text

03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:11.170
that tells the authentic stories.

03:18:11.170 --> 03:18:13.140
And as, you know, the
professor mentioned,

03:18:13.140 --> 03:18:16.400
that's going to be critical to
that-- this idea of translation.

03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:18.580
Because it's easier for us to
translation but it's not as easy

03:18:18.580 --> 03:18:21.270
as we think and it doesn't
really represent itself

03:18:21.270 --> 03:18:26.260
in those native tongues in those
countries as well as it's ought to.

03:18:26.260 --> 03:18:28.480
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Thank you.

03:18:28.480 --> 03:18:30.250
Yes, Sara.

coming at you.

03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:36.260
[ Laughter ]

03:18:36.260 --> 03:18:37.560
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to follow on that

03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:39.260
because I think it's a
really important point.

03:18:39.260 --> 03:18:43.920
One of the things that we find
is really important to have books

03:18:43.920 --> 03:18:46.480
for very young children,
particularly when you're trying

03:18:46.480 --> 03:18:49.730
to get them interested in reading,
that have children in them who look

03:18:49.730 --> 03:18:52.900
like them and families
who live like them

03:18:52.900 --> 03:18:55.600
and neighborhoods that
look like theirs.

03:18:55.600 --> 03:19:00.450
And that's really important that
one of the things you might see

03:19:00.450 --> 03:19:03.080
when you look at our curriculum
for our families is we used a lot

03:19:03.080 --> 03:19:07.760
of books with animals, because
animals transfer in ways

03:19:07.760 --> 03:19:10.060
that maybe stories
about people don't.

03:19:10.060 --> 03:19:11.710
But-- And I also just want to--

03:19:11.710 --> 03:19:13.620
I'm not going to argue with
the professor in research.

03:19:13.620 --> 03:19:16.660
I'm a lawyer by training
and I know not to do that.

03:19:16.660 --> 03:19:18.800
But I do want to say that mother--

03:19:18.800 --> 03:19:23.440
there's another reason why mother
tongue materials are so important.

03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:26.120
And that's because that's
what enables parents

03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:27.610
to read to their children.

03:19:27.610 --> 03:19:31.440
And regardless of what may happen
when that child gets to school,

03:19:31.440 --> 03:19:35.780
is really important that parents
have material in the language

03:19:35.780 --> 03:19:39.990
that they know and that they speak
at home to read to their kids.

03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:44.450
And we do see that children who
have strong native language skills,

03:19:44.450 --> 03:19:47.410
when they get to school, if they
have a teacher who knows how

03:19:47.410 --> 03:19:50.410
to then teach them
the school language

03:19:50.410 --> 03:19:53.030
in their community will
be able to transition well

03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:54.330
to learning that school language.

03:19:54.330 --> 03:19:57.550
But they have to be able to speak
and read in their native tongue,

03:19:57.550 --> 03:20:00.590
to have a relationship
with their family.

03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:02.000
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Yeah, yeah.

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:03.300
Thank you.

03:20:03.300 --> 03:20:05.960
&gt;&gt; So, I have a question for folks
that are in a publishing area.

03:20:05.960 --> 03:20:07.920
And I agree about the
authentic text.

03:20:07.920 --> 03:20:12.760
So, I'm thinking about diaspora,
you know, about refuges et cetera.

03:20:12.760 --> 03:20:16.770
So, you know, especially with
earlier comment about that sense

03:20:16.770 --> 03:20:19.310
of culture and sense of belonging.

03:20:19.310 --> 03:20:22.820
So, intuitively, it seems like for
those kids that are in those kinds

03:20:22.820 --> 03:20:26.560
of situations as families
that they need materials

03:20:26.560 --> 03:20:29.010
about their home country.

03:20:29.010 --> 03:20:31.830
They need materials
about the culture

03:20:31.830 --> 03:20:33.520
that they're now situated in.

03:20:33.520 --> 03:20:38.640
And that they need stories about
other people like them who are

03:20:38.640 --> 03:20:43.650
in that same situation of making
those changes or accommodations

03:20:43.650 --> 03:20:46.220
or whatever in terms
of transitioning

03:20:46.220 --> 03:20:49.370
or accommodating different
culture simultaneously.

03:20:49.370 --> 03:20:52.490
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Is there--

03:20:52.490 --> 03:20:53.790
&gt;&gt; Thoughts.

03:20:53.790 --> 03:20:55.090
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: -- thoughts?

03:20:55.090 --> 03:20:58.000
All right, just dialogue.

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:01.160
So, one of the things--

03:21:01.160 --> 03:21:03.490
another common theme I
heard today was this issue

03:21:03.490 --> 03:21:07.100
about where does literacy live,
where does the policy issue live.

03:21:07.100 --> 03:21:11.120
That's come up a couple of
times throughout the day today,

03:21:11.120 --> 03:21:14.180
and this notion of is it by itself,

03:21:14.180 --> 03:21:16.050
where is it in the
world of education?

03:21:16.050 --> 03:21:20.510
And I hear a lot of threading
throughout in different ways.

03:21:20.510 --> 03:21:28.010
I'm not at all going to start
the fight to say it belongs here.

03:21:28.010 --> 03:21:29.310
Maybe not.

03:21:29.310 --> 03:21:30.610
[ Laughter ]

03:21:30.610 --> 03:21:31.910
But, you know, but I heard--

03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:33.210
I've heard this before,
like who owns literacy?

03:21:33.210 --> 03:21:34.560
Is it really Department
of Education?

03:21:34.560 --> 03:21:36.550
You know, should folks
stay away from it?

03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:37.850
Does it belong by itself?

03:21:37.850 --> 03:21:39.150
If it does, where?

03:21:39.150 --> 03:21:42.260
It's a complement to
the education system.

03:21:42.260 --> 03:21:44.880
The focus on it as a
complement to that system

03:21:44.880 --> 03:21:46.300
versus integrated within.

03:21:46.300 --> 03:21:51.290
I'm just curious to see if there's
more dialogue about that topic.

03:21:51.290 --> 03:21:54.510
Yes? That's so funny
there're some eager hands.

03:21:54.510 --> 03:21:57.550

&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: Am I on?

03:22:00.150 --> 03:22:04.160
Yes. So, I just want to say this
is the first time and coming

03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:05.460
to these are always wonderful.

03:22:05.460 --> 03:22:08.720
And I'm really happy that we're
talking a lot more about policy.

03:22:08.720 --> 03:22:11.030
At this one that I
think ever before,

03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:12.850
which I think is really important.

03:22:12.850 --> 03:22:15.220
So, I'm Jeff Carter with the
National Coalition for Literacy.

03:22:15.220 --> 03:22:18.890
I've worked in adult literacy
for a long time in policy.

03:22:18.890 --> 03:22:22.110
I think the question--
to me the question

03:22:22.110 --> 03:22:25.200
about where it lives
is not irrelevant.

03:22:25.200 --> 03:22:28.040
But I think, again, it
comes down to priority.

03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:32.230
If we made it a priority in this
country, that question would,

03:22:32.230 --> 03:22:34.640
I think, simply sort
of resolve itself.

03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:37.880
So, simply thinking-- I think it's
a mistake to think that, well,

03:22:37.880 --> 03:22:40.970
if we're just situated here, it
will get the attention it needs

03:22:40.970 --> 03:22:42.620
and it will take care of it.

03:22:42.620 --> 03:22:44.670
I think it's actually a
more fundamental issue

03:22:44.670 --> 03:22:47.130
around advocacy and awareness.

03:22:47.130 --> 03:22:51.420
And I having had this experience
of doing a ton of advocacy here

03:22:51.420 --> 03:22:54.200
on the hill around adult
literacy, I can tell you all

03:22:54.200 --> 03:22:57.720 position:56%
that there are too many
representatives up there on the hill

03:22:57.720 --> 03:23:00.150
who knew nothing about the
work that you all are doing.

03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:03.380
Nothing. And that's one
of our big problems.

03:23:03.380 --> 03:23:09.120 position:56%
Because I think policymakers want to
have to be able invest in success.

03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:11.660
And it's one thing to put out
a problem but it's another

03:23:11.660 --> 03:23:15.650 position:56%
to actually be able to hold up
success stories that are investable.

03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:17.220
And I'm also glad we
had the question

03:23:17.220 --> 03:23:19.450 position:56%
about replicability and about scale.

03:23:19.450 --> 03:23:21.850
Those are really important
discussions to have as well.

03:23:21.850 --> 03:23:25.000
So, I think it was Allister or
someone else made the point,

03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:28.450
I do think it's important to
point out in terms of policy

03:23:28.450 --> 03:23:32.320
that it is critical to many other
concerns that we have with--

03:23:32.320 --> 03:23:35.430
particularly in terms
of addressing poverty.

03:23:35.430 --> 03:23:38.900
So, in the discussion, I
think we need to situate it

03:23:38.900 --> 03:23:42.810
in different places but in terms
of who owns it or who runs it,

03:23:42.810 --> 03:23:47.170
that's probably down the list
of things that I worry about.

03:23:47.170 --> 03:23:48.470

&gt;&gt; I'm switching hats now.

03:23:55.570 --> 03:24:01.800
But I think that in terms of
policy in talking about Congress--

03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:03.380
and I know this is the
Library of Congress.

03:24:03.380 --> 03:24:06.990
But governors know these issues.

03:24:06.990 --> 03:24:10.110
And I think if we're talking
about policy that we might think

03:24:10.110 --> 03:24:13.040 position:56%
about going to the governors of
this country because they understand

03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:15.780
if it's an economic development
issue and they understand

03:24:15.780 --> 03:24:18.210
that their workforces and
their individual states depend

03:24:18.210 --> 03:24:21.370
on early childhood and
those three, and four,

03:24:21.370 --> 03:24:23.840
five years before children
get in to school.

03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:27.400
So, if we're looking at a place
where people, I think we have a,

03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:30.590
maybe a welcome audience and
people who are little bit educated

03:24:30.590 --> 03:24:34.470
about that that it might
be through those people

03:24:34.470 --> 03:24:35.900
at the heads of their states.

03:24:35.900 --> 03:24:37.510
And those are policymakers.

03:24:37.510 --> 03:24:42.620
And when we went after early
childhood and quality daycare

03:24:42.620 --> 03:24:47.120
and really engage the business
community and brought them together

03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:52.820
to put pressure on the
legislator along with the governor.

03:24:52.820 --> 03:24:56.520
So, it was both ends plus their
grassroots community going

03:24:56.520 --> 03:24:59.790
out to every small community in the
state in making the case to parents

03:24:59.790 --> 03:25:01.610 position:56%
that this was in their best interest

03:25:01.610 --> 03:25:03.240
and the best interests
of their kids.

03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:04.540
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: OK.

03:25:04.540 --> 03:25:06.880
And just quick-- the pressure was
on what, funding certain kinds

03:25:06.880 --> 03:25:09.090
of reading promotion
programs funding--

03:25:09.090 --> 03:25:12.290
&gt;&gt; The result for preschool
for four-year-olds and quality

03:25:12.290 --> 03:25:16.330
of daycare systems so the
parents can identify what kind

03:25:16.330 --> 03:25:19.680 position:56%
of daycare they want for their kids.

03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:20.980
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: OK.

03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:22.280
Thank you.

03:25:22.280 --> 03:25:23.580
Yeah.

03:25:23.580 --> 03:25:24.880
&gt;&gt; I think along the
lines of policy,

03:25:24.880 --> 03:25:27.740
it might be quite interesting
to keep an eye on the law

03:25:27.740 --> 03:25:30.770
that was just passed in
the State of Michigan.

03:25:30.770 --> 03:25:35.460
Michigan passed a law, a bit ago,
that if a child couldn't read

03:25:35.460 --> 03:25:40.960
at third grade at-- reading-- grade
level by the end of third grade,

03:25:40.960 --> 03:25:43.470
they could not go in school.

03:25:43.470 --> 03:25:48.590
There was undue commotion,
there's still great commotion.

03:25:48.590 --> 03:25:53.870
Some people are saying absolutely
that must be what happens,

03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:56.710
other people-- even though the
law passed, there's, of course,

03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:59.240
no resources behind this.

03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:01.760
Now, we have all the
people with the-- who are--

03:26:01.760 --> 03:26:05.330
who is being tested all
the emotional difficulties.

03:26:05.330 --> 03:26:08.720
So, I think it's just
going to be so much fun

03:26:08.720 --> 03:26:10.510
to watch how that plays out.

03:26:10.510 --> 03:26:11.810
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Fun, really?

03:26:11.810 --> 03:26:15.110
&gt;&gt; Because it also will give
us some insight into what kind

03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:21.370
of policies can be passed and where
in the policy arena it can help

03:26:21.370 --> 03:26:26.420
or where in the policy arena it
may hinder the growth of literacy.

03:26:26.420 --> 03:26:32.380
It clearly denotes that the folks
know about a problem but we'll have

03:26:32.380 --> 03:26:38.180
to see if policy at that level
improves the situation or does not.

03:26:38.180 --> 03:26:41.220
So it's a place to keep an eye on.

03:26:41.220 --> 03:26:43.390
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Well, I'm really
struggling with this because I am--

03:26:43.390 --> 03:26:47.250
most of you, you all know, I'm new
to this particular job so I'm new

03:26:47.250 --> 03:26:48.850
to this particular conversation.

03:26:48.850 --> 03:26:50.320
I'm an economist by training

03:26:50.320 --> 03:26:53.530
and I don't get how come it's
not a no-brainer the quality

03:26:53.530 --> 03:26:56.080
of our labor force in
10 years, in 20 years.

03:26:56.080 --> 03:27:00.410
I don't get how that's just not
completely and totally obvious

03:27:00.410 --> 03:27:01.710
that if you don't put money here,

03:27:01.710 --> 03:27:04.970
you're going to be pouring
out money over here.

03:27:04.970 --> 03:27:06.270
I don't get it.

03:27:06.270 --> 03:27:07.680
Help me.

03:27:07.680 --> 03:27:09.790
[ Laughter ]

03:27:09.790 --> 03:27:11.090
&gt;&gt; Liza McFadden: This
is Liza McFadden

03:27:11.090 --> 03:27:12.560
with the Barbara Bush Foundation.

03:27:12.560 --> 03:27:15.900
And I think you were
spot on and I think a lot

03:27:15.900 --> 03:27:18.810
of what the movement I'm
seeing right now and goes back

03:27:18.810 --> 03:27:22.630
to something you said, is
how we monetize the value

03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:24.120
of literacy in the future.

03:27:24.120 --> 03:27:27.520
We're starting to see there's
been two really successful

03:27:27.520 --> 03:27:31.220
pay-for-success models in the early
literacy area in Utah, in Chicago.

03:27:31.220 --> 03:27:36.290
And now there's a work by
Walmart looking at, you know,

03:27:36.290 --> 03:27:39.650
there were two articles in New
York Times recently, about the fact

03:27:39.650 --> 03:27:42.030
that they've upgraded the
training of their workforce

03:27:42.030 --> 03:27:43.330
and they're seeing results.

03:27:43.330 --> 03:27:47.630
And as we see that, and that
impacts things, like for example,

03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:50.980
if you increased the literacy level
and then you have fewer accidents

03:27:50.980 --> 03:27:53.160
in the workplace and
your insurance goes down,

03:27:53.160 --> 03:27:57.780 position:56%
you may start monetizing it
internally, and saying, OK, literacy

03:27:57.780 --> 03:27:59.130
and training really matters.

03:27:59.130 --> 03:28:03.620
So, I think it's-- and
really incumbent on all of us

03:28:03.620 --> 03:28:07.630
to follow how this can play out and
how it can benefit the workplace.

03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:10.880
And I think then we're going
to really see some movement,

03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:14.100
both on the early childhood
and the adult education ends.

03:28:14.100 --> 03:28:15.400
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: OK.

03:28:15.400 --> 03:28:19.180
&gt;&gt; I just want to add that
I think the Pre-K movement

03:28:19.180 --> 03:28:22.980
in the US is a really
good example for us.

03:28:22.980 --> 03:28:26.740
I just don't think it's gone far
enough or have been funded enough.

03:28:26.740 --> 03:28:31.230 position:56%
But as the part of education that
has made huge slips forward in terms

03:28:31.230 --> 03:28:33.170
of the amount of public
money now being invested

03:28:33.170 --> 03:28:35.170
and it's probably the best example.

03:28:35.170 --> 03:28:40.320
And they did a really good job
of rallying unexpected voices

03:28:40.320 --> 03:28:44.220
to advocate for Pre-K,
particularly at the state level.

03:28:44.220 --> 03:28:48.420
And those would be generals
and admirals and police chiefs

03:28:48.420 --> 03:28:53.920
and sheriffs, who started to talk
both about their workforce but also

03:28:53.920 --> 03:28:57.400
about the fact that
literacy reduces crime rates.

03:28:57.400 --> 03:28:59.520
If you look at our
present population today,

03:28:59.520 --> 03:29:03.430
it is heavily people with
very low literacy levels.

03:29:03.430 --> 03:29:07.560
So, when those are the folks who
walk into a public official's room

03:29:07.560 --> 03:29:12.330
as opposed to me or, you know, that
the kindergarten teacher's saying

03:29:12.330 --> 03:29:15.240
"But I need children to come
to school ready to learn read,

03:29:15.240 --> 03:29:17.350
if I'm going to be able
to teach them free."

03:29:17.350 --> 03:29:20.690
If when you have a general
or an admiral or sheriff go

03:29:20.690 --> 03:29:24.850
into their representative's
office or their governor's office,

03:29:24.850 --> 03:29:26.420 position:56%
it's heard in a whole different way.

03:29:26.420 --> 03:29:29.200
And I think the literacy
movement, we probably need to take

03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:31.590
that Pre-K lesson and broaden it

03:29:31.590 --> 03:29:35.590
out to make sure it's a much bigger
advocacy piece that we're doing.

03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:37.980
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: I'll
take the microphone here.

03:29:37.980 --> 03:29:39.280
Thank you.

03:29:39.280 --> 03:29:42.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; To get back to your question why,
because it's makes perfect sense.

03:29:42.920 --> 03:29:45.070
And we've seen it makes
sense over and over again.

03:29:45.070 --> 03:29:47.560
I'm much older than everybody
else in the room and I've been

03:29:47.560 --> 03:29:50.160
through these different
iterations of literacy.

03:29:50.160 --> 03:29:52.260
One of the issues has always been--

03:29:52.260 --> 03:29:54.820
and Karen just articulated
over here.

03:29:54.820 --> 03:29:59.640
There's been ideologically, if
you will, thing that's going

03:29:59.640 --> 03:30:04.510
on where whenever we've been very
successful with literacy programs

03:30:04.510 --> 03:30:07.540
and made sure the various context

03:30:07.540 --> 03:30:10.360
that we taught the
literacy skills needed

03:30:10.360 --> 03:30:13.710
to not just get the
GED but also get a job.

03:30:13.710 --> 03:30:18.190
You have people who say "Oh,
no, we can't monetize literacy."

03:30:18.190 --> 03:30:19.630
Literacy is a right.

03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:21.670
Literacy is a human right.

03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:25.480
If you just turn everybody
into a cog in the wheel,

03:30:25.480 --> 03:30:27.940
and they're just there
for the economic reason,

03:30:27.940 --> 03:30:33.820
you are violating some-- And
that conversation has obfuscated

03:30:33.820 --> 03:30:38.200
to some extent to the point that
you made, of course it's obvious.

03:30:38.200 --> 03:30:43.140
And there's a way of doing
both, of not negating the right

03:30:43.140 --> 03:30:48.420 position:56%
of human beings to learn to read, at
the same time loudly acknowledging

03:30:48.420 --> 03:30:51.220
and constructing programs,
working with the workforce.

03:30:51.220 --> 03:30:54.780
Because we did a lot of that stuff
in New York back in the '70s,

03:30:54.780 --> 03:30:59.490
to get GEDs, get associate degrees,
and be trained to work Con Ed

03:30:59.490 --> 03:31:01.500
and at the phone company
every place else.

03:31:01.500 --> 03:31:02.800
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Right.

03:31:02.800 --> 03:31:06.050
&gt;&gt; The other very big
area is health care.

03:31:06.050 --> 03:31:09.950
There's-- We really need more
partnerships within the Health

03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:14.470
and Human Services area because
there's an awful lot that parents

03:31:14.470 --> 03:31:20.130
with kids missed-- and in
their own care as well.

03:31:20.130 --> 03:31:24.470
We've story back from the '70s, we
had a meeting up at Colombia once,

03:31:24.470 --> 03:31:26.760
and there was a woman who kept--

03:31:26.760 --> 03:31:29.230
we heard a story from a doctor
that a woman kept showing

03:31:29.230 --> 03:31:32.180
up in the emergency room
with diabetic attacks.

03:31:32.180 --> 03:31:34.810
Over and over and over again,
they-- she come in, they treat her,

03:31:34.810 --> 03:31:38.060
they've show her how to
and she end up there.

03:31:38.060 --> 03:31:41.170
Finally, someone say, "We don't
understand, we've shown you."

03:31:41.170 --> 03:31:43.620
And she said, "I do
exactly what you say.

03:31:43.620 --> 03:31:48.760
I take an orange, and then I
shoot my insulin into the orange

03:31:48.760 --> 03:31:51.010
and then I eat the orange."

03:31:51.010 --> 03:31:52.330
[ Laughter ]

03:31:52.330 --> 03:31:54.500
She couldn't read so she
couldn't read the instructions.

03:31:54.500 --> 03:31:59.360
So the demonstration they were
using was what she thought--

03:31:59.360 --> 03:32:01.190
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously] -- was
what she supposed to do.

03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:02.490
&gt;&gt; That's not apocryphal.

03:32:02.490 --> 03:32:03.790
That was a true story.

03:32:03.790 --> 03:32:06.650
So, we have to.

03:32:06.650 --> 03:32:10.200
And lawmakers will hear it,
business people will hear it,

03:32:10.200 --> 03:32:13.070
and I think we can do it in a way
that does not offend the people

03:32:13.070 --> 03:32:15.250
that believe people should read
for joy and for the pleasure

03:32:15.250 --> 03:32:19.320
for the Bible and everything else.

03:32:19.320 --> 03:32:20.620
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: OK, yeah.

03:32:20.620 --> 03:32:23.930
&gt;&gt; We haven't succeeded
in doing that yet.

03:32:23.930 --> 03:32:26.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Any international
commentary on this issue,

03:32:26.120 --> 03:32:30.530
the whole literacy
investment and-- Yes?

03:32:30.530 --> 03:32:34.830
&gt;&gt; Yes. But not as
straightforward as-- Am I on?

03:32:34.830 --> 03:32:36.130
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Yeah.

03:32:36.130 --> 03:32:37.430
He just says to turn
you-- You're good.

03:32:37.430 --> 03:32:41.130
&gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you.

03:32:41.130 --> 03:32:45.130
What we want is problem
solvers and critical thinkers.

03:32:45.130 --> 03:32:47.350
So, how do we get there?

03:32:47.350 --> 03:32:49.660
We need policy for that.

03:32:49.660 --> 03:32:52.870 position:56%
We need people who implement policy.

03:32:52.870 --> 03:32:54.490
We need a joined-up approach.

03:32:54.490 --> 03:32:57.770
And at New Zealand we've
had some strong initiatives

03:32:57.770 --> 03:32:59.940
of being government-based.

03:32:59.940 --> 03:33:04.200
Nothing is straightforward
and nothing is easy,

03:33:04.200 --> 03:33:08.520
but there is a strong direction.

03:33:08.520 --> 03:33:13.220
What we know in the workplace
is that if you are able

03:33:13.220 --> 03:33:20.880
to align language with the CEOs, if
you are able to talk about measures

03:33:20.880 --> 03:33:24.340
with the CEOs, if you're
able to put simple measures

03:33:24.340 --> 03:33:30.340
into business aligned-driven
programs, then it's very easy

03:33:30.340 --> 03:33:32.320 position:56%
to say the difference that you make.

03:33:32.320 --> 03:33:38.540
So, I spoke very briefly about
the whole organization approach

03:33:38.540 --> 03:33:41.930
to literacy and numeracy
in New Zealand,

03:33:41.930 --> 03:33:44.550
it's the same thing
in terms of a country.

03:33:44.550 --> 03:33:47.700
And New Zealand's a great
country as an example to look

03:33:47.700 --> 03:33:50.000
at because we only have
four million people.

03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:52.620
And we have a lot of experiments
that comes to New Zealand

03:33:52.620 --> 03:33:56.020
because it's a very cohesive
little place to come to.

03:33:56.020 --> 03:33:58.870
I think New Zealand
is very interesting

03:33:58.870 --> 03:34:02.150
on how we've taken the
literacy and numeracy approach

03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:07.230
and how we are looking now,
some-- Since 2001, Diana,

03:34:07.230 --> 03:34:12.360
when we first had policy that how--

03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:13.660
we're not at the next stage

03:34:13.660 --> 03:34:18.180
of joining the government
agencies together,

03:34:18.180 --> 03:34:23.650 position:56%
to really bring the next level of
implementation, and that we need all

03:34:23.650 --> 03:34:26.090
of these initiatives that
people are talking about.

03:34:26.090 --> 03:34:28.330
We need a good practice models.

03:34:28.330 --> 03:34:30.890
We need the advocate efficacy.

03:34:30.890 --> 03:34:35.850
We need the policy, we need the
practices, we need the systems,

03:34:35.850 --> 03:34:38.350
all for sustainability
because we don't want

03:34:38.350 --> 03:34:39.790
to keep doing this all the time.

03:34:39.790 --> 03:34:42.320
No country anymore has
got the money to do that.

03:34:42.320 --> 03:34:46.290
So, we need to be looking at
systemic and sustainable approaches

03:34:46.290 --> 03:34:49.220
for literacy and numeracy.

03:34:49.220 --> 03:34:50.980
Thank you.

03:34:50.980 --> 03:34:52.280
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Yeah, yeah.

03:34:52.280 --> 03:34:53.580
Down in front.

03:34:53.580 --> 03:34:54.880
Thank you.

03:34:54.880 --> 03:34:56.180 position:56%
Do you have-- Angie, was there-- OK.

03:34:56.180 --> 03:34:57.480
&gt;&gt; Louise Bridges:
Thank you so much.

03:34:57.480 --> 03:34:58.780
My name is Louise Bridges.

03:34:58.780 --> 03:35:01.050
I'm on the literacy advisory board.

03:35:01.050 --> 03:35:04.250
And to the question we
need to monetize literacy,

03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:10.980
literacy is monetized in ways that
are dangerous and are just adding

03:35:10.980 --> 03:35:14.090
to the inequity in our country.

03:35:14.090 --> 03:35:17.930
Many of you probably are familiar
with the work of Mariah Evans

03:35:17.930 --> 03:35:21.860
at the University of
Nevada, who shows that books

03:35:21.860 --> 03:35:26.940 position:56%
in the home is the number one factor
in whether children succeed or not.

03:35:26.940 --> 03:35:31.700
As few as 20 books in the home
can make a huge difference

03:35:31.700 --> 03:35:33.000
in a child's life.

03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:35.040
And we know that in our country,

03:35:35.040 --> 03:35:40.020
we have what is now commonly
referred to as book deserts.

03:35:40.020 --> 03:35:44.050
If you follow the work of Dr. Susan
Newman, she had a tremendous piece

03:35:44.050 --> 03:35:46.680
in the Atlantic Monthly recently.

03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:51.360
She looked at two different
communities in Philadelphia.

03:35:51.360 --> 03:35:59.380
One high poverty; the other middle
class, in 2001 and found that 60%

03:35:59.380 --> 03:36:05.910 position:56%
of all children living in high
poverty communities have less than--

03:36:05.910 --> 03:36:08.330
or have no books in the home.

03:36:08.330 --> 03:36:10.370
She went back to that same--

03:36:10.370 --> 03:36:15.800
those same two communities just
two years ago and it's worse.

03:36:15.800 --> 03:36:24.060
It-- The problem is growing in
very frightening and scary ways.

03:36:24.060 --> 03:36:30.060
So, part of this begins with
giving people a living wage

03:36:30.060 --> 03:36:32.790
so that they can buy
books for their children

03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:36.040
and have books in their homes.

03:36:36.040 --> 03:36:37.340
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Got it.

03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:41.450
And then, Timothy, you had a--
behind you with the microphone.

03:36:42.890 --> 03:36:48.250
&gt;&gt; Timothy Ireland: And I'm being
on both sides of the divide.

03:36:48.250 --> 03:36:51.050
I was-- I worked with this project,

03:36:51.050 --> 03:36:55.670
which was awarded here the
[inaudible] school for 25 years.

03:36:55.670 --> 03:37:00.650
But I worked from 1990 to
2004 coordinating the project.

03:37:00.650 --> 03:37:06.300 position:56%
And then I was invited to take a
post-ministry of education in Brazil

03:37:06.300 --> 03:37:07.600
where I was responsible

03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:13.220
for a national program called
Literate Brazil Programme.

03:37:13.220 --> 03:37:18.660
In the Literate Brazil Programme,
we were responsible for something

03:37:18.660 --> 03:37:24.720
like an average over 12 years of
1,200,000 people being attended,

03:37:24.720 --> 03:37:27.150
I wouldn't say made
literate each year.

03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:37.100
But I think the struggle is talking
specifically about adult literacy.

03:37:37.100 --> 03:37:42.230
This is a complete mental
block in terms of investment,

03:37:42.230 --> 03:37:49.650 position:56%
and people who always think at
least in countries which I know best

03:37:49.650 --> 03:37:53.150
that adult literacy can
be done on the cheap.

03:37:53.150 --> 03:37:57.430
And I-- I mean, within
the same ministry,

03:37:57.430 --> 03:38:03.680 position:56%
we were investing something like
200, $300 a head for adult literacy,

03:38:03.680 --> 03:38:10.700
whereas a child in primary
school is worth 2,500 or 2,600.

03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:15.440
You know, what mindset is
it that permits you to think

03:38:15.440 --> 03:38:18.520
that adult literacy is
worth so little compared

03:38:18.520 --> 03:38:21.230
with a child's education?

03:38:21.230 --> 03:38:26.030
When you know that if the
parent isn't literate, you know,

03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:28.940
the child's education is
going to suffer even more.

03:38:28.940 --> 03:38:35.250
So this difficulty of persuading
even progressive governments

03:38:35.250 --> 03:38:39.930
to invest in real terms in
adult education is enormous.

03:38:39.930 --> 03:38:44.530
And the other thing when you talk
about responsibility from literacy,

03:38:44.530 --> 03:38:47.800
in our case obviously the
adult literacy program,

03:38:47.800 --> 03:38:50.180 position:56%
belong to the ministry of education.

03:38:50.180 --> 03:38:55.200
One of the difficulties
is depending obviously

03:38:55.200 --> 03:38:57.630
on how you define literacy.

03:38:57.630 --> 03:39:00.830
In the case of this
particular program,

03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:04.420
the literacy program
was eight months,

03:39:04.420 --> 03:39:09.080
and you don't make anybody
literate in eight months.

03:39:09.080 --> 03:39:12.130
But how do you guarantee
that the people who take part

03:39:12.130 --> 03:39:18.090 position:56%
in literacy programs, which is at
least a step into the written world,

03:39:18.090 --> 03:39:21.950
how would you guarantee that that
person continues his studies?

03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:25.610
And quite often, literacy programs

03:39:25.610 --> 03:39:29.220
and adult education
programs are separate.

03:39:29.220 --> 03:39:33.030
In our case, for instance, we had
separate funding to literate--

03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:36.550
literacy program from the
adult education program.

03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:41.930 position:56%
So literacy programs, the classrooms
weren't physically in schools.

03:39:41.930 --> 03:39:44.890
They weren't in community
associations,

03:39:44.890 --> 03:39:48.900
or in other space is church-based
[inaudible] base or whatever,

03:39:48.900 --> 03:39:52.890
whereas obviously adult
education took part in schools,

03:39:52.890 --> 03:39:55.150
how do you bridge that divide.

03:39:55.150 --> 03:39:59.720
So I think in terms of--
I don't know whether--

03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:05.230
there are two different discourses
and two different problems in terms

03:40:05.230 --> 03:40:09.070
of the developed countries and
the less developed countries.

03:40:09.070 --> 03:40:12.560
But I still think that,
you know, persuading people

03:40:12.560 --> 03:40:20.390
that adult literacy is fundamental
for all the reasons we know,

03:40:20.390 --> 03:40:24.820
we prefer to talk about--
you know, I was interested

03:40:24.820 --> 03:40:28.210
that nobody has mentioned Paul
Freddie [assumed spelling]

03:40:28.210 --> 03:40:29.510
here today.

03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:31.410
And I think that must
be an exception.

03:40:31.410 --> 03:40:35.340
Obviously, there are other
people who have done a lot

03:40:35.340 --> 03:40:37.610
for an adult literacy
besides Paul Freddie.

03:40:37.610 --> 03:40:42.180
But Paul Freddie obviously has
been an important influence

03:40:42.180 --> 03:40:44.380
on a lot of people.

03:40:44.380 --> 03:40:51.130
But how to persuade, you know,
people to invest in adult education

03:40:51.130 --> 03:40:54.770
for its economic importance, for
its importance of human rights,

03:40:54.770 --> 03:41:00.430
for its importance, it's just
an essential right of everybody

03:41:00.430 --> 03:41:06.610
to learn how to read and write and
to be more of a person as a result.

03:41:06.610 --> 03:41:08.060
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Thank you.

03:41:08.060 --> 03:41:09.860
Thank you.

03:41:09.860 --> 03:41:13.310
[ Applause ]

03:41:13.310 --> 03:41:15.630
So, we are close to wrapping
up this portion but I want

03:41:15.630 --> 03:41:16.930
to make sure I gave chance.

03:41:16.930 --> 03:41:19.710
Any final questions or follow-up?

03:41:19.710 --> 03:41:22.340
I know that, you know, certainly
Timothy is speaking as one

03:41:22.340 --> 03:41:26.070 position:56%
of the best practice honorees in the
realm of literacy in a workplace.

03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:28.970
And so, we certainly hear
an opportunity for adults

03:41:28.970 --> 03:41:31.780
to be learning to read
where they are,

03:41:31.780 --> 03:41:34.220
which is not necessary in school.

03:41:34.220 --> 03:41:40.760
We just make sure-- There were
two other things that came

03:41:40.760 --> 03:41:44.440 position:56%
up that haven't gotten a lot of
attention and we can either put them

03:41:44.440 --> 03:41:48.090
in a parking lot or see if you
want-- they excite you right now.

03:41:48.090 --> 03:41:50.890
Numeracy and literacy.

03:41:50.890 --> 03:41:55.130
And I noticed there's some
attention on numeracy.

03:41:55.130 --> 03:41:57.370
Some folks have their
attention on it, mentioned it.

03:41:57.370 --> 03:42:02.190
Some of it's on the background;
some of it's in the foreground.

03:42:02.190 --> 03:42:05.800
Any comments there,
for future discussion?

03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:10.650
And then the problem of illiteracy.

03:42:10.650 --> 03:42:14.920
Diana, behind you with--

03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:17.300
&gt;&gt; Diana Coben: Hi.

03:42:17.300 --> 03:42:19.390
I would like to speak
up for numeracy.

03:42:19.390 --> 03:42:23.410
Because I think for too long it's
been the poor relation of literacy

03:42:23.410 --> 03:42:26.700
and subsumed within
it on my own, OK?

03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:30.270
Yeah. And so I think
it's very important

03:42:30.270 --> 03:42:35.520
that it's given due respect
and not subsumed within--

03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:37.890
you know, deemed to be
covered by literacy,

03:42:37.890 --> 03:42:39.950
both things are really important.

03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:42.830
And just as an example, I was
very struck by a colleague

03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:46.220
over there talking
about the Michigan law.

03:42:46.220 --> 03:42:49.900
There was the amazing piece of work
done in the 1960s by the children

03:42:49.900 --> 03:42:52.540
of the school of [inaudible]
in Italy,

03:42:52.540 --> 03:42:55.870
which proves conclusively just
how damaging that approach is

03:42:55.870 --> 03:42:59.450
of holding children
back year on year.

03:42:59.450 --> 03:43:01.550
It was statistical work
done by the children

03:43:01.550 --> 03:43:03.930
with their teachers are
absolutely outstanding.

03:43:03.930 --> 03:43:06.300
A copy should go to
lawmakers of Michigan.

03:43:06.300 --> 03:43:08.580
[ Laughter ]

03:43:08.580 --> 03:43:09.880
And that's an example.

03:43:09.880 --> 03:43:17.100
That's an example of numeracy
as a key element of education

03:43:17.100 --> 03:43:22.190
and of being a critical and
fully functioning adult able

03:43:22.190 --> 03:43:25.740
to command respect in their
society and command a living wage

03:43:25.740 --> 03:43:28.390
and command a decent life.

03:43:28.390 --> 03:43:29.970
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Thank you.

03:43:29.970 --> 03:43:31.460
OK, a couple more comments.

03:43:31.460 --> 03:43:32.810
And, again, just so you
know for our schedule.

03:43:32.810 --> 03:43:35.090
What we have planned is
that a wrap-up no later

03:43:35.090 --> 03:43:36.510
than 3:00 and then break.

03:43:36.510 --> 03:43:39.460
For those of you who want to
do-- those that led tours,

03:43:39.460 --> 03:43:41.660
they're going to start at
3:15, for those of you who want

03:43:41.660 --> 03:43:43.380
to continue the dialogue here

03:43:43.380 --> 03:43:47.730 position:56%
or in the tabletop presentation room
back there, you're welcome to do so.

03:43:47.730 --> 03:43:50.130
And then the reception
is at 4:00 downstairs.

03:43:50.130 --> 03:43:52.870
Just so you know what's going on
for the rest of the afternoon.

03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:54.170
Go ahead.

03:43:54.170 --> 03:43:57.630
&gt;&gt; OK. Is it all right?

03:43:57.630 --> 03:44:02.840
OK, OK. So, a couple of us have
noticed that there's been more

03:44:02.840 --> 03:44:08.360
of the ICT and numeracy discussed
outside of the United States.

03:44:08.360 --> 03:44:13.170 position:56%
And in United States, I think, we
sometimes kind of separate those two

03:44:13.170 --> 03:44:16.440
in a more-- you know,
the Venn diagrams are--

03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:19.570
you know, don't overlap as much.

03:44:19.570 --> 03:44:21.640
And I think also-- And
I'd be really curious

03:44:21.640 --> 03:44:23.950
if in other countries
there's the same kind

03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:27.130
of dismissal about numeracy.

03:44:27.130 --> 03:44:30.580 position:56%
In fact we don't even tend to use
the term numeracy as much in the US.

03:44:30.580 --> 03:44:33.150
It's more like math
literacy, you know,

03:44:33.150 --> 03:44:34.920
where folks will say, "Oh, math.

03:44:34.920 --> 03:44:36.660
Well, you'll never need that.

03:44:36.660 --> 03:44:38.620
And, you know, I never
was good at math."

03:44:38.620 --> 03:44:41.400
You know, how many people would
self-disclose "Oh, you know,

03:44:41.400 --> 03:44:42.700
reading, who needs reading?"

03:44:42.700 --> 03:44:48.620 position:56%
I mean, yeah, so I mean I think math
illiteracy is even more of a hidden,

03:44:48.620 --> 03:44:52.350
you know, problem than
even, you know,

03:44:52.350 --> 03:44:54.670
the reading and writing literacy.

03:44:54.670 --> 03:44:57.280
But what I am noticing is,
you know, we talk so much

03:44:57.280 --> 03:45:00.260
about data-driven decision
making and importance of that,

03:45:00.260 --> 03:45:04.390
that I know that librarians
are now talking more explicitly

03:45:04.390 --> 03:45:09.950
about data literacy, and that
might be a way a hook at being able

03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:12.660
to then refrain numeracy.

03:45:12.660 --> 03:45:15.960
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: And then Paul.

03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:21.510
Paul is ready, but after you Diana.

03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:31.150
[ Inaudible Remark ]

03:45:31.150 --> 03:45:33.010
Does she--

03:45:33.010 --> 03:45:34.310
[ Inaudible Remark ]

03:45:34.310 --> 03:45:36.110
OK, yeah.

03:45:36.110 --> 03:45:59.150
[ Inaudible Remark ]

03:45:59.150 --> 03:46:03.180
Yeah, so let's switch--

03:46:03.180 --> 03:46:05.270
Diana, switch with Anya
[assumed spelling] there, please.

03:46:05.270 --> 03:46:06.570
Thank you.

03:46:06.570 --> 03:46:07.870
&gt;&gt; OK. Did you hear that?

03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:09.400
I was just saying that the
survey of adult skills,

03:46:09.400 --> 03:46:13.070
which is on at the
moment OECD program

03:46:13.070 --> 03:46:16.530
of the international
assessment develop competencies,

03:46:16.530 --> 03:46:19.940
not only include numeracy but it's
a key in [inaudible] area together

03:46:19.940 --> 03:46:23.680
with literacy and problem solving
and technology-rich environments.

03:46:23.680 --> 03:46:26.860
That international survey
and the previous ones,

03:46:26.860 --> 03:46:29.440
the adult literacy [inaudible]
school survey and the one before

03:46:29.440 --> 03:46:33.050
that have been enormously
influential insofar

03:46:33.050 --> 03:46:35.750
as there's a heck of a lot of
more work to be done, of course.

03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:41.120
But in persuading governments and
business and other organization

03:46:41.120 --> 03:46:47.180
of the importance of these skills
for adult life, and I would love

03:46:47.180 --> 03:46:51.170
to see some better sort
of speech going on also,

03:46:51.170 --> 03:46:55.570
the coordination going on between
UNESCO and OECD and these big sort

03:46:55.570 --> 03:47:00.450
of super-national organizations
to get literacy, numeracy.

03:47:00.450 --> 03:47:05.060
And so the whole digital piece
which is part of both those areas,

03:47:05.060 --> 03:47:12.480
you know, raised up in sort of
public consciousness and, you know,

03:47:12.480 --> 03:47:16.800
some coordinated policy
and ideas around that.

03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:20.350
So, numeracy as I say
has to be at the table.

03:47:20.350 --> 03:47:24.260
It's such a key area about the life
we know but it's one of the areas

03:47:24.260 --> 03:47:27.670
which has a direct impact
on adult's chances in life

03:47:27.670 --> 03:47:31.310
if they are low numerate
that's just as devastating

03:47:31.310 --> 03:47:34.200 position:56%
if not more or so than low literate.

03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:36.460
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Paul,
you want to-- Thank you.

03:47:36.460 --> 03:47:38.480
You, thank you.

03:47:38.480 --> 03:47:40.520
&gt;&gt; Paul Austin: Paul Austin,
superintendent of schools.

03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:43.630
And I think-- I'm listening
very carefully

03:47:43.630 --> 03:47:44.930
because I think I'm the only--

03:47:44.930 --> 03:47:47.510
Am I the only public
educator in the room?

03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:50.980
I'm a little intimidated
and out of my element.

03:47:50.980 --> 03:47:54.510
But I listened very intently
with what people are saying.

03:47:54.510 --> 03:47:56.980
And there are a couple of
things that I'm not much of a--

03:47:56.980 --> 03:48:00.650
I'm on a comment at a meeting
but I'm going to do it anyway.

03:48:00.650 --> 03:48:03.870 position:56%
There's a lot of things that were
said and I apologize if I'll go back

03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:08.030 position:56%
for a minute on some of the issues
that we're facing in public schools.

03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:10.890
One is-- And I can't
remember exactly who said it,

03:48:10.890 --> 03:48:13.470
about taking care of the
needs of the whole child.

03:48:13.470 --> 03:48:16.200
I can't do anything.

03:48:16.200 --> 03:48:19.040
I can give the best instruction

03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:21.860
and provide the best professional
development for my teachers

03:48:21.860 --> 03:48:23.790
and hire the very, very best.

03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:28.060
I can't do anything if kids
are coming to school hungry,

03:48:28.060 --> 03:48:33.580 position:56%
they're cold, they're tired,
they're homeless, they have no work.

03:48:33.580 --> 03:48:37.170
Those are the things that I would
encourage all of you to think

03:48:37.170 --> 03:48:41.740
about when we think about how to
improve literacy in this country.

03:48:41.740 --> 03:48:43.600
There is no doubt about that.

03:48:43.600 --> 03:48:48.950
And I live in an area that 75%
of my population live in poverty.

03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:56.270
It's 66% of the income, and say,
if the income of my area is 66%

03:48:56.270 --> 03:48:59.030
of the national average income.

03:48:59.030 --> 03:49:01.250
And so we're facing huge,

03:49:01.250 --> 03:49:05.710
huge divides of a work we're
trying to accomplish everyday.

03:49:05.710 --> 03:49:08.860
And I see it everyday because
I'm in the schools everyday.

03:49:08.860 --> 03:49:11.910
It's one of the things that I pride
myself on and getting in there

03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:13.750
and seeing what kids are doing.

03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:19.950
And so I encourage you to bridge
the gaps between health care,

03:49:19.950 --> 03:49:24.600
and insurance, and food
security, and home security.

03:49:24.600 --> 03:49:27.090
That has to be done if we're
going to move anything.

03:49:27.090 --> 03:49:29.180 position:56%
I'm also curious about the numeracy.

03:49:29.180 --> 03:49:32.770
And I agree, because we
haven't talked much about it.

03:49:32.770 --> 03:49:34.070
It's interesting.

03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:37.430
I don't know if other states are
like Maine, but we've had great,

03:49:37.430 --> 03:49:43.360 position:56%
great success in moving literacy
forward and not so much in numeracy.

03:49:43.360 --> 03:49:45.680
In fact, all of our work
over the last decade--

03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:48.200
and I can say I have three
decades in public school,

03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:52.250
has a special educator, social
worker, school psychologist,

03:49:52.250 --> 03:49:54.380
assistant superintendent,
and superintendent.

03:49:54.380 --> 03:49:56.630
I've seen a lot of
different changes.

03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:59.940
And so we've spent a lot of time
doing literacy and really thinking

03:49:59.940 --> 03:50:01.660
about instructional literacy,

03:50:01.660 --> 03:50:04.380
but not much on numeracy,
and that shows.

03:50:04.380 --> 03:50:06.980
I won't even get started
on what I think

03:50:06.980 --> 03:50:10.450
about state assessment
and national assessment.

03:50:10.450 --> 03:50:14.160
Those things that they're doing in
Michigan, and my PhD is actually

03:50:14.160 --> 03:50:16.880
in public policy, I'm
ashamed to say it sometimes.

03:50:16.880 --> 03:50:21.230
But the ideas of what they're
trying to do in Michigan is not

03:50:21.230 --> 03:50:23.640
about improving literacy
and numeracy in students

03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:26.080
but in shaming America's teachers,

03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:28.410
to show them that they
are not doing the job.

03:50:28.410 --> 03:50:30.220
And that is a-- somebody
mentioned earlier--

03:50:30.220 --> 03:50:32.780
and I think it was the
gentleman from Chicago or--

03:50:32.780 --> 03:50:37.560
I can't remember where you're
from but close enough--

03:50:37.560 --> 03:50:38.990
that talked about that
the profession

03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:41.970
of teaching is not
getting due diligence.

03:50:41.970 --> 03:50:45.790
Those are the things that I think
this group can influence greatly.

03:50:45.790 --> 03:50:49.240 position:56%
And we do appreciate all the support
that we get in public education.

03:50:49.240 --> 03:50:50.540
So, thank you.

03:50:50.540 --> 03:50:52.220
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson:
Yeah, thank you Paul.

03:50:52.220 --> 03:50:53.520
Thank you.

03:50:53.520 --> 03:50:56.510
That might be our last word.

03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:59.200
[ Laughter ]

03:50:59.200 --> 03:51:02.400
So, yeah, let me just
wrap up and say thank you.

03:51:02.400 --> 03:51:05.030
This has been an extraordinary day.

03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:09.200
It has been remarkable to have the
firsthand experience of the work

03:51:09.200 --> 03:51:12.750
that you all are doing for the
honorees and the award winners.

03:51:12.750 --> 03:51:15.160
The work that you're
doing is just phenomenal.

03:51:15.160 --> 03:51:19.680
And I have to admit
that probably four

03:51:19.680 --> 03:51:23.340
or five different times during
the presentations, I was crying

03:51:23.340 --> 03:51:26.440
and just sad and want to like
ball up in a corner and just like,

03:51:26.440 --> 03:51:30.100
"Uh just get-- " you know, this
is just overwhelming, right?

03:51:30.100 --> 03:51:33.060
And then at other times in the
conversation there's so much hope

03:51:33.060 --> 03:51:36.400
and inspiration and joy and
excitement and commitment.

03:51:36.400 --> 03:51:39.260
So, certainly I'm in
a roller coaster ride.

03:51:39.260 --> 03:51:42.730 position:56%
And what I'm left with at the end
of the day is an extraordinary group

03:51:42.730 --> 03:51:46.840
of people who are phenomenal
contributors to others.

03:51:46.840 --> 03:51:52.510
Whether it's our advisers,
award-winners, our honorees,

friends of the Library of
Congress, former award-winners,

03:52:01.870 --> 03:52:06.010
former honorees, you're all here
in the room in some capacity,

03:52:06.010 --> 03:52:08.500
just the most remarkable people.

03:52:08.500 --> 03:52:10.130
And I thank you for being here.

03:52:10.130 --> 03:52:12.320
I thank you for being our partners.

Thank you for being
in this conversation.

I'm so glad you were here.

03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:20.960
And with that, we'll
take a short break.

03:52:20.960 --> 03:52:22.460
Time for dialogue.
