00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.350
So, I want to show you one more

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.400
thing. Here, we have two loops. This one arranges

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.210
the pictures. The one over here draws the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.310
pictures. Now, the second loop is so simple and

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.020
so common, that there is a shorthand for

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.920
it called the enhanced for loop. Instead of letting

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.700
the index value, i, go from zero, through

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.540
all the valid values. And then using the index,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.950
to get the ith picture, you can do the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.550
following. You can simply write for, then you make a

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.830
variable for the picture. Then you write a colon, and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.260
then the array list that you want to traverse. This loop

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.290
sets pic to the first element in the gallery.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.250
Or I guess I should say the zeroth element, then

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.506
to the element within index one, then to the element

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:50.772
with index two, and so on. So pic assumes and

00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:56.700
turn all of the values off the array list each time the loop is entered

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.250
and in this case, pic is drawn. You could do other things as well, of course.
