00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.040
Tactics to flank slash shift a ferocious analyzer from paralysis to go.

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.660
Meaning what? Some hacks overthinks things,

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.570
hesitation to landing and planning and planning and planning.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.890
While there's a couple of things here,

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.580
if the person is above you or below you in the chain of command,

6
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.670
so if they're below you in the chain of command, you know, you explained to him,

7
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:23.320
you say, look, we don't need perfection.

8
00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.850
We're not going to have a hundred percent solution.

9
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:28.450
We don't have 100% of the information. That's a good enough solution.

10
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.420
We need to move forward. Let's execute. Um, and you know what?

11
00:00:31.421 --> 00:00:33.280
I'll take her to things go weren't wrong, don't worry about it.

12
00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:34.990
I'll take responsibility for it. I'm not going to blame you,

13
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.880
which is what you're gonna do anyways as a good leader.

14
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.200
So that's what you're gonna do for you.

15
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:39.340
They're below you in the chain of command.

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.990
If they're above you in the chain of command, guess what?

17
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.980
Same thing you're going to tell. Say the same thing. Like, Hey boss,

18
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.060
we don't need perfection here. Look, boss,

19
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:51.700
we're not going to get all the information we need.

20
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.350
We're not gonna get 100% solution,

21
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.100
we've got a 90% solution and let's go for it.

22
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.740
And if things do go wrong, you can blame me. I don't care. So boom,

23
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.560
the, whether they're above you or below you, the chain of command,

24
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.230
you might change your tact or your verbage a little bit, but it's the same,

25
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.940
same overall concept.

26
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.340
You've got to get them to understand that we don't need perfection,

27
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:13.300
we need to move forward.

28
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.540
And the other thing is you explain the cost of not moving,

29
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.790
the cost of staying still,

30
00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:23.380
the cost of being reactive instead of proactive in basically the cost of not

31
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:24.460
being aggressive.

32
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.070
Cause that's what we're talking about is a lack of aggression and to what does

33
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:30.160
that look like? Will you explain to them that the longer we sit,

34
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.250
the better position the enemy gets into?

35
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.790
The longer we wait,

36
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.320
the less we know about what is actually happening.

37
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.190
Think about that one. The more you sit here and you're planning,

38
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:47.560
the less we know what's going on out there. The things are happening,

39
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.860
they're changing, they're evolving, the enemy's maneuvering.

40
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.340
There's developments on the battlefield or in the marketplace and you don't even

41
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:58.480
know cause you're sitting in the planning space. And the longer we wait,

42
00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:01.990
the less time we have to recover if something does go wrong.

43
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.070
So if we sit here and plan for 47 days and on the 40th day we sat down and we

44
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:11.020
start to execute, something goes wrong.

45
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:14.200
Well we're not gonna make the 50 day mark cause we spent all that time planning.

46
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.080
So the longer that you're sitting around,

47
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:19.300
the last time you have to recover and adapt and adjust.

48
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.630
And the longer that you wait while you're doing planning,

49
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.180
the less relevant your plan actually becomes.

50
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.860
So that's what you need to make people understand.

51
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.700
Now there's people that are just habitual and chronic,

52
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.020
ferocious analyzers and those are the people you got to watch.

53
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:42.070
But you've got to continually just get through their head that the more we sit,

54
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.090
the more the enemy maneuvers. And if we let them maneuver on us anymore,

55
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.950
we're going to get killed. That's it. Pretty easy. No, it's not easy.

56
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.090
It's a simple concept.

57
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.030
[inaudible] it's hard to get people out of their own heads just like this.

58
00:02:55.031 --> 00:02:55.900
Like everything else.

59
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.300
It's hard for the ferocious analyzer to recognize themselves as that.

60
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.650
They think they're doing a good job. They think they're a,

61
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.180
they think they're actually being thorough. And you're a wild man.

62
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:11.240
You're a cowboy. Hey, are you crazy? No, I'm not crazy. I remember one time I,

63
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.990
my first deployment to Iraq, they said, Hey John,

64
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.240
this is after I'd been there for awhile. And they wanted, for some reason,

65
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:21.241
they wanted to know the minimum requirements for us to go out on an operation.

66
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.150
And I said,

67
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.150
I just need a vicinity of the target and of radio frequency to talk to the local

68
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.980
, uh, conventional units there. And they were like, well,

69
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:31.540
don't you need air support? What she did? And I was like,

70
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:36.460
all these other things. I was like, no, we'll figure it out. Just send us. Yeah,

71
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.780
we'll go. And there was other things that we would do as we'd moved to a target.

72
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.360
We'd align things up and we'd but we, we'd be good.

73
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.130
But sometimes people wanted to plan out every last detail and that doesn't work.

74
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.780
The details are not going to stay the same.

75
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.270
The things that you're planning on are going to change.

76
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.360
So don't sit there and plan every last detail cause it's not going to help you.

77
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.970
Man, that's actually a pretty good plan.

78
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.010
Never even thought about how you say if you spend too much,

79
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.700
too much time planning, you know, and then you jump in the game all late.

80
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.580
It's like Dang, you have no time to make any adjustment can react.

81
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.290
Oh you better go perfect cause you, that's all it gets.

82
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.720
The one shot you got at it and guess what?

83
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:12.490
It's not going to go perfect cause things don't go perfect.

84
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.610
Things are not going to go perfect. Not going to happen.

85
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.290
No such thing as flawless execution.

86
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.050
Dave Burke just wrote an article that was on business insider.

87
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.050
This is what it was like. Flawless execution doesn't happen.

88
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.820
Well you know he was a top gun senior instructor for three years. He,

89
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.920
he knows about flying and he knows how hard they worked to towards fall,

90
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.570
this execution. But it didn't exist. The false execution was,

91
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.740
was analyzing their mistakes, seeing what they can improve upon.

92
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:43.450
That was flawless execution for them.

93
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.180
It wasn't the actual act of flawless execution. They, you know,

94
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.060
they had for all this debriefing, flawless analization of what they did wrong.

95
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.020
Yeah.

96
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.810
But it wasn't gonna be perfect ops then it knows no such thing doesn't happen.

97
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.140
So if you're sitting in planning that trying to make that happen,

98
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.210
it's not going to work for you. It's don't do it.
