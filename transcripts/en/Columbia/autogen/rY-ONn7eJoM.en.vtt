00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:13.010
students in their respective countries
and I think we enjoyed getting to know

these students on a personal level you

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:15.690
these students on a personal level you
 

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.150
these students on a personal level you
know getting dragged home to their

houses and going out to karaoke but I

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:20.340
houses and going out to karaoke but I
 

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.820
houses and going out to karaoke but I
think also importantly what we were able

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:22.830
think also importantly what we were able
 

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.710
think also importantly what we were able
to learn about their academic and

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720
to learn about their academic and
 

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.420

think what a lot of us were able to

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560
think what a lot of us were able to
 

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.620
think what a lot of us were able to
observe through our interactions with

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:42.630
observe through our interactions with
 

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.840
observe through our interactions with
our peers is a really big difference

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:44.850
our peers is a really big difference
 

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:48.410

interacted with our subject matter in in
 

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.230
interacted with our subject matter in in
the classroom or when we'd have

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.910
the classroom or when we'd have
discussions about what we were doing

00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920
discussions about what we were doing
 

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.080

that day or at our field sites and we

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:03.090
that day or at our field sites and we
 

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:05.480
that day or at our field sites and we
saw some Indian students really really

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:05.490
saw some Indian students really really
 

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:08.540
saw some Indian students really really
engaging and fighting the political

changes in their communities while we

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:14.340
changes in their communities while we
 

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.480
changes in their communities while we
have a much harder time coaxing

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:17.490

01:09:20.499 --> 01:09:20.509
of especially rising juniors about this
 

01:09:20.509 --> 01:09:23.229
of especially rising juniors about this
program because I think it really even

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239
program because I think it really even
 

01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:24.820
program because I think it really even
though it was a short period of time it

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:24.830
though it was a short period of time it
 

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:27.910
though it was a short period of time it
was exhausting it was intense and I

01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920
was exhausting it was intense and I
 

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.800
was exhausting it was intense and I
think it really I've had this

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:29.810
think it really I've had this
 

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:31.629
think it really I've had this
conversation with other peers helped us

01:09:31.629 --> 01:09:31.639
conversation with other peers helped us
 

01:09:31.639 --> 01:09:36.669
conversation with other peers helped us
really gain a lot more confidence in not

01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679
really gain a lot more confidence in not
 

01:09:36.679 --> 01:09:38.649
really gain a lot more confidence in not
just their ability to do research but

01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:38.659
just their ability to do research but
 

01:09:38.659 --> 01:09:41.740
just their ability to do research but
our ability to just think about what we

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:41.750
our ability to just think about what we
 

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:43.899
our ability to just think about what we
want to research what we want to learn

01:09:43.899 --> 01:09:43.909
want to research what we want to learn
 

01:09:43.909 --> 01:09:47.140
want to research what we want to learn
and why we're here which i think is

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:47.150
and why we're here which i think is
 

01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:49.019
and why we're here which i think is
important for all of us as we're

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:49.029
important for all of us as we're
 

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:52.120
important for all of us as we're
graduating or just going on to the next

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:52.130
graduating or just going on to the next
 

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:55.689
graduating or just going on to the next
year school is kinda legitimizing that

01:09:55.689 --> 01:09:55.699
year school is kinda legitimizing that
 

01:09:55.699 --> 01:09:57.370
year school is kinda legitimizing that
and so a lot of students I've encouraged

01:09:57.370 --> 01:09:57.380
and so a lot of students I've encouraged
 

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:14.150
and so a lot of students I've encouraged
to apply to help them figure that out

01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160
 

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.030
um or what I often speak about is the is

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040
um or what I often speak about is the is
 

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.730
um or what I often speak about is the is
the rigor of the program because when

01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:20.740
the rigor of the program because when
 

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.380
the rigor of the program because when
were there I felt like you know we were

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:22.390
were there I felt like you know we were
 

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:24.500
were there I felt like you know we were
really pretty much at a master's level

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:24.510
really pretty much at a master's level
 

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:27.150
really pretty much at a master's level
you know course it wasn't a study abroad

01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:27.160
you know course it wasn't a study abroad
 

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.510
you know course it wasn't a study abroad
I think often what people associate

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520
I think often what people associate
 

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.830
I think often what people associate
particularly with study abroad programs

01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840
particularly with study abroad programs
 

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.140
particularly with study abroad programs
in Europe that they're sort of vacation

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:34.150
in Europe that they're sort of vacation
 

01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:35.670
in Europe that they're sort of vacation
programs there's a romantic notion

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:35.680
programs there's a romantic notion
 

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.950
programs there's a romantic notion
especially about being in Europe but I

01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:37.960
especially about being in Europe but I
 

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.810
especially about being in Europe but I
think what this program does really well

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:39.820
think what this program does really well
 

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:43.770
think what this program does really well
is a sort of show the diffuse maybe more

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:43.780
is a sort of show the diffuse maybe more
 

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.510
is a sort of show the diffuse maybe more
oblique ways that inequality still

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520
oblique ways that inequality still
 

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.750
oblique ways that inequality still
exists across Europe and I think that's

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:48.760
exists across Europe and I think that's
 

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.300
exists across Europe and I think that's
what really differentiates it from other

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:51.310
what really differentiates it from other
 

01:10:51.310 --> 01:11:00.410
what really differentiates it from other
programs abroad especially in Europe

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420
 

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:05.820
