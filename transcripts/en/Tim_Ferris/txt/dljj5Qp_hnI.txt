Speaker 2:          00:14          what would my advice be to a driven and intelligent college student or young person about to enter the real world? Well, I would be very simple. It would be focus on learning instead of earning, and that sounds cliche, but I'll explain why because if you want to make say $1 million a year, $10 million a year instead of $100,000 a year, I would argue you probably don't want to take the a hundred thousand dollar per year job, even if it's offered to you right out of the gate. I know it sounds like a lot of money, but what I'm going to recommend is not limited to finances. You want to focus on projects, on companies, on environments where you can learn lessons on someone else's bankroll. All right? So let them pay for it and view it effectively as an apprenticeship. So find a situation where you can be in the room with masters of a craft and that could just be dealmaking.

Speaker 2:          01:18          It could be joining a small company, say a fewer than 50 people, where you simply get to observe one of the principals negotiating in an industry that you don't even care anything about, right? It could be waste management and you want to go into high tech, but if you sit in a room with someone who's an absolute pro at crafting deals, negotiating, getting past no those skills, and maybe those relationships start to snowball. All right? And this is what Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert would call systems thinking. So instead of being wedded to the outcome of a given job, you are accumulating skills and relationships that transcend that job, okay? And if you choose your environments, well, because as I've said before, and as people like drew, the CEO of Dropbox, as a friend have said, you're the average of the five people you associate with most, right?

Speaker 2:          02:13          So if you take just a few years, have the patients, the few years to really develop core competencies that allow you to craft your own reality and life negotiation, deal making, getting past know, et Cetera, learning how to pitch, how to get someone's attention in 30 seconds so that you can then create the desire and ultimately ask for some type of action. Once you develop those, then you can really just create the map for the next decade and the next several decades. So that would be it. It would be learned before you earn and it's never too late to do that. So I don't care if you're coming out of college, coming out of high school, 30 40 whatever it is, systems thinking, focus on the skills and relationships first and then you can just create a blank check for how much money you want to make. If that is your goal. The guys, if you're enjoying the tips and tactics and how to on this channel or in the podcast, the Tim Ferriss show, I made this for you.

Speaker 2:          03:21          Tribe of mentors, short advice from the best in the world. This is the book that I wanted to read. So I went out and I put it together, created a dream list of 130 of the best at what they do. People who are icons, legends, and ask them all the same questions. These are people in some cases I wanted to reach out to. My whole life ranges from many, many billionaires, cofounders of every company imaginable, elite athletes ranging from surfing to tennis to power lifting. Everything else, country stars, actors, directors, and you can spot the patterns. So some of my friends have said this is the easiest to read, most useful book that I've put together yet. So checking out tribal mentors.com you can find sample chapters, the whole list of mentors, everything, mentor, mentors.com.
