00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.210
American psychologist, and professor of psychiatry,
Kay Redfield Jamison, is one of the world's

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.170
foremost authorities on bipolar disorder.
She's spent her career researching, lecturing,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.330
and writing seminal books on the condition.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.110
A condition that she also happens to have
had her entire adult life.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.130
In her memoir, "An Unquiet Mind," Jamison
details what it really means to be bipolar.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.380
She writes of not sleeping for days on end,
of feeling long periods of euphoria, and filling

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.019
whole notebooks with her racing thoughts and
grandiose ideas.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.360
While in these manic states, she experienced
a tremendously inflated sense of self-esteem

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.300
and did impulsive things that felt good at
the time but had painful consequences, like

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.690
going on lavish shopping sprees, engaging
in promiscuous behavior, racking up credit

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.600
card debt, and emptying her bank accounts.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.200
But these episodes were followed by emotional
crashes: Crippling bouts of depression that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.130
sent her into a suicidal spiral. At the age
of 28, Jamison tried to kill herself by taking

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.900
an overdose of Lithium, lapsed into a coma,
but thankfully emerged from it determined

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.260
to find help through medication and therapy.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.100
Through her research and writing, Dr. Jamison
has pioneered our understanding of bipolar

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.090
disorder, depression, and the nexus of mental
struggles that we now think of as mood disorders.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.590
And she's probably one of the best ambassadors
we have for all those people who live successful,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.840
productive lives with mental illness.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.200
Just like the anxiety disorders we talked
about last time, mood disorders are misunderstood.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.549
They're diluted by depictions of depression
as something that can be treated with one

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.069
day at a spa or descriptions of people as
manic depressive just because they were sad

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.009
yesterday and aren't today.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.319
As students of psychology, our job is to understand
what mood disorders really are, how they manifest

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.880
themselves, and what might cause them. And
as you probably guessed, this can be pretty

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.759
tough terrain to explore. These disorders
can take people from terrifying highs to pits

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.529
of despair that seem all but bottomless.

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:48.000
But! In between there's what Jamison has called, 
"A rich, imaginative life"

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
-- all made possible by your moods.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.200
We've been talking a lot about terms and concepts
that mean something different than what you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.240
think they mean, but this time, the term "Mood"
is not one of those.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.420
In a psychological context, moods are pretty
much exactly what you think they are: Emotional

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.680
states that are even more subjective and harder
to define than the emotions themselves.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.170
And while psychologists have defined about
10 basic emotions, moods tend to fall

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.290
into two broadly and infinitely variable categories.
You got the good moods and the bad moods.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.900
Probably the most important distinction between
emotion and mood is that moods are long-term

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.090
emotional states rather than discreet, fleeting
feelings.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.090
And "mood-disorders," which are characterized
by emotional extremes and challenges in regulating

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.730
mood tend to be longer-term disturbances.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.710
These include depressive disorders, typified
by prolonged hopelessness and lethargy, and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.200
bipolar disorders, the most prominent of which
involve alternating between depression and mania.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.320
Depression has been called the common cold
of psychological disorders. Which is not to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.400
say that it isn't serious, but it's common
and it's pervasive and it's the top reason

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.040
people seek out mental health help.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.780
We've all felt down before, obviously, often
in response to a specific loss: a breakup

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.900
or a lost job or the death of a loved one.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.830
And the fact is, you probably should feel
bad at times like those. It can actually be

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.680
good for a mind and body to slow down, to
help digest losses that you experience, but

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.110
in general, sadness is temporary. It's when
sadness and grief extend beyond the generally

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.250
accepted social norms, or plunge into a depth
that causes serious dysfunction that you find

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.080
yourself in the territory of depressive disorders.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.390
The DSM-5, our handy (if super flawed) user's
guide to psychological disorders officially

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.940
diagnoses a major depressive disorder when
a patient has experienced at least five signs

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.350
of depression for more than two weeks.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.890
These symptoms include not just depressed
mood, but also significant weight or appetite

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.090
loss or gain, too much or too little sleep,
decreased interest in activities, feeling

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.930
worthless, fatigued, or lethargic, difficulty
concentrating or making decisions, and recurrent

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.580
thoughts of death or suicide.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.510
So while everyone experiences sadness, depression
is a physiological as well as psychological

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.610
illness. It messes with your sleep, and appetite,
and energy, and neurotransmitter levels, all

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.450
interfering with the way your body runs itself.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.330
Plus in keeping with our definition of psychological
disorders, to be considered a true disorder

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.079
this behavior needs to cause the person or
others around them prolonged distress - the

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.540
feeling that something is really wrong.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.920
Just as a person with a severe, generalized
anxiety disorder may never want to leave the

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.639
house, a clinically depressed person often
feels so hopeless and overwhelmed that they

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.660
have trouble living a normal life. And unlike
the bipolar disorders, the depressive disorders

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.139
tend to be all lows.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.220
You've probably heard of manic depression.
It's the outdated term for bipolar disorders.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.660
These include those classic dark lows of depression,
but also bouts of the opposite - of extreme

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.350
mania in more severe cases. Someone suffering
from a bipolar disorder may flip back and

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.170
forth between normal and depressive and manic
phases within a single day or week or month.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.460
And a true manic episode doesn't just mean
being energetic or happy, it's a period of

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.740
intense, restless, but often optimistic hyperactivity
in which your estimation of yourself and your

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.540
abilities and your ideas can often get skewed.
Like, really, REALLY skewed.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.880
Some patients experience mania only rarely,
but when they do, it can be destructive. Kay

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.760
Jamison has testified to that.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.980
Once during a manic episode, she bought up
a drug store's entire supply of snake-bite

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.150
kits, convinced of an imminent attack of rattlesnakes
that only she knew was coming.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.830
In another, she purchased 20 books by the
Penguin Publishing House because she said,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.100
"It could be nice if the penguins could form
a colony."

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.110
In other words, bad judgment is common. And
it can get worse.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.900
Full blown manic episodes often end up in
psychiatric hospitalization, since the risk

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.510
to self or others can become severe. When
the highs eventually end, they're often followed

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.380
by dark periods of depression. When left untreated,
suicide or suicide attempts are common, another

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.250
element of the disorder that Jamison herself
can attest to.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.250
Like so many things in psychology, the cause
of mood disorders is often a combination of

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.280
biological, genetic, psychological, and environmental
factors. We know, for example, that mood disorders

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.889
run in families - genes matter. And you're
more likely to experience a bipolar or depressive

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.090
disorder if you have parents or siblings who
suffer from them.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.580
Studies have of identical twins show that
if one twin has a bipolar disorder, that the

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.330
other has a seven in ten chance of also being
diagnosed, regardless of whether they were

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.240
raised together or apart.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.669
And while a stressful life can't give you
bipolar disorder, it could trigger a manic

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.040
or depressive episode in someone with a pre-existing
condition. Or start a descent into a major

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.270
depressive episode in someone who never before
had experienced depression. In other words,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.430
a person who loses a loved one could go from
sad to depressed or slide into a bipolar episode,

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.080
but it couldn't cause them to have the disorder
to begin with.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.540
In the case of depressive disorders, for most
people, after weeks, months, or even years,

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.240
their depression can end, hopefully with the
return to baseline healthy functioning.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.820
World-wide, women tend to be diagnosed with
major depression more often than men, but

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.389
many psychologists think this is simply because
women tend to seek treatment more. It's also

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.840
possible that depression in men tends to manifest
itself more in terms of anger and aggression,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.160
than as sadness and hopelessness.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.020
This is just an example of how depression
is much more than just being sad and that

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.300
the characteristic lack of purpose and helplessness
can manifest itself in a lot of different ways.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.460
Looking at mood disorders from a neurological
perspective, we see that depressed, manic,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.960
and average brains show very different brain
activity in neural imaging scans. As you might

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.850
expect, a brain in a depressed state slows
down. While a brain in a manic state shows

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.590
a lot of increased activity, making it hard
for that person to calm down or focus or sleep.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.990
Our brain's neurotransmitter chemistry also
changes with these different states. For example,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.460
norepinephrine, which usually increases arousal
and focus, is severely lacking in depressed

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.130
brains, but kind of off the charts during
manic episodes. In fact, drugs that seek to

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:41.070
reduce mania in part do it by reducing norepinephrine
levels. You may have also heard about how

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:46.540
low serotonin levels correlate with depressive
states. Exercise, like jogging or break dancing

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.710
or whatever, increases serotonin levels, which
is one reason exercise is often recommended

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.949
to combat depression. And most medications
designed to treat depression seem to work

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:58.050
by raising serotonin or norepinephrine levels.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.100
And of course there's yet another way to look
at things. The social-cognitive perspective

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.110
examines how our thinking and behavior influence
depression.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.030
People with depression often view bad events
through an internal lens or mind set that

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.660
influences how they're interpreted. And how
you explain events to yourself, in a negative

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.540
or positive way, can really effect how you
recover from them - or don't.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.759
Say you were humiliated in the lunch room
when someone tripped you and chicken soup

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:24.970
flew all over the place, and you sat down
on a brownie, and it was just a bad day. A

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.620
depressive mind might immediately start thinking
that the humiliation will last forever, that

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.800
no one will ever let you live it down, that
it's somehow your own fault, and you can't

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.250
ever do anything right.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:39.130
That negative thinking, learned helplessness,
self-blame, and over-thinking can feed off

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.480
itself and basically smother the joy out of
the brain, eventually creating a vicious self-fulfilling

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.790
cycle of negative thinking.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.480
The good news is that the cycle can be broken
by getting help from a professional, turning

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.710
your attention outward, doing more fun things,
and maybe even moving to a different environment.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.770
But again, that social-cognitive prospective
is just part of a much bigger puzzle. Positive

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:02.600
thinking is important, but it's often inadequate on its own
own when up against genetic or neurological factors.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.390
So mood disorders are complicated conditions
and rarely are they eliminated with a single

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.490
cure. Instead, they're often things you just
live with. And as Dr. Jamison has shown us,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.950
you can live well.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.620
Today we talked about what mood disorders
are, as well as what they aren't. You learned

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.220
about the symptoms of depressive and bipolar
disorders, and the possible biological, genetic,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.460
environmental, and social-cognitive causes
of mood disorders.
