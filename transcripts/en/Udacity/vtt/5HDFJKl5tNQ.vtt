00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.620
So let's see if we understood
the relationship between page size and

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.000
frames in memory.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.660
let's say we have system whos physical
memory's only two gigabytes.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.080
The virtual memory same page
process is four gigabytes,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.920
the page size in this
system is four kilobytes.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.300
The question for you is how many page
frames do we have in this system.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.590
And how many entries does
each page table have?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.420
An entry is what keeps the mapping for

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.070
a single page to where it
is in physical memory.
