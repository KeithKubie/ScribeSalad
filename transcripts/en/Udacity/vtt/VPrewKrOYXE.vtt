This answer here, that the profile stores conference

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.370
names not keys, is wrong. We do store the

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.940
conference keys. However, we store them as strings.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.940
So, this answer is correct. The profile stores the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.070
conference keys as strings. So because they're strings,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.570
we have to convert them into keys, before we

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.860
can use the key to load the entity from

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.910
the data store. The reason that we use strings

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.050
for the keys, is that you can't parse actual key entities

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.490
around inside of JSON. So we create a web safe version

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.670
of the key as a string. And this answer is wrong.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.970
Yeah, I know, it would be, it would be nice just to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.760
simply return the value of the property, but it's not going to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.760
work. So you can find the finished code for getConferencesToAttend in

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.330
the lesson four folder, if you need a bit of help

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.500
writing the code. So go take a look if you need to.
