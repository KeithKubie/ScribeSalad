00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:01.534
- [Instructor] We're
now going to talk about

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:04.254
the main division that emerges in Islam

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:07.245
shortly after the death of Muhammad.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.622
And that division is
between Sunnis and Shias.

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:14.225
And this division even exists today

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:17.386
where roughly 90% of the world's 1.5

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:20.563
or 1.6 billion Muslims are Sunni,

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:23.420
and roughly 10% are Shia.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.695
And that 10% is concentrated mainly

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:30.638
in places like Iran,
Iraq, but they are spread

00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:34.324
throughout the Muslim world
or the world in general.

00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:38.440
Now, the word Sunni comes
from the word Sunnah

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.279
which is referring to
examples of Muhammad.

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:46.170
The word Shia comes from shi'atu 'Ali

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.234
which means followers
of Ali or party of Ali,

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.429
and we'll talk more about
Ali in a little bit.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.247
But, the general division is over

00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:58.601
who should succeed
Muhammad after his death

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.246
as the leader of the Muslim community.

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:04.902
Shias believe it should be
members of Muhammad's family

00:01:04.902 --> 00:01:07.626
and especially descendants of Muhammad,

00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:10.682
while the Sunnis believe
that it doesn't necessarily

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:12.556
have to be that.

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:14.853
But, as we'll see, this division becomes

00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:17.708
stronger and stronger and stronger

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.935
as there's more and more bloodshed

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:23.744
between the two parties.

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:27.043
Because so much of this revolves around

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:31.219
the family of Muhammad,
let's just review that first

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.705
and then we'll talk about the division

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:37.772
over who should succeed
Muhammad as caliph or successor

00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:40.309
to lead the Muslim community.

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.507
So, you see Muhammad
right over here born 570.

00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:46.300
We have his birth on our timeline as well.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.228
And just to read this timeline,

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:50.561
it goes from light blue to dark blue

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:53.134
when Muhammad, according
to Islamic tradition,

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:55.985
starts to have the revelations from God.

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.604
And the Muslim calendar starts at 622,

00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:01.037
the time of the Hijrah
where the Muslim community,

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:04.172
in order to escape
persecution from the Quraysh,

00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:06.589
migrate from Mecca to Medina.

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.986
Now, we've talked about
several of these figures

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:11.707
in other videos.

00:02:11.707 --> 00:02:14.701
Right over here, you have
Muhammad's dad, Adbullah,

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.935
who dies several months
before Muhammad is born.

00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:21.593
You have Aminah here who
is Muhammad's mother,

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:25.329
and she dies when
Muhammad is six years old.

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.188
Then, you have Abdul-Muttalib
who is the head

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:30.899
of Muhammad's, you could say, household

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.125
and he takes custody
after the death of Aminah.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:37.331
And he takes custody until
Muhammad is eight years old

00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:39.621
when Abdul-Muttalib dies,

00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:44.073
and then Muhammad's uncle,
Abu Talib, takes custody.

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:48.566
It's under Abu Talib that
Muhammad learns his trade

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:51.066
as a merchant and as a trader.

00:02:52.012 --> 00:02:54.752
Now, later on, we talk about Khadijah

00:02:54.752 --> 00:02:57.419
who is a wealthy widow in Mecca,

00:02:58.442 --> 00:03:01.951
and she employs Muhammad and
according to Islamic tradition,

00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:04.757
is impressed by him and proposes to him,

00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:07.135
and she's 15 years older than Muhammad.

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:10.232
This is her third marriage,
and Muhammad marries her.

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:12.061
She's a significant figure in Islam,

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:15.189
not because she is Muhammad's first wife,

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.121
but also because she is the first Muslim.

00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:21.177
Now, as you can see,
Muhammad and Khadijah,

00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:22.305
they have several children,

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:24.979
and I list one of them here, Fatimah,

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:29.146
because Fatimah ends up
marrying Abu Talib's son, Ali.

00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:32.452
And Ali is the Ali that
we're talking about

00:03:32.452 --> 00:03:36.619
where the word Shia, shi'atu
'Ali comes from, party of Ali.

00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:41.634
Because Ali is considered
the second Muslim.

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:44.821
He is one of the early
followers of Muhammad.

00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:47.021
As you can see, he is Muhammad's cousin.

00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.499
He grows up in the same
household with Muhammad

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.926
with Abu Talib, and he is
also Muhammad's son-in-law.

00:03:52.926 --> 00:03:56.336
He marries Fatimah and
they have several children,

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.439
two of which are Hassan and Hussein

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.736
who figure very prominently
in the narrative

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:04.146
I'm going to talk about in
this video and the next.

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:06.068
Now, the other figures that you see here,

00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:10.089
you have Abu Bakr who
was a close companion

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:14.259
of Muhammad, also one
of the early Muslims.

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.018
And you can see he was a little
bit younger than Muhammad.

00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:20.384
And they are connected through Aisha.

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:24.422
Muhammad marries Aisha
after the death of Khadijah,

00:04:24.422 --> 00:04:27.974
and Aisha is a significant
figure in early Islam.

00:04:27.974 --> 00:04:30.367
She's considered to have
a very strong personality.

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:33.135
Many of the Hadith are narrated by her.

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:36.165
The Hadith are the Muslim
traditions and accounts

00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:39.110
of Muhammad's life, and
it's a significant part

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.294
of the religion outside of the Quran.

00:04:42.294 --> 00:04:46.045
And she is married to Muhammad
at a very, very young age,

00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:49.459
and there's some debate about
how young she actually was.

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:52.214
But, as we'll see, she
also figures prominently

00:04:52.214 --> 00:04:54.742
in this narrative and in
this schism that develops

00:04:54.742 --> 00:04:56.944
between the Sunni and the Shia.

00:04:56.944 --> 00:05:01.252
And the Sunni and the
Shia view her differently.

00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:03.919
So, let's go back to the timeline here.

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.586
So, as Muhammad's life
nears its end in 632,

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:10.139
in previous videos, we talk about

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.479
his final pilgrimage to Mecca.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.774
And then, on his way back to Medina,

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:18.433
at a place like Ghadir
Khumm, he gives a sermon,

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:23.103
a sermon that is especially
very important to the Shia.

00:05:23.103 --> 00:05:24.835
According to that short sermon.

00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:27.594
And Ghadir Khumm, Ghadir
literally means pond

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:32.180
or small stream, so it's the
sermon at the pond Khumm.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.506
There's one quotation that Shia consider

00:05:35.506 --> 00:05:39.063
to be very, very important
where Muhammad says

00:05:39.063 --> 00:05:41.964
"Of whomsoever I had been Mawla."

00:05:41.964 --> 00:05:44.357
Ali here is to be his Mawla.

00:05:44.357 --> 00:05:48.007
And the word Mawla means
protector or leader,

00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:52.917
or it could mean guardian or
people that you are close to.

00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:55.440
And the Shia view this as clear evidence

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.357
that Muhammad intended
Ali to be his successor.

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.496
Many members of the Sunni tradition

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:06.016
take a slightly different interpretation

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:08.407
where they say Mawla
doesn't necessarily have

00:06:08.407 --> 00:06:10.474
to mean protector or leader.

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.177
It could mean companion or friend

00:06:13.177 --> 00:06:14.676
or member that is close to,

00:06:14.676 --> 00:06:18.424
and so they don't view this
as strongly of evidence.

00:06:18.424 --> 00:06:21.741
But, in the Shia tradition,
the event at Ghadir Khumm

00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:26.573
is actually a significant
event and it is even a holiday.

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:28.997
So, that's the evidence that Shia point to

00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:32.425
as why Ali should be the successor.

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:36.592
But, then Muhammad dies, and
according to the tradition,

00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:41.728
while his funeral was being
planned by his family,

00:06:41.728 --> 00:06:43.271
the close companions were meeting

00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:46.874
and discussing who
should succeed Muhammad.

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:48.696
And the close companions decide

00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:51.305
that is should be Abu Bakr.

00:06:51.305 --> 00:06:54.160
So, Abu Bakr becomes the first caliph,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.594
and he rules for two years.

00:06:56.594 --> 00:07:01.235
He's succeeded by Umar,
sometimes pronounced as Omar,

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:05.064
who then is assassinated
who is succeeded by Uthman,

00:07:05.064 --> 00:07:09.090
sometimes pronounced as Osman
who is then assassinated.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.112
And then, Ali takes power.

00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:15.501
According to Sunni tradition,
these first four caliphs

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.122
are considered the Rashidun caliphs

00:07:18.122 --> 00:07:19.672
or the rightly guided.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:23.039
And under their rule, you
have the significant spread

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.520
of what becomes this Islamic empire

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.625
that we talk about in other videos.

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:30.282
In Shia tradition, they consider

00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:33.138
these first three caliphs as usurpers.

00:07:33.138 --> 00:07:35.627
They believe that Ali
should have been caliph

00:07:35.627 --> 00:07:38.665
from the beginning right in 632

00:07:38.665 --> 00:07:40.577
at the time of Muhammad's death.

00:07:40.577 --> 00:07:44.414
And once again, they cite
the events at Ghadir Khumm

00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:47.978
which was observed according to the Hadith

00:07:47.978 --> 00:07:49.938
by thousands of people

00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:52.417
and there's many, many accounts of this.

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:55.138
Now, Ali is in power, but as we will see

00:07:55.138 --> 00:07:58.557
in the next video, this
starts the first civil war,

00:07:58.557 --> 00:08:00.749
the first Muslim civil war, often referred

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:03.792
to as the First Fitna, between Ali

00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:07.709
and the Umayyad's who
are the family of Uthman,

00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:11.864
and we will cover that in the next video.
