NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
You know what we have?

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:05.667
We have a video dispatch from an
actual local news meteorologist

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:09.500
to help us explain how they
make their predictions happen.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.667
Let's check it out.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.767
NICK GREGORY: Hello, Dr. Tyson.

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:13.767
Nick Gregory here at
the Fox 5 Weather Center

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.033
in New York City.

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.500
Coming up with a weather
forecast with all the raw data

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.100
we get from NOAA
and other sources,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.166
really is a science-- huge
amounts of data that get

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.233
plugged into various
computer models,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.967
which then present a solution.

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:29.533
We take that solution,
apply our own knowledge

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.600
of past weather events,
and predict what

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.467
we think is going to happen.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:34.734
For example, let's
see how we would

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:37.100
predict a potential blizzard.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.367
So we would start to look
for those weather trends.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:40.667
What would they be?

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.567
Let's say high pressure
ridging in from eastern Canada.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.333
We would then look to
the computer models

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.100
to see what type of jet stream
pattern would be in play,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.600
and would this trough
of low pressure

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.467
be along the East
Coast, potentially

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:55.100
with this jet stream riding
up the Eastern Seaboard?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.200
Pockets of energy then started
moving across the country,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.367
this upper-level energy, that
once it reaches the East Coast,

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.066
sets the potential
for a storm to develop

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.800
right in this location.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.467
That storm could then intensify
and turn into a nor'easter,

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.633
and eventually track up
along that jet stream track,

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:17.233
leaving a swath of
heavy snow alongside.

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:18.600
So there you have it.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.734
Perhaps not the most
accurate forecast,

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.100
but we do work with
science and technology

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.066
so that forecast will
improve over time.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.734
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Cool.
I know this guy.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:29.433
I mean, he's our
local weather guy.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.967
It's nice you
threw him some work.

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:32.600
[laughter]

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.233
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
So to improve accuracy,

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:38.700
it's not just an
academic exercise.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.934
It matters.

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.400
And what's the biggest
reason why we need accurate

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.200
disaster forecasts from you?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.500
RADLEY HORTON: Well, for one
thing, it saves lives, right?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.066
I mean, if we can
know that a hurricane

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:53.433
is going to explosively gain
in strength and advance.

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.934
We can get people out
of the way in time,

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:59.000
for example, if we can
better forecast tornadoes.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.467
It's also big business, right?

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:04.533
If we can help inform people on
when they should plant crops,

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.600
inform investments on
how much money should

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.467
be spent on heating fuels,
or something like that,

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:10.467
for a winter.

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:12.533
So there's real
economic implications

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:13.533
and human lives at stake.
