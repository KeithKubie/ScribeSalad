00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.410
Let's see if we can evaluate
the indefinite integral 1

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.430
over plus 9 plus x squared dx.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.040
And we know that if you
have the pattern a squared

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.230
minus x squared, it
could be a good idea

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.180
to make the substitution,
x is equal to a sine theta.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.470
But we don't see that
pattern over here.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.030
Instead, what we see is
a squared plus x squared.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.794
And in this context, it tends
to be a good idea-- it's not

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:28.960
always going to work, but
it never hurts to try out.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.160
This is a little bit of
an art here-- to try out,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.100
x is equal to a tangent theta.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.224
Now you might say,
Sal, why is that?

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:37.640
Well, let's make
that substitution

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.010
and see how this
thing would simplify.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.490
This thing would become a
squared plus a squared tangent

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.360
squared theta, which
is a squared times 1

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.630
plus tangent squared theta.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.742
And this right over here,
we could reprove it.

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:56.450
Actually, let me just
reprove it for you.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.450
This is going to become
a squared times-- this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.500
is 1 could be written
as cosine squared theta

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.750
over cosine squared theta.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.720
Tangent squared is
sine squared theta

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.542
over cosine squared theta.

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:13.000
And this is why I picked cosine
squared as the denominator,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.900
so that I can add the two.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.160
And this is going to become
a squared times cosine

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.900
squared theta plus
sine squared theta,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.270
all of that over
cosine squared theta.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.240
This numerator from the
unit circle definition

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330
of trig functions becomes 1.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.380
So this is 1 over
cosine squared theta.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.900
And everything simplifies
to a squared secant

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.850
squared theta, which
might simplify things.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.520
So let's see if we have
what's going on over here.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.700
We can rewrite this.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.580
So 9 plus x squared
you could rewrite

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.770
as 3 squared plus x squared.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.800
In this case, a
would be equal to 3.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.630
So we want to make
the substitution,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.990
x is equal to 3
tangent of theta.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.900
And if we wanted
to solve for x, you

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.235
can divide both sides by
3, because we're later

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:07.860
going to have to undo
the substitution.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.230
x over 3 is equal
to tangent theta,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.190
or theta is equal to arctangent
or inverse tangent of x over 3.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.474
Now we're also going to have
to figure out what dx is.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:22.640
We're also going to have
to figure out what that is.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.395
So let's take the
derivative or we'll write it

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.750
in differential form.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.400
dx is equal to 3 derivative
of tangent theta with respect

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.282
to theta is secant
squared theta d theta.

00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:36.990
So now it looks like
we're armed with all

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.850
of the things necessary to
rewrite this entire integral.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.820
It's going to be equal to
the indefinite integral.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.650
You're going to
have dx here, which

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.450
is equal to 3 secant
squared theta d theta.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.880
That's the dx.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.080
And all of that's going
to be over this business

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.302
right over here, our a
squared plus our x squared.

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:04.510
Now we already know what
that's going to simplify to.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.380
Our a squared plus
our x squared is

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.260
going to-- since we
made this substitution,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.070
x is equal to 3
tangent theta is going

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.610
to simplify to a squared
secant squared theta.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.530
So this is going to simplify
to 9 secant squared theta.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.610
And you could essentially
go through this logic.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.720
You're going to get 9 plus
9 tangent squared theta.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.740
Factor out a 9, you get 9
times 1 plus tan squared theta.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.130
And so that's going
to be 9 times secant

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.650
squared theta, exactly
what we have here.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.200
Lucky for us, we have
the secant squared.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.520
It's canceling out.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.020
The secant squared
is canceling out.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.390
You have 3 over 9.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.850
This whole thing
can be rewritten

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.870
as 1/3-- that's
just the 3 over 9--

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.090
times the indefinite integral
of just d theta, which

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.510
is equal to 1/3 theta plus c.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.130
And now we just have to
put things in terms of x.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.560
And we see theta is equal
to arctangent of x over 3.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.930
So this is going to be
equal to 1/3 arctangent of x

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.480
over 3 plus c.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.680
And we are done.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.180
So now we know how to deal with
cases where we see something

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.580
like an a squared
minus an x squared

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.090
and an a squared
plus an x squared.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.850
It won't always
work, but it might

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.600
be a useful-- it'll definitely
allow you to do this thing.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.100
It might not always make
the integral solvable,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.530
but it's not a bad thing to try.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.970
When it looks like
u-substitution isn't working,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.600
then you can look
for these patterns

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.802
and try some trig substitution.
