00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.803
THIS DAIS
IS THE PERFECT METAPHOR

00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:06.707
FOR WHERE AMERICA STANDS
TODAY.

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:08.909
LOOK AT OUR ECONOMY.

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.912
BARELY MOVING,
GASPING FOR AIR,

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:15.682
AND DESPERATELY
CLINGING TO LIFE.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.785
VERY MUCH LIKE LARRY KING.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.755
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:26.593
WITH LARRY, WE HAVE
A NEVER-ENDING SUPPLY OF GAS.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.495
NEVER ENDS.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:31.398
THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:35.469
WAS BUILT ON ITS
ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT,

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.105
AND THAT SPIRIT
IS BEST DEMONSTRATED

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:42.476
BY NONE OTHER THAN MY FRIEND
SNOOP DOGG.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:44.711
[cheers and applause]

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.880
HIS IS A TALE

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.284
OF DO-RAGS TO RICHES.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:52.352
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.988
HE'S VERY PROUD OF THAT.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.724
THAT'S WHY I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE SNOOP

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:02.262
SITTING UP HERE
NEXT TO HIS FORMER RIVAL...

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.198
BIGGIE SMALLS,
RIGHT HERE.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.806
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
ONE OF THE WOMEN ON THE DAIS.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.208
THIS AMAZING LADY STRUGGLES

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:19.780
WITH A SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE
PHYSICAL HANDICAP.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.484
I SPEAK, OF COURSE,
OF WHITNEY CUMMINGS.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:28.789
WHITNEY'S CAREER IS CRIPPLED
BY HER FOUL MOUTH.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.757
TO HEAR THAT FILTHY LANGUAGE

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.127
FROM SOMEONE
SO MARGINALLY ATTRACTIVE

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:37.564
IS, FRANKLY,
VERY UNPLEASANT.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:44.571
LISA--
OR AS I CALL HER, MISS USDA--

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:52.579
I WANT YOU TO BE A JUDGE

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.849
AT MY NEXT
MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.884
[cheers and applause]

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.586
YOU'RE PERFECT.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.555
BECAUSE LIKE THE UNIVERSE,

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:06.727
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY EXPANDING
AND FILLED WITH DARK MATTER.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.137
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT HAVE BROUGHT SHAME

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.272
UPON THIS GREAT LAND OF OURS.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.174
BESIDES LISA.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.810
I SPEAK OF THE ATROCITIES

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.614
THAT WE AS A NATION
MUST ENDURE,

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.884
LIKE THE JERSEY SHORE.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:36.890
A PIECE OF ADVICE,
MY GREASY FRIEND.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.493
YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.995
ALL OF THAT PRODUCT
IN YOUR HAIR.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.031
YOU JUST DON'T.

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:48.201
LOOK HOW GREAT MY HAIR LOOKS,
AND I DON'T USE ANYTHING.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.637
AND IT LOOKS VERY GOOD.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:54.541
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A WET RACCOON

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.477
AND DONALD J. TRUMP'S HAIR?

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:00.113
A WET RACCOON DOESN'T HAVE

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:05.318
7 BILLION FUCKIN' DOLLARS
IN THE BANK.

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:07.587
[cheers and applause]

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.490
VERY FUNNY.
OKAY, VERY FUNNY.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.628
AMERICA IS GOING THROUGH
TOUGH TIMES,

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.264
AND WE ALL NEED TO LAUGH.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:19.299
TRUE.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.634
[cheers and applause]

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:24.538
I KNOW THAT BETTER DAYS
ARE AHEAD.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.840
IF WE BELIEVE IN OURSELVES

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.876
AND THE WAY I BELIEVE
IN MYSELF--

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.412
AND I REALLY DO
BELIEVE IN MYSELF--

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:36.450
THEN COME JUNE,
IF I DECIDE TO RUN,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.254
YOU'LL HAVE THE GREAT PLEASURE
OF VOTING FOR THE MAN

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:46.026
THAT WILL EASILY GO DOWN
AS THE GREATEST PRESIDENT

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.929
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.032
ME--DONALD JOHN TRUMP.

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:55.669
GOD BLESS AMERICA,
AND GOOD NIGHT!

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.670
[Mississippi's Money]

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.672
GOOD NIGHT.
