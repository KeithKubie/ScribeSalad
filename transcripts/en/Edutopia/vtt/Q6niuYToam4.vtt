00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.516
&gt;&gt;Falon: Anything else special
happen this weekend, friends?

00:00:02.696 --> 00:00:04.186
&gt;&gt;In the pool, I did a cannonball.

00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:05.866
&gt;&gt;I know how to swim.

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:07.176
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You know how to swim?

00:00:07.646 --> 00:00:08.006
&gt;&gt;I do.

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.206
&gt;&gt;I know how to blow
bubbles under water.

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:09.976
&gt;&gt;Falon: You do?

00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:10.716
&gt;&gt;Falon: As human beings, one

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:14.176
of the most essential needs
we have is the need to belong.

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:19.736
In school, children need
a sense of belonging

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:21.726
to be able to be productive learners.

00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:25.156
They need to be connected
to their fellow students,

00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:32.016
connected to their teachers, to also
be affirmed in who they are in a way

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:33.976
that is positive and accepting.

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:40.726
&gt;&gt;I take swimming lessons.

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:41.966
&gt;&gt;I don't take swimming lessons.

00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:43.536
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: In
a belonging classroom,

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:45.906
there's a community being
explicitly built.

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:50.306
The teacher knows each child and
things about each of those children

00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:52.566
that they can mention and draw on.

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:56.156
&gt;&gt;Falon: I pay attention, I listen, I'm
really invested in what they tell me.

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:59.496
The students feeling loved, students
feeling nurtured, students feeling

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:01.146
like they have a place at school.

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:04.966
They're safe, it activates
their brain cells.

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:10.376
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: Sense of belonging is
one of the most important activators

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.626
of a child's engagement in learning.

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:20.406
Everything about activating a
child's cognitive skills begins

00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:23.346
with activating their
social connectedness.

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:28.716
The energy for learning is coming from
the social connection the children have.

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.676
&gt;&gt;Teacher: But in the end, we're
trying to come up with an agreement.

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:32.406
&gt;&gt;Excellent.

00:01:32.546 --> 00:01:34.606
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: We're not going
to comment, question.

00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:35.876
We're only going to encourage.

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:47.506
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: Because they're culturally
and linguistically diverse students,

00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:53.236
I want to really make sure that we
are making them feel connections.

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:58.046
All the writing we do in our
class, it's very much about them.

00:01:58.046 --> 00:02:00.196
It helps them, promotes
them to find their own voice

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:02.216
and to share their stories.

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:05.356
&gt;&gt;Anissa: Sometimes people think
every Muslim person is a target

00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:06.336
or is a terrorist.

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:06.976
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: Thank you, Anissa.

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:12.956
&gt;&gt;Molly: What did this show us about
what we are good at, as a group?

00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:15.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Working together
because we often argue a lot.

00:02:16.106 --> 00:02:20.516
&gt;&gt;Molly: Today, we did an activity that
was really designed to get them thinking

00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:22.906
about how they're going
to support each other.

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:26.516
I think that reiterating the
idea that we're in this together,

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:31.586
I think it's hard to find the time
but doing some team building exercises

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:33.256
at the beginning of the year

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:36.976
and revisiting them can really
help illustrate that point.

00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:41.496
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: In a belonging
classroom, they have a community

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:44.696
that may meet in classroom
meetings to problem solve together,

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:48.796
to read stories together, to
tell successes and accomplishments

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:50.766
or important events together.

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:55.336
They celebrate like families do things

00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:57.976
that each other have
done or have experienced.

00:02:58.106 --> 00:03:02.226
&gt;&gt;Falon: Let's talk about what we
admire about some or our friends.

00:03:02.226 --> 00:03:10.176
&gt;&gt;Student: I admire Jazara
because she is so compassionate.

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:12.066
&gt;&gt;Falon: We're always talking
about being compassionate,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.176
being supportive of one another.

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:15.876
It's to build that deeper
connection, for everyone just to feel

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:18.196
like this is their school family,
this is somewhere where they're loved,

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.836
they're nurtured, they're
taken care of, they're valued.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:22.266
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: Thank you for speaking.

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:26.546
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: The
community becomes a place

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:30.746
where you can bring your
emotions, your fears, your needs.

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:36.596
You can be honest about what's going on
and know that there will be acceptance,

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:39.976
support and love that's
available to carry you through.

00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:45.776
&gt;&gt;Ernie: We all can work together and
we all can try to strategize together

00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:47.816
and create a better pathway for others

00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:48.976
to be successful, and
we can make it fun.

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:54.256
&gt;&gt;Molly: They're working together,
they take care of each other,

00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:54.806
not just personally but academically.

00:03:54.976 --> 00:03:56.643
&gt;&gt;Student: We're always
pushing each other.
