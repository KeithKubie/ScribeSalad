four year old boy and so there's a very
strong chance that he's just using his

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
strong chance that he's just using his
 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.680
strong chance that he's just using his
imagination and that's what it felt like

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690
imagination and that's what it felt like
 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.599
imagination and that's what it felt like
at first I actually had to go to IMDB

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609
at first I actually had to go to IMDB
 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.349
at first I actually had to go to IMDB
and read the plot synopsis that states

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359
and read the plot synopsis that states
 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.090
and read the plot synopsis that states
that a boy finds a magical portal that

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100
that a boy finds a magical portal that
 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.129
that a boy finds a magical portal that
allows him to travel through time and so

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139
allows him to travel through time and so
 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.920
allows him to travel through time and so
if that synopsis is to be believed then

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
if that synopsis is to be believed then
 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.870
if that synopsis is to be believed then
what we're seeing is literal but there's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880
what we're seeing is literal but there's
 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.229
what we're seeing is literal but there's
a large portion of the movie where you

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239
a large portion of the movie where you
 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.879
a large portion of the movie where you
just kind of feel like the boy is so

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889
just kind of feel like the boy is so
 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.650
just kind of feel like the boy is so
bothered by this new presence in his

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660
bothered by this new presence in his
 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.860
bothered by this new presence in his
life that he's using his imagination and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870
life that he's using his imagination and
 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.240
life that he's using his imagination and
perhaps that might be what hosted us

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
perhaps that might be what hosted us
 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.849
perhaps that might be what hosted us
going for maybe he wants the ambiguity

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859
going for maybe he wants the ambiguity
 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.940
going for maybe he wants the ambiguity
but the IMDB synopsis seems to state

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950
but the IMDB synopsis seems to state
 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.370
but the IMDB synopsis seems to state
otherwise I kind of like the idea of it

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380
otherwise I kind of like the idea of it
 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.860
otherwise I kind of like the idea of it
being ambiguous but as the film goes on

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870
being ambiguous but as the film goes on
 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.379
being ambiguous but as the film goes on
and he talks to his parents and he sees

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389
and he talks to his parents and he sees
 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.110
and he talks to his parents and he sees
photo albums with people from his family

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120
photo albums with people from his family
 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.540
photo albums with people from his family
in them and his mother states things

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550
in them and his mother states things
 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.399
in them and his mother states things
that they have done in the past and

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409
that they have done in the past and
 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.560
that they have done in the past and
those are things that we saw in

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570
those are things that we saw in
 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.570
those are things that we saw in
these dreamlike sequences than you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
these dreamlike sequences than you
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.430
these dreamlike sequences than you
realize okay well then this must really

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440
realize okay well then this must really
 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.530
realize okay well then this must really
be happening because how else would this

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540
be happening because how else would this
 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.810
be happening because how else would this
four-year-old boy have this knowledge of

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820
four-year-old boy have this knowledge of
 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.600
four-year-old boy have this knowledge of
things from the past unless he really

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610
things from the past unless he really
 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.250
things from the past unless he really
experienced that through some sort of

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260
experienced that through some sort of
 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.320
experienced that through some sort of
time portal and so I kind of wished that

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330
time portal and so I kind of wished that
 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.660
time portal and so I kind of wished that
that was open to more interpretation and

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670
that was open to more interpretation and
 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.790
that was open to more interpretation and
less literal I feel like that would have

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800
less literal I feel like that would have
 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.500
less literal I feel like that would have
made for a stronger narrative but it

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510
made for a stronger narrative but it
 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.330
made for a stronger narrative but it
might have also pissed off people

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340
might have also pissed off people
 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.620
might have also pissed off people
especially young kids who are watching

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630
especially young kids who are watching
 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.660
especially young kids who are watching
the movie if it was confusing like that

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670
the movie if it was confusing like that
 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.490
the movie if it was confusing like that
still this is a film that explores

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500
still this is a film that explores
 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.950
still this is a film that explores
aspects of family that a lot of films

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960
aspects of family that a lot of films
 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.580

just don't really go for this young boy

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590
just don't really go for this young boy
 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.780
just don't really go for this young boy
experiencing things that are so much

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.290
experiencing things that are so much
deeper and at a level of personal

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300
deeper and at a level of personal
 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.080

importance that he just can't comprehend

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090
importance that he just can't comprehend
 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.020
importance that he just can't comprehend
yet watching him experience that and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030
yet watching him experience that and
 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.940
yet watching him experience that and
trying to come to terms with things that

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950
trying to come to terms with things that
 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.180
trying to come to terms with things that
will happen or have happened gives him a

different perspective on his parents and

she's gonna be kind of cool and maybe I
should try to deal with that now and so

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510
should try to deal with that now and so
 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.360
should try to deal with that now and so
this is a movie that was very personal

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370
this is a movie that was very personal

so the material feels like it has more
 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.170
so the material feels like it has more
heart behind it because it's so close to

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130
sometimes the journey back and forth
 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.560
sometimes the journey back and forth
between time periods and then the

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570
between time periods and then the
 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.990

actually quite hilarious there are some

actually quite hilarious there are some
 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.670
actually quite hilarious there are some
very funny sequences but I think it

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680
very funny sequences but I think it
 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.830
very funny sequences but I think it
would have just benefitted from a little

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840
would have just benefitted from a little
 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.130
would have just benefitted from a little
more certainty about what the plot was

more certainty about what the plot was
doing early on because for a large

portion of the film I just assumed he

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190
portion of the film I just assumed he
 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.940
portion of the film I just assumed he
was using his imagination but then you

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950
was using his imagination but then you
 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.790
was using his imagination but then you
realize okay he's probably not and it

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800
realize okay he's probably not and it
 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.240

felt a bit like information was missing

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250
felt a bit like information was missing
 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.440
felt a bit like information was missing
sometimes to connect the past and future

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450
sometimes to connect the past and future
 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.350
sometimes to connect the past and future
and present scenes I think perhaps on a

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360
and present scenes I think perhaps on a
 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.150
and present scenes I think perhaps on a
second or even third viewing it might

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160
second or even third viewing it might
 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.550
second or even third viewing it might
improve a little bit even though this

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560
improve a little bit even though this
 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.360

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919
is more aimed towards younger audiences
 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.330

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500
tad too confusing for really young kids
 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.280
tad too confusing for really young kids
but I feel like a young kid who

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290
but I feel like a young kid who
