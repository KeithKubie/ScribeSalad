00:00:02.827 --> 00:00:06.686
Jobs at mills like this helped
shape the American dream and

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:09.607
created the modern American middle class.

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:11.992
And in their heyday, Pittsburgh steel and

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:15.450
Pittsburgh steel workers
were the envy of the world.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.130
Today's groundbreaking is a sign that
a new heyday is coming for Pittsburgh and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.160
for America.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.590
One that will transform and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.318
revive the American economy in
every corner of our great nation.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:30.350
By bringing together large
scale academic research and

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.320
industrial development under one roof,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.230
Mill 19 will become a true differentiator
for Pittsburgh and for the region.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.778
When complete,
it will be the first manufacturing

00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:44.140
hub of its kind in the nation,
in the world for that matter.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.558
Researchers and practitioners at ARM and

00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:52.310
MFI are quietly reshaping what goes
on inside factories and warehouses.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.800
The technologies that
emerge from this building

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.530
will have the power to make things in
a whole new way, to trigger a significant

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.670
resurgence of major economic
sector in the United States, and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.610
to assert our global leadership
in advanced manufacturing.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.170
&gt;&gt; I believe that robotics is key to the
US competitiveness in manufacturing and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.790
one of the major factors in the economic
prosperity of the United States.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.650
&gt;&gt; Through cooperation and
coordination of our industry partners and

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.450
Carnegie Mellon, which is truly one
of Pennsylvania's greatest assets and

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.960
a global pillar of research and
development.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.360
Our investment will help transform
an entire sector of the economy.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.810
We are here today because government,
federal, state and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.480
local recognize the potential
of this site of the region and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.780
of these partners to usher in a game
changing manufacturing renaissance.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.460
&gt;&gt; This site is envisioned as
a place where people will thrive,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.630
ideals will be forged.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.294
And this entire ecological condition of
the site will be regenerated over time.

00:01:54.294 --> 00:01:56.837
&gt;&gt; I would like to acknowledge
Pittsburgh's foundations.

00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:00.327
Especially Richard King Mellon Foundation,
the Heinz Endowments,

00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:03.070
and the Claude Worthington
Benedum Foundation.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.660
They had a vision and
a determination to pursue it for

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.010
more than 15 years in
the face of many challenges.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.556
Carnegie Mellon University
owes an additional debt of

00:02:13.556 --> 00:02:16.184
gratitude to the RK Mellon Foundation.

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:19.954
RK Mellon's gift to the university,

00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:24.863
helped catalyze ARM, helped launch our
manufacturing futures initiative, and

00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:28.220
helps support our participation
in this facility.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.680
&gt;&gt; Today we celebrate not only the future
of manufacturing, we celebrate

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.326
the rebirth of a great community,
the historic community of Hazelwood.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:43.027
And we understand that what
will happen in this building,

00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:47.721
just like it happened 100 years ago,
will forever change this world.
