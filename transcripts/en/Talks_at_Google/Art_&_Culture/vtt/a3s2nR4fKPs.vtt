00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.890
MARK SAAB: So I'm just
going to start this off

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.410
just with a general question
that kind of brings all of us

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.770
together and why we're all here.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.200
All of you as artists utilize
technology in different ways,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.830
whether it's social media to
get the word out about your art,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.330
whether it's distribution of
what you create, so can you

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.860
just touch upon, as an
artist, why is it important

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.710
for you to utilize technology?

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.260
And we can start with Yetunde
and move down this way.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.030
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Sure.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.340
I think one of the
primary ways, and I'm

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.850
sure of all of us agree, is
to be able to get the word out

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.090
about what you're doing.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.440
And also, on a deeper level,
to be able to connect to people

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.380
who are doing similar things.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.260
I think in my
practice, personally,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.500
I think moving
away from utilizing

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.990
social media and
technology only as a means

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.290
to market yourself is something
that I'm expanding upon.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.100
So trying to ask questions that
most people wouldn't see online

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.600
often.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.800
So a project that I recently
worked on and finished up

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.370
is asking 100 questions that
are really intentional questions

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.310
like, do you believe
in life after death?

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.860
Is there a deeper reason why
you're using this platform?

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.400
And it's called "I
want to know you"

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.640
and it's an Instagram
specific project.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.670
And I think it goes against
what I feel like a lot of people

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.950
use it for, which is a
real reason to utilize it,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.790
but specifically for talking
about what you're working on.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.850
So yeah, I think
that's important,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.130
to not only utilize it as a way
to talk about what you're doing

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.330
but also expand upon it
and be able to use it

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.995
in different interesting ways.

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:52.120
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: I concur.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.220
I think that's the
number one thing,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.040
is to get your projects
or your ideas out,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.582
definitely through
social networking.

00:02:01.582 --> 00:02:02.873
That's what it's called, right?

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:03.680
Social networking.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.290
So that's what you do.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.680
And being a part of growing
up with the changes,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.540
a lot of the young
kids is innovative.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.630
And it's like things can go
viral in a matter of seconds.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.380
I didn't know nothing
about "Bird Box."

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.970
I didn't have a clue.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.610
And it literally just
took over my whole life.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.050
And I knew when it came out
I was going to be tuned in,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.710
so those examples of just--

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.130
you just have to
utilize it and come up

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.480
with a plan within yourself.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.740
For me, that's what I did.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.990
I came up with a plan
within myself and my team

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.810
and said, look, if
we want to get things

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.120
out the way we want
them out, let's put out

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.420
the way we want to be put out.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.795
And that's a
platform to do that.

00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:54.260
So it was very helpful.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.710
FUZE THE MC: Yeah, I mean, they
all hit the nail on the head.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.500
I think in addition
to that, just

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.980
the ability to create
without a gatekeeper

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.030
is kind of a new thing
enabled by technology.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.820
No one in my family
comes from music.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.410
And there's always
a saying, you've

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.110
got to know somebody in
music to get into music.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.530
But I won't say technology has
opened those gates completely,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.980
but it's definitely put a
couple back doors in there.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.470
And the fact that I
don't have to wait

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.540
until I can get into a
million dollar studio

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.230
to get quality equipment, that's
an interface, a microphone,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.000
and a quiet space,
and you can make

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.150
a hit that catapults your life.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.380
And music was just
the first to feel it,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.440
but all of these
other industries

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.100
are starting to feel those
shifts where it's not just

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.710
that, oh, you had a lot of
money so you had the best

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.740
equipment, so we think
your stuff is the best.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.010
It's like now, you actually
have to provide ideas.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.830
And now that that
barrier is coming down,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.860
the people with the ideas,
or usually art people,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.030
are finally seeing
the shifts in it.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.720
And hopefully we can get some
of the value out of it as well.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.470
MARK SAAB: Even with
that, going off that,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.240
do you think that
there is anything

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.710
right now that makes black
creativity in this space

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.400
unique, from your perspective?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.170
So whether it's art,
whether it's filmmaking,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.590
or whether it's music, inventing
games, is there a certain--

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.470
are black artists
doing anything that

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.370
feels different or even
different from the way

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.070
that we've operated in the past?

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.620
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: I
mean, having a shared

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.000
experience of
being black I think

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.910
is a really unique thing, right?

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.370
That's something that
crosses that-- doesn't

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.800
exist within borders
or within any sort

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.860
of socioeconomic status.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.390
It has to do with just how you
are perceived by the world.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.920
And so I think that is a
really unique experience,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.070
being able to walk through
life knowing that somebody has

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.680
a similar, obviously
not the same,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.053
but a similar experience as you.

00:05:01.053 --> 00:05:02.470
And I think that
that is something

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.870
that's really amazing.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.880
And that if it is unique, it
has to do with the ability

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.317
to tap into that in some
capacity, if that make sense.

00:05:12.317 --> 00:05:14.400
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: Yeah,
it definitely makes sense.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.960
I think-- coming from
the inner city for me,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.930
I think that Richmond
taught me a lot

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.110
about these type of things.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.790
But I would say being
black is something

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.720
that you can't escape.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.303
So it's like when
you create something

00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:30.635
it's not about being the best
black thing I can create.

00:05:30.635 --> 00:05:32.510
It's about being the
best thing I can create,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.330
and that just comes with that
territory because I'm black.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.640
And I think that creating
things with people

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.140
of different
backgrounds, for me,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.490
was mind blowing and just dope.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.840
I mean, we all come from
different walks of life,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.330
but we can create
something in art.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.700
And I feel like whenever
we create anything,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.400
I think all of us want
to make something that's

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.160
thought provoking, where
you can-- it's timeless,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
it can last forever.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.240
And it's not afraid to
fail within doing that.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.990
And I think that's what can
get you to that next level.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.690
FUZE THE MC: And I
think also the diversity

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.950
within what it means to be a
black creative innately makes

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.420
it unique.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:28.360
Because we have traditionally
not had access to these tools.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.240
For some of these tools that
other cultures have been using

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.520
since the '60s and '70s in a
very, very major way, a lot

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.310
of those we're just now getting
into, and just now exploring

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.630
what it means for us.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.880
So like you said,
black people come

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.610
from all shades, all countries,
all religions, dialects,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.380
languages, all of
these different things.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.802
And the only thing that--

00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:57.760
not the only thing, but
some of the only things

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.250
that bind them together
is this shared experience.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.750
So in that case, it's kind of
unique from any other culture

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.713
because by its nature
it's super diverse.

00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:09.130
And I think we're
finally starting

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.030
to see the more diverse
aspects of the perspective

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.470
rather than this narrow
focused view behind what

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.090
the gatekeepers
saw in our culture.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.602
Now it's like, no, let me tell
you what's actually going on.

00:07:22.602 --> 00:07:25.060
Because there's actually people
who invent things, and make

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.210
movies, and do social
experiments, and you

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.700
really wouldn't even know that
unless you're deeply in it.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.100
It's not something that can
be observed from the outside.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.000
So I think those stories coming
to life are really unique,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.532
and I think there's a
lot of opportunity there.

00:07:40.532 --> 00:07:42.032
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU:
Well, black people

00:07:42.032 --> 00:07:43.120
have been doing that for--

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.440
we've been doing that forever.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.750
Like, we've been doing
that forever and having

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.590
really unique stories and diving
into this multiple dimensional

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.690
way of existing.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.000
And I guess I would
question, what do you

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.600
mean by having access to certain
technologies or certain things?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.680
Because I feel like--

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.160
I think of Sun Ra,
I think of people

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.580
who have been doing
experimental films and music

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.640
and being eccentric
and not being

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.110
this monolithic version of
blackness for a long time,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.205
right?

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.420
So-- yeah.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.878
FUZE THE MC: To answer that,
I was saying more specifically

00:08:20.878 --> 00:08:21.875
on quality levels.

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:22.220
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: OK.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.260
FUZE THE MC: I
think the content,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.760
and the ideas,
and the creatives,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.718
have always been there.

00:08:25.718 --> 00:08:26.677
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Yeah.

00:08:26.677 --> 00:08:27.987
FUZE THE MC: But it was like--

00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:29.570
I mean, and this is
for me personally.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.028
It felt like there
was a span where

00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:34.030
we had the golden
age of black film,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.760
and then after that,
the quality level just

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.419
went off a cliff where it
just turned into reality TV

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.200
as the only--

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.140
and what I mean by quality,
I mean 4K, Aria cameras,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.510
the things that give
credibility abroad.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.880
And a lot of those things
are coming back now

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.830
because people like
the retro views.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.160
But for a very long
time, the stamp

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.340
that made a movie
at the movie theater

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.100
amazing and the dude
on YouTube not amazing

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.560
was not because the
ideas were better.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.880
It was just around execution.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.500
It was like, oh, 3 point
lighting, there was HDMI input.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.390
All these Canon
lenses, the prices

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.100
have dropped dramatically.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.890
You can get a 5D
camera that shoots

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:27.490
the same quality as a 1990s
film that used to cost $60,000.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.550
So now that that's
not a barrier,

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.500
you can't just say,
oh, it's low quality.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.800
I think it gives a fair
chance for the stories

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.950
and the creatives to express
themselves on a real level.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.120
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: That's funny.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.800
It's funny because I finished
film school probably 2012.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.740
So I feel like that
was the biggest thing.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.250
Are you a filmmaker or are
you a digital filmmaker?

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.970
I'm like, what are
you talking about?

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.287
I'm a filmmaker.

00:09:54.287 --> 00:09:56.620
Well, you're not-- you're not
actually shooting on film.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.250
No, I'm shooting on
what's accessible

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.730
and what's going to be
able-- what I can use.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.070
Now, I think the gatekeeping
thing is a real thing at times.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.010
It was before because--

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.370
all right, you have an idea.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.610
OK, now what makes your idea
so separate from this person's

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.550
idea?

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:18.010
And man, how does that
idea get manifested?

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.010
And it's like,
well, one, I think

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.900
that we have to
make sure that we

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.910
are shooting for the quality.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.820
Because why are you
doing something just

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.390
to do it, just to be doing it?

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.170
I want to do it at the highest
level possible, whatever it is.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.770
Even if it's not
going to be good,

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.280
it was the highest level
that I had accessibility to.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.880
And I think that when
you're creating something,

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.562
that has to be in the
back of your mind.

00:10:43.562 --> 00:10:45.520
Do I just want to put
something out real quick?

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.870
Or do I want to make sure I
put every single effort that I

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.530
had at that time?

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.970
And I think that is what
gets you to do the research

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.760
and say, what's the difference
between 4K and film?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.470
And what's the
difference between this?

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.942
And finding that
information out.

00:11:00.942 --> 00:11:02.650
Because I had to go
through that struggle

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.080
and then when I
went through it, I

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.680
had to make peace
within myself and say,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.210
all right, I'm cool with
making the Arias, and the Reds,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.790
and these 5Ds.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.967
And they do shoot well.

00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:16.300
But I always tell somebody
it's the chef in the kitchen,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.530
it's also the shooter.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.790
It's not just a camera.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.320
Don't rely so much
on the camera.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.940
Rely on yourself.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.740
And that's what's
going to make it dope.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.235
FUZE THE MC: For sure.

00:11:26.235 --> 00:11:26.860
MARK SAAB: So--

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.970
Yeah, thank you.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.655
Please, please.

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:31.780
And that's to all of y'all.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.363
There were so many
dimensions to that.

00:11:33.363 --> 00:11:34.880
That was beautiful.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.297
Actually, I kind of want to
stay on this for a little bit,

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:40.480
because I actually had
this same thought as I was

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.300
thinking about this subject.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.340
When I was growing up,
I think it was probably

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:51.008
at the height of this, quote
unquote, "trash television"

00:11:51.008 --> 00:11:52.050
that we're talking about.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:57.820
So "Flavor of Love," "I Love New
York," "Real Chance to Love,"

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.570
I can go on.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.200
Obviously, I watched all
of these religiously.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.800
But to be honest, that, for
the lack of a better word,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.900
that was a lot of
the black television

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.810
that I was exposed
to, that I had just

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:16.870
being a kid that was sneaking
watching BET and VH1, right?

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.410
And so I guess my question
is, now, if you look at it--

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.410
and I'm black really
excited for this generation

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.410
that we have in the crowd
of high school students

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.910
to think about.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.330
What they see on TV are shows
like "Atlanta," "Insecure,"

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.400
"Blackish," right?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.992
There's this whole
other gammut that

00:12:35.992 --> 00:12:37.450
runs from everything
to what people

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.590
would consider safe to what
people would consider raunchy.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.060
My real question now is, do
you think this is a trend,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.940
or is this going to be the
future of black creativity,

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.787
especially as it involves
mainstream television?

00:12:54.787 --> 00:12:56.620
So Diaunte, you can
answer that first, being

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.743
our filmmaker expertise here.

00:13:00.743 --> 00:13:02.660
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: I don't
know about all that,

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.360
but I would say this.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.880
I was very against
reality TV as somebody

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.560
that started off from 7
years ago acting, going

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.470
to acting schools, learning,
putting on that grit and grind,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.970
and I'm like, yo,
I did all this.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.240
And now it's just
like, yo, it's a boom

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.520
and you don't have to act.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.695
I'm like, wait a minute.

00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:21.820
What are you talking about?

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.300
So I battled that for a while.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.700
But then I had to
realize something

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.470
and I want everybody
to take this.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.790
There's room for everything,
including nonsense.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:38.950
Because what's your cup
of tea might not be mine.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:39.890
And that's OK.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.580
We live in a diverse,
innovative world now.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.850
It took me a while to
understand that growing up.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.500
If you want to watch your "Love
&amp; Hip Hops," hey, I might not.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.770
But that's your thing.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.270
That's what drives you.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.820
But I'm always going to ask why.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.820
But don't just disclude
the scripted television,

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.480
because a lot of hard
work went into that.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.450
It's a lot of rehearsals,
it's a lot of--

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.560
the way things--

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.390
I'm going to give an example.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.070
The "Black Panther"
craze was amazing.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.220
Ryan Coogler and I
are great friends.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.810
And the thing about it is--

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.660
a lot of people
don't know this--

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.410
is that when you have
a gift or something,

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.390
I think your gift will
make room for you.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.577
Because he was a
football player.

00:14:22.577 --> 00:14:23.910
A lot of people don't know that.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.620
So now he's starting to
use his creative mind

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.150
to write his ideas out.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.420
And when you watch on
screen, it started with him

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.100
just in his room writing.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.930
So does that mean that people
not tuned into "Love &amp; Hip Hop"

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.530
whether it's Miami or--

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.850
I don't know where they at now.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.890
But I'm saying it doesn't mean
they're not tuned into that.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.410
But definitely,
those same people

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.600
came out to go see
that movie as well,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.960
and everything in between.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:58.663
So definitely, I think
that it's all great.

00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:00.080
It's just about
how you consume it

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.925
and what you want it to consume.

00:15:01.925 --> 00:15:04.350
So that's from my perspective.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.912
FUZE THE MC: Yeah,
I agree with you.

00:15:06.912 --> 00:15:09.120
I mean, we have the discussion
in music all the time.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.860
It's the same thing.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.618
But I think the problem comes
when there's no balance, when

00:15:14.618 --> 00:15:16.160
it's like you're
flicking through all

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.280
these black channels
and all these networks,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.700
and it's like the sa--

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.718
and not even to not
reality, TV the whole genre.

00:15:23.718 --> 00:15:25.760
Because I think there are
some interesting things

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.540
that have been and
can be done there.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.950
But I'm saying
specifically, put to people

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.660
who are not going to get along
and let's watch what happens.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.630
And I think that it
can be entertaining.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.360
I've caught myself
pulled into the drama.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.620
So I can see the value in it.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.453
But I think of it more
like candy in that sense.

00:15:44.453 --> 00:15:45.620
It's like, oh, it was great.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.162
It felt good.

00:15:46.162 --> 00:15:48.890
But then how did you
feel, really, afterwards?

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:52.230
How do you feel about yourself
seeing the people on there?

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.050
What does it do for
your mental psyche

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.330
and what you see about
yourself in the future?

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.890
And I think a lot of people
just write it off as, oh, it's

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:01.990
just entertainment.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.448
I think that's a
degree, but if you

00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:05.900
watch anything for
10 hours a week,

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.983
it has some effect on you.

00:16:06.983 --> 00:16:08.192
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: Absolutely.

00:16:08.192 --> 00:16:09.027
Absolutely.

00:16:09.027 --> 00:16:10.860
FUZE THE MC: And that's
consuming any media.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.220
So I think it's just
like any other diet,

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.670
you have to pick and choose.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.720
And I think to
use that metaphor,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.550
we used that food deserts.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.530
But now we have platforms
that can financially

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.030
hold that kind of content.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.420
Because in their defense,
TV has a very strict way

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.470
it makes money.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.548
So the way it makes
money is by eyeballs.

00:16:32.548 --> 00:16:34.090
And if they see the
numbers going up,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.960
it's like, oh, OK,
well, people will binge

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.580
watch nonsense for 10 hours.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.600
So as long as we can put
ads between that, it's good.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.590
When you have different
business models like YouTube,

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.640
and Netflix, and
HBO, who I would

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.160
say have different ways of
extracting that revenue,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.060
it creates more opportunities.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.880
So I don't think it's a fad.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.290
I just hope that the
creators in this new system

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:04.130
will find the
leverage and footing

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.161
that we never quite really
got under the old system.

00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:08.119
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: True.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.140
FUZE THE MC:
Because I don't want

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.640
it to be a scenario
where it's like,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.652
yeah, that was super dope.

00:17:12.652 --> 00:17:14.110
We're going to give
you two seasons

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.480
and then we're cutting that out.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.897
And I've seen a
lot of that, where

00:17:16.897 --> 00:17:19.910
it's, like, build up
on the buzz of having

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.210
this huge all black cast and
get everyone super excited,

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:28.880
they get the social earned
media from all of our stuff,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.100
and then as soon as that
dies down it's like, well,

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.390
it wasn't doing exactly
what it was doing

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.190
when it came so let's
just pull the plug

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.020
and try something else.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.350
Whereas I see some other
shows get a lot more leniency.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:44.690
So I think it's still about
finding some kind of ownership

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.280
and control.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.660
I don't mean necessarily
financial ownership,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.450
but at least the leverage
to be able to say,

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.800
no, I wanted this film with this
character playing in this role,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.030
and this is why I
wanted it that way.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.990
So do this.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.130
And as long as people
have their production

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.140
budgets held over their head,
that's used as leverage.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.650
I don't necessarily know
if it can be sustained.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.370
I hope so.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.020
MARK SAAB: Yeah, for sure.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.070
And I would love for you to
address this question, too.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.950
And if you could also
address it from the stance

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.190
of this huge explosion in
interest in black art recently,

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.770
especially since the whole
Kerry James Marshall historic--

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.650
all of that.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:29.070
So can you touch upon that as
well and from your perspective,

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.680
how this really massive surge
and interest in black art

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.880
from a lot of new people--

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.180
what do you think about that
and how that impacts you?

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.200
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Sure.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.920
I think going into it,
and this whole situation

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.780
with a form of
criticality, being

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.590
critical of what is being
consumed, is necessary.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.760
I think a lot of what I'm
seeing right now in black art

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.700
is really exciting.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.400
I think a lot of
people are sifting

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.280
through a lot of black
trauma almost, and wanting

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.780
to sift through
that in a way that's

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.400
respectful to all different
kinds of black people.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.500
The problem that-- not problem,
but the worry that I have is

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.770
that it almost seems like--

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.080
I'm sorry to use this word
in front of high schoolers,

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.120
but it seems like
black trauma porn.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.170
It seems like a lot of--

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.890
I worry that a lot of curators
and a lot of these historically

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.910
white institutions are
consuming black art

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.250
in a way that is
consistently having

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:37.610
it be in relationship to white
supremacy and black pain.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.720
And I think moments where
I find more exciting

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.290
are these moments where
people are taking media--

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.790
film I'm thinking of "Random
Acts of Flyness"-- yeah,

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.210
which is a really
interesting, and dynamic,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.460
and non-linear form of
storytelling, and filmmaking,

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.550
and video making, that I
think does not put black pain

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.000
and white supremacy at the
center and focal point of its

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.200
narrative.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.660
And I think that
that is often even

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.890
having to do with reality TV.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.530
I mean, why is that
so popular, right?

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.650
I think that that has a lot to
do with witnessing black pain

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.310
and struggle.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.760
And so again, it's entertaining.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.510
I will not lie.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.087
I am watching "Love &amp;
Hip Hop: Miami" right now

00:20:27.087 --> 00:20:28.920
and I'm waiting for the
episode to come out.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.240
But also, I consume that in a
way where I'm saying, OK, cool.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.220
This is something
that I'm not going

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:41.370
to let anybody tell me
defines black people in mass.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.950
I'm going to make sure that
when I watch that, I'm like, OK,

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.240
I'm watching this critically.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.670
VH1 is making a lot of
money off of this series.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.490
They've been doing it
for a very long time.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.980
And I think it's all
about having balance.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.830
I think it's all about
recognizing the power dynamic

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.640
and structures within
these institutions.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.520
And I think that applies for
film and music and art as well.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.560
MARK SAAB: Thank you.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.940
So I want to stay
with this conversation

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.820
because what you just said
makes such great points.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:14.490
And I think an example of
the exact opposite of what

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.460
we'll call trauma porn, I
love that term actually,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.942
is your exhibition
which has just opened--

00:21:20.942 --> 00:21:21.900
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Yeah.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:22.900
MARK SAAB: --at SOMArts.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.030
So congratulations on that.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.420
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Thank you.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:24.832
DIAUNTE THOMPSON:
Congratulations.

00:21:24.832 --> 00:21:25.656
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Thank you.

00:21:25.656 --> 00:21:26.489
MARK SAAB: Yes, yes.

00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:28.230
So your exhibition,
"Forever, a Moment:

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:32.740
Black Meditations on Time and
Space" can you get into that?

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.170
Can you kind of just talk about
the title and what that means?

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.062
And how do black identities
think about time and space?

00:21:41.062 --> 00:21:42.520
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU:
Yeah, definitely.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.720
So "Forever, a Moment: Black
Meditations on Time and Space"

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.450
is a show of 13 black artists.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.840
It's at SOMArts which
is in San Francisco.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.890
And it's part of the
curatorial residency where

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.460
they bring on
curators, or people

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.590
who aren't curators who want
to curate, into the space.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.430
It's a really big space,
like 3,000 plus square feet.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.850
And the whole premise and
decision making with me

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.870
and my co-curator,
Kevin Daye, was

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:15.060
to put black experience
and collective black memory

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.370
at the forefront of
the gallery experience.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.530
So a lot of times, like I was
saying, black pain and trauma

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.242
is often the focal point
of a lot of artwork

00:22:25.242 --> 00:22:27.700
that I'm seeing right now in
a lot of curatorial decisions,

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.880
which is disappointing.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.730
And what we decided
to do is we decided

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.920
to make sure that
expanding on blackness

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.890
and making sure that it's not
associated with a monolith,

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.480
like some sort of weird
black canon where it's always

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.970
about our relationship
to whiteness,

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.338
which is not the case.

00:22:49.338 --> 00:22:50.130
We're so much more.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.210
We're expansive.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.470
We've been here for forever.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.940
We're always making.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.170
And so really trying to put
that resiliency and innovation

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.360
into the gallery space--

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.435
and thinking about
how oftentimes,

00:23:02.435 --> 00:23:03.810
when you're going
into a gallery,

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.853
you're just there
to consume the work.

00:23:05.853 --> 00:23:07.770
And you're not actually
engaging with the work

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.650
and having to think about it
critically, step over it, get

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.800
into it, make yourself smaller
or make yourself larger

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.680
within the space.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.880
And so thinking about non-linear
time and thinking about how we

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.770
experience black art--

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.790
so we spent a lot of time
thinking about the layout.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.300
Almost nothing is on the walls,
which is really different.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.990
I'm sure with gallery people you
know this is really different.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.390
And also making a
living-- the thing

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.570
that I really enjoy the most
about the "Forever a Moment"

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.660
space is we have a living
room space in the back

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.940
that has Kevin and I's family
photos, a lot of books,

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.900
and media, and blackazines,
which I think a lot of people

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.370
don't think a lot about of how
our experiences are actually

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.450
archived and how they're
living beyond us.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.790
And that's what I think is
super interesting about music

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.310
and film and how
they intersect, is

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:03.840
that it is an archiving tool.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.880
It is how we are
going to be perceived

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.952
for future generations
longer down the line.

00:24:07.952 --> 00:24:10.410
And that's why I think cultural
production for black people

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.900
is so important and making
sure that all the stories are

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.580
included, as many
stories as possible

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.800
are included in the canon.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.633
Because I think it
does us justice.

00:24:18.633 --> 00:24:19.550
MARK SAAB: Definitely.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.925
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU:
Yeah, anyways--

00:24:20.925 --> 00:24:27.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.210
MARK SAAB: So Lance,
so I really want

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:38.000
to ask you this whole idea
of being a game inventor.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.440
And why is it important to
you that a game inventor

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.480
comes from the culture?

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.790
And along with
that, can you also

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.820
tell me some of your
future plans for the game

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.510
and how you plan to utilize
technology with what

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.000
you've already created?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.170
FUZE THE MC: Yeah, for sure.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.740
I think for the culture,
every title is important.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:08.210
I think the fact that black
game inventor is not a norm.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.280
It's part of the problem, right?

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.450
Because there's lots of black
people, all people love games,

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.260
so it's just a
natural occurrence.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.030
And it goes back to the fact
that a lot of our perspectives

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.270
haven't been shown yet.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.120
And there's a mass
saturation of everything else

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.330
to the point where we're
forced to consume even

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:36.500
our own content and stories
through the lens of people

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.200
who are not necessarily
in our culture.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.550
And what that leads to
is one of two things.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:45.080
Either a great
story that is skewed

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.380
through a weird lens, or
it's like a terrible story

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.050
that isn't accurate at all.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.750
And I think there are
exceptions to that rule, where

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.080
things have married up
nicely, but they're usually

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:57.980
the exception.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.070
I mean, even with
Fortnite, and then putting

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:06.590
all the dances in
the video game,

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.960
I honestly don't think
that was malicious.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.280
I think it was just--

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.200
there's that far of a disconnect
between the person who

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.770
created that dance and the
person who did the mo cap

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.910
and put it in there, that
it wasn't even a thought.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:28.550
And those kinds of presences are
the only way those things even

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.940
get brought up.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.440
I think a lot of this
is really systematic.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.800
And to be fair, for a lot
of the game companies,

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.010
it's a new, weird thing.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.640
Kevin Durant is a 6'7" person
who plays from all over

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.630
the field.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.370
I'm sure for coaches
originally, it

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.980
was like, put him as a center.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.770
A lot of times these people just
don't know how to engage with--

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.140
don't know there are black
game inventors who want

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.160
to have their things out there.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.970
So I think that's part of why
our mission at Cool Black Games

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.990
is really, really important.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.010
And it's not necessarily
games just for black people,

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.140
but just created
from our perspective

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.000
and in the hip hop culture.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.880
Because hip hop culture
is black culture,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.700
and it's the biggest culture
in the world right now.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.410
And we're just now
getting the statistics

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.110
to back it up with streaming
numbers and all that stuff,

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.060
but we've known for a while now.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.790
And that means that someone is
going to fulfill that demand.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.910
And historically,
it hasn't been us.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:32.350
So I really want to make
sure that we at least have

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:35.390
our hat in the ring
to be considered

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:40.490
for these opportunities, and
grants, and collaborations.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:43.460
And for the meme
game specifically,

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.250
going to that point,
it's about scale.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.170
That's our next point.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.260
We have a really niche loyal
following who loves our game.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.180
We have consistent sales.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.490
We found product
market fit, so now it's

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.970
about how we scale it
as humanly possible.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.410
I mean, scale it as fast
as humanly possible.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.810
And before, we were using--

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.880
it's a traditional card game.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.270
But now we've got to be
bringing those experiences

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.060
to the internet, and
to your handheld phone,

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.642
and to live experiences
through technology.

00:28:14.642 --> 00:28:16.100
I wish I could talk
about specifics

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.642
on how that's going
to happen, but we

00:28:17.642 --> 00:28:19.640
have some pretty cool
rollouts coming out

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.280
that we'll make sure to
keep everybody in on.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.470
MARK SAAB: Yeah, thank you.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.640
And so continuing
with Diaunte, can you

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.210
touch upon some of
the voids in media

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.250
that you're fulfilling,
especially with your role over

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.400
at Beastmode Productions?

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.500
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.810
We're attacking everything.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.430
That's what we're doing.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.300
We're not-- there's
nothing we can't do.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.770
The word "no" is like a
figment of imagination

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.980
at Beastmode Productions.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.850
We have somebody that's, like--
when I came to Marshawn Lynch

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.300
to say, look, let's create
a production company,

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.108
it wasn't let's figure
out the particulars,

00:29:05.108 --> 00:29:06.650
let's see how we're
going to do this.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.670
It was, all right.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.800
The next day, we got
a production company.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:18.150
And I think that's important,
is to press play on those ideas.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:23.160
I felt like it was the best
thing to represent our film.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.710
Our first film, coming from
"A Hundred Blocks" was--

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:30.610
it was made for
and by the people.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.380
We didn't have any name actors.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.827
We broke the lines of what
we were saying earlier about,

00:29:36.827 --> 00:29:38.410
you've got to have
four names attached

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.842
to a project for
that project to sell.

00:29:41.842 --> 00:29:43.300
So when they are
looking at things,

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.670
they're looking at like,
OK, well, wait a minute.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.240
So you make this movie.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.968
Who do you have in it?

00:29:50.968 --> 00:29:52.730
I got Robert Jordan.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.308
Who is that?

00:29:54.308 --> 00:29:56.020
He's a wonderful actor.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:00.190
I cast him.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.780
I cast it--

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.470
It's funny man.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.250
It's so funny.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.470
This is a true story.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.950
I was in film school and I
used to watch "Entourage"

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.110
all the time, all the time.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:16.780
And I had actually
said, oh, this is dope.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.480
They're showing you how the
actors' really lifestyle is.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.690
And I said, well, what if
I did that about hip hop,

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.500
especially in the Bay Area with
the independent scene of music?

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.780
And I said, oh, I'm
going to cast Mo Green.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.650
He's a great actor.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.500
I'm going to cast Daveed
Diggs, who's now blew up.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.400
But he was that
when I casted him.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.800
I just knew he was loud,
he had long, big hair,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.260
and I knew he was the man.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.580
So as we filmed this project,
I said, this is dope.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.970
So as time went by-- that
was almost 7, 8 years ago.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.560
Time went by.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.110
That was my calling card
to get in these rooms.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.330
And I'm looking
for the acceptance

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.903
to say, hey, I can do this.

00:30:56.903 --> 00:30:57.820
And look how it looks.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.100
It's quality.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:30:59.880
Everything's done.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.020
The editing is done right.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.330
And they're still like,
oh yeah, this is cool.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.540
But we need more.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:12.210
So I was like, what is the
disconnect between my idea

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.590
and what you guys want?

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.530
But I'm looking at the
actors is blowing up from it.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.840
I'm like, OK.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.720
But then I start to see, with
"A Hundred Blocks" I was like,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.870
well, you know, I'm going to
do everything opposite of what

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.838
the status quo was.

00:31:26.838 --> 00:31:29.130
And we're going to make this
movie black and white even

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.860
though we have the capabilities
to make it in color.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.133
Yeah, we're going to have all
the cast members be local.

00:31:35.133 --> 00:31:37.050
Yeah, I'll be holding
them to a high standard.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.675
I did make them do
a lot of rehearsals,

00:31:38.675 --> 00:31:40.530
I did make them do
a lot of things,

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:44.790
but I was challenging
who they already were.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.760
I was like, you can do this.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.615
And when they start
to understand that,

00:31:48.615 --> 00:31:53.010
and we made this film,
for us to win a grand jury

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:57.120
award in Oakland was big
because I remember Jay-Z saying,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.540
if you can make it in the Bay
Area with any type of art,

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.908
music, whatever, oh, you're
good everywhere else.

00:32:02.908 --> 00:32:05.200
I didn't understand that
because they're the first ones

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.440
to go and say, this is wack.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.360
This is wack.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.530
So that's what we thrived on.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.590
We don't have any limitations.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.875
We did do it in a variety space.

00:32:15.875 --> 00:32:17.750
So we did add a touch
into the reality world,

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.290
but we did it in our way.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.240
We wanted to show you
our reality of what

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.040
we would do hanging out.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.450
We didn't want to put it
on this type of standards.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.385
We got kids around us on a day
to day basis that are always

00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:32.760
looking for the
next thing that's

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.000
going to help them be better.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.940
So that's why I'm like,
we don't have no rules.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.010
We don't have no rules.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:42.450
The only rule we have is to see
it through, and be creative,

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.760
and be the best you you
can be in that project.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.100
We're good with it.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.040
MARK SAAB: Yeah.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.110
So all of you have
really touched

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.800
on this idea of
challenging the status quo

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.260
and breaking the mold
of what's expected.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.890
Can you touch upon where
that comes from for you

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.900
and where that attitude comes?

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.600
Is it someone in your family who
inspired you to be like that?

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.450
Is there an artist
that you just look up

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.120
to that really made
you say, OK, yeah,

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.640
[INAUDIBLE] what I want to do.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.280
So yeah, can we start over here?

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.020
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: How are
y'all going to answer this?

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.333
I mean, I don't--

00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:21.000
I think people--

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.300
MARK SAAB: Is it in you?

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.800
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU:
--it just happens.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.480
I'm sure-- I mean, we all might
have people that would really

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.740
inspire us and push us.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.430
And I could list
the many people who

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.190
have encouraged me to
do more and push myself,

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.460
but I think it just has to--

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.645
it's a decision you make.

00:33:38.645 --> 00:33:40.020
It's a decision
you make that you

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:46.050
want to be critical and
self aware of what you can

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:50.730
do and push yourself to
make things that are better

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:54.840
or to help somebody else make
things, or be creative, or find

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.790
their voice, or be able
to express in a way

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.037
that they haven't
been able to before.

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:00.870
And I think it comes--
for me personally, it

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.390
comes from a desire to
be able to free myself

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:12.480
from any sort of societal
pressure or obligations.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.270
And I think that that's
a form of liberation,

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.560
especially for black people.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.290
So being able to instill
that within myself,

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.020
being able to see that
within other people,

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.429
and being able to
support anybody

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:26.699
I can to free
themselves from that

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:29.770
and liberate themselves in
that way, I think, is powerful.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:34.080
And that's the driving
force behind any of that.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.469
FUZE THE MC: I
mean, to your point,

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:43.739
status quo is in itself
inauthentic because people

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:46.080
are not one thing.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.580
So whenever you're trying to--

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.520
especially something
as multifaceted

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.600
as art, where the core of it
is that you are expressing

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.960
some unique
perspective, for me, I

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.790
had a really revelation
moment when I was in college.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:08.270
I made a song that was really
popular and really trash,

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.750
in my opinion.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:13.310
It was a song that I would have
lots of people sing it back,

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.930
and then I would feel
like a terrible person

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.160
at the end of it, you know?

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.510
And I think that kind of
feeling, a lot of artists,

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.840
not just in music,
just art in general,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.420
will tuck it for
the praise, but then

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.700
that feeling you get
about yourself when

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.240
you get that praise is not the
same as when you do something

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.697
you know is authentic,
and creative, and varied.

00:35:35.697 --> 00:35:36.780
And then someone loves it.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.150
But then you feel like,
oh, this person really--

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.560
it's almost like they love me.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.610
You know what I mean?

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.377
But if it's something
that's like a bastardization

00:35:44.377 --> 00:35:46.710
of something that came out
of you, you're just like, oh,

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.530
but that's-- you like that
thing, but that's not me.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.250
So it creates this
weird dynamic.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.530
And for me, I'll say I had--

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.590
specifically with Blu.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.250
At the time, Blu had
been a XXL freshman,

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.255
which was a really
big deal back then.

00:36:04.255 --> 00:36:05.130
You know what I mean?

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.210
That was, like, the list.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.100
When you're on that list, you're
like, OK, you're in hip hop.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.790
That was your co-sign.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:15.300
So I had a lot of respect for
him, and I just did poetry

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.060
but I never really
expressed it out

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.570
like that because that wasn't
what people looked to me for.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:25.030
Because I worked computers,
and all that stuff.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.090
And when I rapped for
him, he was like, yo,

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.920
this is really dope.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.030
This is really dope.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.590
He sent me a beat the next day.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.360
I was still in high
school at this time.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.320
You know what I mean?

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.320
To me, he still is in my eyes
one of the best lyricists that

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.400
ever done it.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.055
And just getting that--

00:36:42.055 --> 00:36:43.930
it probably didn't even
mean anything to him.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:45.960
I have even kept close
conversation with him,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.390
but that moment where he
just sent me that beat

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.740
and he was like, this dude in
XXL sent me a beat for my raps.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.690
I got skills.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.360
And just that little
amount was like, OK,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.010
no matter what anyone else
says, man, Blu sent me a beat,

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.600
so y'all can't tell me nothing.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.990
And having those
little things are

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.180
super important to keeping
that authenticity when

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.710
it gets tough.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.840
Those little moments
you can grab on that

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.420
let you know who you
are at the purist times,

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.730
before the money's involved,
before the opinions,

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.100
and everyone else gets
their hands into it,

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.335
how you really feel about it.

00:37:21.335 --> 00:37:23.460
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: I agree
with a lot that you said.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:29.832
I mean, honestly, I don't
believe in realistic.

00:37:29.832 --> 00:37:33.103
And that's my driving force.

00:37:33.103 --> 00:37:33.770
I'm an underdog.

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:36.110
I've always been the underdog.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.472
I'm still-- people's crazy.

00:37:37.472 --> 00:37:39.680
Still, people are like, oh,
you do this, you do that.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.680
I'm like, I don't see
myself at that, at times,

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.490
being honest and transparent.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.190
But that come from
my background.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.380
I grew up in an inner city.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.420
I grew up in the hood.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.190
I watched people leave
this world in front of me.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:59.990
So for me, time and realistic
is like two things that are--

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.910
been poured into me and
a lot of individuals.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.880
It's no such thing as
realistic in my mind

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.660
because all you're saying is
that, yeah, I have an idea,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:13.070
but somebody told me along
the way I can't do that.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.340
And I feel like if
you listen to that,

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.810
you will never get to
your full potential.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:19.520
You will never--

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.000
I don't care who you
are, where you're from,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.920
you don't have to
go with the fad.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.880
Oh, they're making
this type right now,

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.330
so you have to do that.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.500
Because then you could
find yourself in a box.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.950
So realistic-- always have
the plan A, never the plan

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.260
B. Everything you do in the
plan A. If it is a plan B,

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.513
it will take you
there on its own.

00:38:39.513 --> 00:38:41.930
You don't have to be like,
well, if this doesn't work out,

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.470
you're starting to put these
weird things in your head,

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.720
and you start to
question everything.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.830
And that's-- the young
people I see in this room,

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.610
it's no limit with this.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:53.420
It's no limit.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.100
It's no-- you're limitless.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.965
You have a superpower inside
of you that is driving you.

00:38:58.965 --> 00:39:00.840
The fact that you woke
up today, you're good.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.090
You got the purpose in you.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.100
And you can't let
any one or anybody--

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:09.400
because who's to tell you
that that idea was never

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.240
going to transfer?

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.320
But I will say this
to add to your point.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.400
You said make sure--

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.600
you said people love me.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.183
You start to feel
like people love me.

00:39:18.183 --> 00:39:20.920
If you make something because
you like what somebody else is

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.585
doing, you becoming a copy.

00:39:22.585 --> 00:39:23.210
And guess what?

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.000
They're going to want that from
you every time if it takes off.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.360
If that's not
authentically who you are,

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.250
you're literally making a copy.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.690
And guess what?

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.490
I know several friends of mine
that does music and everything,

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:35.923
and they're stuck in that box.

00:39:35.923 --> 00:39:37.840
They keep wanting this
from me, but I'm really

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.870
trying to do this.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.380
Now, I don't want that from
you because that one thing that

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.493
was fake popped off, now
you gotta stick to that.

00:39:43.493 --> 00:39:45.160
And now you're starting
to find yourself

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.585
going through depression
even when the money comes.

00:39:48.585 --> 00:39:50.210
I don't move-- I
don't chase the money.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:51.270
I chase the passion.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:52.530
The money is just going
to be the principal.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.320
It'll be there.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.480
But I don't-- I don't
chase not one dollar.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.980
I'm going to chase
the fact that I'm

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.310
investing in people, the people
that I see right here that

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.890
are innovators, the people I
see out here that's innovators.

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.230
I'm chasing that.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.930
What's-- what's about you
that makes it differently?

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.410
And I'm cool with that.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.360
And if it fails, so what?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.070
Keep going.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.700
MARK SAAB: Fail the way
that you want it to fail.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.270
DIAUNTE THOMPSON:
It took me 7 years

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.350
to make my first
movie with no money.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.100
I did it with no funding, none.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.670
I just communicated, I showed
people my passion, and what

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.180
I wanted, and we made it.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:23.800
And it's out.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.910
You can go and buy that.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.140
It's tangible.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:26.810
So guess what?

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.450
Nobody can't tell me anything.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:31.484
And nobody can tell you
guys anything as well.

00:40:31.484 --> 00:40:34.316
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:38.563 --> 00:40:40.980
MARK SAAB: Just because you
just recently talked about it,

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.660
Diaunte, and I do want
to know specifically--

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:49.500
because I come from
similar backgrounds

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.000
from the east coast.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.540
But I would love to know how
you feel coming from where

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.270
you come from in Richmond.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.050
How you feel that that's really
shaped the way that you make

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:06.050
decisions as a filmmaker
but also as an entrepreneur

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:08.470
in your own way as well?

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.500
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: Be willing to
accept the things that I cannot

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.480
change, is the biggest thing.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.880
Because it's hard.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.320
It's a lot of people that
deals with daily struggles.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.150
They got to test every facet
of it, from growing up,

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:29.470
my mom being a functional
drug addict, to my stepdad

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.360
being one of the
biggest drug dealers,

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.690
and me knowing what I
didn't want from my life.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:36.730
That was definitely
something I'm like--

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:37.690
but I felt normal.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.910
So when you talked
about trauma--

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:42.400
because all you see-- but you
don't even know it's trauma

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.253
because it feels normal to you.

00:41:44.253 --> 00:41:45.670
And then you start
to look at it--

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.980
you start to normalize
your situation, which

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.560
a lot of people that I grew up
with, sometimes you get stuck.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.050
So I think that those traumas,
I was the reason why my mom--

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:57.730
I was the human TV guide.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:58.680
What's this?

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.710
Oh, man, I'm watching
Showtime and HBO as a kid.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.420
Not cartoons always.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.940
So I'm looking at the Joy
Luck Club at 7 years old

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.690
and I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.830
But I know I'm intrigued
on this lifestyle.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.660
So I think for me
as a filmmaker,

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.080
it was already embedded in that
purpose because of that trauma.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.000
Because I wanted to escape.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.120
And then when I dealt
with it on my own,

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.610
and dealt with that
trauma, and realized

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.960
that I was going through
that and admitted that,

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.840
I realized like, oh,
man, these stories.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.930
These stories that can get
out, like I said earlier,

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:35.750
is limitless.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.880
So I think that's what shaped
me is my neighborhood--

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.460
I wouldn't be nowhere
without Richmond.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.030
Because if I grew
up anywhere else,

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.040
I wouldn't have this
perspective on life that

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.670
can help the next person up.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.970
And my goal is to help
the next person up.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:52.850
Period.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.370
MARK SAAB: Yeah.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:58.660
So this whole process has
been really dope for me

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.020
because for all of
you in different ways,

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:07.060
at different parts of my life,
I've been deeply obsessed with

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:11.980
the content that you've created,
without necessarily personally

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.930
knowing y'all.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:19.060
For me, the earliest
one is Lance.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:23.080
So I was a really big part
of hip hop message boards

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:27.130
and forums when they were
pretty much like what

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.910
were the pre-social media,
especially for artists.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:34.240
And Lance, your work
and the type of stuff

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.700
that you were creating
just stood out so much.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.940
And I mean, it stood out
amongst great, great rappers.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.220
I mean, people like Drake
were a part of these forums

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.970
that we were a part of
and were active members

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:47.950
in sharing music.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:51.280
And so with that, I
really just wanted

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:56.040
to ask you to touch
upon the projects

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.450
that you do, just being
a digital strategist,

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:02.860
and how being so involved in hip
hop but also at the same time

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.530
being a digital native
have kind of got you

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:07.063
to where you are today.

00:44:07.063 --> 00:44:08.230
FUZE THE MC: Yeah, for sure.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.900
I mean, my start in
digital strategy,

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.650
which I'm pretty sure
was just a made up phrase

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.890
when I first started
using it, was

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:21.260
I had no intentions to
be a digital strategist.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.950
I was trying to pitch
my music to a dude named

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:27.100
Brian Calhoun, who at the
time was the chief operating

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.580
officer at Good Music.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.290
MARK SAAB: Which is
Kanye's record label.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.082
FUZE THE MC: Which is
Kanye's record label.

00:44:33.082 --> 00:44:35.410
So I was like, oh, this
dude works for Kanye.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.120
He's going to sign me.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.350
So he came to our school at
Howard and I gave him a CD.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:42.930
He's like-- for
those who don't know,

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.040
a chief operating officer
does not sign people.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.410
In fact, that's probably
as far away from that

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:48.830
as they could possibly get.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:49.810
But I didn't know that.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:53.050
So I gave him a CD and he
actually listened to it.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:54.910
He was like, oh,
this is really dope.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.140
Who did your design work?

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.360
I was like, oh, I did that.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.235
Who did your website?

00:44:58.235 --> 00:44:58.960
Like, I did it.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.835
He was like, well, I'm
not going to sign you,

00:45:00.835 --> 00:45:02.720
but you want to come
work on this project?

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.940
And you want to get a check?

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.720
And I was like, yeah.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.780
The first project that I
kind of piggybacked on,

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.160
one of the first ones
was like Drake's release

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.740
of "Best I Ever Had."

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.430
It's not even news now, but
it went straight to iTunes

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.490
while negotiations
were still going on.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:26.920
And I saw the power
from the other side

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.480
that, oh, these digital
strategies and ideas

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.960
I've been using to
build my own career up

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.850
without having
any connections, I

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:35.650
saw really early on
that these are things

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.480
that everyone was
going to have to do.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.110
And at the time, he was signed
to a management company called

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:46.080
Hip Hops in 1978, which was
[INAUDIBLE] management company,

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.290
I think Jeezy at one time.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:50.170
I mean, they've managed
some of everybody.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:54.580
And because there was no
real digital footprint,

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.650
it was like me and that
one dude I mentioned

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:57.720
before who gave me a job.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.580
That was it.

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.490
So lots of really--

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.920
lots of responsibilities you
wouldn't really hand over

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.260
to a college student just
kind of fell on my lap

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.870
because he was like,
oh, just give it to him.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.270
Because it was kind of
like an afterthought.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.920
You're trying to convince
these millionaires who

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.310
are super famous, like,
yeah, you need a blog.

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:16.570
And I'm like, blog?

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.880
I'm about to get a Maybach.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.440
So as that shift happened and
people started to realize,

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.380
like, oh, everything is
going digital, iTunes,

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.825
and all these things,
then those departments

00:46:28.825 --> 00:46:30.450
started to like,
yeah, we need digital.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.320
Well, who's the
digital strategist?

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.040
And literally it was just like,
well, he's the guy we know.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.230
And that snowballed
to the effect

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:43.150
that I worked with Common,
and Lil Wayne, Jeezy, TI,

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:49.130
The Roots, Jill Scott,
[INAUDIBLE] who's local here.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.970
And for me, that kind
of opened my eyes

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:56.710
to the effects of digital
abroad in everything.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:47:00.190
It's not just this thing that I
can spam people my music with.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:03.190
It's something that non-profits
and companies and all

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.960
these other organizations
can use, too.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.355
So yeah, it's-- I forget what
your original question was.

00:47:07.355 --> 00:47:08.480
MARK SAAB: No, that was it.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.550
That's so it.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:10.080
That was it.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.553
How'd you get here?

00:47:11.553 --> 00:47:12.220
How'd you do it?

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.570
FUZE THE MC: Yeah.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.860
MARK SAAB: So Yetunde,
so along with being

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.200
an amazing visual artist
who does everything

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.620
from photography to
painting to the video,

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:28.040
you're also a experimental
musician who also scores

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.870
a lot of their own videos.

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:33.830
So can you kind of talk
to me about your process

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:38.160
there, and how all of
that comes together?

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.410
How do you-- how do you do it?

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.460
And how does that happen?

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.090
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Yeah.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:46.530
I don't-- I don't
know this stuff.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.130
I think most of the time
it comes from my desire,

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:52.020
like I was talking about before,
to archive all these stories.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:56.053
I feel like everybody's
process is really important.

00:47:56.053 --> 00:47:58.220
And how we got to where
we're at is really important

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.120
to talk about.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.540
And so a lot of where I start
is talking to my family,

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.550
talking to my mom and my
grandma, who are both here now,

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.610
but were from South Carolina.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:10.990
We're Gullah Geechee people.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.650
And so there's a
lot about language

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.383
and about oral history
that's passed down.

00:48:15.383 --> 00:48:16.550
And I don't want to miss it.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:18.170
I don't want to lose it.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:21.680
And so a lot of the places I
start is by interviewing my--

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.940
just pressing record and
just having a conversation.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.300
And so I don't know, it
feels important as far

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.120
as tying it in with what
everybody else is saying

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.600
about understanding
where you come from

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.940
and being really true
to your authentic story,

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.180
and making sure that you
understand where you come from

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.430
and what you can
bring to the table.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.890
And also what you
don't want to be.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.410
I feel like just listening
to them talk, especially

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:50.600
with talking about
relationships,

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.770
and talking about having to
move, and being displaced,

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:56.772
it feels like stuff
and lessons that I

00:48:56.772 --> 00:48:57.980
need to make sure I remember.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:00.093
So I guess where I
start is just wanting

00:49:00.093 --> 00:49:01.760
to make sure I remember
all these things

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.570
and making sure that I can
pass that down in some way.

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:06.560
But yeah.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.670
MARK SAAB: That's awesome.

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:08.020
Thank you.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:08.600
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU:
Yeah, no problem.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.510
MARK SAAB: So I want to
get into a portion where,

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.135
especially before we
kick it over to Q and A,

00:49:14.135 --> 00:49:18.350
I would like to just kind of
know about some stuff that

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:19.820
y'all like.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.920
And so I have specific
questions for each of you.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.540
So for you, Lance, I
want to know what's

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.300
your favorite meme right now?

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:28.600
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Oh.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.030
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: Oh, wow.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:30.280
FUZE THE MC: My favorite meme.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.197
MARK SAAB: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:31.197 --> 00:49:31.910
Or some of them.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:35.840
If you can't pick one,
two or three is fine.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:40.280
FUZE THE MC: So one that I
find myself going to a lot

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.790
is the Waka Flocka one
where he looks over

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.440
and he looks back again.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.160
Because there's so
many scenarios that

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.370
are happening right--
especially on the internet

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:55.018
for black people and black
culture where it's just like,

00:49:55.018 --> 00:49:57.310
you don't even have-- you
can't even get angry anymore.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:59.780
It's just-- you just kind
of give it a side eye.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.660
So I find myself going
to that one a lot.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.450
And me knowing who
Waka Flocka is,

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.550
he's kind of perceived as
someone who doesn't have

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:09.560
a lot of emotion,
or people think he's

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.310
a trapper, all these things.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:17.000
So to see that nuance of emotion
and response and understanding,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.750
too.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.890
People think Waka's dumb,
but he's not at all.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.580
And a lot of people
from the south

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.700
have that thing where it's like,
you hear the accent and then,

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.080
oh, he must not be intelligent.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.590
And I don't know, that meme
[INAUDIBLE] a lot that I can

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:31.940
see the--

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.290
I get what's going on.

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:34.610
What do you-- you know?

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.083
MARK SAAB: Yeah.

00:50:36.083 --> 00:50:37.250
FUZE THE MC: I see the plot.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.668
That's the phrase I'm
thinking of in my head.

00:50:39.668 --> 00:50:41.210
So that's my favorite
meme right now.

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:42.168
MARK SAAB: I like that.

00:50:42.168 --> 00:50:43.280
I like that.

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.420
Diaunte, what are some of
your favorite film projects

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.110
that are going on right now?

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:52.400
And if there's none right now
that you particularly love,

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.740
then I'm just interested
to also just know

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.320
what films you really love that
just inspired you to do this.

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.990
DIAUNTE THOMPSON:
Films that inspired me.

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:06.420
One film that inspired me--

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.260
well, there's two.

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:13.232
Well, "Seven" was my favorite
film because of the--

00:51:13.232 --> 00:51:14.690
I didn't know who
the director was.

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.680
I found out it
was David Fincher,

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.930
but I'm saying it
was just everything

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:22.080
about what he was doing.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.220
Denzel Washington was supposed
to play Brad Pitt role.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.180
He turned it down.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:27.930
He shouldn't have.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.450
But I wish he would have,
but he turned it down.

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:32.430
But it was still
a phenomenal film.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:36.480
That inspired me the way I
could think outside the box.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.625
And then there was
a movie called,

00:51:39.625 --> 00:51:44.170
when I was in film school,
"Sweet Sweetback's Badass

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:44.670
Song."

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:45.490
MARK SAAB: Oh, yes.

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:46.120
Yes, yes.

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.090
DIAUNTE THOMPSON:
And I was like--

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:49.770
first off, in film
school, you got

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.710
to watch, in film
appreciation, movies

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.260
that you wouldn't
normally watch.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.610
And I was like, what
did I just watch?

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.930
This is crazy.

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:07.830
My film directing teacher was
like, look, we gonna watch it.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:11.230
And I want you to watch another
movie which was just "Bad Ass."

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.450
And I was just like--

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:18.940
it showed how he made
"Sweet Sweetbacks."

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.667
And that right there I
appreciate that movie so much.

00:52:22.667 --> 00:52:24.250
And that would be
one of my top movies

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.110
because of how it was made.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.980
Because he had nothing.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.540
He had nothing.

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:33.470
So that's when that
got introduced, like,

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.470
oh, you just got to be
creative and resourceful.

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:37.223
We had a scene in our movie.

00:52:37.223 --> 00:52:38.890
The producers came
to me and said, look,

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:41.440
I love this idea that you
have, but check this out.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.850
That scene cost $90,000.

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.330
I was like-- so what
am I supposed to do?

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:47.792
They said, you
got to get 90,000,

00:52:47.792 --> 00:52:49.250
or you got to be
creative to do it.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.570
And I was just like--

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.070
I think it was a home invasion
scene or something like that.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:54.220
And we had all these--

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.780
there's blood coming.

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:56.950
I was like, oh yeah, OK.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.690
OK, I got you.

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:02.440
I sat home in my house and
I was watching that again,

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.607
whenever I get stuck.

00:53:03.607 --> 00:53:05.440
And I said, oh, I know
what I'm going to do.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.653
You know what?

00:53:06.653 --> 00:53:07.820
I'll make the audience work.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.800
I'm just going to--

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.600
I'm just going to
film outside the house

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.560
and have everybody act
inside and we is not--

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.570
we just going to imagine
what was going on.

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:15.670
And then they was like--

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:16.820
in the movie theater,
they were like, man,

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:17.778
that point was so good.

00:53:17.778 --> 00:53:21.530
I'm like, man, I got no money.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:22.850
I was able to be creative.

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.300
So that-- I mean, those are
the movies that inspire me.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.510
And I think that the
film projects that I

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:32.590
have going on now are a lot.

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:36.458
I have five projects right
now that we are currently

00:53:36.458 --> 00:53:37.000
working with.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.270
We doing two projects with Mark
Wahlberg that is unscripted.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:42.560
And then we're actually doing--

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.760
we're actually doing
a TV show based on--

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.770
I want to fucking say
it, but I can say this.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:49.270
It has something
to do with Marshawn

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:50.800
but it's going to be scripted.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.480
And then we have a
couple of feature films

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.970
that we're going to probably
do in Atlanta and in Oakland.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:53:59.860
FUZE THE MC: Nice.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.930
MARK SAAB: So many
secret projects.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.530
So Yetunde, I'm going to
make this a little bit harder

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:06.850
for you just because--

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:08.857
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: OK.

00:54:08.857 --> 00:54:09.940
MARK SAAB: --you're such--

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.040
and for y'all,
anyone who's here,

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.830
if y'all have the chance to
come up to the city in San

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.920
Francisco, you really should
see this show that Yetunde has

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.520
curated.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.100
And also just-- I
mean, Yetunde is

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.600
one of the most prolific
and intelligent artists

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:31.383
that are a part of the active
San Francisco art scene today.

00:54:31.383 --> 00:54:33.550
I don't think that there's
anyone who's a part of it

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:35.830
or knows anything
about it who isn't

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:39.400
super familiar with Yetunde's
work as a curator or an artist.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.020
Seriously.

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.680
And so with that, can
you talk about some

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.220
of the artists who are active in
the scene in San Francisco who

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.610
you think people should
be doing their Googles on,

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:55.130
paying attention to,
following, et cetera?

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.630
Yeah.

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:57.130
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Yeah.

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:58.800
I think Summer Mason.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.150
If we want to talk
about Summer Mason--

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:03.940
just premiered a
video at the show

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:05.890
called "Velvet Rain"
which is I think

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:07.570
the beginning of a
project, but maybe

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.930
a complete project,
"Black Zombies,"

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:14.407
which when they told me, I was
just like, I don't know, sis.

00:55:14.407 --> 00:55:16.990
I was like, I don't know if I'm
going to put this in the show,

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.880
but let me see it.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.640
But it's actually
really brilliant.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.397
OK, so Summer Mason.

00:55:24.397 --> 00:55:26.730
I wrote this down and I totally
forgot everybody's name.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:27.690
Wait a minute.

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:29.276
MARK SAAB: It's all good.

00:55:29.276 --> 00:55:30.820
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Summer Mason.

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:34.670
I think that Layla's making
interesting work right now.

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:35.305
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:35.305 --> 00:55:35.930
MARK SAAB: Yes.

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:36.430
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:38.787 --> 00:55:40.620
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: I
think Christian Johnson.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.790
I'm really interested.

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:43.410
Christian Johnson
was formerly part

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:49.480
of the Black Aesthetic, which
is an all black film collective.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.490
And I think it's a
book that's coming out

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:55.570
called, "My Skin
is Black Upon Me,"

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:59.040
but he's also doing a
film associated with it

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.110
that's going to be
screening, actually,

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:04.170
as part of the show on March 7.

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:05.910
So I'm excited about that.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:10.282
He's a really smart
film curator and critic

00:56:10.282 --> 00:56:12.240
and I'm really excited
to see his work actually

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.955
be manifested into something.

00:56:15.955 --> 00:56:16.830
And then [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.413
I want to talk about
[INAUDIBLE] who's

00:56:18.413 --> 00:56:22.200
not a filmmaker but a fantastic
and prolific painter, talking

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.010
about how space and
understandings of memory

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:27.832
and home change.

00:56:27.832 --> 00:56:29.790
But those are just a few
on the top of my head.

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:30.750
MARK SAAB: Yeah, definitely.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:31.250
Definitely.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.520
So all those people
are super important.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.600
You've just gotten they key
to the next popping artist

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.270
for the next 4 years.

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:42.390
So I would like to turn
to audience questions

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:44.928
if you all have any.

00:56:44.928 --> 00:56:47.880
AUDIENCE: As a filmmaker,
and you're doing everything

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:52.260
independently, for me, well,
for my last short film,

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.620
everything they could have
went wrong went wrong.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:58.020
Yet I still made the best of it.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:00.150
And sometimes I look at it
and people are like, yo,

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.817
this looks good.

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:04.020
But all I see is, it was
supposed to be like this.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.010
You know?

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:09.090
So what do you--
what do you do when--

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:11.405
how do you function when
things don't work out,

00:57:11.405 --> 00:57:12.780
like how you were
saying that you

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:15.170
didn't have the money so you
just shot it from outside.

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:16.170
It turned out brilliant.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.990
Turned out better than
you would have thought.

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:21.183
What do you do when
things like that happen?

00:57:21.183 --> 00:57:22.600
DIAUNTE THOMPSON:
Well, first off,

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:27.140
on every single set I've been
on, there's always a fire.

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:28.470
So I put that in head.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.300
There's going to be a fire.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:33.160
And you got to put it out.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.845
You have to put in your mind--

00:57:34.845 --> 00:57:37.470
not saying you're assuming that
something is going to go wrong.

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:41.620
You're trying to, but you've
got to know, that's filmmaking.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:47.470
So what I would do
more so than not is,

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:49.800
I go back to what I can control.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.260
If I'm prepared like
I'm supposed to be,

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:57.280
and whether it's financial
or just mentally,

00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.490
am I prepared to
know what I want?

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:02.770
And have options in your
head how these things can go.

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.270
And always feel
like, as a director,

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:06.400
you're a problem solver.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.690
You're a problem solver.

00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:10.050
If you've got to take 5
minutes, look, y'all, hold on.

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:13.180
I need 5 minutes
just to process.

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.300
And get back in the fire.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.033
And what will be will be.

00:58:17.033 --> 00:58:18.450
And you have to
be cool with that.

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:21.750
And you're always never going
to be satisfied with your work.

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:24.245
No creator is, on any
level, not just film.

00:58:24.245 --> 00:58:25.870
You're like, oh, I
could have did this,

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:27.150
I could have did that.

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:28.380
Don't kill yourself about it.

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.090
Just really say, move on.

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:32.580
Next project.

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.586
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:33.586 --> 00:58:34.794
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: No problem.

00:58:34.794 --> 00:58:35.920
MARK SAAB: Thank you.

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.980
AUDIENCE: So for
Lance, my question

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.140
is, as a digital
strategist what are

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.640
a couple of tips
that you could give

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.482
to someone to expand their art?

00:58:44.482 --> 00:58:46.440
I feel like there's a
lot of good art out there

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.500
but it just doesn't
necessarily have the reach?

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.550
So how do you--

00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:53.070
how would you say are a
couple of ways that you can

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:56.250
expand someone's piece of art?

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:59.370
FUZE THE MC: OK, I'm going
to throw a question back

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:02.520
at you just because I don't want
to give a vague answer that's

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.960
not even actionable.

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.760
What kind of art?

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.080
AUDIENCE: Let's say you're--

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.225
I would love to ask
all of you questions,

00:59:11.225 --> 00:59:18.270
but let's say you're
a short film maker

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:22.480
and you are trying to utilize
the digital platforms to get

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.560
further out there.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.430
FUZE THE MC: Yeah.

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:26.200
And my point asking
that question

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.020
is also just kind of to
show my process about it.

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:35.260
Every piece of content, if
it's not even if it's good,

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.790
every piece of content,
period, has an audience.

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:46.180
And that audience is a certain
person at a certain time.

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:48.420
So whenever you're thinking
about your project,

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.190
you think about, OK,
who are the people who

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:52.840
want to see short films?

00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.780
Where are they at in their lives
when they're watching them?

00:59:55.780 --> 01:00:00.880
Short films don't have the same
homes as a feature film or even

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.010
as a periodic series.

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:05.230
It's kind of an easy
law, but I would

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:09.280
look for programs
like apps that are

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.970
created by our culture that feed
specifically to those things.

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:16.720
And find out how you can
work with other creatives

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.460
and curators in that space.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:21.460
I think collaboration
is the easiest way

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.140
and it can be the most
organic way to make it happen.

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.390
Because if you find
someone that you really

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:31.000
love their art in
that space, you're

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.730
probably not the only
one, which means that they

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.110
have an audience as well.

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:40.330
And not to underestimate what
they call the mere exposure

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:44.080
effect, which is like if someone
sees something four times,

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.210
they'll start to appreciate
it even if they don't like it.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.150
That goes for music, content.

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:51.970
And when you have a circle
that's close to you,

01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:54.310
or people that are like,
oh, I really like his art

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.200
so I want to go make
something with him.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.150
I got a lot of people in
Oakland, he got a lot of people

01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.770
in Oakland.

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:02.200
And when those two
networks start to overlap,

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.720
that's when you really see
the magic that fires it off

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.480
in all these other places.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.520
That, or just have a
really huge budget.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.290
And then just buy Facebook
ads or Google Ads.

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:15.880
But yeah, that
would be my advice.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.960
And then to that point, also,
don't be afraid of advertising.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.830
Advertising is
really-- it's kind

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.710
of daunting for a lot of people.

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:27.820
And up until recently,
it's actually

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:32.020
been kind of difficult. But
not to shamelessly plug,

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.560
Google's ad platform has
gotten tremendously easier

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.957
over the last couple of years.

01:01:36.957 --> 01:01:39.040
And that's across the board
for all the platforms.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.980
So you take $20 to the bar.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:45.100
If you're working on something
cool, put $20 into it and say,

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.290
I think these kind of
people like my stuff.

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.790
Let me just put it
in front of them.

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:51.460
And the beauty of that is
it's real people who give you

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.040
real feedback real fast.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:59.210
And $20 can give you 5,000
impressions to really find out.

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:01.660
And I think that's the
step that a lot of people

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:06.830
miss is they're waiting for
the big, huge, boom release.

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:08.713
And I'm guilty of it as well.

01:02:08.713 --> 01:02:11.130
You start to overthink, oh, I
got to get this person here,

01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:12.610
I got to get this
person here, and then

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:14.320
we going to roll out
in this, with this,

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.153
and then these people
are going to cover it.

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:18.890
And those things are
good, but a lot of times

01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:21.280
that just causes the
paradox of choice.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.920
And you're like,
well, my art's good,

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.980
but I don't know how
to get it out there.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.880
So I'm just going
to hold onto it.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.330
I think the first thing is
just getting it out there.

01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:29.560
She mentioned Summer.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.350
Summer is someone that I
connected with a long time

01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:35.350
ago just because I thought she
was making dope art in college.

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:37.780
And now she's on--

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.940
doing openings with her.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.180
So it's like, man, those
kind of little connections

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.010
might not be anything right now.

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:48.340
But as you start to connect
with more super talented people,

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.270
all those people find
footing in other places.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:54.695
We connected on a message
board almost 10 years ago now.

01:02:54.695 --> 01:02:55.570
You know what I mean?

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:58.280
And now we're at Google.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.960
So just don't underestimate
the people who are around you.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.610
And use those networks.

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:05.835
Because 500 people is
actually a lot of people.

01:03:05.835 --> 01:03:06.710
You know what I mean?

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:07.710
AUDIENCE: Appreciate it.

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:14.164
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:15.982 --> 01:03:17.190
AUDIENCE: Thanks, all of you.

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:20.460
It was really inspirational.

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.460
As an educator, could
you make the stay

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.500
in school story sound cool?

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.372
Because I'm wondering what--

01:03:27.372 --> 01:03:28.830
could you talk
about the difference

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:32.130
between what you learned
from going to school

01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:35.703
and what you can teach
yourself online these days?

01:03:35.703 --> 01:03:37.620
Because I think we're
in this transition point

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.750
where a lot of people still
have the hood story of,

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:40.667
I didn't go to school.

01:03:40.667 --> 01:03:42.150
I applied my hood knowledge.

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:43.170
And now I'm up here.

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.510
And you have a lot of people
saying that, oh, we'll

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:46.830
learn it all on the web.

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:47.745
I don't need to--

01:03:47.745 --> 01:03:49.620
I don't need a mentor,
I don't need teachers.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.990
If you just speak to
the role of education

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:55.060
and how that really played out
for you guys I'd appreciate it.

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.490
DIAUNTE THOMPSON:
Y'all want to go?

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:58.990
MARK SAAB: I can
go first real quick

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:01.110
and then you can [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:04.500
I'll just say really quickly,
so I come from educators.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.770
My mother's a teacher,
my sister's a teacher.

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:12.060
And I still taught myself a lot
but I think the building blocks

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:15.540
to know how to even
properly decipher

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.070
what knowledge is right for you
comes from the basis of having

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:21.810
some sort of education.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:24.840
So I think-- and I'll
even stand here and say

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.970
I'm totally about independence.

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:28.850
I think you should have a job.

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:30.600
And I don't even believe
in a side hustle.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.520
I think you should
have a business.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.070
I think you should really
have duality at all times.

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:39.270
But even being able
to do that properly

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:41.970
comes from the basics of
having a good education.

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:45.000
Doesn't matter where you are in
the world, what race you are,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.890
what gender you are, everyone
is uplifted by some sort

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:52.240
of formal education.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.080
So I think it's a
part of being a human,

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.450
and it's necessary,
just on a base level.

01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:59.970
And that's why we have
fake news because people

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:04.130
don't have a respect for
any sort of institution.

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:08.405
So it's a balance, as we've all
talked about in different ways

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.660
up here.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.310
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: Yeah.

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:13.310
I was one that was
like, you know what?

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.470
I don't need no degree.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:16.460
I don't need no school.

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.020
After high school, of course,
but I was like nah, I'm cool.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.270
I'm going to do it on my own
and find a different way.

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:24.180
What he just said, oh, it's
another way you can do it.

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.100
And it is ways you can do it.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:31.100
But I find myself
saying that after when

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.120
I realized how many things
were essential if I were

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.230
to went to school on
certain things, of course

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:38.900
I went to film school
directly, but if I

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:43.240
went to a university of some
sort, I know I would be--

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.980
one, it would have been
fast track, way faster.

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.500
Two, I feel like that's
what I really feel.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:54.020
And I feel like, first off,
you learn so much socially

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.040
being at a school.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:55.872
MARK SAAB: Yeah.

01:05:55.872 --> 01:05:57.830
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: I go
on college campuses now,

01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:01.460
and I'm like, why
didn't I go to school?

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.660
What was I thinking?

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.410
But you don't know it
until it's too late.

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.827
And it's like-- well, it's
never too late to go to school.

01:06:06.827 --> 01:06:08.840
But I'm saying, for
what I'm trying to do,

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.800
I was like, man, look.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.970
I'm already two kids in.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:15.980
And then looking at my oldest,
my 13-year-old, I look at him

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:20.120
and he's talking about college
applications and stuff now.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.180
And I'm like, this dude
is nowhere near from me.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.790
But he's his mom.

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:28.160
So I'm like, I'm not
thinking that far.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.420
But I was like, I
see the benefits.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.710
And I'm going to college
campuses with him for sports

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:37.670
and I'm like, oh yeah, let's
get these 3.5 and above.

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:38.510
You know what?

01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:40.040
You do this, I'm going
to go back to school.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:40.640
I'm going to do this.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.810
I'm going to go to that.

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:43.650
My friend's going
to USC Film School.

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:46.912
I'm like, nobody told me.

01:06:46.912 --> 01:06:47.870
So don't let the fear--

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:50.690
I think a lot of it was me-- and
I start putting that bad fear,

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:51.830
oh, I don't need school.

01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:53.150
But I really needed the school.

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:55.220
So don't-- that's to
psych yourself out.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:58.000
But yeah, I definitely think
school is very important,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:58.970
period.

01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:01.890
FUZE THE MC: Yeah, and to add
on to that, this might not

01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:03.890
be very popular, but I
think there is definitely

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:07.940
a shift towards
people not having

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:10.730
as much faith in the
institutions of college

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:13.955
and how much value they give.

01:07:13.955 --> 01:07:17.210
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
in school debt a lot of people

01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:19.400
go through just to
find out they don't

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.080
know what they want to do.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.110
And that's a very
dangerous, very real thing,

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:26.210
that I don't think gets
beat into kid's head

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.670
when they're 17, 18
years old, taking

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:32.150
on loans that will affect
their life probably forever,

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:34.610
according to the student
loan debt problem.

01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:39.410
But I think education and
the institution of school

01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:41.780
are completely separate.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:45.410
I think school is really
good for cheat codes,

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:49.220
meaning that you're going to be
next to a lot of other people

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.280
who are doing amazing
stuff just by nature of it

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.800
being a school and a college.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.590
Howard is notorious for--

01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:03.170
people don't necessarily always
appreciate the academics of it,

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:05.630
but our track
record in people who

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:08.780
have stepped through
those halls is unmatched.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.970
Diddy dropped out, do
you know what I mean?

01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:13.340
And those are the things
that are intangibles,

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.040
that are not actually
attached to the book--

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.970
because let's be real.

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:20.189
A lot of these books
become outdated in a year.

01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:21.830
A lot of teachers
get into situations

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:23.580
where they're teaching so
they're not out in the field

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.649
and they lose things.

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:28.760
But as long as you go into
it with the impression

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.609
that this is about
my self development

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:33.560
and I'm going to go get the
things that I need out of it

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.319
rather than I'm going to
check off these boxes,

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.327
take this paper, and wait for
a check from some employer,

01:08:39.327 --> 01:08:40.910
I think if you take
that second route,

01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:44.720
you're going to be sorely
mistaken, especially in 4 or 5

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.010
years from now.

01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:48.000
You might be mistaken this year.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.770
So I would say having
a value for education

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:53.870
and being around
intelligent, smart people,

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:57.140
you spoke about mentors, you
don't have to go to college

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:57.979
to get those things.

01:08:57.979 --> 01:09:01.109
I think if you have a really
affordable option to do it,

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:04.580
it's an easy way to get those
cheat codes, get those plugs,

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:05.210
to get--

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:09.830
I met Brian Calhoun because he
came for a panel at my school.

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:13.316
He wasn't going to come to my
house and do a panel, right?

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.899
And I wouldn't have
found out about it

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:16.130
unless I was in that network.

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:21.109
And even now, especially 4 or 5
years after you get out of it,

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:25.550
you really start to see, oh,
I need a job at this place.

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:29.479
This dude who I had that
one class with in economics,

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:32.819
he's now the hiring
manager for that position.

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:35.720
And he's not even going to look
at my resume when I come in.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:41.180
And seeing that in person, that
I've been out of college for--

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.490
I'm not going to date
myself, but some years now,

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:49.819
and I haven't had my actual
transcript pulled ever.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:53.479
And I've held positions at
some of the highest companies

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:55.520
with the biggest artists.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.720
But what really stands out
is your ability to execute,

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.300
and your reputation,
and your connections.

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.190
And your ability
to execute school

01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:06.650
can kind of help with,
but your reputation

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:08.870
and your connections,
if you go to Stanford,

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:11.390
you're plugged, period.

01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:14.000
You can't help but be plugged
because of the filtering

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:14.570
mechanism.

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:18.785
So I would say don't
think too much about--

01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:19.910
man, I'm reading this book.

01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:22.730
I know this trigonometry
isn't going to mean anything

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:24.155
to me in 6 months.

01:10:24.155 --> 01:10:25.280
Because you might be right.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.190
But it's not about that.

01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:27.580
It's about the
kid next you who's

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.250
getting an A in
trigonometry and knows

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:31.140
that the back of his hand.

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.970
He's going to be
changing the world.

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:35.250
So you want to be next to him.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:36.250
You want to build those.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:41.015
And you want to get some of
that energy off of those people.

01:10:41.015 --> 01:10:42.140
That was long-winded, but--

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.910
AUDIENCE: How are
you guys doing?

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.025
My name is Brian Shea.

01:10:49.025 --> 01:10:51.420
I'm one of the chaperones
from [INAUDIBLE] High School.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.420
And I just love what you
guys are talking about.

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:56.040
This is such an awesome
segue because I have students

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.610
and some of them
are a little shy.

01:10:57.610 --> 01:11:00.380
And Diaunte, especially you were
familiar with Marshawn Lynch.

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.880
You know, [INAUDIBLE]
football, he's

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.620
been up there a couple of times.

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:07.520
But even for Yetunde and Lance,
I hope I said that right,

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.560
do you guys have a
process for mentorship?

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.140
Do you have a process for
internship or externships?

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.820
How could the students
get access to you?

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:17.030
And even if you don't
do that, how could they

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:18.632
get in contact with you online?

01:11:18.632 --> 01:11:20.840
Or what's your social media
handle, just so that they

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.507
can follow you and
get a little bit more

01:11:22.507 --> 01:11:25.087
familiar with who you are
and what you're doing?

01:11:25.087 --> 01:11:26.670
We're super, super
interested, though,

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:30.050
in the Beastmode connect because
we have a whole multimedia Best

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.950
Buy teen tech center.

01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:32.660
And I'm telling you,
some of the students

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.190
are already making
their own films.

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.020
Some of them have
already won awards.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:37.910
And these are kids who--

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:40.290
I love the conversation we
were having about education

01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:43.700
because I think, as Yetunde
was talking about trauma as it

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.400
relates to white supremacy
or the oppression

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.070
or systemic oppression,
education in itself

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:50.070
is embedded in that.

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:53.420
So as we start to talk about
learning and different learning

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:54.890
modalities, it's
not going to work

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.057
for kids who are coming
from vulnerable communities.

01:11:57.057 --> 01:12:00.380
So if we, as artists,
or the black artists who

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.940
are making the next wave are
not keeping that in mind,

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:05.030
a lot of kids are marginalized
but they won't ever

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:07.220
get to where you are
just because of where

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.230
they were born, period.

01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:09.950
So yeah.

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:10.280
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Yeah.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.086
MARK SAAB: Thank you.

01:12:11.086 --> 01:12:12.170
DIAUNTE THOMPSON:
Wow, that was a lot.

01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:13.570
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Yeah, I know.

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:14.930
AUDIENCE: The question.

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.370
The question, the question.

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:17.870
How do they get in
contact with you?

01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:20.420
How could the internship-- we
are looking for the connect.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.950
What's the connect for them?

01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:22.580
The plug.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.730
That's the real question.

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:24.688
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Yeah.

01:12:24.688 --> 01:12:26.060
MARK SAAB: Thank you, thank you.

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.230
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: I mean,
if anybody is out there

01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:31.640
and wants to learn
about being in arts,

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.910
wants to learn about being an
artist, my door is always open.

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:38.670
I have a lot of connects
through MoAD's, Museum

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:43.430
of the African Diaspora, San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art,

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:46.820
[INAUDIBLE] Center for the
Arts, I've worked there.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:49.460
If anybody-- if you want
to be a curator, which

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.620
is showing people's
artwork, if you

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:55.880
like making experimental
videos, I can help with that.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.040
I'm also getting my
master's at Mills College,

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.610
so if you are interested
in Mills College, which

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:04.070
is a really good
school and they have

01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:05.270
different kinds of programs.

01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.610
A lot of people I
know have gone there.

01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:08.803
Anytime.

01:13:08.803 --> 01:13:10.220
If anybody wants
to come up to me,

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.650
I will share my
number and my email.

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:16.130
I also work at a organization
called Counter Pulse, which

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.350
is an organization that
does a lot of dance

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:19.310
and experimental dance.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:21.900
So if you're a dancer,
if you need studio space,

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.190
rehearsal space, let me know.

01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:25.790
Let me know.

01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:28.010
Anything you need.

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:31.225
DIAUNTE THOMPSON:
Same way for me.

01:13:31.225 --> 01:13:32.350
That's what it's all about.

01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:33.850
That's why I'm here
right now right.

01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:38.857
So it's like-- it is a
tricky business, you know?

01:13:38.857 --> 01:13:40.690
I know I get busy at
times, but I don't ever

01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:42.670
want to get too
busy to the point

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:44.900
where we can't have a
conversation to get you

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:46.750
where you need to go.

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:49.345
I'm very accessible
whether if it's meeting

01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:50.730
you guys after the thing.

01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:55.810
You can get all my information
far as what we got going on.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:58.520
And we're going
to have a lot of--

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.490
the Beastmode Productions
is an umbrella extension

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:03.410
of a lot of other things.

01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:06.110
We have Family First.

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:08.290
Family is the foundation.

01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:13.010
And a lot of kids wants to be--
we did Beast of a Business.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:14.720
And you have an
idea for a business,

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.200
and you could have applied and
helped get through Shopify,

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.820
get your business off the
ground as a high school person.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.870
Architecture.

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:25.700
We have-- it's not just film.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:26.810
It's everything.

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:31.670
And the foundation-- we have
a West Oakland youth center.

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:34.970
We have classes throughout
the summer, everything.

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.490
So it's a lot of things
that we're actively

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:38.810
in the community day to day.

01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:43.190
We're not just too far off
doing these great projects.

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:46.977
It started with just being right
here on a day to day basis,

01:14:46.977 --> 01:14:47.810
being on the ground.

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:51.760
So yeah, and to even
go into another step

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:57.480
further is that just
make sure you guys are--

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.110
literally, you might
have heard it--

01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:00.900
your future.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.843
And I think that
if you hear, you're

01:15:02.843 --> 01:15:04.010
like, oh, OK, that's school.

01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.710
I'm the future.

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:08.460
No, you're the future.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.590
I don't know-- it's
somebody in this room that's

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:18.180
going to be the next best film
director, the next best music

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.025
artist, everything.

01:15:20.025 --> 01:15:21.150
It's somebody in this room.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:25.350
And it's crazy because it's
a couple of years away,

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:27.640
or it could be
happening this year.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.250
There's no age
limit to greatness.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:32.040
So I just think that--

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:32.640
if any way--

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.280
I'm sure, if any
way we can help--

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.520
we wouldn't be here if
we wouldn't want to help.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.190
But help-- remember this.

01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:43.760
Help doesn't mean
I'm doing it for you.

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.450
Help means I want to help
you understand what you have

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:50.700
so you could plant that seed
so you could let it grow.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.530
Because once you
watch it grow, you're

01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:55.550
going to do everything
to protect it from dying.

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:57.765
And that's what I can give.

01:15:57.765 --> 01:16:00.390
FUZE THE MC: [INAUDIBLE] I mean,
I'll echo the same sentiments.

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:01.200
Just hit us up.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.450
I mean, we're live streaming,
so I want to put it out.

01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:05.980
But if you come up
to me, I'm open.

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:09.990
I have lots of connections that
are not even relevant to what

01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:12.570
we're talking about here
but that could plug you

01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:14.290
in lots of different ways.

01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:18.370
And I'll say in general,
this is like a really open,

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:21.810
friendly environment because we
have common ground and space.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:24.510
But going forward,
when I was young,

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:27.010
I used to think, like,
man, I'm only 16.

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.220
They're not going
to care, da, da, da.

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:30.870
Trust me.

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:34.380
It is a perk right now that
you only have four window.

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.170
Right now, if you just
email someone and say, yo,

01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:41.040
I'm 17 and I x,
y, z, it's already

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.990
perking the interest
of people like us

01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:47.220
because we see how early that
these desires are being--

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.200
and that's when you need
to start them to make

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.460
them become something great.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.683
So don't be afraid--

01:16:51.683 --> 01:16:53.100
like yo, I don't
have the answers.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.610
I don't exactly know even what
you really want to ask for yet.

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.080
Just start those conversations.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.030
And if you want to
make it real easy,

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:02.460
find a simple way that you
can help the people you're

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.570
trying to reach out to.

01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:06.000
I'm not saying that has
to be for me or up here,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.977
but you say, hey, look, I really
want to be mentored by you,

01:17:09.977 --> 01:17:12.060
and I'm also going to bring
me and 6 of my friends

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:12.820
to my opening.

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.695
You know what I mean?

01:17:13.695 --> 01:17:16.320
I'm sure she would
appreciate that, right?

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.850
And it shows that,
to the other person,

01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:21.300
even if it's not something
that's really helpful, that you

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.730
respect their time, and
their influence, what

01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:25.550
they can do for you.

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:28.680
So yeah, don't be afraid
to use-- like, I'm young,

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.232
and we're here.

01:17:30.232 --> 01:17:31.440
DIAUNTE THOMPSON: Absolutely.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.240
FUZE THE MC: Yeah.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.940
MARK SAAB: Yeah, well, thank
you everyone, for your time.

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.460
This has been an
incredible panel.

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.530
And yeah, we're pretty--

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:42.030
yeah.

01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.460
Yeah, thank you.

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:42.760
YETUNDE OLAGBAJU: Thanks.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.093
AUDIENCE: Big round of applause.

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:48.810
[APPLAUSE]
