00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.911
[GUITAR MUSIC]

00:00:00.911 --> 00:00:02.535
LAURA LING: What are
you cooking today?

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.530
JP REYES: I'm going to
make a popcorn shrimp.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.670
What I did was just bread it in
some panko and some seasonings.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.878
LAURA LING: Sounds delicious.

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:09.790
JP REYES: Oh, yeah.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.310
LAURA LING: What he's cooking
actually isn't shrimp at all.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.340
It's a meatless
product made in a lab

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.770
by New Wave Foods, a biotech
startup founded by Dominique

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.420
Barnes and Michelle Wolf.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.961
Tell me how you conceived of
this idea to make fake shrimp.

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.710
DOMINIQUE BARNES:
Shrimp is the number one

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.940
consumed seafood in the US.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.940
You know, this is a product
that we enjoy eating

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.600
and many other people do too,
but the way we're getting it

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.180
now isn't sustainable.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.190
LAURA LING: Did you know that
38% of the world's mangroves

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.260
have been destroyed to
create shrimp farms?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.830
That even one hamburger
wastes more water

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.850
than two months of showering?

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.440
That agriculture contributes
nearly one quarter

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.040
of global greenhouse
gas emissions?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.750
Our seemingly insatiable
appetite for meat

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.890
is having a devastating
impact on the environment.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.600
But some are betting that
biotechnology will offer

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.730
a sustainable alternative.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.260
Wow, so this really
does look like shrimp!

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.100
I'm impressed.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.960
What has gone into this process?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.335
MICHELLE WOLF:
What you're seeing

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:14.320
is a combination of different
plant and algae ingredients

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.840
and then our
proprietary process,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570
which really gives
it the bounce-back

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.480
that a lot of
people mention makes

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.090
it taste a lot like shrimp.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.272
LAURA LING: Can I handle it?

00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:23.480
MICHELLE WOLF: Yeah, totally.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.140
If you take one up
and smell it you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.569
should get sort of a
shrimpy-type smell.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.360
LAURA LING: Yeah, it's
not quite as pungent

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.401
which is not a bad thing.

00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:34.920
MICHELLE WOLF: I know.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.470
LAURA LING: Does your product
have the same nutritional

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.080
value?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.538
DOMINIQUE BARNES:
Our products will

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:42.060
have very similar nutritional
value as far as having

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.096
high protein, low fat.

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:44.970
Because they're made
out of plants and algae,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.530
it'll be zero
cholesterol, and even

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.972
if you have a shellfish
allergy, you will most likely

00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:52.680
be able to consume
our product because we

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.304
don't have that same component.

00:01:57.304 --> 00:01:58.720
LAURA LING: New
Wave Foods is part

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.280
of a growing movement of
biotech companies creating

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.470
meat alternatives.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.280
Others include
Memphis Meats, which

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.160
grows real meat from cloned
pig, cow, and chicken cells.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.350
Impossible Foods plans to
create a plant-based burger

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.030
with the same taste, texture,
and appearance of real ground

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.770
beef.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.720
And a company called Clara
Foods makes vegan egg whites out

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.730
of yeast.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.405
Where do you see
the future of food?

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:23.030
MICHELLE WOLF: What
it comes down to is

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.580
taste-- that we
can, you know, apply

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.530
all these amazing processes,
but if it doesn't taste amazing,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.950
and consumers aren't
going to accept it.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.530
LAURA LING: JP
Reyes, a vegan chef

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.540
at the Google offices
in San Francisco,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.210
has been one of the first to
incorporate New Wave shrimp

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.170
into his dishes.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.730
JP REYES: At Google,
we have a lot

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.860
of sensitivities, allergies,
diet restrictions--

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.270
so it's nice that we're able
to offer a shrimp alternative.

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:52.420
LAURA LING: All
right, Chef JP, so I

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.980
brought my dad to
this taste test-- he

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.617
is the ultimate seafood lover.

00:02:56.617 --> 00:02:57.450
JP REYES: All right.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.325
LAURA LING: OK right.

00:02:58.325 --> 00:02:59.030
Ready, Dad?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.905
DOUG LING: I'm ready.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.564
LAURA LING: I think it's yummy.

00:03:04.564 --> 00:03:05.980
You can tell it's
not real shrimp?

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.938
DOUG LING: No, I can't.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.530
Tastes a little like scallop.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.220
LAURA LING: Oh, okay.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.160
So did it meet the Doug
Ling seafood-loving test?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.490
DOUG LING: Very nice.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.990
LAURA LING: Do you
think that we are

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.886
sort of entering a new era when
it comes to food technology?

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:27.010
DOMINIQUE BARNES: It does
definitely feel that way.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.290
And I think it's going to take
a lot of these great ideas that

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.980
are coming to market to help
solve some of the problems

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.160
that we see in our
food supply chain.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.060
And our ultimate goals
is really to continue

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.760
to create delicious
food that's good for you

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.802
and the environment

00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:48.260
LAURA LING: Are you curious to
try these meat alternatives?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.030
Let us know in the
comments below.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.090
And to see how ugly food
can transform our planet,

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.900
watch this next video.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.930
To prepare for tonight's
event, Chef Pesha Perlsweig

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.880
visited various
markets to see what

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.750
ingredients she could transform
into a six course dinner.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.510
MAN: She finds ingredients
that are going to go to waste

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.770
and then she turns it into these
intricate, amazing, interesting

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.023
dishes that people love.

00:04:16.807 --> 00:04:18.890
LAURA LING: Thank you for
watching Seeker Stories.
