00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.980
Few companies have a rivalry as fierce and
longstanding as PepsiCo and Coca-Cola and

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.729
in their never ending battle for soda market
dominance each company has gone to some spectacular

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.330
lengths to screw over the other.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.700
Arguably the most fiendishly genius move of
all was one made by Coca-Cola in the early

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.320
1990s- a move that basically involved intentionally
releasing a terrible product purely to try

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.050
to screw over by association a similar product
released by Pepsi.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.210
The genesis for this tale began in the early
1990s during what is referred to in the marketing

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.100
world as the “Clear Craze”.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.640
In a nutshell, for whatever reason, many companies
began releasing clear versions of their products,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.890
using marketing buzzwords like “pure”
and “clean” to advertise them to the public.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.410
A company recognised as the industry leader
in this regard was the soap giant, Ivory,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.420
who, among other things, released a clear
version of their dish soap in the early 1990s.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.820
Ivory Clear was advertised with rather questionably
accurate slogans like “Ivory attacks the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.430
grease, not the natural oils in your skin”.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.280
The idea of clear products was quickly used
in diverse and eclectic range of products

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.380
including Zima Clearmalt (a clear citrus beer),
Mennen Crystal Clean deodorant, and, perhaps

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.290
most bizarre of all, Amoco Crystal Clear gasoline.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.180
As you might have guessed given the lack of
ubiquitous see-through products on your local

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.090
super market shelves, most of these products
either failed miserably or quietly faded into

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.470
obscurity when the Clear Craze went full meta
and disappeared.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.570
This brings us to Crystal Pepsi, which was
devised by then COO of PepsiCo, David Novak,

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.950
in 1992.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.590
The soda was virtually identical in composition
to their flagship product, sans the caramel

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.560
coloring used to give so many sodas their
distinctive brown hue.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.480
Novak’s idea was to market the soda like
other products released during the Clear Craze

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.820
and hope consumers would equate it being clear
with “purity” and, thus, assume that it

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.090
was a healthier alternative to regular Pepsi.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.860
Of course, as sodas are wont to be, Crystal
Pepsi was still terrible for you.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.170
For example, a single 20 oz bottle of Crystal
Pepsi still contained around 69 grams of sugar,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.949
or about 16 teaspoons worth- the same as normal
Pepsi.

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:47.511
Taste wise, Crystal Pepsi is extremely similar
to regular Pepsi, however, fans of the product

00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:50.610
claimed they could still tell the difference,
though how much of this was just in their

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.610
heads isn’t clear.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.880
Nevertheless, the slight taste difference
was brought up during the product’s design

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.480
phase, with one bottler at a Pepsi plant telling
Novak: “David, it’s a great idea, and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.010
we think we can make it great, but it needs
to taste more like Pepsi.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.280
If you call it Pepsi, people will expect it
to taste like Pepsi.”

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.050
Novak decided to ignore these concerns, and
presumably also ignored the fact that by saying

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.699
Crystal Pepsi was better because it wasn’t
brown they were literally advertising that

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.410
all their brown drinks weren’t good for
you.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.290
Despite all this, Crystal Pepsi was rushed
into production.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.200
Initially it seemed that Novak’s gut feeling
was correct and trials in cities like Denver

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.820
and Dallas in early 1992 garnered positive
feedback from customers.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.260
Encouraged by this, PepsiCo eventually rolling
out the product nationwide in early 1993.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.010
In their initial advertising blitz for Crystal
Pepsi, Pepsi paid millions for a minute long

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.420
Super Bowl ad to celebrate it’s launch.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.870
The ad, which can be viewed here in all its
glory touts Crystal Pepsi as the drink for

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.280
“Right now” and is full of pseudo-intellectual
quotes like, “Right now nature’s inventing

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.139
better stuff than science” and “Right
now only wildlife needs preservatives”.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:06.070
Also, because subtlety apparently died in
the early 90’s, the entire ad is set in

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.280
time to the Van Halen song, ‘Right Now’.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.090
They followed this up by spending a total
of around $40 million, about $70 million in

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.060
today’s dollars, pushing the product in
broader advertising.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.380
Initial response was very positive, including
Cystal Pepsi quickly capturing almost 1% of

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.260
the soda market (good for sales of almost
a half a billion dollars right out of the

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.979
gate, or close to a billion dollars today
if adjusted for inflation).

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.340
Nevertheless, in just over a year the product
was dead, with the last batch in the initial

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.510
run being shipped in early 1994.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.120
(It should be noted that since this time,
Pepsi has periodically re-released the product

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.610
for limited runs as something of a marketing
stunt, most recently in August of 2018.)

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.880
As to why the product flopped so spectacularly,
this seems to all center around basic human

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.990
psychology.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.910
To begin with, it was noted that because the
only other mainstream sodas out there that

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.400
were clear were citrus based, like 7-Up and
Sprite, many consumers initially thought Crystal

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.620
Pepsi must be the same type of drink.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.490
When they noted it tasted almost exactly like
Pepsi, most simply went back to drinking the

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.640
original brown version of the product.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.850
In essence here, Pepsi were going against
a literal century old association that cola

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.120
should be brown.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.760
This is a real problem, as noted by marketing
professor Kyle Murray at the University of

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.760
Alberta.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.980
In his study, The Role of Arousal in Congruity-Based
Product Evaluation, it was demonstrated that

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.210
when people are presented with products that
are otherwise exactly as expected except just

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.590
changing one very apparent thing, like the
color, they actually show genuine physiological

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.790
signs of anxiety.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.350
Thus, things like a drink that tastes exactly
as people expect a brown cola to taste, but

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.580
is clear, literally makes people’s pulses
rise and increases perspiration.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.770
Nevertheless, as noted, thanks to a rather
massive marketing push, while Crystal Pepsi

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.050
was falling short of Pepsi’s hope that it
would be a billion dollar brand (needing to

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.820
capture at least 2% of the market to achieve
that figure in 1990s dollars) it was still

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.650
doing reasonably well out of the gate.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:14.620
Enter a little more psychology and PepsiCo’s
chief rival, Coca-Cola.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.960
Thanks to the successful launch of Diet Coke,
Coca-Cola had a diet drink on their hands

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.510
that had more or less faded into obscurity-
Tab.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.620
Significant to Coca-Cola’s plans here was
the fact that diet drinks in general at this

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.530
time were not terribly popular and were otherwise
generally considered something only women

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.530
drank.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.390
In fact, this association was so strong that
Tab cans themselves were made pink and advertisements

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.280
eventually solely targeted women, with such
statements as “Be a shape he won’t forget…

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.690
Tab can help you stay on his mind.”

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.290
This negative association with diet drinks
among half the population and a brand that

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.780
Coca-Cola didn’t really care about got the
wheels turning among executives at Coca-Cola,

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.410
with the result being a rather ingenious idea
to hurt sales of the upstart, Crystal Pepsi.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:03.520
Launched as a direct competitor to Crystal
Pepsi in December of 1993, Tab Clear was later

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.000
described by former Pepsi executive and, at
the time, head of marketing for Coca-Cola

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.150
Sergio Zyman as a product the company intentionally
sent to die, almost purely to spite Pepsi.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.740
In a nutshell, this was just the exact same
drink as Tab, sans caramel coloring.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.830
The company also removed the caffeine from
the product- another move that isn’t terribly

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.770
popular with consumers.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.050
They then very prominently featured the fact
that the product was caffeine and sugar free

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.540
right on the can.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:37.060
Naturally, both being clear colas, most stores
stocked Crystal Pepsi and Tab Clear very close

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.060
to one another.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.229
This all combined had Coca-Cola’s executives
hoping consumers would similarly assume that

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:45.290
Crystal Pepsi was a diet drink and caffeine
free.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.980
If accepted by the public, these two factors
would virtually guarantee that Crystal Pepsi

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.670
would never be a mainstream drink, no matter
how hard Pepsi tried to make it a thing.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.560
In the end, Zyman called the launch of Tab
Clear, “a suicidal mission from day one”

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.570
and in an interview for the book, Killing
Giants: 10 Strategies To Topple The Goliath

00:09:04.570 --> 00:10:05.870
In Your Industry gleefully noted,
