00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:13.250
It could be argued that flying was in Pancho’s
blood.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.890
Born into a wealthy family in 1901, Florence
Leontine Lowe, as she was originally known,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.610
grew up in a large mansion in California.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.380
Her family’s wealth was built on aviation.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.670
Pancho’s grandfather was Thaddeus S.C. Lowe,
the man responsible for establishing the United

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.660
States’ first military air unit during the
Civil War.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.310
The Union Army Baloon Corps might have been
made up of hot air balloons rather than airplanes,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.750
but it was fairly revolutionary in its time.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.940
It was also Grandpa Lowe who took Pancho to
her first air show when she was ten years

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020
old, cementing her love of flight at a young
age.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.190
Despite being born into wealth, Pancho resisted
the expectations of rich society from a young

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.190
age.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.410
Her father was an avid outdoorsman who allowed
Pancho to join him in sport while her mother

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.460
was busy caring for a sick uncle.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.800
She was treated like a son rather than a daughter,
and she liked it that way.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.960
She was given a Thoroughbred horse for her
fifth birthday and won her first equestrian

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.480
trophy later that same year.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.000
Not only was she a tomboy at home, but after
a brief stint of home schooling, she was sent

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.110
to Padadena Elementary School where she was
the only girl in a classroom with twenty-three

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.110
boys.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.800
Not much is known about the quality of education
she received in the usual subjects, but she

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.250
did learn to run fast, spit, curse, and fight
better than her peers.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.320
When they learned of her behaviour, her parents
eventually moved her to a Catholic boarding

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.600
school.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.420
Barnes promptly ran away to Tijuana on horseback
after two years.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.870
When she eventually graduated from an Episcopalian
boarding school, Pancho announced to her parents

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.310
that she wanted to be a veterinarian.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.570
At the time, this was an unheard of profession
for women and a particularly appalling idea

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.570
to her well-to-do mother, who encouraged her
daughter to pursue a more lady-like profession.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.780
Though she resisted becoming a lady, a marriage
between Pancho and an Episcopalian reverend

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.840
was arranged.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.970
Pancho looked at it as a shot at independence
rather than being tied down—at least she

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.340
could break free from her demanding mother!

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.140
Thus, Pancho married Reverend C. Rankin Barnes
in 1921 and they had a child together nine

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.140
months later.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.090
Needless to say, Pancho was bored stiff being
a preacher’s wife.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.910
She took a shot at teaching Sunday school,
but it didn’t quite live up to her childhood

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.400
adventures on horseback.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.830
Luckily, she had some success in Hollywood,
where she was hired to ride horses in movies.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.420
She was such a good rider that she could even
carry a camera on her shoulder while on horseback,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.900
making around $100 every day doing just that.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.920
(About $1000 today.)

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.810
The money went straight into hiring a cook,
nanny, and housekeeper—with the servants

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.310
effectively taking over Pancho’s duties
as a housewife and mother.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.880
When Pancho’s mother died when she was just
twenty-two years old, her father remarried

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.110
a woman just a few years older than Pancho
was.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.530
In a fit of anger, Pancho ran off and started
a series of affairs with men who weren’t

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.931
boring, upstanding Episcopalian preachers
as a kind of revenge.

00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:02.819
Her family soon caught wind of her shenanigans.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.710
Pressured to leave due to the family’s embarrassment,
she signed up to crew a banana boat headed

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.959
for South America with some of her friends.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.989
Dressing as a man and taking on the name Jacob
Crane, Pancho set sail for Mexico.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.070
She and the crew soon discovered that they
were running weapons and ammunition to revolutionaries

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.099
there.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.069
When they landed, not everything went as planned.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.910
The ship was boarded by Mexican guards who
held the crew hostage for six weeks.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.129
Only Pancho and one other crew member had
the courage to escape from their captors.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.680
The two escapees stole a horse and started
their journey back to the States.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.910
It was during this stint that Pancho earned
her nickname.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.040
She said that her partner looked a bit like
Don Quixote, and he said that that made her

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.930
“Pancho,” mistaking the name of the character
“Sancho.”

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.120
Even with the mistake, Pancho decided she
quite liked the sound of “Pancho Barnes”

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.069
and the name stuck with her until her death.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.300
After returning to California, Pancho sought
her next great adventure.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.690
In 1928, she began taking flying lessons and
took her first solo flight after just six

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.870
hours of instruction.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.300
She went on to become one of the first female
pilots to earn her license in the United States,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.349
and in 1930 she beat Amelia Earhart’s speed
record.

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.379
Buying herself a $5,500 plane, she decided
to turn her hobby into an enterprise, earning

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.250
money from being a test pilot and doing promotional
flights.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.489
Later, she also became a stunt pilot, returning
to Hollywood to feature in movies again—this

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.680
time in a metal bird rather than on a horse.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.569
Unfortunately, Pancho lived a lavish lifestyle.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.189
She wasn’t used to saving money and tended
to spend it on parties for her friends and

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.620
additional real estate that she wouldn’t
use.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.330
By 1935, she ran out of funds and moved to
a small house on an alfalfa farm in the middle

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.920
of nowhere, where she stayed with her horses
and airplane.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.219
Her son, Billy, helped out on the farm every
now and then—he had been living with his

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.919
dad while his mother went adventuring, but
enjoyed the freedom of the farm.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.300
Pancho was also visited by flyboys and her
Hollywood friends, which unfortunately didn’t

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.569
do her pocketbook much good.

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.289
During this time, she continued to host a
string of lovers as well.

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.740
In 1939, her first husband asked for a divorce
that had been a long time coming.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.449
She then married Robert Hudson Nichols, Jr.
shortly after the divorce, but the union lasted

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.680
just two weeks.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.629
In 1944, she was visited by a show dancer
named Don Shalita, who she married and lived

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.289
with for a whole four months.

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.599
She remarried in 1952 for a fourth time to
Mac McKendry.

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.169
The reception was a lavish affair, with a
50-pound wedding cake, 16 gallons of Jell-O,

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.240
and the one and only Lassie as entertainment.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.729
When Pancho received an inheritance upon her
uncle’s death, she started enhancing her

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.729
property.

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.010
She put in runways and encouraged pilots to
fly in and tie up their planes for free, as

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.129
long as they purchased oil and gas from her.

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.749
She also converted the guest house, adding
more private bathrooms.

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:43.099
Her property even boasted a repair shop and
a flight school.

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.409
She called it a “modern flying dude ranch”
and advertised for families to join her for

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.580
just $49 per week.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.059
But Pancho wasn’t one to miss out on the
old days—she also created a private club

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:57.860
called “The Happy Bottom Riding Club”
exclusively for her pilot and Hollywood buddies,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.919
where they could drink and tell stories.

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.589
Illegal liquor was flown in from Mexico and
“hostesses” waited the tables and danced

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:05.589
with the guests.

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.789
The pilots’ wives seemed to think that those
women did more than “hostess” but Pancho

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.129
denied the claims.

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.889
Pancho was at the height of her happiness
then, but it wouldn’t last.

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.399
In 1952, the government started buying up
the land around the Edwards Air Force Base

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:23.680
to build a long runway, and that meant Pancho’s
beloved Happy Bottom Riding Club was on the

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.809
chopping block.

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:28.180
After a series of law suits, the government
finally won the title to Pancho’s property,

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.240
and she was given $185,000 ($1.5 million today)
as recompense.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.849
She tried to start over, but Happy Bottom
had taken her twenty long years to build.

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.379
Pancho still had trouble managing her money
which wasn’t good for business.

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:43.860
She was also diagnosed with breast cancer
and underwent a double mastectomy.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.659
As if that wasn’t enough, her relationship
with her fourth husband crumbled soon after,

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.750
and while it was the longest relationship
she’d maintained—lasting almost ten years—she

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.960
filed for divorce in 1962.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.029
She did end up leaving Mac McKendry her worldly
possessions in her will, though, so she must

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.589
have liked him better than her previous husbands.

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:03.969
Pancho wasn’t able to get back on her feet.

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:08.819
She died in 1975 in less-than-glamorous surrounds;
it’s thought that breast cancer was the

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:09.819
ultimate cause of death.

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:12.990
Her ashes were scattered over her old ranch.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.429
Despite falling from grace toward the end
of her life, Pancho was always upbeat.

00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:20.050
As she liked to say, “When you have a choice,
choose happy!”

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.779
As to perhaps being somewhat overlooked as
a pioneering female aviator over the much

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:28.569
more widely publicized Amelia Earhart and
Harriet Quimby, among others- largely due

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.309
to Poncho’s “unladylike” exploits and
penchant for off-color quotes like, “Flying

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:36.710
makes me feel like a sex maniac in a whorehouse
with a stack of $20 bills”- her response

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:42.149
to such observations was, “Hell, [I] had
more fun in a week than those weenies had

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:58.029
in 
a lifetime!”
