done now now Bob gets to pick which of
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.790
done now now Bob gets to pick which of
those pieces he wants say Bob goes for

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800
those pieces he wants say Bob goes for
 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.260
those pieces he wants say Bob goes for
this one here now bob is definitely

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270
this one here now bob is definitely
 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.300
this one here now bob is definitely
happy because he's got his number one

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310
happy because he's got his number one
 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.980

choice out of the trimmings and we

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990
choice out of the trimmings and we
 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.910
choice out of the trimmings and we
already know that he's happy with his

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
already know that he's happy with his
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.900
already know that he's happy with his
main chunk of cake

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910
main chunk of cake
 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.000

now it's Alice's go and whichever one

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010
now it's Alice's go and whichever one
 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.800
now it's Alice's go and whichever one
Alice picks she's definitely gonna be

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810
Alice picks she's definitely gonna be
 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.780
Alice picks she's definitely gonna be
happy because in the very beginning she

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790
happy because in the very beginning she
 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.190
happy because in the very beginning she
thought that all three of the pieces of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
thought that all three of the pieces of
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.740
thought that all three of the pieces of
cake were equally good she's ended up

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
cake were equally good she's ended up
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.240
cake were equally good she's ended up
with one that hadn't been trimmed off

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
with one that hadn't been trimmed off
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.979
with one that hadn't been trimmed off
and now she's got an extra bit so

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989
and now she's got an extra bit so
 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.390
and now she's got an extra bit so
there's she's definitely gonna be happy

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400
there's she's definitely gonna be happy
 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.760
there's she's definitely gonna be happy
and then finally Charlie ends up with

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770
and then finally Charlie ends up with
 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.350
and then finally Charlie ends up with
the last still trimming and he's

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360
the last still trimming and he's
 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.690
the last still trimming and he's
definitely gonna be happy too because he

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700
definitely gonna be happy too because he
 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.310
