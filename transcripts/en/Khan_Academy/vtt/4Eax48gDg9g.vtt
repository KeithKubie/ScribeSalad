00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.150
Simplify the expression 28b
to the sixth divided by 7b.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.540
Well this is the same
thing as 28/7 times

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.480
b to the sixth over b.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.440
And I did it this
way so that we have

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.870
b to the sixth over b
to some other power.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.170
And this is over b, which is the
same thing as b to the first.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.200
So we could simplify this
using exponent properties.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.430
And 28/7 we can just
clearly simplify because 28

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.122
is divisible by 7.

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:36.920
28 divided by 7 is just 4.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.120
So that is just 4.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.260
And then b to the
sixth divided by b

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.310
to the one, that's just going
to be b to the sixth minus 1

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.860
power.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.830
So times b to the sixth
minus 1 or b to the fifth.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.810
So our answer is
4b to the fifth.
