00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm just checking in on your,
sorry, I'm saving my voice.

5
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:21,600
I fucked up my voice a couple of months
ago and I've just ignored it and now I

6
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:24,420
am. I'm throat coding teeing it. Um, mmm.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,320
I got some halls sucking
on the halls there.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,950
Dude. It's still fucking metal lip. This

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,970
well never fucking says on the thing.
Hauls mental lipless mental lip.

10
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,640
This eucalyptus. I don't
know. Take a steam. You,

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,340
what you need to do for your
voice is you need to stop talking.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,920
You need to drink some condensed milk.

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,140
It's like 20 people right now.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,260
What could those middle global actually
closed phlegm. Shut the fuck up.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,870
You never went to medical school. Okay.
All you did was drink a glass of milk.

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,080
Stop talking like you're a fucking
veterinarian. Ah, you know,

17
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:09,940
I didn't want to be in a mood like
this. Um, all right, so Billy,

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,990
no fun.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,790
Now I've cried wolf for
about three weeks right now.

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,440
Talking about how I was going to get my
act together, right. And I was gonna,

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,750
I was gonna start working clean
on stage. I was going to, uh,

22
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,830
you know, get my relationship
with Christ going again,

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,480
ma'am. Talk to that guy and fucking
fucking forever. We had a big falling out,

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,770
me and that guy, you know, and I still
feel like he owes me the apology.

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,990
I'm waiting for him to call, you
know, waiting for him to reach out.

26
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,280
But, uh, you know, I could see that he's
being a big baby about it. So evidently,

27
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,550
you know, I'm gonna have to
be the bigger man, you know,

28
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,630
I'm going to have to reach
out. Jesus. If you could,

29
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,870
could you help me avoid
the demon of the booze? Um,

30
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,910
no, I was good at this. This is how,

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,620
this is how much I've been eating
and drinking like a fucking asshole.

32
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,070
I just shut everything down Sunday
night and I lost four pounds this week,

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,900
you know, just fucking, and I
even got hammered one night.

34
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,480
I was doing so well,
dude, the 4th of July.

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,040

MMM.

You live in on goop and we want it pay.

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,080
Oh Jesus. Anyways, on July 4th,

42
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,010
you know how many Burgers

43
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,610
I had? Zero. How many hot dogs?

44
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:07,540
I had zero up.
You know how much alcohol I had.

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,960
Zero until a couple came over.

46
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,150
I'm French. You know, they
brought their kids over, you
know, they had a little one,

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,980
then they had one that was like seven,
eight years old.

48
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,580
It was a riot telling me knock knock
jokes. He was killing me, killing me.

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,990
It's delivery was outstanding. He was
making up his own knock knock jokes,

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,780
but just the way he would do the,
deliver the punchline, he'd be like, um,

51
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,530
um, okay. I got one, I got
one. He was just making them
up on the spot. He'd be like,

52
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,780
knock, knock. I'd be like,
who's there? And He'd be like,

53
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,180
Liz [inaudible] Liz who when he'd be like,
listen to my music.

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,490
Yeah, give me, you come up with one on
the spot. Those aren't easy. Um, anyways,

55
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,150
so we ended up having, I
had a great time, but uh,

56
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,850
you know the guy brought over some
beers, so I'm like, ed, he's not cold.

57
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:02,870
I got a couple of cores up.

58
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,530
The is liking on the little grenade
fucking bottles in the back. I'm like,

59
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:11,210
I'll have one. So I have one. There
were only here for an hour. Right.

60
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,630
But what did I do?
I sprinkled a little fairy dust on it,

61
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,580
demon in me and then the demon will

62
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,530
governments like walk over to your bar,
record ship to Korea. And I did, you know,

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,730
big fucking square ice cube, nice home
poor and the bottle was almost empty.

64
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,220
So I'm like, well I gotta have
another one and finish that one. Yeah.

65
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
Long story short,

66
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,230
one and a half of those plus the fucking
cores and I'm downstairs in my bed

67
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,170
talking Jibo's to my wife. I just meant
one point, she just goes from what?

68
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,800
And I was like, all right, time to go to
bed. So that one minor slip up, you know,

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,730
whatever. I think if you just did heroin
once a week, that wouldn't be bad. Right.

70
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,250
If you just did once,
you know,

71
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,090
maybe on the weekends he would want to
be nodding off at work. If I be bad.

72
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,130
That'd be hilarious. If you just
stuck to your guns, I'd be like, yeah,

73
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,050
four out of five days, I'm
fucking on it. One fucking day.

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,410
I come in here with track marks nodding
off of my cubicle and all of a sudden,

75
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
oh,
we need to have a meeting

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,530
that's an 80% it's a B minus.

77
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,190
Tell me your parents would ground
you over a B minus. They just say,

78
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,790
get your grades up. This is it.
Get your grades up, conversation.

79
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,930
Then I'm all about it.

80
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,090
But if you're going to start
saying that you're gonna fire me,

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,350
you're gonna fire me over a B
minus over a B minus. Okay. Yeah.

82
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,510
I'll get a fucking lawyer. I'll sue
the shit out of you, your honor.

83
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:37,400
My client was only doing
heroin once a week.

84
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,980
Okay. It was, it was the
middle of the week. It was a
Wednesday. Okay. Yuki came in.

85
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:45,290
He crushed it on Monday and Tuesday,
Wednesday.

86
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,520
Middly he wasn't worth anything
but Thursday and Friday. Right.

87
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,713
Finish strong.

88
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,270
We could equate this to a sports
analogy. He, uh, you know, uh,

89
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,440
when did, uh, when o for
20 and the beginning of the
third quarter. But anyway,

90
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,470
he came out with a victory.

91
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,820
Sorry. Um, anyways, yes. So I lost
four pounds his fucking week and, um,

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,160
I think I'm back on it. I, you know
what, I have an acting gig coming up,

93
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,790
so I got to get down to my
fighting weight. Is Bob Pogo?

94
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,170
Um,

95
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,670
is Dave Kempner was Bob Pogo says
my fighting weight is a one 72,

96
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,770
so I can drop three a week.
It's in two weeks.

97
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:28,150
I'll be down to like one
74 good. Three, four,

98
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:28,984
something like that.

99
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,020
And then I'll just fucking wean the
next two off while I do the shoot.

100
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,640
And there you go.
That's how it's done.

101
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,093
All right.

102
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,370
Oh, you fat actresses out there.
Fucking bitch. Moan and complain. Oh,

103
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:42,250
it's so easy for a fucking guy.
We got our fighting weight too.

104
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,543
You know,

105
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,390
so sick of that fucking myth that they put
out. Oh, guy can look however he wants.

106
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,790
Now, if you're a fat fuck, you're
going to play a fat fuck is a guy.

107
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,170
It's just just what it is.
You're going to play a fat fuck in.

108
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:59,410
The jokes are going to be
that you're a fat fuck, okay?

109
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:02,410
You're going to be doing a chip
and Dales dance with no shirt on.

110
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,420
You're going to be breaking coffee tables.

111
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,520
You'd be living in a
van down by the river.

112
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:09,520
You're going to be a mall cop
to tries to slide behind a pole,

113
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,100
but doesn't quite make it
because of the shape he's in.

114
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,780
Okay? I don't know what fucking
movies you're watching. Um,

115
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,570
and then the whole thing where they
sit there and they go, oh, you know,

116
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,050
I'm so sick of seeing these movies
where there's these guys in these,

117
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:29,230
these women, you know the, with
women half their fucking age. Well,

118
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:32,860
you know what that is, is because you
haven't traveled to where the money is.

119
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,080
Go Down in Miami,

120
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,520
you know, get out of the ugly parts of
the world like De Moines, Iowa. Okay,

121
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,950
I'll come on. You know, you're
ugly and if you're not ugly,

122
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,000
you're fucking planning an escape.
All the hot chicks move out at de Moines.

123
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,880
Where do they go? Cash. Cheyenne, Wyoming.

124
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,373
Yeah.

125
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,303
MMM.

126
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,130
You know,

127
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,800
then they meet some hot guy from Greeley
Nexeo there in Denver growing some

128
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,933
wheat.

129
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,070
Um, Greeley, we're having
a bad smell day. Um,

130
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,240
anyways, you know, a friend of mine
was just talking recently about this,

131
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:12,390
this farm that they have.
Uh,

132
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,190
they sponsored this farm somehow
somewhere out in England and they, um,

133
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,690
they don't kill the cows when
they stopped producing milk.

134
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:25,800
They just let them kind of just get old.
It's really cool.

135
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,700
It's like a cool farm man.
They milk the cows by hand.

136
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,140
I think all farms should do that. All
farmers should do that. And if there's,

137
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,780
you know, if they can't keep up with
the milk supply demand that, you know,

138
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:42,390
all that means is human beings will die.

139
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,460
And considering where the problem,
you know,

140
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,570
I say as long as it's not me or
anyone that I love, I'm all for it.

141
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,690
Here's something really fucked up.
Environmentally,

142
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:01,140
I started watching baseball again and
finally gave in, I bought the MLB package.

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,360
I'm S, I'm all set now. I've
got the center rice. I got
the fucking, what's this?

144
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,950
What's always got some dumb names?

145
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,620
They can't just say the NHL
against the center ice, the court,

146
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:14,160
sad fucking 50 yard line,
whatever they call them. Right?

147
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,700
I've got the Bruins to patriots,
Celtics and red.

148
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,010
So I've got the whole fucking thing.
And with my cable,

149
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,880
it just automatically renews,
which I love.

150
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,790
I usually don't like when it
automatically renews. Like, Hey, hey,

151
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,690
I make the decision now. I don't give a
shit. I'm just like gonna fine, whatever,

152
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,940
whatever. It's fine. Don't worry
about it. Um, so I've been watching,

153
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,560
uh, I watched that Rangers series.
I didn't realize how many Red Sox,

154
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:44,220
I didn't know.
He's Mookie Betts and right.

155
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,543
Yeah.

156
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,083
Bradley Jacob Jr,
something like that.

157
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,140
Bradley a a fucking Walmart
Junior, whatever the fuck
his name is. Milton Bradley.

159
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,020
What's his name? Something.
Bradley Jr, I dunno.

160
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,840
Then you got Andrew
[inaudible] and fucking left

161
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,480
Zan and Baguettes, Dustin Pedroia.
I don't know a lot of them.

162
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,690
Um, anyway, so I'm going to start watching
them and watching the Yankees too.

163
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,140
Cause Aaron, Judge Aaron Judge looks
like a fucking myth, doesn't he?

164
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:20,750
He looks like one of those fucking things
when they talk about baseball in the

165
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:25,450
early 19 hundreds, you know, and they
had those giant fucking, you know,

166
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,060
elephant Titus of the fucking hand
gloves that they use to play with.

167
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,390
You know, guy's fucking amazing. I
don't know what's going on though,

168
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,570
but I think baseball's numbers are down.
I think they do something whenever they,

169
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,690
whenever they fucking numbers go down,
I believe that they juice up the ball.

170
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,330
They've got to do something. I mean, it's
just all of a sudden, out of nowhere,

171
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,570
everybody just starts cranking
all these fucking home runs.

172
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,860
And this guy's on pace to hit like 60.
Um,

173
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,320
but anyways,

174
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,130
I've been not just sitting there
recording the games were in Tampa tonight,

175
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,480
right. We started, you know,
what happened was I went,

176
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:05,030
did that big papi roast and then
I went to the game and then I,

177
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,490
I just got back into it. I was like,
Oh yeah, I fucking love this game.

178
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,980
I forgot about that. Um,
and I think we went to, um,

179
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,721
Toronto.

180
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:22,721
I told I went to Toronto when
that series went to a ranger's,

181
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:24,740
right, Texas. Wait, this is
what I want to stand this.

182
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:29,741
What the fuck I was trying to get to was
I'm watching the fucking Texas Rangers.

183
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:35,500
They had that amazing ballpark.
I went there, I sat up,

184
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,890
I sat in the outfield because I wanted
to have the opportunity to run out on the

185
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:42,790
grass to try to get one of those
home runs, you know? And um,

186
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,260
yeah,

187
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,590
I've just found out that fucking ballpark.
It's not even 25 years old.

188
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:51,970
They're already, they're already
knocking it down, all that concrete,

189
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,640
all of that shit,
all of that fucking stuff.

190
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,070
Somebody please do a documentary and
followed the dump trucks and just show up.

191
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,980
Where does that go? What are they
going to do with all that? Fucking,

192
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,550
it's fine. It's fucking fine.
And like, well, you know,

193
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,360
it gets really hot out here in the summer.
We need a fucking real,

194
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,450
it gets hot out here in
the summer because of us.

195
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,870
We're a fucking plague.
Jesus Christ.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,810
You already fucking Yag,
all that shit out of the Goddamn ground.

197
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,490
Now you just going to throw it out.

198
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,860
You're going to throw it in the
fucking ocean to build another one.

199
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,133
I don't know.

200
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,090
They're doing that in Atlanta.
Atlanta has a fucking ballpark.

201
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:37,670
That thing's not more than 25
years old. And they're like, well,

202
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:41,510
you knew our Fan Bay seeds GST.
You fart

203
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,380
dry cow.
[inaudible]

204
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,440
Aurelia,

205
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,210
right? They've got to bring it out to
where the white people are. All right?

206
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,810
White people, white people.
You don't have to do it.

207
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,210
And they're going to move it out
to the where the white people are.

208
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,170
You know what the problem is?
Is Atlanta Braves fans fucking suck.

209
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,290
They just lean on.
It's not even that they suck.

210
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,980
It's just they've had the ball yanked out
from underneath them a Zillion fucking

211
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:14,550
times. They've got Charlie
Brown. Okay, and then, you know,

212
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:18,540
after that last fucking Superbowl, if you
think these, these, these, these fucking,

213
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,590
I mean, if I was the president, I would
declare Atlanta a fucking disaster area.

214
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,220
If I was in Georgia,
all right?

215
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:35,900
I would just watch college
sports. Ibm, Georgia bulldogs.

216
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,640
That's what I would do. Georgia
tech, university of Georgia.

217
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,270
[inaudible] I didn't want to come
over and just slobber my fucking hand.

218
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:50,900
I'll go home and Jerrica up to the blog
and Georgia bulldog. Um, I would go,

219
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,010
that's disgusting. I will fuck
in. I would be into that shit.

220
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,020
Yeah.

221
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,680
So evidently they feel that not enough
black people come out. I have no idea.

222
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,180
This is just what people
from Atlanta told me.

223
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,210
They don't feel enough black people come
up or white people are too afraid to

224
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:11,590
drive their Chrysler town and country
countries and as SUVs into the greater

225
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:12,550
Atlanta area.

226
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,090
Yeah. MMM, okay.

227
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,200
To go to a fucking baseball game.
I have no idea.

228
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:23,201
So they're just abandoning that fucking
major league ballpark that some like

229
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:26,390
college team is now going to play
their baseball games and it's fucking

230
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:27,950
ridiculous. And then they're
going to build another one.

231
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,960
MMM.
Yeah.

232
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:32,881
I don't know.

233
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:36,330
I think you should have to
be in a ballpark for at least
50 fucking years. Right?

234
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,030
I, I'll be honest with you, I
couldn't believe how old those were.

235
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,270
I thought they made those
in like in the year 2000.

236
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,290
I thought they made them 2000 to meet
him like 94 or something like that. So,

237
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,020
um, I dunno. Who Cares?
You know who gives a fuck?

238
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,110
Just keep yanking the shit out of
the fucking ground building. Shit.

239
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:59,111
Rip It down and then throw it in the
ocean and then blame people with red ties

240
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,820
at Blue Tyson.
Then we'll just continue doing,

241
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:05,240
what the fuck would this depressing bill.
This is fucking depressing. All right.

242
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,430
How about some good news?

243
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,340
I have some of the best news I've
gotten in a long time. A long time.

244
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,410
All right. You ready for this? The
Indianapolis Colts got caught. Cheating.

245
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,720
Got caught cheating again.

246
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,863
Yeah,

247
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,650
it's fucking on. It's hilarious.
It's fucking hilarious.

248
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,300
How many of these fucking things that
these guys do and how little attention

249
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,220
those cunts at ESPN pay
attention to this shit.

250
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,330
The level of fucking focus on spy gate,
deflate gate,

251
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,280
all of this fucking shit. They're not
even going to do a story on ESPN like,

252
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:45,061
Hey,
wait a minute.

253
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:50,040
We spent two and a half years on fucking
deflate gate because the owner of a

254
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,760
team that's gotten caught
pumping in crowd noise,

255
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,540
fucking they haven't hearing aids now
I guess in the helmets because Peyton

256
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:04,270
manning was an or a new quarterback
and hadn't mastered the silent count.

257
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,610
The dude who caught the underinflated
fucking ball got busted doing roids.

258
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,710
They stole our fucking off fence.
I mean did they?

259
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,780
Yeah,

260
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,730
they get their owners sat
on the competition committee
and changes the rules of

261
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:22,820
passing to tip it in his favor so they
could beat the Patriots. It's fucking,

262
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:25,940
I believe this is a thing.
I'm not mad at any of that.

263
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,830
Okay.

264
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,400
Do you like,
does that make Indiana,

265
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,650
does that really make
them win the fucking game?

266
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,200
Cause they have hearing aids
in their fucking helmets.

267
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,100
I think that's fucking hilarious.
All right.

268
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,270
And I think it's the job of the league
to try to catch those people doing it.

269
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:45,220
And when people get caught,
I just laugh.

270
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:46,750
Okay.

271
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,460
Corked bats, all of that Shit's
funny. Steroids is the one thing.

272
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,820
Steroids. That's the one for me that
I feel that's the biggest thing.

273
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,290
You know, pumping in
crowd noise, hearing aids,

274
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,630
taking a context where the air out
of a ball trying to steal signs.

275
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:11,170
Jesus Christ. Everybody fucking,
but that shit's hilarious to me.

276
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,770
And those are some of the best stories
that you hear when you listen to pro

277
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:20,770
athletes. Half their fucking funny
stories are about guys cheating.

278
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,350
Was every time a rough turns it's
can I keep punching me in the ball?

279
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,860
So I'm just like, dude, what
the fuck? By the third quarter,

280
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,610
my balls are the size of my fucking head.

281
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,600
So I turned around and I kicked him in
the nuts from behind. I get his taint,

282
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:36,150
his fucking ass out. Like every
one of them, you go to a banquet,

283
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,090
all of their fucking stories are about
the shit that they did to each other when

284
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:43,470
the refs warrant looking.
Um, my only one is steroids.

285
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:44,820
That's the only one I
give a fuck about it.

286
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:48,600
If you get caught using
steroids just because that,

287
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,341
you know,

288
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:53,940
and that doesn't make you throw the
ball farther or see it better or get bat

289
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:58,770
speed or any of that shit. It just
keeps you feeling brand fucking new.

290
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,010
You're going up there like
you got eight hours sleep,

291
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,320
like you never got tackled in your life.

292
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,770
Like you never got hit on the
rib cage by a fast ball. It just,

293
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,620
you like a fucking x
man. That's the one. Yes.

294
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,993
MMM.

295
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,920
Dan. I look at like what the fuck? But
I also, I also understand it. I mean,

296
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,590
cause at least in football,

297
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,280
like what those guys do to their bodies
and what happens to their brains at the

298
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:28,490
very least. I mean, I think they ought
to be able to heal up like x men.

299
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,770
I think they ought to
be able to smoke weed.

300
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:32,730
Yeah.

301
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,270
You know, at a state level so
they don't get in trouble. Yeah.

302
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,910
Um, that's the only thing. Um,

303
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,000
but listen to the ting colts.
I don't think Peyton Manning's a cheater.

304
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,620
I don't think the cults
of fucking cheaters,

305
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,560
I think it's fucking hilarious
that you got caught doing that.

306
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,200
Just because your owner is a cunt.

307
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,780
He's such a fucking content.

308
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,770
I can't believe that ESPN is just
gonna fucking ignore this story.

309
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,480
They just ignoring the thing. Quick
little blurb. Bing, Bang, boom. Done.

310
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:05,320
See you later.

311
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,020
Okay.

312
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,510
There's no, Hey, wait a minute. Yeah.

313
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,920
Okay.

314
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,240
The all time this guy was saying by the
bed, the bed. Meanwhile he's doing this.

315
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,540
I mean, Jesus Christ. ESPN
is the dog days of summer.

316
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,270
God knows you've got to fill
up some fucking airtime.

317
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,110
There's a patriots fan.

318
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:27,010
Can you at least have Bob Lee do
some fucking outside the line? Shit.

319
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,080
They won't do it. They won't
fucking do whatever. Whatever.

320
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,550
What are you going to do?
I love it though.

321
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,510
I love it because to this day I
still get shit when I was up in, um,

322
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,260
when I was up in Porchester
fucking giant fans,

323
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:44,620
giant fans who had former great giants
talk about fucking cheating all the time,

324
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:45,590
all the shit that they do like,

325
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:50,591
like this fucking Guy Jim or say succeeded
because he in his own weight tainted,

326
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,440
ah,

327
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,060
the Patriots when they did absolutely
nothing more than anybody else's fucking

328
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,290
do it,
which is basically

329
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,200
fucking grab as bullshit and they're
acting like they're fucking, I dunno.

330
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:11,590
I Dunno. I Dunno. I don't get it. I
don't fucking get it. You know what?

331
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:13,900
I just Tom Brady,
he's just too good looking.

332
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,290
If Tom Brady looked like pate manning,
I'm telling you right now this way,

333
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,930
and we weren't winning championships.
It wouldn't be a fucking story,

334
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:23,764
but whatever.

335
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,510
All I know is I got another round of
ammunition that I can put in the gun any

336
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:32,470
fucking time anybody speaks up,
um,

337
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,950
about the patriots cheat. Die. What do
you think about the Indianapolis Colts?

338
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,043
Huh?

339
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,170
Hey, how do you feel about the, uh,
the Falcons or the, uh, the Vikings?

340
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:44,280
What do you think about those guys?
Uh,

341
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,190
what do you think about
the Pittsburgh Steelers?

342
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,910
What do you think the New York football
giants, what do you think about Ndi?

343
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,930
You don't think anything about that?
You know why?

344
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,810
Because Espn didn't tell you
to think anything about it.

345
00:20:55,811 --> 00:21:00,630
You fucking buffalo wild wings,
mouth breathe and far let it go below.

346
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,500
Right. I am. Anyways,

347
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,760
a buddy of mine was just brought up that
Conor McGregor Mayweather fight again

348
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,790
and uh, it was fucking
hilarious. And he goes,

349
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,670
you don't think Mcgregor has a chance?
And I'm just like, I think he's, you know,

350
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,220
I told him I go there. I think he's
had an unbelievable disadvantage.

351
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,020
You know what I mean?
He's like a,

352
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:22,460
he's like a fucking swimmer and
this is like a fighter. And I,

353
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:24,950
that's a bad analogy. I don't know
what it is. I told you the analogy,

354
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:29,540
it's like fucking Tom Brady, Jerry Rice
at the height of their fucking careers.

355
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,330
Let's see.

356
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,920
What's a better football player by seeing
who can throw the football further and

357
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:38,250
more accurate. That's the only level
of competition. So this guy's gone.

358
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,860
You don't think he's got a chance.
He goes,

359
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:42,980
look at his boxing in this and
he shows me a fucking MMA fight.

360
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:46,790
The guy throws like three punches and
then a flying fucking knee and takes the

361
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,550
guy to the ground is just like,
dude, that's not boxing. All right.

362
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,420
World class championship boxers could
not lay a fucking glove on this guy.

363
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,220
These not going to be
able to land a fucking,

364
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,230
I don't need an Atlantic love on them.
The only change,

365
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,690
the only thing he has is if Mayweather,

366
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,610
I dunno,
in the last,

367
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:14,611
whenever the last time you fought was
he just got old like Jordan between the

368
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,810
bowls in the wizards.

369
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,490
Like he just had a noticeable fucking
drop off and he can somehow rough the guy

370
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:25,420
up. And I know Mayweather's hands are
fucked up from all the years of fucking

371
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:28,390
punching guys in the head.
Um,

372
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,000
okay,

373
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
well maybe he can fucking somehow getting
Mayweather's ego into like you can

374
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:39,470
talk enough shit that
MMA is a superior sport

375
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,640
that may,

376
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,110
whether is it going to want to knock
them out and maybe he comes in and do and

377
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:47,690
for the first time in his
career does something stupid.

378
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:49,850
I just don't see it happening.
Um,

379
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,930
I said that I hate this fight cause
I know I'm going to order it. But um,

380
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:58,990
after the debate with him and watching
him sending me an MMA clip to show me how

381
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:00,740
good this guy was at boxing,

382
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,733
mmm.

383
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,430
Am now, but I don't think I'm going to
order the fucking thing. I'm gonna wait,

384
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:11,570
I'm gonna wait to people call me up and
seal and I mean wait for text of like,

385
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,900
Oh shit. Capital Letters.
Then I'll order it.

386
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,310
Or if they go, that was a
complete fucking waste of money,

387
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,080
then I'll just laugh and then
I'll probably, we'll order it.

388
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,850
I'm going to order it. God Damn
fucking Shit. I'm going to order it.

389
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,810
I'm going to give Mayweather another
hundred. You know, nobody's fucking money.

390
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:29,644
That guy owes me,

391
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,630
wants you to fight Manny Pacquiao fucking
10, 11 years after when he should have.

392
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,790
Although I actually, I mean I thought
that that guy was on something, you know,

393
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,740
you know, I know, cause
I'm not in the fight game.

394
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,850
Anytime a guy just keeps moving up in
weight class and he just keeps getting

395
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:49,100
stronger. I mean, is that possible?

396
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,260
I moved up in weight class. I went
up to him. What you a buck 90.

397
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:57,800
I didn't get any faster. Um, anyways,

398
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,760
let's read some fucking advertising here
and then I have to go into the writer's

399
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:05,720
room for season three of f is for family.
Oh boy.

400
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,010
Another 10 episodes.
Um,

401
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,340
and I am being a fucking angel,

402
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,540
an angel as far as my eating
in that writer's room. Nothing.

403
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,840
Nothing will fuck you over like
sitting in a goddamn writer's room.

404
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,940
You sitting on your ass all fucking day
and his candy and chips and chips and

405
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:31,430
candy and pizza and fucking
burgers and fries. I mean,

406
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:36,230
it is, it is. It's fucking, you might
as well be sitting in a crack house.

407
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,380
Um, this k here's my diet. All right
here for me. I feel like this works.

408
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,910
All right. I have oatmeal, third of
a cup of oatmeal with a bunny in it.

409
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,990
Right. A little bit of milk in there to
cool off the fucking, the the fucking,

410
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,540
I don't know what it is. And Fuck
you guys with your steel cut oats.

411
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,270
I don't give a shit. This works for
me. All right. Then I have two eggs.

412
00:24:56,271 --> 00:25:00,830
Oish that's it. Right? Then between
lunch and breakfast, I have an orange.

413
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,810
That's it. And then for lunch, I have
some sad fucking salad with the protein.

414
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:10,010
No bread. And then I just crush
waters. I leave around five,

415
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,440
I gotta eat something else in
the afternoon. I don't know what.

416
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,480
And then I come home and I have a salad
with a protein and I do a half hour of

417
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:21,620
cardio and a, that's it.
The fat has nowhere to hide.

418
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,950
It's like a fucking roach. When you
turn the lights on, it's just freezes.

419
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:28,970
It doesn't know what to do and
then it's dead. That's it. Um,

420
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,730
and I just have to, what I have to
do is I have to stick with this.

421
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:36,680
So I'm down to just under one 80.
I'm a buck 79 and change.

422
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,300
So this time next week I want when
I'm in fucking grand rapids, Michigan,

423
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,850
during my favorite fucking
gigs in the country,

424
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,200
the Fountain Street fucking Church,
um,

425
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,520
I'm doing some fun gigs
coming up by the way. Uh,

426
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,500
I want to be one 76 next week is
what I'm saying. Um, but uh, I got a,

427
00:25:57,501 --> 00:26:00,350
I'm playing that fucking venue,
that buddy Holly,

428
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,950
the big bopper and Ritchie
Valens all played the night.

429
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:07,790
They died flying into the same fucking
airport and now you guys are saying,

430
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:10,160
oh Geez, Bell, don't
judge your work. No, no,

431
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:13,700
because we actually have de icing exists.

432
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,060
They did not have that. All
right. Legal Zoom, everybody.

433
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,480
And that kid is going to be like in a
November I and it's not on sale yet as far

434
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,314
as I know.
All right.

435
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,670
Legal Zoom in order to successfully run
your own business attention to detail is

436
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,910
so critical.
One contract slip up,

437
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,110
one contract slip up or illegal
misunderstanding can really set you back.

438
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,340
Fortunately, there's legal zoom. You may
already know that over a million billion,

439
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,790
billion Americans have used
zoom to start their business,

440
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,870
but legal zoom services go
well beyond business formation.

441
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,900
They built a nationwide
network of independent
attorneys who can provide legal

442
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:57,570
answers to the day to day questions
you have about your business.

443
00:26:57,571 --> 00:27:00,780
What the fuck is this man?
Because let's face it,

444
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,090
things like trademarks,

445
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,750
employment laws and lease agreements
can get pretty complicated,

446
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,150
so don't waste your valuable
time trying to wrap you up.

447
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:11,220
Simple little head around,
all the fine print.

448
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,290
Use Legal Zoom for that so you can
focus on growing your business. Instead,

449
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,530
you'll get the legal help you need
without being billed by the hour.

450
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:22,140

and the last thing you take off? Huh?

461
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,460
It's not your socks. You fucking
Weirdo. It's your underwear.

465
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Me undies are designed in La and made
from sustainably sourced that micro modal,

466
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,100
modal,
a fabric three times softer than cotton.

467
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,180
You know what? I think my stomach's
three times softer than micro molder.

468
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,920
Mandy is softer than soft.

Luxury undies comes in an ever
changing selection of classic colors.

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,430
Bold shades.
What are classic colors?

471
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,490
Does that like your first box of crayons
where you just have the eight colors,

472
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,370

476
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:09,190
This is great monthly subscription.

478

It seems new to your wife, right? All

You can save time and money each

Bird buried Byard by [inaudible]. Um,

493
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,530
he's making some fucking moves. I guess
we're going after this. Gordon Haywood.

494
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,240
Everybody thinks he's a great fit
for the Boston Celtics because one,

495
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,830
he's a great player too. He played for
coach Brad Stevens at Butler and Trey.

496
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:23,520
He's fucking, yeah. Why?
Why, why? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

497
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,090
Celtics love a white guys
still love a white guy.

498
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:34,320
Boudou Tu Tu Tu Tu Tu Tu boop, boop, boop.
I don't know what it is. The Celtics,

499
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:39,140
they just have to have the white guy. I
watched this. We played Utah. I didn't,

500
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:42,850
I didn't see what the big fucking deal
was. Everybody's sleeping on my God. Go.

501
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,730
This guy is fucking unreal.

502
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,460
He's white like me. Um, Jason Tatum,

503
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,350
we got Jason Tatum Dry,
drafted him.

504
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,990
I saw him play at Duke last
year against Carolina. You know,

505
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,660
I think he's a great fit for the Celtics.
You know,

506
00:30:57,661 --> 00:31:01,800
we played at Duke on to coach k is an
absolute beast and he appears to be at

507
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:05,690
least tap white. He's light
skinned did. There you go.

508
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,980
That's Celtics like that.

509
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,690
I'm fucking with you guys.
Um,

510
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,010
look at fucking daddy age becoming
like a fucking red Roi back.

511
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,460
Junior's got all these draft picks.
He's fucking wheel and he's dealing,

512
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,560
you know what?
I want to see him do.

513
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:24,050
I want to see him light up a
fucking so you can't do it anymore.

514
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,050
Light up a fucking cigar when we're
up by 20 in the fourth quarter.

515
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,250
Just light it up. It's fucking over red.
Our back used to do that on the bench.

516
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,330
I mean, just one of the
biggest shit talkers ever
without having to say one word.

517
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,930
Oh my God. How bad did people
want to beat that guy? Um,

518
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,590
all right. Anyways, that's going to be the
podcast for this week. Oh, you know what?

519
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:50,590
I bought some new symbols.
I got a bunch of new symbols.

520
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:53,890
I finally get the jazz ride that I wanted.
I still fucking suck,

521
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:57,040
but my cymbal sound great.
And um,

522
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,360
I'm still my Gretsch kit that I ordered.
I ordered it and may,

523
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:04,600
they said it'd take two and a half months.
So it's been a month and a half. So, uh,

524
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,790
it should be here at any moment now,
Bill, it should be here in another month.

525
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:10,960
If you do the math,
whatever.

526
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,520
I know what's going to happen when I
fucking leave to New York and I go to do

527
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:18,340
the acting gig. That's when it's going
to fucking show up. Murphy's law.

528
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,830
And then I'm going to come here and
then we'll be like, sorry we missed you.

529
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,180
And they're going to be like,
we don't know where the drum
kit is. Uh, you know, we,

530
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:26,440
we set it down,
right?

531
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:30,280
And then I'm going to fucking see some
street performer with my fucking Gretsch

532
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,800
kit and I'm going to know it's mine cause
it's going to have three floor toms,

533
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:36,400
like fucking doesn't that could have
one rack, Tom, three floor toms,

534
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:40,780
the triangle of death to my right.
Um,

535
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,140
I'm already going to order
another rack, Tom. I think, uh,

536
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,220
I'm just doing everything I can to have
a different fucking set up so I can get

537
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:51,820
out of my 30 year fucking John Bonam

538
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,320
vortex that I went down and um,

539
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,840
I've been playing the double pedal.

540
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,630
I've been playing a double panel to
Primus and a low and a little bit of Pan

541
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,463
Tara.

542
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,090
I'm just doing whatever I can listen to
the lung and then slowing it down and

543
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:14,790
fucking trying to get my
shit up to speed. And, and I,

544
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,780
you've been listening to
like 1950s miles Davis.

545
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,310
Typical me fucking add all over the map.
Why,

546
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:25,580
why work at one of those things at one
time so you can actually get something

547
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:29,270
down bill when you can work
at with at all of it at once.

548
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,740
All of it at once. Um, all right.
Whatever I'm having. What the fucking,

549
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:36,860
I mean I'm not a pro or you know, I'm
not going to be recording anything soon.

550
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:39,260
Who gives a fuck?
I'm going to record anything ever.

551
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,180
Okay.

552
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,970
Yeah. Although, you know, I've
been doing the, I did that video,

553
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,570
that Sunday video podcast.

554
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,780
I had a great time doing that. I'm
going to do those every once in a while.

555
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,010
Maybe one of these times.
Yeah. I'll fucking,

556
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,740
I'll do like a Nah,

557
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,690
I'll put a little clip up.

558
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,540
MMM [inaudible]

559
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,540
I got to do a drum cover of like
one of the worst songs ever.

560
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,230
And then just be sitting there cause it
has to, I have to somehow make you laugh,

561
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:13,420
right. I can't just do a drum
cover and be like, yeah, Bill,

562
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,570
why don't understand what the purpose
of that was. What am I watching?

563
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:19,570
The banana splits is like fucking
danger island going to come on next.

564
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,753
MMM.

565
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,710
Oh maybe I'll just do
one behind the drum kit.

566
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,430
I'll just talk shit for fucking half hour.
And then the second I'm done,

567
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:33,130
I can play drums.
Maybe that's how I do it.

568
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,160
And I act like I'm going to play drums,
but then I never do.

569
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,510
And then you like bill, what the fuck? And
I'll just be like, no, what the fuck you,

570
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,590
because I made you watch until the
end. I'm like, Bill, Bill. Yeah.

571
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,090
Beer right now playing a mind game.

572
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,600
We used to play mind games with
people. Um, is that what you did bill?

573
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,080
I thought you just waited to people
left the ground and you took the fucking

574
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,190
legs out from underneath them.
I didn't realize that that was some,

575
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,510
it was a holiday on a level
of mental shit going on there.

576
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,590
I thought you just understood gravity
and somebody being vulnerable. All right,

577
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:11,390
that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves.
Uh, God bless the Indianapolis Colts.

578
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,630
Not everybody having been
through this as a patriots fan.

579
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:19,340
I want you to be nice to those colts fans.
Do not call them cheaters.

580
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,350
It isn't fair.
Um,

581
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,190
fucking hearing aid status. Hilarious.
Could they talk to each other?

582
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:30,380
Do you realize how fucking funny that is?

583
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,010
Yeah.

584
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,280
And that you sit in there and your
offensive line coach comes in. I listen.

585
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,380
This kid ain't fucking making man.
He doesn't know what the fuck he's still,

586
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,440
we're going to get her assets. It's
going to be allowed building. All right?

587
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:41,790
Just put these fucking things in.

588
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,120
Okay.

589
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,950
Anything,
any one of them sat there going like,

590
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:47,110
but coach isn't that against the rules?

591
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,700
That's fucking hilarious.
I love that they did that.

592
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,440
That's one of my favorite things
about sports, you know, is that shit.

593
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,270
Somebody with Vaseline
under their fucking did.

594
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,100
That guy had the shit on his
neck and it's just fucking funny.

595
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,030
And then everybody judges him.

596
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,990
Like you never drove in the car pool
lane without another person in the car.

597
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,030
Right?
You never cheated on a test.

598
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,250
You never fucked around on your
girlfriend or your boyfriend, you know,

599
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,920
fucked around in your taxes.

600
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,933
Huh?

601
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,590
You have a cut in line.
We're all fucking cheaters.

602
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:31,540
You cons fucking holier than
now douche bags. All right.

603
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,093
Um,

604
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:33,670
yeah.

605
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,660
Anyways,
let me look as,

606
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:38,950
unless you're doing like steroids or
like you making somebody, you know,

607
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,890
you're fucking somebody over on a house
and then they're upside down in the

608
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:44,950
house and you fucked them over for life.
And then their senior citizens,

609
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:46,360
they have to eat Paul.
That's when,

610
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,890
that's when you got to step in and do
something. But other than that, you know,

611
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,650
you bust somebody and then you
fucking laugh at him. You know,

612
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,440
you never cheated on your diet.
You fucking spouse walks in.

613
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,930
Did you got a fucking
spoon for the ice cream,

614
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,610
ms your cook bat right in your fucking
mouth. All right, go fuck yourselves.

615
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,390
I have a great weekend. Your
content. I'll see you on Monday.

616
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,163

all capitalized solar power.

624
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:44,551
Everybody can I take five minutes
just to be a fucking hippie man.

625
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,340
Um, every once in awhile I go in
and out of my fucking, you know, um,

626
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:55,210
with the team and now and then, and
then I'm against the team, you know,

627
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:00,740
kind of like a fucking,
uh, like a Randy Moss,

628
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,800
you know, you come into town,
you got your mind right.

629
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:08,220
And after about a season and a half,
you start acting like a fucking maniac.

630
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:12,840
That's how I feel when I look at,
uh, whatever the fuck and explore.

631
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,320
I was really trying to avoid the
expression, the powers that be,

632
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,510
but um,
I dunno,

633
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,920
I can't help it every time when I land
in Los Angeles and I look out at the

634
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,600
basin is as they call it,

635
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,940
I'm from the San Gabriel mountains
all the way south of that,

636
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:33,880
which is fucking La and greater la,
all of that,

637
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:38,320
just what an absolute clusterfuck it is.
And um,

638
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,740
what happens when the shit hits the fan?

639
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:46,741
So I'm thinking about getting some solar
panels and I know all your rednecks out

640
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:51,370
there saying the obvious thing to fuck
good. Just solar panel going to do.

641
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,510
If you ain't got a gun,

642
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,320
what are you going to keep the guy warm
that fucking shoots you in the head and

643
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,483
steals you provisions.

644
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,500
I understand they're fucken
bearded wonder. All right,

645
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,380
I get it.
But one step at a time.

646
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,210
One step at a fucking time. First
thing I want to do, I want to get,

647
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,560
you know, it's ridiculous.
I live in a fucking desert.

648
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,340
The House bakes in the sun
and I'm s I still have,

649
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,930
I don't have solar powered. It's
the dumbest shit ever. So, uh,

650
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:27,820
I'm going to look into it and I want,
I want to know is, is, you know,

651
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,930
is that two types of solar power.
There's one,

652
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,930
will you still on the grid and then
there's one where you're off the grid.

653
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,540
I like off the grid and if
anybody's listening to my podcast,

654
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,710
if you're off the grid, like
what happens? Did they like it?

655
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,830
Do they get mad at you?

656
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,510
I mean, how do they know? Because all
of a sudden you've bill goes down.

657
00:40:51,511 --> 00:40:54,100
Does that like set off a light,
you know,

658
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,270
and underneath the mountain that all
those Illuminati guys live in and then

659
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:58,890
somebody pulls up to your house.
Say,

660
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:02,070
I noticed you haven't been
making any toast lately.

661
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,670
And uh, you know, what's going on here?

662
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,180
How come you're not watching TV?

663
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:10,980
What are you reading books in their
fucking eating apples off the tree.

664
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,310
How come you're not using any electrical,
uh, tricity there. Does that happen?

665
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,230
Is it a, it's not illegal to be off
the grid. They just sort of fucking a,

666
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:28,720
do they bully you at all? Like, just
let me know what I'm in for. All right.

667
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:34,450
Because what I would love to do is it
continue spending legal tender that really

668
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:38,870
has nothing behind it other than the
faith of every freckled face can't over

669
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:43,610
here. Um, I would really love
to continue existing in this,

670
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:48,611
but I would like to have the backup that
if the shit does hit the fan before I'm

671
00:41:49,411 --> 00:41:52,370
overrun by a mob,
you know,

672
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:55,370
because mine's the only light on
the top of the hill. See, that's,

673
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:58,610
I used to do a bit about that. That's
the thing, like if you actually have,

674
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,440
if you're off the grid, all right? And
everything just goes fucking haywire.

675
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,680
You immediately, you got to cut
your lights out quick. Okay?

676
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,770
Cause the first thing when everybody
loses power, they stand. They go, Oh,

677
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,660
you've got to be fucking shitting me.
I was watching two brokers Olvey right?

678
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:20,480
That's the first thing
you flipped the switches is it?

679
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,030
Then this, you know, within 30 seconds
you're like, is it just our house?

680
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,550
And you look out the window.
So you basically,

681
00:42:26,551 --> 00:42:31,080
you have 30 fucking seconds
to cut all your lights off.

682
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,500
I'm tell you wife to shut the
fuck up and get downstairs.

683
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,190
Then that little corner room,
all right?

684
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,560
You put your hand on a shoulder
firmly.

685
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,800
You don't hurt him,
but you're not affectionate.

686
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,720
You place your hand on her shoulder
so she knows it's impertinent.

687
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,610
Fucking information is on
the way. Can you say, honey,

688
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,120
we're the only ones left. We're the
only ones left. Look at me. Stop crying.

689
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,020
We're the only ones with the only ones
left with power and I need you to hold it

690
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:12,770
together.
Cried out.

691
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,660
Now I want you to cry every
ounce of bitch you have in you,

692
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,770
out of you in this corner of this house.
Okay?

693
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,240
And when you come upstairs,

694
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,640
I want you to sit here and act
like we do not have power. Okay?

695
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,530
So when the Sullivan's come across the
fucking street and see if we don't have

696
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:36,140
power,
why did their fucking faces

697
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,450
honey,
forget about the cell phones.

698
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:45,680
They're not going to make you understand.
You know,

699
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,540
I don't want that to happen.
I don't want that to happen to anybody,

700
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:53,690
but I don't want to be the Sullivan.
You know what I mean?

701
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,970
I want a shot. Just give me a
fucking shot. That's all I need.

702
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,980
I just need some solar panels and a
fucking helicopter and I will get the fuck

703
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:08,330
outta here. That's what you need.
You fucking 80 [inaudible] guns,

704
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,400
Huh? What do you Schwartzenegger
how long is that? Gonna last. Um,

705
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,840
anyways, so I'm thinking about it. Does
anybody, is anybody live in the La area?

706
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:22,560
Does anybody have solar panels anywhere
in the fucking world? Can you recommend,

707
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,120
are there two different kinds?

708
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:29,121
Because I actually looked up
solar panels off the grid and a,

709
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:33,750
I came to this place,
a blue Pacific solar,

710
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,170
it says off grid packages.
Um,

711
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,590
then there's another one that
just says get solar power,

712
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,150
Sun power off grid systems.
Off Grid System.

713
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,150
Backwoods solar electric systems.
Yeah,

714
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,000
I kinda stole that Shit.

715
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:51,960
Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

716
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,100
We're gonna do is we're going to bring
it in and we'll just run it over the

717
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,833
outhouse.

718
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:02,510
Well, what go ban on what's that? A cigar.

719
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:08,420
I'm
sorry.

720
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:14,030
I'm going a stupid fucking
mode this week. Um, yeah. Oh,

721
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:19,010
then there's one for Australia.
I don't mind paying the grid,

722
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:23,840
but I would like to have, if
the grid fails to have the
then off the grid switch.

723
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,640
How about that?
Can we just have that,

724
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,340
those of you who've been
on the Internet this week,

725
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:33,650
you know the direction that I'm working.
Oh yes. You'd do this. Stop being modest.

726
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,890
You know the direction I'm going in.
I'm talking about solar fucking Rhodes.

727
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:43,020
Has anybody seen this, this youtube
video? It's fucking amazing if,

728
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:47,430
if what they're saying is true
about these solar roads. Um,

729
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:50,340
and I apologize for the narrator.
I get what he's doing.

730
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:52,800
He's trying to keep it interesting,

731
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:56,040
but he kept in interesting too long and
then he brings it down to an interlude,

732
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:59,110
which should have come a minute earlier
and then he goes back to screaming.

733
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,220
So it's a little bit annoying, but, uh,

734
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,360
just try to listen to the information
and then try not to get sucked into a

735
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:10,290
George Bush Obama debate because,
uh,

736
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,090
I dunno, I dunno if these things, what
the fuck do I know? Right. But it just,

737
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:20,040
they were basically saying if we replaced
all our roads with these solar fucking

738
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,510
things that literally look,

739
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:25,800
makes it look like Lego land and it's
all lit up and there'd be sensors to let

740
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:26,071
you know,

741
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:29,160
a deer is going around the corner and
then it would just light up in the turn a,

742
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,250
there's a fucking deer around the corner,
you know,

743
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:34,530
enjoy your barley pancakes or whatever.
Right.

744
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,510
For some fucking full on Hippie Shit.

745
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:41,511
And that basically the amount of energy
that it would create would be three

746
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:45,030
times what this country even needed,

747
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,310
which immediately we can just
leave the Middle East. Right.

748
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,510
We don't have to be over there pissing
them off by getting in the middle of

749
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,180
their bullshit.
All right.

750
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,410
We don't have to deal with oil and oil.

751
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:04,980
Money is what funds the terrorist as
far as my limited reading goes. Right.

752
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,110
The, the, the families over there
that, fuck, hang on, she's scratching.

753
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:15,690
I just gave you a bath.
What's wrong? Oh wait.

754
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:20,820
Oh. Um, anyways, uh,

755
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,090
yeah, like the fucking the oil people over
the people who make all the money over

756
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:26,300
there.

757
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:31,180
They then donate to mosques and
then in the moss they fucking,

758
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,870
you know, kind of fucking a, you know,

759
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,600
send it over to these
fucking people over here.

760
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:40,270
That ended up coming back at US
shooting shit at us as far as you know,

761
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,110
like I said, I don't know shit.
Cleo, would you stop fucking,

762
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:48,490
you're going to have to go to the other
room here. Come here buddy. What's up?

763
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,720
Sweden? We went on a nice hike today,
didn't we? Huh? Good food. Good.

764
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,280
All right. Get out of
here. Um, so anyways, um,

765
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,370
yeah, and then that whole fucking
thing is just null and void.

766
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,270
We have all this extra power actually.
Do we create a bunch of jobs?

767
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,580
The only thing I don't
know is the way it looks.

768
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,410
It doesn't seem like it's a smooth ride.

769
00:48:10,411 --> 00:48:13,390
It just seems like the whole
time he'd be gone. Hello?

770
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,820
Like over these fucking things. I
have no idea, but just check it out.

771
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:22,140
And I swear to God, because
this is something that I
don't know if it, if it is,

772
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:26,820
if it does work, if it does fucking
work, it could benefit everybody.

773
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,980
Conservatives, liberals, independence,

774
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,080
everybody who wouldn't benefit from
all of this energy. All that's right.

775
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,760
The people in power. Ah. How
could I forget that? That's real.

776
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,000
How do you think that they're going to
derail this if this actually becomes a

777
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:48,860
movement,
how will they somehow tie in terrorism?

778
00:48:48,861 --> 00:48:53,630
Nine 11 liberals fucking right wing
conservatives and just get this,

779
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:58,520
the pot fucking stern. So everybody's
screaming and yelling, let's go. Let me.

780
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,540
Hell of an ugly, expensive,
and had babies will starve.

781
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,250
They're going to do all of that shit.
Um,

782
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,570
the only way this thing gets
off the ground, if it works,

783
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,503
if it works,

784
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,990
is if people don't get sucked into those
arguments and we all become one and we

785
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:21,580
all pick up a hatchet and we start
marching towards the bankers.

786
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:26,500
Gated communities. Okay?
Because the asphalt streets,

787
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:31,710
we'll have to run red with blue blood
money before something wonderful like this

788
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:35,230
will ever fucking happen
because you are fucking with

789
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:42,090
a century and a half of cashflow
going to a small amount of people,

790
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,190
that's what you're fucking with. And when
you're fucking was something like that,

791
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,440
that level of money, basically the
money that gives the dollar power,

792
00:49:53,441 --> 00:49:57,130
like the only thing gives the u s dollar
powers that oil barrels of oil are

793
00:49:57,131 --> 00:50:00,610
still measured in US dollars. Other
than that, it's a fucking shit show.

794
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,430
So these guys are the
guys behind all of that.

795
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,330
It's them in the fucking bankers
and that's it. All right.

796
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:10,660
The insurance companies like the Ted
Kennedy or that fucking family. All right.

797
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:14,140
But fucking Bobby and Jack.
All right.

798
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,200
Actually the banks have
fun, Joe Kennedy. All right,

799
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:22,200
they'll shut up with the Kennedy Shit.
All right. So anyways, that's my thing.

800
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:25,020
Like this is a great fucking
idea. If it works, if it works,

801
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:29,240
it's a fucking great idea.
Even if you just did a few roads,

802
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,130
if you just did a few of them,

803
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,330
each state just did like their
main highway or whatever.

804
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,670
You just did that.

805
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:43,040
I can't imagine the amount of of money
we'd save and on the less than, Oh man,

806
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,700
it was incorrect.
The possibilities of it are incredible.

807
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:51,680
I don't know if it works, but it is
fucking incredible. But the sad thing is,

808
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,690
um, the fact that whenever
new stuff like this comes up,

809
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,720
it all just turns into a Obama Bush,

810
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,860
Republican, Democrat, blah, blah, blah.

811
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,860
Everybody's just yelling at each other
and then it just fucking goes away.

812
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:11,780
And then everybody turns on sports and
that's what happens. So there you go.

813
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,770
This is all off the grid,
Billy. 15 minutes of crazy talk.

814
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:20,660
But that makes sense to me. Makes
sense to me, man. Fuck, you know,

815
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:26,100
we get this done. Everyone was
so, so, so fucking wear bro. Oh,

816
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,420
Liam liberals out there in Hollywood.
Right. And I gotta tell you, I'm the, I'm,

817
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:34,930
I'm not just making fun of
stereotypical southern guy. All right?

818
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,010
Because having lived
out here in Hollywood,

819
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,270
these people are out of their fucking mind
state. They have Fox News to the left.

820
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:46,550
They're out of their fucking minds that
there does such fucking hypocrites where

821
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:50,900
it's just like, you can say the most, uh,

822
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,290
I guess racist isn't the word.
Cause you can make fun of white people,

823
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,720
rich white people. You can
basically, you can be a,

824
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,060
you can use the exact fucking thing
that they don't like seeing used on poor

825
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:05,360
people against rich people. And
they fucking love it. You know,

826
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,270
you can suggest that people
from the south or all fucking,

827
00:52:08,271 --> 00:52:12,650
they're sisters and they're slapping
their knees and they're doing the wave and

828
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:14,090
the crowd.
All right.

829
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:19,270
But if you suggest any homeless guy
needs to get off his fucking ass,

830
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:23,060
stop boozing and get a fucking
job, then you're the devil. So

831
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,810
I mean, I dunno, does that make
any sense? We'll, it shouldn't.

832
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,330
Isn't that why you're
listening to this podcast?

833
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,400
[inaudible]

834
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,910
solar panels last week,
like I talked

835
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,700
about, I was thinking about maybe
getting solar panels off my house,

836
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,600
off my house on my house.
And uh,

837
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,550
I don't know if I want to go off the grid,

838
00:53:14,551 --> 00:53:18,420
but whatever city of Bacon in
the sun in this fucking house,

839
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,570
that might as well get something out
of it. Right. All right, so here we go.

840
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:24,300
Hi Bill. First off, huge fan of
your comedy podcasts. Thank you.

841
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:28,590
I saw you for a Brian Regan.
Oh, with Brian Regan cobb's
comedy. While that was a,

842
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:32,340
that was a bucket list at night for me
to be able to perform with that guy show

843
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,940
was absolutely hilarious. Well thank you.
And thank you from Brian Regan to um,

844
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,850
anyway,
regarding your question about solar,

845
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,720
there is no solar power that
is completely off the grid.

846
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,430
You use all the energy that you can
provide through solar and the rest that

847
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:52,431
can't be provided by the sun like at
night or if it gets shady on your roof.

848
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,000
The utility provides, this is
called interconnection. Uh,

849
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,020
you save a ton of money and you
use clean energy in the process.

850
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:02,460
I worked for a solar company.

851
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,060
I promise this isn't a bullshit sales
pitch and I manage the construction

852
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,130
timeline,
so I've learned a lot about this stuff.

853
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,110
Here's a link to my company I worked for.

854
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:12,900
We install a lot in la
and in Boston as well too.

855
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,570
I think we're in like 12 different states.
Anyways,

856
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:19,020
thanks you for the awesome podcast and
you know something about this Psoas Shit.

857
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,260
This, every person you talk
to says something different.

858
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,510
I watch people on Youtube
make up a solar thing. Um,

859
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,700
what a solar thing.

860
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:34,680
Put up their solar panels broke
down how they worked and uh,

861
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:38,160
and how you could get off the
grid, but it was really, really,

862
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:42,630
really fucking involved.
This guys dig in a goddamn trench.

863
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,210
I can't remember what the fuck was
going on, but I'm just like, all right,

864
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,930
I don't have room for a trench. All
right. My little piece of property here.

865
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:53,100
So I and I, you know, I got room
for a whole, does that work?

866
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,670
I can't even what he was doing,
they dug this trench,

867
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:00,200
the stuff like a fucking tarpon there.
I don't even know what the heck.

868
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,400
I can't even tell you what's going
on. But um, I will definitely,

869
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,550
I'll definitely look into it.
Um,

870
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:10,160
hopefully I'll have
more luck with you guys.

871
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,230
And the fucking constant put the
roof on this house. Fucking assholes.

872
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:16,160
I told you what they did right.

873
00:55:16,161 --> 00:55:19,550
They put the roof on the house
and then like the drain pipes,

874
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,690
because it's an old house,

875
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,720
old stupid design with a drain off was
it goes down into a pipe that actually

876
00:55:25,731 --> 00:55:30,170
goes into like, uh, I don't, I have
like, uh, my attic is actually,

877
00:55:30,171 --> 00:55:32,270
you ever see seen John Malcovich or being,

878
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,580
being John Malcovich remember they
had that floor, we had to walk around,

879
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:41,510
bent over. Like that's basically
how much space there is between, um,

880
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:46,010
the ceiling on my top
floor and then the roof.

881
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,700
I don't even know what the purpose
of it is. All it is is just,

882
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:54,830
it just traps air that gets heated up and
causes my house to be hot. But anyways,

883
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:55,941
that's what it is.

884
00:55:55,941 --> 00:56:00,941
So the drain off of the water on the
roof goes into a pipe that goes in,

885
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:06,800
into the fucking crawl space and then
back out the front of the house and down

886
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:11,090
the side. So you take water from the
roof, you bring it into the house,

887
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,800
it's inside a pipe,

888
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:17,801
but nevertheless you bring it into the
fucking house and God forbid that pipe

889
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:24,780
bursts or you have some fucking moron
who disconnects it when he's putting the

890
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:30,211
new roof on and forgets to hook it back
up and then tries to blame an yeah,

891
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,850
he blamed it on mobile, you know, the
fucking, all the blah, blah, blah.

892
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:35,310
And I'm just sitting there going, all
right, this is at least a year in court.

893
00:56:35,311 --> 00:56:37,560
You know what? Why don't you
just get the fuck out of here?

894
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,290
I'll just put in a goddamn claim.
You can't.

895
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,850
That's what I did because I didn't
want to go to court. So, um, anyways,

896
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:48,090
I'm hoping you, you're better than
those guys. I mean, how couldn't you be?

897
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:53,340
All right. Here's my favorite one.
This week a solar roadways debunked.

898
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,453
MMM.

899
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,930
I got a note from my gay here,

900
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:02,430
Andrew says a ton of people forwarded
the same link as the one in the email

901
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:05,820
below. I watched this so you don't
have to, it's 30 minutes long.

902
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,750
Basically he bitches about cost and
maintenance and the efficiently if

903
00:57:09,751 --> 00:57:12,740
efficiency of the perks,
advertising original video like heating,

904
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,070
repairing the road. Yeah, I actually
watched the first 10 minutes of it.

905
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,690
Um, I'll save my opinion until I read
this. Uh, Yo Billy, the sunburned kit.

906
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:25,380
I know you were pretty pumped up about
solar roads is be honest. So was I,

907
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,290
but someone's smart sat down
and crunched some numbers,

908
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:32,640
invite up points as well as to why
solar roads are economically in tech.

909
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,300
Technically not feasible.
It's about 30 minutes long.

910
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,110
So if you've got some time to kill
in any airport, check it out. Well,

911
00:57:40,111 --> 00:57:44,880
you know what sir, I watched the first 10
minutes of it. Uh, he didn't debunk them.

912
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:46,830
He just brought up a bunch of questions.

913
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:52,140
He's just like a road has to be durable
and I would have some questions about,

914
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,200
I mean,
they showed a tractor run over the tiles,

915
00:57:55,201 --> 00:57:59,610
but it was a small tractor
and they only did it once. Um,

916
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,700
I would like to see how these,
you know,

917
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:06,990
these things hold up when it's wet
out and you need water to run off.

918
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:11,220
And he just brought up a bunch
of fucking questions. You know,

919
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,910
he didn't debunk them.
He did basically basically what he did,

920
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,980
it's like 50% what you have to do. You
can have somebody just come in and, hey,

921
00:58:19,981 --> 00:58:24,750
these are brand new roads. Can I make
them? Oh, okay. You think they're good,

922
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:27,630
you think they're going to work okay.
I mean, obviously you can't do that,

923
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,620
but it's 50% that, which is smart.
You gotta ask the right questions.

924
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,820
And then the other side is anytime
you try to do something new,

925
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:39,060
there's always people saying
it's not gonna work. You know,

926
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,670
and this guy in his half hour,
I'm sure he brought,

927
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,120
he brought up a number of
things that would be a problem.

928
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,940
It doesn't mean they can't
work. Okay. So I don't,

929
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,260
I wouldn't say they would debunked.

930
00:58:49,261 --> 00:58:53,550
I would just say somebody asked a bunch
of fucking questions and rather than

931
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:56,250
just when what he does is he just
throws it out there. It's like,

932
00:58:56,251 --> 00:59:01,110
why don't you contact the people at the
solar road who tried to make the solar

933
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:04,290
roads and actually get some
answers and get some fucking, uh,

934
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:07,740
or maybe ordered some tiles and tried
to do some experiments yourself rather

935
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:12,180
than wasting people's time with a half
hour of questions and speculation.

936
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,800
That's basically what it was. So I
wouldn't say that it was debunked. Um,

937
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,890
but you know, you throw up three
pointers for a half an hour,

938
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,800
some of them are going
to go in if you suck.

939
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:25,400
So I'm sure a couple of his concerns
were true, but uh, you know,

940
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,560
let me look at electric cars
since way back in the day.

941
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:32,330
People, they show up, they're fucking up.

942
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:36,260
Like people actually questioned
the power of electric electricity.

943
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:40,880
It powers the entire fucking city
can light up a whole fucking city.

944
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:46,070
And I get a Prius and my own mother,
my own mother is going,

945
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,640
can it go up a hill?
No mom,

946
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:53,720
I just got to get out and start walking.
It's great for my weight.

947
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,800
And look at that. They say,
oh they're underpowered and
their this and their that.

948
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:00,860
First of all,
the Prius is not an electric car.

949
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,250
It's not even a fucking 50% electric car.

950
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,890
It's like an 8% electric car.

951
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,580
That's what it is from like zero.

952
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,760
I've told you this guys for years
from zero to seven miles an hour,

953
01:00:15,761 --> 01:00:19,540
that car runs on electric power and then
switches over to gas for the rest of

954
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:21,790
the time.
And if you drive with a lead foot,

955
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:25,150
you're going to get maybe 25
miles a gallon. But if you listen,

956
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:28,000
you listen to the engine,
okay.

957
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:32,200
And you don't stomp on the gas and drive
like a fucking maniac and slam on the

958
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,190
brakes. You can get, you know, I don't,
I wouldn't say 40 miles a gallon.

959
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,170
You can get like 35 but it's great.
Perfect car if you live in, in the city.

960
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,990
I absolutely love the fucking
thing. So anyway, so you had that.

961
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:49,350
I bought that thing in October
of 2007 and now look at these,

962
01:00:50,741 --> 01:00:53,470
these Tesla cars. I actually
wrote in one of those, uh,

963
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:58,300
the end of last year before I wrote in
Casey's fucking truck, Jesus Christ,

964
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,900
which probably gets two feet
to the gallon, especially
the way he was driving it.

965
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,890
Um, those Tesla cars that are, are,

966
01:01:05,891 --> 01:01:10,730
are fucking amazing and you can drive
from last I checked from San Diego,

967
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:13,160
all you have to Vancouver,
um,

968
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,450
you know they have a recharge
stations from San Diego.

969
01:01:17,451 --> 01:01:20,900
All we have to Vancouver and I think
recently someone just drove one across the

970
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:24,760
country. So it's not like that guy
in the speculation video. Um, I'm,

971
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:27,530
I got to look that one up or you
should look it up or whatever. But um,

972
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,770
I'm actually, uh, I'm leaning towards
that fucking thing. Thanks Badass.

973
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,070
You walk up to,
when you turn it on,

974
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:37,280
like the door handles are flush against
the car and you walk up and things pop

975
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:40,420
out. Sure. Other cars do that,
but I never seen it, you know?

976
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:30,763
[inaudible] [inaudible]

977
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:35,761
hey,

978
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:40,740
what's going on and spill bar and it is
the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

979
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:43,680
June the sixth,
2009.

980
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,820
And this is my last couple of
days here in New York City.

981
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,120
I can't wait to get back to,
uh,

982
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:56,300
to Los Angeles even though
everybody fucking trashes that city.

983
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:01,170
I'd never lived in a city where so many
people so openly just fucking trash it.

984
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:06,990
You know what I mean? It's weird.
Hey, where do you live? Oh,

985
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:11,520
I lived in a, I live in Saint
Paul, Minnesota. Oh my God,

986
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:15,870
that place sucks. Those people
are so fucking phony. Yeah.

987
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:20,950
Have another contrived snowball
fight, you know, I dunno,

988
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,140
whatever.
And people always,

989
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:25,890
I love when people go to fucking La is
they go down to fucking right on the

990
01:03:25,891 --> 01:03:30,891
sunset strip and then they fucking talk
about how Hollywood and phony it is.

991
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:35,160
Really.
When you go to Georgia,

992
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:38,590
do you go to Atlanta or do you go
to like fucking Macon, Georgia?

993
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:40,050
And they'd be like,
I can't believe how many of you,

994
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:41,940
I can't believe how many
rednecks there were there.

995
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:45,180
What you fucking went to ground
zero of it yet? Dumb fuck.

996
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,250
Um,
I'm grumpy this week.

997
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,450
I'm grumpy this week cause uh,
I don't want to fucking be here anymore.

998
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,640
I just realized that I don't
want to be here anymore,

999
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:58,590
which is great because this
is my last day of shooting.

1000
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,960
I am having a great time
when I am on the set,

1001
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:05,550
but when I am off to set and I'm trying
to figure out what the fuck I do in a

1002
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:09,360
city that I already lived in
for 12 fucking years, you know,

1003
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,100
what am I going to get another slice?

1004
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:15,900
Am I going to go to central park
for the 90th million fucking times.

1005
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:18,390
90 million fucking time is
what I'm trying to say there.

1006
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:22,950
I was drinking yesterday and
like the afternoon, you know,

1007
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,060
went into watch the red sox
play the mariners at some bar.

1008
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,920
And my buddy,

1009
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:31,560
he came in for the first three innings
and then he left and I was like,

1010
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:32,610
you know what,
I'm going to hang out.

1011
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:38,090
And I just sorta just stayed there and
had like five Heineken's in the middle of

1012
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:38,490
the day.

1013
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:42,210
Now I know all you youngsters out there
like five Heineken's in the middle of

1014
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:47,010
the day. What do you fucking Pussy, what
do I say it? It's, it's all you got.

1015
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:52,100
I don't know what the ages, but there
becomes an age. Jesus Christ look at,

1016
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:55,470
I got like a fucking double Chin
looking at myself in the mirror.

1017
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:56,610
That's when you know you've been boozing.

1018
01:04:56,611 --> 01:05:00,600
If you got to like a fucking two days
scruff and all of a sudden you got like

1019
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:05,470
that Pelican Chin, uh, on
a fucking mess. I like,

1020
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,990
you know, I don't know. I gotta get
Outta here. That's the fucking point.

1021
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:14,240
So anyways,
so I have like five beers and uh,

1022
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:15,320
it was that perfect.
No,

1023
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:19,930
five beers is like that point
where you don't think you're drunk.

1024
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:25,120
So you continue talking to people and uh,
I dunno,

1025
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,583
it just sucks.

1026
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:29,290
Stricken in the middle of day sucks
because you go through the whole fucking

1027
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:34,480
hangover, you know, usually when you just
pass out at the end of the night, I mean,

1028
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:38,380
you sleep through most of your fucking
hangover as opposed to this one where I

1029
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:41,770
came off and I just sort of gradually
came down and I would not off like a

1030
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:46,540
fucking old man and then wake up back
again and just wake up back again.

1031
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:51,040
It doesn't even make any sense.
I'd wake up again. I don't know.

1032
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:54,730
I'm all over the fucking place. I
want to get out of here. I've had it,

1033
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:58,900
fucking had it. I've had it. So anyways,

1034
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:03,550
I went up to see some family over the
4th of July to celebrate the birthday of

1035
01:06:03,551 --> 01:06:07,000
this country. And, um,

1036
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:08,560
as I'm driving up,

1037
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:15,160
I'm listening on the radio and
evidently I looked up the song on,

1038
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,770
uh,
on the Internet.

1039
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:23,230
It's a Carrie Underwood song, who
I don't, I don't know what she is.

1040
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,710
I'm guessing she's white cause it sounded
country and she had a little Twang in

1041
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,400
her voice, but I don't want to
piss off any Koreans out there.

1042
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:33,340
She might've been Korean.
Um,

1043
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,820
is a song called before he cheat.

1044
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:42,130
So I'm driving along and you know,
I'm driving my buddy's car.

1045
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,230
This is how I'm going to
fucking defend myself.

1046
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:47,130
That I was on a radio station that was
actually playing this and I was just sort

1047
01:06:47,131 --> 01:06:51,850
of clicking the, uh, the
preprogram radios. Fucking yeah,

1048
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,830
whatever. You know what I'm saying?
I'm hung, I'm feel like shit.

1049
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,080
Cut me some slack this week. So
anyways, this song comes on and this,

1050
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:04,340
this Carrie Underwood chick is sitting
there singing this song going rat.

1051
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,320
Now he's probably slow dancing.

1052
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,770
Bam Pratt now and she's
singing about her boyfriend.

1053
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,000
I got the lyrics right here.
Right now.

1054
01:07:13,001 --> 01:07:17,830
He's probably buying her some fruity
little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey

1055
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,830
right now. He's probably up
behind her with the pool stick,

1056
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:25,650
showing her how to shoot a
combo. I, then they go into the,

1057
01:07:25,651 --> 01:07:29,130
the chorus and she goes and he don't know,
um,

1058
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,570
that I dug my keys into the side of
his pretty little souped up four wheel

1059
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:37,720
drive,
carve my name and to his leather seats.

1060
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,240
I took a Louisville
slugger to both headlights,

1061
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:43,120
slashed a hole in all four tires.

1062
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,170
And all I could think was,
why don't you just break up with them?

1063
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:52,190
You dumb cunt.
You know what I mean?

1064
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:55,820
What are you going to do?
You're going to do all this shit.

1065
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:00,680
Then he's going to get mad and then what
you're going to make up after five days

1066
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:02,240
and then you're going to blow them again.

1067
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,510
I hate this fucking song and I'm going
to tell you why, because it's, I,

1068
01:08:07,511 --> 01:08:12,440
I'm pretty sure it's a hit.
It's on the radio, right? Uh,

1069
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:13,130
I dunno.

1070
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:17,720
And what do I love about this is people
will listen to this song and they won't

1071
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:21,680
even question the rationale of what
the fuck someone's doing in there.

1072
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,250
Because so many people in life,
myself included,

1073
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:32,870
you, you, you play, you like powerless in
life. You just play the powerless card.

1074
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,113
You know,

1075
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:37,800
just get out of the fucking relationship.

1076
01:08:37,801 --> 01:08:40,890
I fucking hate this song and
this is one of these songs too.

1077
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,280
We're fucking women all get together.
They started saying,

1078
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:46,440
hey gang ass car,

1079
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:51,480
you're all a bunch of dumb cunts.
Okay, you're fucking stupid.

1080
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:55,050
Just break up with the guy.
Just break up with them.

1081
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:00,140
Not even to mention the fact that now
you're going out there and you're,

1082
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:04,230
you're doing damage. You're, I don't know,
is that a fellow that's not a felony?

1083
01:09:04,231 --> 01:09:05,064
I don't know what it is,

1084
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,420
but it's just a classic thing where a
woman would listen to that song and at no

1085
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:13,170
point would she ever think, man,
maybe I could get arrested for this.

1086
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:18,060
I am damaging somebody's property.
No, you gotta fucking Vagina.

1087
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,190
You can just go out in broad daylight.

1088
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,230
You don't even have to
wear a fucking mask.

1089
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:25,590
Do you know what I would have to do
if I wanted to go out and go fuck up

1090
01:09:25,591 --> 01:09:28,740
somebody's car? I would have
to wait for the, first of all,

1091
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,980
I'd have to make sure I had an alibi.
It'd be like I was killing somebody.

1092
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:35,010
I had to make sure somebody could
cover for me and say that I was fucking

1093
01:09:35,011 --> 01:09:36,060
somewhere,
right.

1094
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:41,100
I had to put on some goddamn cat
suit and a fucking a mask. Right?

1095
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:45,320
Like I'm in that dead presidents
movie and all I would able to get,

1096
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,640
I'd be able to get off one quick
hit, right? One quick hit. Let's,

1097
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:52,330
I want to start carving it up
like a pussy. Right? But if I,

1098
01:09:52,331 --> 01:09:55,020
if I really was going to go out there
and smash somebody who's headlights,

1099
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,020
I can hit one and the second
the car alarm goes off,

1100
01:09:58,021 --> 01:10:00,300
I have to fucking take
off and then run home,

1101
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:05,420
get out of my little fucking fucking a
little cat suit and then try to put on my

1102
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:08,460
pajamas.
So when the cops show up,

1103
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,890
because you know they're going to
find some sort of fucking fingerprint,

1104
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,570
I gotta Act like I'm not out of breath.

1105
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,570
Like I actually have been sitting there
for fucking eight hours watching TV.

1106
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,970
I Dunno. I just, I can't stand, you know,
it just reminds me of when that movie,

1107
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:24,150
a fatal attraction came out,
right.

1108
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,480
And the amount of women who would just
sit there and you see that movie? Huh?

1109
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:32,280
Yeah. That's what you get
three you get, you know,

1110
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:36,870
there's no thought of like
this bitch put a rabbit in, in,

1111
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,430
in boiling water.
There's none of that women there.

1112
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,740
They're out of their fucking minds.
But that's not even the point of this.

1113
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:46,470
My point of the Carrie Underwood song,

1114
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:49,770
it actually made me feel like a loser
because the amount of fucking times,

1115
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:51,750
I mean I going out and
fucked up somebody's car,

1116
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:55,230
but the amount of times you don't,
what does that song is? That song?

1117
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,350
It's a powerless song.
That's what the fuck it is.

1118
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:02,640
And I went to the whole lyrics to see if
she breaks up with them in the end and

1119
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:07,050
there's sort of an ambiguous line
in the end where she goes, uh,

1120
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:11,340
cause the next time he cheats,
oh, you know, it won't be on me.

1121
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,010
So that sort of ambiguous because it
could mean because I broke up with them or

1122
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,100
it could be because he doesn't
want to get his truck fucked up.

1123
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,010
So I don't know. You know, I, I just

1124
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:29,280
at just fucking annoys me.

1125
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,850
That song just annoyed the shit out of me

1126
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:38,610
on both levels where you got somebody,
it's like,

1127
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:43,140
just break up with a guy
and your solution is,

1128
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,440
you know, something. If a girl
ever fucking cheated on me that,

1129
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:47,820
that I would break up with them.

1130
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:53,630
I'm not saying I wouldn't flip out
and I give him a good fucking trashing

1131
01:11:53,821 --> 01:11:58,770
verbally, but I would
never go in like, uh, what,

1132
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,950
you know, throw all their clothes
out in the front line and Burnham,

1133
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:09,330
you know, why wouldn't I do
that? I had, I don't know why.

1134
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,930
I think a lot of it has to do because
I'd be fucking worried I'd get arrested

1135
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:14,280
for damaging property.

1136
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,380
Why don't women have an exemption from
damaging property? I don't understand it.

1137
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:26,030
Of a woman sat there
smashing up somebody's car
in broad daylight because the

1138
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:31,050
guy cheated on him. People would
be laughing. I would be laughing.

1139
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,470
Everyone. It's, it's a
comedy. It's just hilarious.

1140
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,860
But if the exact same scenario
was going down in a guy did it,

1141
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,960
he used to be the classic,

1142
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:42,390
you know the cops come and
they put you in that little,

1143
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:46,710
you get tasered and they mush your face
into the fucking pavement. I Dunno,

1144
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:47,310
I get it.

1145
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:50,640
Women have to carry a kid around and
that goddamn stomach for nine months,

1146
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:54,360
but I don't think that gives you the
right to go out and tack somebody Sphero I

1147
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:59,280
really don't. You know, so why don't
you guys just fucking relax. All right.

1148
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:04,080
You're a bunch of Goddamn
Psychos, you know, with your,

1149
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:08,160
I'm on my period excuse. So three weeks
a month, you're out of your fucking mind.

1150
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:13,980
I think if a girl goes, even if you were
cheating on a girl or on a woman, right?

1151
01:13:13,981 --> 01:13:15,120
And she fucks up your car,

1152
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:19,260
I really think you ought to be able to
go up to her and give her a nice fucking

1153
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:22,200
two piece combination to
the Goddamn fucking cabbage.

1154
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,290
What do you think about
that? Right? Just fucking,

1155
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:27,750
just hook off on that fucking

1156
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:33,090
hair teased. Head of lettuce on the
top of her fucking shoulders. Right?

1157
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,070
What would you go with?

1158
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,190
I'm really going to alienate
a lot of my pants on this one.

1159
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,930
And I want you to know that most of this
is not me advocating punching a woman

1160
01:13:42,931 --> 01:13:44,550
in the face.
Most of this is,

1161
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:48,630
I can't fucking sit in this
stupid hotel room anymore.

1162
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,000
I can't fucking do it.
I've had the Goddamn

1163
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:54,990
do not disturb light
on for like four days.

1164
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,410
They probably think I overdosed in here.
I'm really big on that.

1165
01:13:58,411 --> 01:14:01,470
Don't clean up the
room. Beat it. You know,

1166
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,040
you got to come in and every three days
and changes the sheets like I'm royalty.

1167
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,460
I changed the sheets like
fucking once every three weeks.

1168
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,380
Maybe that's, that's only if they have
white and I can tell how filthy they are.

1169
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:17,290
That's right. Wrinkle your nose
up. You fucking pompous broads.

1170
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:21,520
That's how I live my life. Um,
Jesus. Why am I attacking women?

1171
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,310
I don't know why. What did I
talk about? Oh yeah. If you,

1172
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,850
if you could punch a woman in a face,
you allow two punches,

1173
01:14:27,851 --> 01:14:31,540
what would you go with?
Okay. What'd you go? Classic.

1174
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:35,980
Would you set up the overhand right with
the jab? Would you actually waste a jet?

1175
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,970
You know, waste a jab which you go,

1176
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,810
this is just evil. All right, I gotta get
off this fucking subject. I don't know,

1177
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:45,910
that song just annoyed me.
Um,

1178
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:50,410
I hate those fucking songs when women
just just openly talk about how they're

1179
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:53,710
going to go out and destroy a guy's
fucking property rather than break up with

1180
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:58,750
them, you know, and it's considered
some sort of justification, you know,

1181
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:03,700
rather than looking inward going, you
know, maybe I'm a bad judge of character.

1182
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:08,890
What sort of qualities are
am I looking for in somebody?

1183
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:11,050
And I'll date that.
I mean,

1184
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,920
didn't the fact that the guy had a
souped up four wheel drive truck,

1185
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,910
didn't that give it all up within that?
Give it away on any fucking level,

1186
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:24,580
Huh? I mean a souped up four wheel
drive truck. Carrie Underwood,

1187
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,140
you dumb fucking, what
else did he have? Huh? Uh,

1188
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:31,500
a fucking earring hanging down with
a lightening bolt on the side of it.

1189
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,800
It had this fucking song sticks.
This is one of the,

1190
01:15:35,801 --> 01:15:39,010
you know why I hate to sign this and
I'm going to do my whole podcast on this

1191
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:39,820
fucking song.

1192
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:43,870
This is going to be one of those fucking
songs when I'm on the road and I'm

1193
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:45,850
hating my life,
you know,

1194
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,690
and I just don't want to go back to the
hotel room and be lonely and I'm going

1195
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:54,691
to go out to a bar and that song's gonna
come on and fucking four fucking twats

1196
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,210
with their ear piercing.
I'm singing and I'm drunk.

1197
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:02,110
High pitch voices are going to start
singing every fucking word of that song.

1198
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:06,410
Liked it.
They like these fucking cunt bad asses.

1199
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:11,390
Okay. And I'm done. All right. I'm done
with that. I'm done with that fucking Ah,

1200
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,510
Jesus Christ.
That fucking song annoyed me.

1201
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,430
What a fucking loser that
Carrie Underwood is. Huh?

1202
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,730
Is that an anthem for all you
broads out there? You know,

1203
01:16:22,731 --> 01:16:25,700
I love about this is I'm really like,
I'm really taking the,

1204
01:16:25,701 --> 01:16:29,000
literally the dumbest
demographic of women and a,

1205
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,040
and I'm just fucking super imposing
it over all women and I'm doing it on

1206
01:16:35,571 --> 01:16:37,350
purpose because this,

1207
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:40,580
cause I'm childish this week
I'm fucking in a bad mood.

1208
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,820
And um,
you know,

1209
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:49,520
rather than doing some yoga and going
out and getting a Veggie Omelet or

1210
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:53,480
whatever dumb shit you're supposed to do,
what you look at my fucking face,

1211
01:16:53,481 --> 01:16:55,250
this bloated booze face.

1212
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,800
Oh Jesus Christ. What happened? I
wasn't, you know, my life was great.

1213
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:06,300
I came to New York on, okay,
this is awesome. You know,

1214
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:10,880
live in a dream here and I'm gonna, I'm
gonna eat right. I'm not gonna drink.

1215
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,970
I'm going to work out every day.
And you know,

1216
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:19,220
I don't know what happened. Oh, I
know. What happened was the, this,

1217
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,490
the second day I got here was my birthday.

1218
01:17:22,491 --> 01:17:26,270
So you got a drink on your birthday
and then I just got the booze coursing

1219
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:31,130
through my veins and then it's just,
it's just been a, it's just been a,

1220
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:35,030
I can't even say drunken debauchery.
It's just been sort of sad old man.

1221
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:40,940
I've kind of been sitting there like norm
in cheers. If he didn't know anybody,

1222
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:41,840
you know,

1223
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,840
cliff Klavan didn't come in and butcher
his name with his bad Boston accent a

1224
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:53,210
then Nami nom. It's norm.
Just take the r out.

1225
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,570
If you want to do a Boston accent, that's
what you do. You just take the r out.

1226
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:00,950
Everything doesn't become an ae. I know
I've mentioned that before, but uh,

1227
01:18:00,951 --> 01:18:03,380
you know how the deal is people
in North Dakota. I went there,

1228
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:07,130
Fargo when I brought up that movie
and they were just like, dude,

1229
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:10,070
we don't fucking talk like that.
That movie was annoying,

1230
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:14,360
but everyone else thought it was hilarious
because how many of us have ever been

1231
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:18,980
to Fargo, North Dakota and the
same thing with chairs, you know,

1232
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:23,600
everybody thinks, oh, that's, that's
how they say norm. They say Nami.

1233
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:27,590
Now they don't, they
say, no, I'm all right.

1234
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:30,950
Does this make any fucking sense?
This is just like, I am like a,

1235
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:33,050
I'm just cutting to the week right now.
Um,

1236
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,040
what else did I want to talk about
that I do? Anything this week,

1237
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:39,620
I don't think I did anything.
I started to read a book,

1238
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,630
just reading a book on the mob.

1239
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,450
Why don't I just start reading
some shit cause I'm actually,

1240
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,670
this is my last day of
shooting and I'm excited.

1241
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:51,200
I'm really excited about
this scene because I have
the most lines of any scene,

1242
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:56,120
you know, and uh, and he seen
that I, that I've been in,

1243
01:18:57,110 --> 01:19:00,290
which means I have 1.5 not kidding,
actually get like two or three lines,

1244
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:04,520
which is going to be cool. And I'm
really excited to do this shit, but, uh,

1245
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,840
I got to get this fucking
podcast out of the way.

1246
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:11,240
Can you tell I'm scrolling
down. Um, all right, here's one.

1247
01:19:11,241 --> 01:19:14,990
I got this dude in England who
always fucking emails me and uh,

1248
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:20,860
I guess he was sick of me not re
reading his questions or whatever.

1249
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:25,610
So in the title, whatever you call it,
the subject line, he said, read this,

1250
01:19:25,611 --> 01:19:30,110
you fucking cunt. So of course I
have to open it. And he said, sorry,

1251
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:33,050
you're not a content. I just need to
get your attention. All right. Hey,

1252
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:36,620
bill dynamite podcast. This week
or should I say last week? Well,

1253
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:40,740
because it's Wednesday and, oh,
look, no Monday morning podcasts,

1254
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:44,390
because I was really looking forward to
hearing you talk about your dog for 40

1255
01:19:44,391 --> 01:19:49,010
minutes again, dude, we get it.
You have a dog. No one cares.

1256
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,873
Be funnier.

1257
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:55,220
That's my main point.

1258
01:19:55,430 --> 01:20:00,430
Also renamed the podcast bill birth
speaks for 40 minutes because for a start,

1259
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:05,540
it's hardly ever out on a Monday.
And also you do ramble aimlessly.

1260
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:13,150
Uh, it's called a podcast. You fucking
moron. What do you think a podcast is?

1261
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,800
Are there a bunch of podcasts out there
where people aren't babbling aimlessly?

1262
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:24,130
Podcasts are basically fucking radio shows
for people who weren't good enough to

1263
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,550
be on the fucking radio.

1264
01:20:25,551 --> 01:20:29,540
So I don't know what's what level
of quality you're looking for here,

1265
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:32,390
but you're really need to lower
your standards. All right,

1266
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:35,660
and who the fuck says dynamite?
Are they still saying that over there?

1267
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,370
Did you guys just get good times?

1268
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:38,813
Okay.

1269
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:42,640
All right. Here we go. Let's
continue here. Um, anyways, uh,

1270
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:46,340
I'm not trying to trash you because
sometimes it's great. Oh, that's cool.

1271
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,780
I'm glad.
Sometimes it's great.

1272
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:51,620
I just think bill birth speaks
for 40 minutes is a better title.

1273
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:56,660
Take a lead my advice, but my main point,
stop talking about the dog. It kills me.

1274
01:20:56,690 --> 01:21:00,960
I fast forward when,
when, uh, when you do,

1275
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:04,080
nobody cares about your fucking dog.
But apart from that,

1276
01:21:04,081 --> 01:21:08,820
the show is great and I love your
work. One quick question. Um,

1277
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,730
I can see how it'd be annoying
if I was talking to my dog.

1278
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,430
I know there's a bunch of animal lovers
right now. Listen to this going. No,

1279
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:19,290
I really enjoy it. Um, fuck you
dude. I love my dog. All right.

1280
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,590
Why don't you go get some fish and chips
and not brush your teeth or whatever

1281
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:25,380
other hacky fucking thing
you guys do over there. Huh?

1282
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:31,550
Geeta pork chop for breakfast.
Yeah, man. I'm trying to think.

1283
01:21:31,551 --> 01:21:33,710
The last good looking person
that came from England,

1284
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,990
pay towns in with that warp knows.

1285
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:43,000
Was there anybody good
looking even what's his face?

1286
01:21:43,001 --> 01:21:47,560
Roger Daltrey who wasn't shape, but
his face is just, it's just beat.

1287
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:51,460
Just beat down, man. You just weathered,
weathered, fucking people over there.

1288
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:56,470
Um, I can't, I don't think I've ever
remembered that anybody ever say,

1289
01:21:56,650 --> 01:22:00,970
and they met some hot chicken England.
I've heard it. You know, you go to France,

1290
01:22:00,971 --> 01:22:05,710
you go to Sweden,
you know you go to Spain,

1291
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:10,180
right? You go to Puerto Rico, there's
all kinds of fucking hot women.

1292
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,990
You go to England, Dude,
look at the royal family.

1293
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,220
Actually,
Princess Diana was kind of hot,

1294
01:22:19,221 --> 01:22:23,690
but she had weird fucking hands and feet.
She looked like she was part lizard.

1295
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:26,140
She was, did she look like a
beautiful lizard? That's what she,

1296
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:31,340
that's what she looked like. And
Prince Charles looks like, um, uh,

1297
01:22:31,341 --> 01:22:31,761
you know what?

1298
01:22:31,761 --> 01:22:35,210
I don't have the fucking
medical background to talk
about how inbred that guy is.

1299
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,280
You know what I mean? But he
just basically, I don't know.

1300
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:41,470
I don't know what he has.

1301
01:22:41,471 --> 01:22:45,130
He has one of whatever the fuck he has
and it's all the same coursing through

1302
01:22:45,131 --> 01:22:48,610
his fucking body, whatever.
If I fell a regular mug,

1303
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,890
human being has to shut up hill.

1304
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:53,710
You're too fucking stupid to go through
with this. All right, one quick question,

1305
01:22:53,711 --> 01:22:58,660
Bill. How long did it take to
crack? The standup scene. I mean,

1306
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:01,600
when you started getting
decent money and radio spots.

1307
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,840
Uh,
let's see.

1308
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,670
Well took me three and a half
years before I quit my day job,

1309
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:14,671
but I was living at home and I saved
every dime that I made from work that I

1310
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:19,870
could. And I also saved every
dime that I was making from um,

1311
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:24,850
stand up and I basically
saved up 10 grand,

1312
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,490
uh,
which believe it or not,

1313
01:23:27,491 --> 01:23:31,690
you can do if you don't run out
and buy every new fucking I iPhone,

1314
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:36,280
iPod and all laptops and all that shit.
I didn't do any of that.

1315
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:41,650
I just dressed like Malcolm young
and ACDC jeans and tee shirt.

1316
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,120
I had a fucking,

1317
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:47,410
I had this old pickup truck that
I used to drive two wheel drive,

1318
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:52,150
one of the little little ones.
And I drove that until it fucking died.

1319
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:58,170
And I was at this critical point where
I was only a year into my standup career

1320
01:24:00,311 --> 01:24:02,170
and I needed a reliable car,

1321
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,100
but I also didn't want to
be chained to my job by,

1322
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:10,090
by buying a new car, which is the
dumbest fucking thing you can do.

1323
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,350
If you're in your 20s and you got
some job and it's not your business,

1324
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:17,560
it's not your own business and you know
you want to leave it at some point,

1325
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:20,800
that dumbest fucking thing you can
do is go out and buy a brand new car.

1326
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,020
You just change yourself to your desk.
I know I've said this before,

1327
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,550
but it's like that.
You don't remember,

1328
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:32,551
you remember in a Bronx tale when those
bikers are acting like assholes and they

1329
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,740
ask them to leave and they don't
leave and then they fucking, you know,

1330
01:24:35,741 --> 01:24:40,120
put the thing on the door and then Chazz
Palminteri goes, now you can't leave.

1331
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,061
You're,
you're,

1332
01:24:41,061 --> 01:24:45,010
you're doing the financial equivalent
of that scene when you go out and buy a

1333
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:47,920
brand new fucking car. Okay, first of all,

1334
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,230
you can afford a good car.

1335
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:55,680
You just going to get some generic fucking
twenty thousand twenty five thousand

1336
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:59,350
dollars stupid ass fucking car.
And it's, it's, it's gonna,

1337
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,050
it's gonna change the death.
So long story short,

1338
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:05,530
what I did was instead of
buying a new car was I, I just,

1339
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,160
I had a new engine put in my
putting my truck and everybody,

1340
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:13,190
all the fucking people at work told me
that said, dumbest thing, do what do you,

1341
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,920
what do you or do for you?
Fuck them.

1342
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:19,330
A really cost me 50 [inaudible] at the
time because it costs about 1500 bucks to

1343
01:25:19,331 --> 01:25:20,470
get the whole thing done.
Right.

1344
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:25,090
As opposed to have a $15,000 car loan.

1345
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:29,200
I had the fucking engine paid off, you
know, on about four or five months.

1346
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,930
Then I had no car payment
again and I could,

1347
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:35,080
I could use that to put
towards my nest egg. And My,

1348
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:39,130
my idea when I went down to New York
was I was going to get a day job,

1349
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,980
but uh, you know, a w you know,

1350
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:45,580
I waited a couple of weeks
before I started looking
and I started doing standup

1351
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:49,420
and then I got a couple of gigs and they
were on the road so I couldn't get a

1352
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:53,680
day job. And believe me, my
10 grand was fucking going
down, down, down, down, down.

1353
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:58,540
But it bought me enough
fucking time where I could, uh,

1354
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,850
I could get in with the clubs,
start getting gigs. And,

1355
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,520
um,
what ended up happening,

1356
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:11,900
I think I went all the way down
to like fucking 2,500 bucks.

1357
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:18,030
And uh,
I think that's when,

1358
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,300
then I started booking shit.
That's what happened.

1359
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:23,600
Then I started booking shit
and I was able to sustain,

1360
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:28,100
um,
it didn't dip below 2,500,

1361
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:30,890
but it didn't really get
above three grand either.

1362
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:32,540
I got to that point where I could,

1363
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:36,260
I could basically pay my bills and uh,

1364
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:38,750
that's also back when somebody
told me about, you know,

1365
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,710
paying off your fucking credit cards,
um,

1366
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,620
every month so you don't get fucked
with the, uh, on the interest.

1367
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:48,980
I started doing that and I basically,

1368
01:26:48,981 --> 01:26:52,490
I ate spaghetti like every fucking night.
Pasta is a really cheap meal.

1369
01:26:52,491 --> 01:26:55,880
It fills you up. I told you about this
shit before and when I went on the road,

1370
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:59,570
I would go to Denny's or the international
house of pancakes and I get the large

1371
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:01,010
stack of pancakes in the morning.

1372
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:05,690
I get the five stack and they would sit
in my stomach like fucking cement and I

1373
01:27:05,691 --> 01:27:09,680
could literally go from like eight in
the morning to eight at night without

1374
01:27:09,681 --> 01:27:11,480
eating.
And you know,

1375
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:15,800
I drive my little rented fucking dodge
neon to some college gig. There you go.

1376
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:18,470
When you get a college Gig, that's a big
thing. So about three and a half years.

1377
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,110
All right, I'm sorry dude.
Was that fucking boring?

1378
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:25,010
I know I didn't talk about my dog
and do an am just breaking your balls

1379
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:27,620
sometimes like people give me shit and I
give him shit back and people think I'm

1380
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:31,850
serious. I really don't give a fuck.
Um, all right, now here's is overrated,

1381
01:27:31,851 --> 01:27:35,600
underrated list. Overrated
bill burrs dog. No one cares.

1382
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:40,670
Bruce Springsteen, bloated overrated
stadium rocker. Barack Obama.

1383
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:44,330
He can't,
he can't hide behind the black forever.

1384
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,670
The economy is still fucked.

1385
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,010
Ah, Jesus Christ. Dude, did
you even proof read this?

1386
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:56,540
He can't hide behind the black forever.
The economy is still fucked. Um,

1387
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:00,860
dude, I dunno if you fucking
notice, but we had a, uh,

1388
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:06,680
we've had a war for a good fucking seven
years to the tune of $1 billion a month

1389
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:11,681
and bankers loaned out money to homeless
people and we had to bail them out.

1390
01:28:11,811 --> 01:28:16,580
So I think I don't give a shit who the
fuck you are. Republican, Democrat,

1391
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:20,120
liberal, conservative.
Fucking independent.

1392
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:24,320
You're not getting us out of this,
which is why I am going to Sweden.

1393
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,710
I have a gig coming up in
Sweden and the end of August,

1394
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,330
I'm going to start doing a
Australia once a year. Um,

1395
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:36,140
this talks about me going to Dublin.
These fucking overseas gigs,

1396
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:39,200
they're very hard to get. You know,
shit usually ends up falling out,

1397
01:28:39,201 --> 01:28:43,910
but that's my thing. All right. If
these corporations are going global,

1398
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:48,320
going global too. I want to give a fuck.
I'll be the Goddamn James Bond. A comedy.

1399
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:53,090
James Bond, I dunno.
International Man of jokes. Um,

1400
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:55,130
underrated arctic monkeys.

1401
01:28:56,270 --> 01:29:00,740
It's a great British band from
Sheffield, England, cocaine,

1402
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:05,610
brilliant song by Eric Clapton. Dude, you
must be young. Okay? That song's great.

1403
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:10,430
The first 40,000 times
you hear it, but id, Eh,

1404
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:17,220
um, underrated football slash soccer,
easily the best sport ever. Hands down.

1405
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:19,770
Um, you know what? I wouldn't argue that.

1406
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,210
I wouldn't argue that because
if you actually, if you,

1407
01:29:22,211 --> 01:29:23,430
if you watch American soccer,

1408
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,710
it's sucks like an American
team versus an American team.

1409
01:29:25,711 --> 01:29:27,330
But if you watch that oversee shit,

1410
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:32,900
you know where people fucking die and
people get trampled in crushed to death

1411
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:38,190
and then they go on youtube and talk about
how dumb Americans are. Um, you know,

1412
01:29:38,191 --> 01:29:39,960
you'd think what those
awful English teeth,

1413
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:42,810
you can eat your way through the fence
when you're getting crushed up against,

1414
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:52,290
uh, the people in England even have
bad teeth or is my entire fucking, uh,

1415
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:57,600
understanding of England, basically
three Austin power movies. All right?

1416
01:29:57,601 --> 01:30:01,530
Probably is. All right, let's talk
about grenades again this week.

1417
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,740
Um, I asked somebody,
when you throw a grenade,

1418
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:07,980
how long do you have before the fucking
thing goes off? And it said, Bill,

1419
01:30:07,981 --> 01:30:12,480
three to four seconds sounds about
right. Uh, I'm still amazed at that.

1420
01:30:12,481 --> 01:30:16,860
Crazy son of a bitch who was filming,
didn't use a tripod or some shit. Oh yeah.

1421
01:30:16,861 --> 01:30:20,730
If you guys want to see what a
fucking grenade does, go on youtube.

1422
01:30:20,731 --> 01:30:24,890
Look up grenade in washing machine.
I believe that's what you search. Uh,

1423
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:27,000
some Army Guy, cause I
asked last week, you know,

1424
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:29,180
whenever you see a those army movies,

1425
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,870
somebody dives on a fucking
grenade and uh, you know,

1426
01:30:33,871 --> 01:30:37,290
saves the life of his
comrades. Um, I dunno,

1427
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,840
this conflicting advice that I got
on this shit. You know what dude,

1428
01:30:39,841 --> 01:30:42,140
I'm fucking losing it right now.
This podcast is,

1429
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:46,800
is quickly spinning out of control
because I haven't eaten yet. And uh,

1430
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,800
I have an early pickup today
and if I don't do it now,

1431
01:30:49,801 --> 01:30:51,330
it's not going to be coming out on Monday.

1432
01:30:51,331 --> 01:30:55,280
So I why I'm just gonna
Start Reading Shit here. Um,

1433
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:58,280
all right. If you want to talk
about weaponry, what's the,

1434
01:30:58,410 --> 01:31:02,320
what is the question I asked last
week? Oh, I asked, I asked, uh,

1435
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:05,970
if there's any people in the military,
if they had any combat stories,

1436
01:31:05,971 --> 01:31:08,880
because I was talking about,
you know,

1437
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:11,160
whenever you fantasize about going to war,

1438
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:15,750
you always picture yourself doing some
Rambo Shit. But in the back of your head,

1439
01:31:15,751 --> 01:31:20,490
you know that there's a strong possibility
that you might be that fucking dude

1440
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,370
who when the shit goes down,
you can't move.

1441
01:31:23,371 --> 01:31:28,371
You freeze or you fucking balled
up in the fetal position crying.

1442
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:34,440
You know, I heard a story one time is
sometimes in battle people just stand up.

1443
01:31:34,441 --> 01:31:37,620
They can't deal with it anymore and
they just kill themselves. Granted,

1444
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,800
I heard that from my high school teacher
who's teaching the English and uh,

1445
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:47,610
he had never been to war, you
know, so that's probably bullshit.

1446
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:50,850
Um, anyway, so here's a guy that
actually went to combat. He said, Bill,

1447
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:53,700
you asking your podcasts about the
first time you're outside the wire,

1448
01:31:53,701 --> 01:31:58,701
which is military jargon for leaving
protected base in Iraq or Afghanistan.

1449
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,160
And this dude said, I was absolutely
terrified for the first couple of weeks.

1450
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:06,820
But the trick is that you can't let
anybody around you know that you're scared

1451
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:09,670
because you don't want, you don't
want to look like a pussy. Uh,

1452
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:11,770
the rules of engagement are strict.

1453
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,670
We were ordered to not
shoot back unless we could.

1454
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:19,740
We could see who was shooting at us.
Is that true?

1455
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:24,970
You couldn't shoot back unless you saw
who was shooting back at you? Dude, uh,

1456
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:29,980
I would break that rule if I wasn't on
the ground crying in the fetal position.

1457
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,630
Oh my God, this young man
is, I don't want to do this.

1458
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,810
If I could actually get past that,

1459
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:39,650
I would be definitely shooting in the
general fucking direction of wherever it

1460
01:32:39,651 --> 01:32:42,560
was through fuck that.
Fuck that.

1461
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:48,620
This war is different from other wars and
so far as we are fighting right in the

1462
01:32:48,621 --> 01:32:53,600
middle of where normal people lived and
we tried hard not to kill any of them.

1463
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:59,000
Um, you know what, I'm not a
student of military history,

1464
01:32:59,001 --> 01:33:03,770
but I think most wars are kind
of where people are at. Um,

1465
01:33:03,771 --> 01:33:07,310
I think back in the revolutionary days
that you would go out and stand in a line

1466
01:33:07,311 --> 01:33:10,640
out in the field or even in the civil war.

1467
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:16,130
But, uh, I know they had
the front in World War One,

1468
01:33:16,131 --> 01:33:21,131
but at some point when you're kicking
the other teams as you end up in their

1469
01:33:21,141 --> 01:33:25,130
backyard, cause a lot of them
don't just give up like, well you,

1470
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:26,930
you beat us on our field.

1471
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:32,360
We wouldn't want to go into this town
and hide amongst the civilians. You know,

1472
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:36,610
am I wrong there on PR? I don't
know if I'm wrong. How do,

1473
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,920
how does Dresden happen if, if, if

1474
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,670
you know,
I don't know.

1475
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:45,283
Okay.

1476
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,760
Well I don't fucking know,
Dude. I'm out of it. Let's,

1477
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:50,970
let's just get to the fucking
questions for the week and uh,

1478
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,550
well I can, I can gradually fucking
bail out of this thing. Um, oh, okay.

1479
01:33:57,551 --> 01:34:02,110
Overrated. Underrated Bill. People
Bitch about the, uh, gas prices are a,

1480
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,850
I guess over a to bill people bitch
about the greedy oil companies whenever

1481
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:11,770
there are high gas prices and also about
how there are no alternative energy

1482
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:13,420
options for transportation.

1483
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,240
What they don't seem to understand
is that no sane entrepreneur,

1484
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:20,500
entrepreneur is going to invest in diamond
developing alternative energy until

1485
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:24,900
gas gets to $10 a gallon and people are
converting their vacuum cleaners into

1486
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:29,950
segues to get to work. We can
either have one or the other. Um,

1487
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:34,630
dude, um, it's not quite as
simplistic as that. Yeah,

1488
01:34:34,631 --> 01:34:38,080
there definitely has to be some sort
of outrage from the people. But uh,

1489
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:40,130
okay.

1490
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:42,500
You know what,
rather than get into fucking details,

1491
01:34:42,501 --> 01:34:47,501
look up a guy stand mayor m e y e r at
this guy actually came up with a car that

1492
01:34:48,441 --> 01:34:52,190
ran on water, rain water,
fresh water, salt water.

1493
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:55,880
It didn't make a fucking difference and
he basically figured out a way where you

1494
01:34:55,881 --> 01:34:57,140
could get across the country,

1495
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:02,320
14 and a half gallons and the
dumb fuck told people about it,

1496
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:05,270
went to the news, they
announced it on, uh,

1497
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:07,610
we played it on the opiod Anthony show.

1498
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:12,050
They talked about it on the news and then
they said that there was somebody from

1499
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:13,730
the Pentagon who is so excited.

1500
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:16,790
They sent a lieutenant colonel
out there to check out his device.

1501
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,780
Basically what happens is when you come
up with some shit like that is they go

1502
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:24,860
out there and they, they sort of tell
you that it's very wise for you to buy,

1503
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,900
to sell them the patent of it, you
know? And then if you don't play ball,

1504
01:35:29,901 --> 01:35:34,820
you mysteriously die four or five years
later and your invention disappears.

1505
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:39,170
Stand mayor, look it up. That's what
the fuck happens. All right dude. Um,

1506
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:41,750
I've always used the iPod.
I used to do a bit about this shit.

1507
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:46,010
You're telling me basically that I can
have my entire fucking record collection,

1508
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:50,210
you know,
8,000 fucking songs in my pocket,

1509
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:54,140
but they can't come up with the car that
can't do better with the gas mileage.

1510
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:57,890
Dude. It's all bullshit. Would you
basically have at the top is you have ra,

1511
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,580
the robber baron,
blue blood blood families and uh,

1512
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:06,110
some of the underworld guys who went
legitimate and the government is middle

1513
01:36:06,111 --> 01:36:10,640
management for these mother fuckers and
the guys at the top, they run everything.

1514
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:14,960
Banks are at the top and
then the blue blood guys,

1515
01:36:14,961 --> 01:36:19,880
I think the corporations are the next
level. And then it's the politicians.

1516
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:23,570
Okay. And this is coming from a
completely uninformed jackass. Fuck that.

1517
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:26,390
I've read a couple of books,
but I think that that's what's going on.

1518
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:29,660
That's what's going on.
And you know,

1519
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,350
I don't know how you can invent shit
nowadays and actually get it up to the

1520
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:34,184
public.

1521
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:38,750
You have to basically be working for a
corporation that has the money to put it

1522
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,440
out there. So then basically they
own it. You know what I mean?

1523
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:48,020
I guess you could kind of try and be the
Tyler Perry of fucking inventing shit.

1524
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:51,650
Um, you know, what, can I just
tap out of this fucking podcast?

1525
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,200
I don't even know what the hell I'm
talking about. I'm fucking on the road.

1526
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:57,500
I'm lonely. I want to see my fucking
dog. I want to get back to my girl.

1527
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:02,090
I'm going to get back to my fucking life
and I want to do a good job today on

1528
01:37:02,091 --> 01:37:06,470
set. So I don't fuck this thing up because
I've had a great God damn time. And,

1529
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:08,480
um,
I fly back

1530
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:14,600
in a couple of days and a
couple of fucking days and
I'm really looking forward

1531
01:37:14,601 --> 01:37:15,920
to it. Oh, did I tell you guys I a,

1532
01:37:15,921 --> 01:37:18,740
I bought the hangover when
I was drunk in the bar.

1533
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:23,200
I bought the hangover of
some fucking, uh, I dunno,

1534
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:27,200
50 year old Asian woman came
walking in, you know, it was great.

1535
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:30,860
It was like fucking
portable,

1536
01:37:30,861 --> 01:37:35,570
a blockbuster video and I bought
the hangover for five bucks.

1537
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:41,240
Great bootleg copy only a couple of times.
Did somebody stand up and walk by?

1538
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:41,931
Do you guy?
You know,

1539
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:45,290
that's the great thing about living in
New York as is all the bootleg movies

1540
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:46,370
that she can fucking buy.

1541
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:50,780
And it basically someone just goes into
the movie theater with a video camera

1542
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:54,650
and they just film the screen and it's
great cause you can hear other people

1543
01:37:54,651 --> 01:37:57,750
laughing.
It's kind of like mystery science theater.

1544
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,400
And then somebody kind of adjusts their,

1545
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:03,210
their seat in front and all of a sudden
you see somebody's head and you're

1546
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:05,370
trying to look around it,
you know,

1547
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:09,570
or somebody just gets up in the middle
and starts walking down the row and it's,

1548
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:14,520
it's funny to me, but, uh, I actually,
I saw it, man. I was all right.

1549
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:20,040
It was, it was fucking all right. I
guess five bucks. Can you compliant?

1550
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:20,761
Can you complain?

1551
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:24,450
I wish I met this lady at the beginning
of my fucking a trip out here.

1552
01:38:24,451 --> 01:38:27,510
I would've had, I would've
bought like 58 of them. Yeah.

1553
01:38:27,511 --> 01:38:31,030
So next time you're in New York,
all right.

1554
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:35,400
In the cute little Asian lady comes
walking and going, am I really doing this?

1555
01:38:35,401 --> 01:38:38,400
Am I advocating the stealing of
shit? I think it's over. Anyways.

1556
01:38:38,401 --> 01:38:41,940
People send me emails. Hey, I listened
to all your running forums. Uh,

1557
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:44,670
I downloaded them for free.
Sorry.

1558
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:47,580
They always got to tell you that they got
your shit for free. And then they say,

1559
01:38:47,581 --> 01:38:49,800
sorry.
You know what I mean?

1560
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:55,890
I pay for my music's, you fucking cunts
pay for my comedy. All right. Whatever.

1561
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,140
That's the end of this podcast.
Um,

1562
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:04,410
literally dizzy right now. Uh,
the fuck am hyping. All right,

1563
01:39:04,411 --> 01:39:07,440
next week I go back to my
life as a standup comedian.

1564
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:12,330
I'm going to be at the punchline
in San Francisco, uh, on Monday,

1565
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,950
July the 13th,

1566
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:17,760
and I'm doing two shows and it's going
to be just like the last time where I'm

1567
01:39:17,761 --> 01:39:21,810
going to try to do as little material
from my act as humanly possible and I'm

1568
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:25,620
just going to tell you some fucked
up stories, uh, from my childhood,

1569
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:30,390
from my dating life to
uh, to whatever, you know.

1570
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:35,070
Um, and then the following week I'm going
to be at the comedy works in Denver,

1571
01:39:35,071 --> 01:39:39,900
Colorado. Um, that's
the 23rd, 24th and 25th.

1572
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,250
And then I believe I'm gearing
up to do another special,

1573
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:48,900
so I'm going to be on the road
pretty much right through August,

1574
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:51,390
September, October, November and December.

1575
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:56,410
I am pretty much going to be doing three
out of four weeks on the road and um,

1576
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:03,000
I'm going to be getting this fucking
special together and hopefully I will be

1577
01:40:03,001 --> 01:40:04,770
shooting it in San Francisco.
That is,

1578
01:40:04,771 --> 01:40:09,030
that is the goal to shoot
it in San Francisco and uh,

1579
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:12,480
to have a very funny, memorable, special,
that's what the fuck I want to do.

1580
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:16,710
And the stress of it is already
starting to hit me because, uh,

1581
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:22,650
I dunno, you know, you don't want it
to suck. You don't want it to suck.

1582
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:27,600
The reality is, is I wish I had another
fucking six months just because I'm lazy,

1583
01:40:27,601 --> 01:40:32,460
but I know if it on bullshit. All right.
I'm just, I'm just really, I'm babbling.

1584
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:33,510
I need nourishment.

1585
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:37,050
I need to stop drinking and I need to
go downstairs under the treadmill and

1586
01:40:37,051 --> 01:40:41,460
somehow get some of this fucking booze
weight out of my Goddamn Chin. All right,

1587
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:44,700
that it, that's the Monday
morning podcast. Um, I,

1588
01:40:44,701 --> 01:40:47,590
if I had to critique this podcast,
I would say would,

1589
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:52,110
it was like when evil Knievel tried to
jump the snake river in that rocket,

1590
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,360
you know, where it started off fast and
you thought I was going to fuck them.

1591
01:40:55,361 --> 01:40:57,550
That's what the I did.
Do you know what happened to this podcast?

1592
01:40:57,551 --> 01:40:59,710
The fucking parachute came
out halfway through it,

1593
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:04,690
and then I just slowly went down towards
the snake river and actually have a

1594
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:07,390
bloody nose right now, just
like evil Knievel. All right,

1595
01:41:07,391 --> 01:41:11,490
I'm going to go get some eggs. Uh,
God bless you. Hope to see you in a,

1596
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:16,180
if you live anywhere near San Francisco,
hope to see audit my gig and uh,

1597
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:18,130
please keep the questions
coming next week.

1598
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:22,090
I'm going to give you a
great podcast because a, um,

1599
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:25,150
I'll be back in my home life and I'll
be eating right and I won't be drinking

1600
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:29,110
and a brace yourself.
Douche bag from England.

1601
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:31,990
I'm probably going to be talking about
how excited I am to see my fucking dog.

1602
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:34,190
All right. That's it. Everybody a good
