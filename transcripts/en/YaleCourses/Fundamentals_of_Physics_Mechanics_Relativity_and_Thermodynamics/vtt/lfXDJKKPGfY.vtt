00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.260
This is a relatively simple topic.
In fact,

2
00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:06.590
any of you took any kind of high school physics,

3
00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:08.780
you would have done this thing with fluids.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.613
<v 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.360
<v 0>so this is the subject for today,</v>

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.930
fluid dynamics and statics.

7
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:20.600
So I'll start with a simple static problem.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.130
We are going to take,
whenever I say fluid,
uh,

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.940
you are free to imagine water or oil.
That's it.

10
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.650
That's good enough example of a fluid,
one important property of the fluid,

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.610
the density.
You know,
ted by row,

12
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.590
density of water.
I would probably do not buy a subsequent w.

13
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.000
And you know what?
That's mass per unit volume for water.

14
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.030
That happens to be 1000 kilograms per cubic meter.

15
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.110
So let's not linger there.
I think that's fairly simple concert.

16
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.390
There's more cyber concept is the one a pressure.

17
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.893
<v 1>Okay,</v>

18
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.540
<v 0>so you have the notion of a pressure.</v>

19
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.940
If you're going to swimming pool and you dive down to the bottom,

20
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.870
you know the pressure is going up.
So what's the formal definition of pressure?

21
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.230
Is it a vector?
Is it a scalar?
Does it have a magnitude?
Has to have a direction.

22
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.420
That's what I want to explain to you so you can pick a point on the fluid there

23
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.220
and say the pressure there is certain sites and what do we mean by that?

24
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.440
We mean by that,
the following.

25
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.180
If you get into that fluid and you want to carve out a little space for
yourself,

26
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.320
you're going to make a little cube,

27
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.410
maybe a glass cube and you wanted to live inside that cube,

28
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830
so I'm going to blow up the cube like this.

29
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.183
<v 1>Yes,</v>

30
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.900
<v 0>the water is trying to push you in from all sides and compress this cube.</v>

31
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.970
Therefore up to push out on the two on all the walls.

32
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.350
If the force you exert on this wall is some f and the area of that Wallace a,

33
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.260
that ratio is called a pressure.
It's pressure.

34
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:11.280
I said intensive measure of how hard the water is trying to push in.

35
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.410
If you don't put the cube,
that pressure is still there,

36
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.010
but one way to measure the pressure is to try to go in there and force the fluid

37
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:20.780
out and ask how hard does it push you

38
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.400
and the unit for pressure is Newton per meter square and we used another name

39
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:32.580
for that call.
The Pascal
one.

40
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.220
Pascal is one Newton per meter square.
Here's another example of pressure.

41
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.050
You have a gas,
we'll do a lot of this after the break.

42
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.770
That is some gas inside a cylinder.
That's the piston.

43
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.570
Now if the pressure of the gas and the pressure of the outside world at the
same,

44
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.260
there's nothing you have to do.
Assuming the piston is massless,

45
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.000
but if you want to increase the pressure then the gas,
you put some extra weight.

46
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.190
That mg we pushed down and empty divided by the area of the Piston with the

47
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:10.150
extra pressure to apply.
That's also the pressure of the gas.
That pressure

48
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.370
is the atmospheric pressure plus the extra weight you apply.

49
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.790
You might add by the area of this Piston

50
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.150
because atmospheric pressure is everywhere.

51
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.920
So when you push down on the piston here to compress the gas further,

52
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:31.030
you're adding to the atmospheric pressure.
This extra force divided by area.

53
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.233
Sometimes,

54
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.020
I mean this is called the absolute pressure and that's called the atmospheric

55
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:45.631
pressure and that's called the gauge pressure gauge pressure is the pressure on

56
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:50.140
top of atmospheric pressure or example when your car has a flat,

57
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.270
the bright side of it is the pressure inside the tightest,

58
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.210
in fact equal atmospheric pressure doesn't help you because that's the precedent

59
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.540
side and there's the pressure outside.
And if we want to keep your car moving,

60
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.940
you'd really have to increase the pressure in the tire.

61
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.780
And when you stick this gauge in that you've measured something 32 pounds per

62
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:08.290
square inch.

63
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.860
That's the gauge pressure that's in excess of the atmospheric pressure.

64
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.090
So you should understand that the pressure is a condition in a fluid.

65
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.300
And one of the important properties or pressure is that if you took a fluid and

66
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:29.020
you went to a certain height,
all points at that height have the same pressure.

67
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.740
And we understand that as follows.
So I go to this fluids.

68
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.560
I imagine in my mind a little cylindrical section off the same fluid.

69
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.880
Just draw a dotted line around the region and focus on that little chunk of

70
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.714
fluid and say,

71
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.300
can the person on the two sides this phase and that phase be different?

72
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.700
The answer is no because the pressure on the left were bigger than the pressure

73
00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:00.610
on the right.
I take a cylinder of some area,

74
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:04.780
a pressure times area on the left will exceed pressure times area on the right

75
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.650
and therefore the fluids should move to the right,
but it's not doing anything.

76
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.250
It's an equilibrium and the only way that can happen as if it's pushed equally

77
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.090
from both sides.

78
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.580
So notice that the pressure on this chunk from the left point this way,

79
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.420
and then that chunk points that way they're trying to push it in.

80
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.080
So pressure cannot change at a given depth.

81
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.390
But let's take a cylinder that looks like this.

82
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.560
Remember,
this is not a real cylinder.

83
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.710
This is the same water in mentally have isolated a part of the water that looks

84
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:43.930
like a cylinder,
maybe want to dry it and dotted lines.

85
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.370
It's just a fluid of cylindrical shape.

86
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.100
Basically Area A and height age.

87
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.780
I can ask the following question.
Uh,

88
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.060
let's say h one is the measure of that one from the surface and h two is the

89
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.370
depth from the surface to be lower phase of the cylinder.

90
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.520
We can know,
argue the pressure on the top and bottom really should not be equal.

91
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.880
You should think about it by the same argument I gave earlier.

92
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.180
We'll tell me cannot be equal if they were equal.

93
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.790
Since these two ads at equal,
the forces pushing up and pushing down,

94
00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:27.250
we'll cancel no net force on the cylinder.

95
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.170
You can ask them what's keeping the cylinder of water from falling down?
Well,

96
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:34.960
that has to be a forced to equal the weight of that cylinder.

97
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.350
Therefore that has to be a net upward force.

98
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.860
That means the pressure down here pushing up better be higher than the pressure

99
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.690
on the top.
We're now going to calculate what the pressure differences,

100
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.270
so let's call the pressure downstairs and upstairs p one.

101
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.040
Then the upward force is p one times a.

102
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.320
The downward force is p two times a day.

103
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.760
That's the net upward force that's got to be equal to the weight of that amount

104
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:10.910
of water
wait does found by first the mass,

105
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.330
which is area times h do minus h one that's the volume of the cylinder times the

106
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:23.360
density of water or whatever fluid you have.
That's the mass of the cylinder.

107
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.940
That's the weight of that cylinder of liquid.

108
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.250
All I have done is balanced the gravitational force on this cylinder with a net

109
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.280
upward force due to the different pressures.
I think I made one mistake here.
Uh,

110
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.410
upward force in magnitude.

111
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.480
I want to write this p two times a and downward force.

112
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.170
I want rate as p one.
How do you keep track of sciences?

113
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.450
A little subtle and balancing two magnitudes.

114
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.580
I'm balancing net upward force named repeat two is considered positive upward

115
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.090
and this is the force of gravity down and balancing the magnitudes.

116
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.790
So the AIDEA cancels out
because this area,

117
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.140
see the pressure between two points should not depend on the area of this

118
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:14.000
fictitious something that I took.
In fact,

119
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:19.001
I find it as equal to Roe g times h two minus h one which is the difference in

120
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:23.150
the depth of these two points.
Yes.

121
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.730
Which one?
Yeah.

122
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.940
In fact it nor is it really happens to be normal are perpendicular the area

123
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:35.450
because the pressure will push straight up and straight down.

124
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.110
How about forces on the side of the cylinder there?

125
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:42.260
Cancel it every height because at every height the push from the left and right

126
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:43.700
are equal.
I already showed you that.

127
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.610
So for the mechanic and stability of this chunk,

128
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.210
I need all forces to add up to zero horizontally.

129
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:54.400
There is no gravity and the pressure that every height is equal so that canceled

130
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:55.710
so vertically.

131
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.430
That is the force of gravity and just cancelled by the difference in pressure.

132
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.870
So we can see that p two is equal to p one plus Roy g times the height

133
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.234
difference

134
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.670
and people write this formula as follows is very standard to take p one to be

135
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:23.511
the point right at the surface and Peter to be any point inside and to call the

136
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:25.230
depth of that simply as h.

137
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.540
Then the pressure at the point p in the fluid is the pressure at the top,

138
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.800
which is usually atmospheric pressure plus row,

139
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.160
g,
H,

140
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.760
so I don't have an h one and h two because h one I've chosen to be zero and h

141
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:51.600
two I've simply calling it the say something very simple.

142
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.450
If you go to lake at the surface of the lake,

143
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.390
the pressure is due to the atmosphere.
You take a dive,

144
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:00.720
you go down some depth age,
the pressure goes up by this amount.

145
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.250
Now if you go to the bottom of the ocean,

146
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:06.930
it's can be incredible amount of pressure.

147
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.320
That's why you and I cannot survive in the bottom of yours

148
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.510
because the outside pressure inside pressure is usually atmospheric pressure.

149
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.950
You breathing the air in your lungs,

150
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:21.360
you go down with that outside of atmospheric plus this and that can kill you.

151
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.280
That way when you build a submarine,

152
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:25.170
you got to make sure it can withstand the pressure,

153
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.760
but fish don't have the problem because fish are breathing the water.

154
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.450
The water is going into their system and outside the system.

155
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.010
So that's one way for you to live for 20,000 feet under the sea.

156
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.250
Start drinking the water,
but it's not a longterm solution.

157
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.410
It'll work in the Shrock time because you'll be equalizing the pressure.
Okay.

158
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.930
Now how about the atmospheric pressure?
What's the origin of that?

159
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.840
And the origin of the atmospheric pressure is that

160
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.050
we had ourselves living
in a bottom of a pool,

161
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.200
but it's filled with air.
The air heads,

162
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:06.780
it goes on for maybe a hundred miles,

163
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:10.020
but the density decreases eventually vanishes.

164
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.660
So I cannot tell you precisely by the atmosphere ends.

165
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.340
But I can say the following,

166
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.910
if I go far above at the absolute pressure to zero in free space,

167
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:24.030
that is just vacuum.
The pressure here is the atmospheric pressure.

168
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:30.350
Atmospheric pressure at the bottom of the earth is equal to zero plus row g h

169
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:37.560
barrow is the density of air.
G is g and h of the height of the atmosphere.

170
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:40.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.000
<v 0>And that happens to be a 10 to the five fast cows.</v>

172
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.840
So we are living in a bottom of a pool where the pressure distended,

173
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.300
the Fi Pascal's relative to empty space,
interstellar space.

174
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.830
Did I say said that pressure doesn't kill us because the pressure can be felt

175
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.580
world from the outside pushing in and inside going through your nostrils and

176
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.473
everything else,

177
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.740
pushing out what do you have all seen the dramatic experiment where you take a

178
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.680
can of something and you heat it up so the ad goes out,

179
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.080
then you seal it.
Then the ad that's been driven out reduces the pressure.

180
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.240
So when you seal it and you cool it,

181
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.390
then the pressure drops and even the drop in pressure,

182
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:23.860
it doesn't even drop down to zero,

183
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.290
but it's big enough for the whole canned to implode.

184
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.170
No,
let's see
what you get here.
Uh,

185
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.100
let's do the following.

186
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.940
This is Roy g eight and you can ask us the following question.

187
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.300
If this was a swimming pool,
how high would the water be?

188
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.551
Another words,

189
00:12:44.551 --> 00:12:48.150
what height of water above the earth will produce the same pressure as our

190
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.160
atmosphere?
This.
Then I say,
if I want to enter the five Pascal's,

191
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.140
that's the density of water.

192
00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:00.170
A standard three gls pretend is 10 and eight is what I'm looking for.

193
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.770
Cancel all the powers of 10,
eight,
just like 10 meters.

194
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.070
And it turns out is the best of my knowledge is 32 feet.

195
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.410
This is the units,
uh,
we don't use in the book,

196
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:17.820
but it's a very common way of thinking.
32 feet.

197
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.540
So we added at the bottom of a pool.
If it is filled with water,

198
00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:24.750
we'd be 32 feet of water.
All right,

199
00:13:24.751 --> 00:13:29.250
so now we're going to take this formula p equals P,
not Roy g,
H,

200
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.220
n put it to work,
get some mileage out of that.

201
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.130
So what are the things we can do with that formula?

202
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.540
First thing you can do is to build yourself a barometer.

203
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:43.920
But I met her.
You know,

204
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.390
it's a way to tell what the pressure is today at atmospheric pressure.

205
00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:51.090
When I set the standard,
the five,
that's a typical pressure.

206
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.720
It doesn't really stay locked in the valley each day that are fluctuations.

207
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.540
That's why the weather person tells you pressure's going up,

208
00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:01.410
pressure's going down.
So let's find a way to measure the pressure.

209
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.150
And he is one way to do that.
You take a,

210
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.960
I can have something,
fill it with some liquid,
take a test,
you

211
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.420
evacuated,
completely suck all the air out of it and stick it into this.

212
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.790
When you do that is complete vacuum here in the atmosphere is pushing down to

213
00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:28.690
the fluid,
will rise
up to some height,
age

214
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.180
and you can ask how high will it go?
What's going to be the height?

215
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.460
Well little go to a height.

216
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:41.461
So that zero pressure here plus this Roy g eight which is the pressure there

217
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.750
will be the same as the pressure here because they are two points at the same

218
00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:49.900
height.
Pressured here is the atmospheric pressure.

219
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.670
So Russia here,

220
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:58.150
atmospheric pressure is zero at the top of that you listed row

221
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.483
g h

222
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.010
so if you build this gadget,
there's better meter out of water.

223
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.460
The water column,
we'll raise the height of 32 feet.

224
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.320
But no,
nobody wants to get to 32 feet high.

225
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:20.030
So what do you use instead is mercury because it's very dense so you want to get

226
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:21.320
the same atmospheric pressure,

227
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:24.170
but you want to have a bigger role and get a smaller rate.

228
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.820
If you go look up a book and find the density of medically,

229
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.070
you're going to find the height is something like,
I don't know,

230
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:33.170
seven 57 80 millimeters.

231
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.220
That's why the weather guy who says the pressure today so many millimeters and

232
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:41.420
the Medicare he is dropping.
No,

233
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:44.660
I'm not sure why they bothered to give the numbers because for most of us,

234
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:46.430
including me,
those numbers don't mean anything.

235
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.900
Here's the number seven 46 millimeters.
Does it speak to you?

236
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.330
Not to me.
So it
speaks to one of you guys?

237
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.840
Yeah.
Okay.
Some number.

238
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.590
It's not like saying today's in the 67 degree Fahrenheit.

239
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:10.190
At least I know what that means.
Right?
[inaudible] you hit the mercury.

240
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:12.020
I think it's just a waste of time anyway.

241
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.770
They are telling you how much the Medicare use.
Okay.

242
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.310
You can use any fluid you like.
What do you got to agree on using mercury?

243
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:23.270
Because if for seven 60 millimeters and it's watered,
the person's talking about,

244
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.760
of course you are in serious trouble.
So I understood,

245
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.350
we are talking about mercury
automatic queries using thermometers.

246
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.430
That's the subject for after the break.
So they're the mercury falling,

247
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:36.770
could Stanford falling temperatures and rising temperatures.

248
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:39.770
But here it is for falling pressure and rising pressure.

249
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.460
So this is the first gadget you can build with what I've taught you.

250
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.890
Next Guide did you can build is you can imagine,
uh,
this is you frank,

251
00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:52.130
to drink,
uh,
this year,
years and knows and whatnot.

252
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.170
You've got a straw and you're trying to drink something.

253
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.430
Now remember the fluid is water,
okay?

254
00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.960
It's not Medicare Reno because you're doing different experiments.

255
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.860
You've gone to drink from a straw.
So how do you do that?
You know,

256
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:07.790
when you drink from a straw,
you create a partial vacuum in your mouth.

257
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:12.560
So the pressure here.
So in the case of the fluid that you want a drink,

258
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.470
this is a
your head,

259
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.700
the oppression here

260
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.660
less than the atmosphere,
even less than the atmosphere by some amount.

261
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:32.260
Then the fluid can start climbing up to some height and claim to set to high so

262
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:37.490
that the lower pressure plus that Roy g h will equal atmospheric pressure.

263
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.440
So you've got to reduce the pressure and water and water in your mouth till this

264
00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:46.820
fluid can play him up.
If he just,
if you wanted to just make it to your mouth,

265
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.650
it depends on the length of the straw,
the height,
the straw.

266
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.820
If you want to suck it up a certain height,
then that height,
Raji,
h,

267
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.330
bless the pressure in your mouth is the pressure here.

268
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.640
And that's the atmospheric pressure.

269
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.700
So if you want to drink water from a well that is more than 32 feet deep,

270
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.990
you're out of luck.
Because even if your face and your head or a complete vacuum,

271
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.230
you cannot get the water to climb more than 32 feet.

272
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.720
So that's another illustration of this.

273
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:26.620
So one more example of this peak goes peanut plus Roy g h is if I give you

274
00:18:29.511 --> 00:18:33.590
another fluid,
it doesn't mix with water and I tell you find a density.

275
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.910
There are many ways.

276
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.870
One is to just find the mass and volume of that fluid and divide.

277
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:44.000
But here's another thing people use.
You take what's called a youtube.

278
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.130
Yeah,
that's not,
I know that's very post Ali embarrassing videos.

279
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.170
This was physics contribution to pop culture long before any of this happened.

280
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.080
This is the youtube,
the youtube.

281
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.800
Let's say you fill it up with one fluid and this is the other fluids cause this

282
00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:09.410
is oil and this is water.

283
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.860
If the two heights were equal then you know we're talking about the same fluid

284
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.910
but this is supposed to tell you that oil is less dense than water and we can

285
00:19:19.911 --> 00:19:24.911
check that by comparing two points in this fluid at the same height

286
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.560
and saying the pressure must be the same at those points.

287
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.440
You understand how I get that,

288
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.090
that pressure and that pressure that equal because you can draw a cylinder there

289
00:19:38.091 --> 00:19:43.091
horizontally which cannot be pushed sideways from here to this pressure at that

290
00:19:43.791 --> 00:19:46.550
broad g h in that row,
g h and you come to that point,

291
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.590
you conclude that pressure is also equal.

292
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.520
You cannot jump into the new fluid here because the role for here in the row for

293
00:19:52.521 --> 00:19:53.354
this a different,

294
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.500
but these two points have the same pressure are in the same fluid.

295
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.330
So let me write that statement that this pressure and this pressure the equal by

296
00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:06.080
saying atmospheric pressure is on the top for both of them.

297
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:12.490
That plus row one g h one is equal atmospheric pressure blows road to the age

298
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.653
too,

299
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.500
but this is the second fluid I it goes to h two first fluid.

300
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.910
The hightest equaled h one the density is a row one and row two atmospheric

301
00:20:25.911 --> 00:20:26.930
pressures cancel.

302
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:32.350
Then you find each one over h two is equal to the road to overall one.

303
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.000
So by comparing the heights you can find the relative density.

304
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.530
If one of them is water then that whatever it is.

305
00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:45.170
If you know the density of one fluid,
you can find the density or the other.

306
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:49.541
Okay.

307
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:54.160
Yet another application of this law that the pressure is equal at a given height

308
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.650
is the famous hydraulic press.
So he had his uh,

309
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.553
<v 1>okay.</v>

310
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.600
<v 0>Here are two pistons of different radio.</v>

311
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.740
This has got cross section 80 81 this got cross section 88 two

312
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.860
and here I want to put some incompressible fluid.

313
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.463
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

314
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:23.200
<v 0>Incompressible fluid is something whose volume cannot be changed no matter how</v>

315
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:26.890
much you press it.
The water is pretty close to incompressible.

316
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:28.870
It does have a couple of ability,

317
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:31.750
but it's not going to change very much for our purposes.

318
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:38.430
So now here I have a piston and I have a piston here and I pushed down here with

319
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:40.330
the force f one

320
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.470
and ask what force will I get at the other site?

321
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.980
You might think f one equals f two but since these fluids are at the same
height,

322
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.400
the only no p one equal speed to that means efan over a one is equal to f two

323
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.520
over eight two.
So this fluid here,

324
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.320
we'll push up here with the force F two which is equal to f one times eight to

325
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.990
or what a,
what
did I get it right?

326
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.470
<v 1>Uh,
pardon me?</v>

327
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.110
<v 0>Did they make a mistake here?</v>

328
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.163
<v 1>That's right.</v>

329
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.970
<v 0>What?
I wanted to amplify the force.
So what do you really want to do?
Well,</v>

330
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.570
it's a matter of who you want emphasize.
So what do you want?
Emphasize here.

331
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.090
Maybe if I drew a picture,
I will know exactly what I'm planning to do.

332
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.820
This picture is fine in practice.
This is not what you do.

333
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.500
You want to push down here and raised something there because what you really

334
00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:50.060
imagine is some elephants,

335
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.680
elephants standing here and you want to lift the elephant by applying a force

336
00:22:54.681 --> 00:22:58.490
here.
So let's still call your force f two in the force.

337
00:22:58.491 --> 00:23:00.680
And the other side is the force.

338
00:23:00.681 --> 00:23:04.390
You apply times aim one ovary too.
So it,

339
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:05.960
it went over a two could be a hundred.

340
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.870
What that means is if you apply one Newton here,

341
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.700
you'll get a hundred newtons on the other side.

342
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.230
So that's the way to Max to convert a small force in their log force.

343
00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.540
But this is the oldest trick in the book,

344
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.960
even older one invented by cave people is that if you have a support like this,

345
00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:28.280
you can put a weight here.

346
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:30.940
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

347
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.410
<v 0>and let me see.
That's right.</v>

348
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:37.810
So the tiny weight here can lift the big weight here because that MDF and that

349
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:40.210
distance in the same data,
this instance,
we'll be equal,

350
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.800
but you must know even from that example that you don't get something for

351
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:48.650
nothing.
In other words,
if you lift the elephant here,

352
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:53.690
we're pushing down here the fact that the forces don't match perfectly.
Okay,

353
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.830
but the work you do here must be the work delivered at the other side.

354
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.190
The law of conservation of energy work you do on this side is the force

355
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.840
multiplied by the distance.

356
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.270
A force multiplied by distance.
I'm going to write as a pressure,

357
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.930
blames the cross section eight.
Yeah,
times distance.

358
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.153
<v 1>Okay,</v>

359
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.200
<v 0>but what is eight times eight?</v>

360
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.930
Two Times the x two eight two times x two.
If you push the liquid here,

361
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.040
you moved at a distance.
Delta x two area.

362
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.750
Tom Del Tech's too is the volume of fluid you push down here.
That's the volume.

363
00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:34.980
They'll come up on the other side.

364
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:40.200
So you're free to write that as p two times a one delta x one

365
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.540
okay,
but p two a one I'm sorry.
Uh,

366
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.030
yes,
no,
let's write.
P two is the same as p one

367
00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.820
p one five a one is f one.

368
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.543
<v 1>Okay,</v>

369
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.940
<v 0>so he just says that the force times distance on one site is the forced time</v>

370
00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:12.020
distance on the other side.

371
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.400
That means the work you actually do is not amplified by the process.

372
00:25:16.401 --> 00:25:19.430
You cannot get more with juveniles out of one site by any device.

373
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.900
What you put in is what you get out.

374
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.050
But still it's useful because in practice you may have to move a whole meter

375
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.820
here to lift the elephant by one centimeter.

376
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.510
But the point is you can lift elephants this way.
That's the important thing.

377
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.220
Okay?
That's why it's worth doing.
And this is how you,

378
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.700
the break in your car works.
You know,
you pump the brake pedal,

379
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.760
that's the little cylinder there and there's a fluid there.

380
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.720
And the fluid is pushed by your feet and you push it quite a bit,

381
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.630
several centimeters at the other end.

382
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.120
That's another cylinder who's piston is right next to the drum is rotating and

383
00:25:56.121 --> 00:26:00.230
push us on the drum and exerts an enormous amount of force.

384
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.520
But it moves a very tiny amount.

385
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.630
The shoes that grab your rotating drum move a very tiny amount,

386
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.670
but as your feet move a large amount,

387
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.660
but that's the ratio of the force that's transmitted.

388
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.400
The fluid has the same pressure,

389
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:17.450
the brake fluid at the same pressure with the force you apply with your feet is

390
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:17.781
much,

391
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:21.920
much smarter than the force that the drum will exert on the rotating that the

392
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:23.860
disc brakes will exert on the rotating draw.

393
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:30.430
So a lot of hydraulics is based on this simple amplification of force.

394
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.813
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

395
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.230
<v 0>All right.
Now,
why move to</v>

396
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.590
next topic in this field,
which is the argument,
this principle.

397
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.150
So we all know the conditions under which this way discovers.

398
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:53.180
I will not go into that other than to say that Mr Archimedes noticed that if you

399
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.750
immerse something in a fluid,
it seems to weigh less.

400
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.840
What I mean by that is that if you attach it to some kind of a spring balance

401
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.620
and you waited so that the k except the spring was the mg of the object and if

402
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:13.320
you did the same thing,
now you will find it seems to weigh less

403
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.240
and the question was home with less Archimedes answer is pretty simple.

404
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.280
The Amo and babies do you lose the weight,
the weight loss

405
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.860
equals the weight of liquid displaced.

406
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.490
Now how do you show that?

407
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.720
Because we don't right now so many years after argument is we will not accept

408
00:27:43.721 --> 00:27:46.090
this on faith.
We want to be able to show this is the case.

409
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.520
There are several ways to prove this.
One way,

410
00:27:51.521 --> 00:27:54.400
which I like is to say if you,

411
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.690
the thing is the thing you want hanging here was itself a tank of water ship

412
00:27:59.691 --> 00:28:00.524
like that.

413
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.720
You don't have to do anything because that chunk of water can float at that

414
00:28:04.721 --> 00:28:05.770
height for free.

415
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.160
But now if it took the chunk of water and put a stone here,
have the same shape,

416
00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.890
the rest of the fluid doesn't know what you're doing.

417
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:18.520
It applies the same force that it would do its own colleagues.
Emily,

418
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.413
this is water.

419
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.560
That's the water is in a configuration ready to support that amount of water.

420
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.950
If you took that water out and put something in the water,

421
00:28:26.951 --> 00:28:30.190
we'll apply the same amount of force and the rest of it is your problem.

422
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:35.630
You will play the remaining force so the water is ready to support it's own kind

423
00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:39.460
of any volume.
That's the meaning of being an equilibrium.

424
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.650
Any chunk of water is an equilibrium,

425
00:28:41.651 --> 00:28:43.900
therefore it's getting an upward force equal to the weight.

426
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.050
What we're saying is if without disturbing the environment,

427
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.300
you take the water out and put something in its place,

428
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:51.820
the rest of the guys will apply the same force.

429
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:57.010
Now one formal way to prove that you can take various geometries,

430
00:28:57.011 --> 00:29:01.630
but I prefer a cylindrical geometry,
so this is in this example,

431
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:02.890
not a piece of water,

432
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:08.050
but the new material live introduced inside the water and we want to find the

433
00:29:08.051 --> 00:29:11.610
buoyancy force.
What is the net force of volumes,

434
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.700
but it's the pressure at the bottom times the ATO

435
00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:22.290
minus pressure that the top times the area it is seeing the difference in the

436
00:29:22.781 --> 00:29:27.781
pressure is Roy g h a but eight just now this hike,

437
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:35.190
well eight [inaudible] say is the volume of the water road times that is the

438
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:37.230
weight of the water is the mass of the water.
At that time,

439
00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:39.510
GE is the way that the liquid displaced.

440
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.890
You can put this for a cylinder,

441
00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.450
you can prove this for our odd ball shapes by thinking a little harder,

442
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.560
but this is good enough.

443
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.870
So basically the body weighs less than water because the lower part of the body

444
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.260
is being pushed up harder than the upper part of the body is being pushed down

445
00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.530
because the pressure increases with depth.
That's it.

446
00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:04.180
That's the why you get this result from Archimedes.
No,

447
00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.360
yet be a little careful,
uh,

448
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.050
on writing the equation because if this was made of a material like iron,

449
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:16.510
then the density of iron is less than,
it's more than the density of water.

450
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.410
So the weight of that chunk of iron will be more than the weight of the water

451
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:21.244
displaced.

452
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.270
So you will have to provide a net force and you can support it with the cable.

453
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:31.090
But suppose this was not
made of iron but made of Cork.

454
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.260
If it's Karch,
it one wanted to be there,
right,

455
00:30:35.261 --> 00:30:38.900
because then the applied force by the water is more than the weight.

456
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.790
It takes the support.
It's the Clark will then Baba to the surface.

457
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.190
It don't look like this.

458
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.690
If you want to keep it Douglas like rubber Ducky,

459
00:30:52.691 --> 00:30:56.470
you want to keep the rug Roberta key inside the water level.

460
00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.190
You've got to pull it down or do you want it tight to the,

461
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.420
I think one of the problems they gave you as somebody tied this piece of

462
00:31:04.421 --> 00:31:05.530
whatever to the floor,

463
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.560
then it'll stay but things will Bob up to the surface and the question is how

464
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:11.710
far up will it go?

465
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.310
We know part of it is going to be insight and part of it is going to be outside

466
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:18.670
and you can ask how much will be outside,
how much would it be insight?

467
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:25.060
You can already guess the answer,
but let's prove it.
Let FB the fraction

468
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.330
immersed
fractional volume in Merced.

469
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.210
Then we can say the weight of the liquid displaced is equal.

470
00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:42.211
The factional volume times a row time,

471
00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.360
g times the total volume

472
00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.150
is the role of water.

473
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.830
Do you understand?
This is the,

474
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.380
this is the weight of water equaled the full volume.

475
00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.420
This is the fraction of water displaced,

476
00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:04.570
so this is simply the weight of this shaded region here and that is going to be

477
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.000
equal to the weight of the thing that's floating.

478
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.180
That is a row g times full value.

479
00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.880
If you can,
so the g and you canceled the volume,

480
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:22.310
you find that the fraction that is immersed is the density of the material

481
00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.050
divided by the density of water.

482
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:31.080
In other words,
if this material is 90% the density of water,

483
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:33.270
maybe emir spent 90%

484
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.830
that's exactly what happens with ice.
As you all know,

485
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.440
ice has a smaller density than water.
One of the great mysteries.

486
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.611
Normally when you call,

487
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:48.260
something condenses and reduces in volume and the density will go up,

488
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.720
but ice actually expands when you cool it.

489
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.390
That's where density of ice is less than the density of your water.

490
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.710
That's where ice floats

491
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.353
<v 1>on water.</v>

492
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.090
<v 0>That's the reason icebergs</v>

493
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.930
look like this because a big part of the iceberg,

494
00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:10.990
that's a very peculiar property of ice.
That's the way you,
yeah,

495
00:33:10.991 --> 00:33:15.160
there's movies like the titanic ready gotta he would ice thing and just
floating.

496
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.400
First of all,
you've density advice more than density of water.

497
00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.360
These two actors would still be alive.
Okay?
What happens is,
uh,

498
00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.170
it is floating.
And not only that,

499
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.960
what you see is maybe a small fraction of the whole thing.

500
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.200
That's why the big ship went down.
Okay?

501
00:33:32.201 --> 00:33:36.760
But it's all thanks to this accident of nature that he had his one substance,

502
00:33:36.761 --> 00:33:40.000
which been called increases.
It decreases the density.

503
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.560
All right?
No argument is principled.
Got Hundreds of applications.

504
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.550
If you want to build a board,
yes.
Have we build a book?

505
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.100
Here's a steel board.

506
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:58.820
Now you cannot come to me and say,
how do you make a steel boat float in water?

507
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:03.320
Okay?
It's not a solid steel board.
Okay.

508
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:06.830
If you're thinking about a solid steel boat,
you'd get in another line of work.

509
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.910
This is this thing made out of steel,
but it's completely hollow.

510
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.210
So what we claim is this,

511
00:34:14.211 --> 00:34:18.890
I'm on the water weighs the same amount as that amount of see the shaded region,

512
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:25.690
so you can easily calculate how deep this one once to sync the balance.

513
00:34:25.691 --> 00:34:28.010
It's week,
right?
That I assume you know how to do that.

514
00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:32.000
Take this to be a rectangular boat,
cross sections,
rectangular.

515
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.520
It's gone down to a depth row and do it that age.

516
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:37.710
I let a,

517
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:41.690
therefore the volume of water displaced is eight times the area of the boat,

518
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.080
cross sectional area of the Florida,
the board,
that's the volume of water.

519
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:49.070
That's the mass of water.
That's the weight of water.

520
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.600
That's the weight of the boat.

521
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.320
If be telling me how many times do it both ways and you give me any of the base

522
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.760
and g and density of water.
I'll tell you what height it'll sync.

523
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.770
Then of course you can load more and more cargo in this.
You know,

524
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.830
if you have a pop here,
start putting more and more cargo.

525
00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:12.500
There's some go down until the board looks like this

526
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.130
and that's as fun as you can push it.

527
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.040
That's the kind of simple calculation you wouldn't be asked.

528
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.640
How much cargo can that boat take?
Well,
that's very simple.

529
00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.160
Weight of the board plus weight of the cargo is maximal in this critical

530
00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:30.230
situation when they're just about to go under.

531
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:35.510
Therefore the total volume of water displaced times the density at IMG will be

532
00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:37.010
the weight of your board plus cargo.

533
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.830
These are all elementary applications and they come from two principles.

534
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.780
One is the pressure increases with depth.

535
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.770
The second is that the weight of the liquid displaced is the weight of the,

536
00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:55.650
it's a big reduction in weight,
so you can imagine three cases,

537
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.040
one where the density of the material is more than density of water.

538
00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:02.700
In which case it will start going down and you will have to hold it up with the

539
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:06.690
cable,
but you wouldn't have to apply the same force as you would outside.

540
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.160
Second example is when the density of the object is less than the density of

541
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:11.490
water,

542
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.390
in which case it'll float with a certain fraction of it emerged in a certain

543
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:20.391
fraction of it outside the fraction they merged as simply the same fraction as

544
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:24.000
what you get by dividing its density by the density of water.

545
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.030
What's the density of water changes in the Dead Sea?

546
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.150
Because of the salt concentration density is a lot higher,

547
00:36:32.151 --> 00:36:36.870
so it's a lot easier people to float.
Okay,

548
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:42.060
well for the last and final topic,

549
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.550
uh,
that's called Bernoulli's equation.

550
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.250
This is the first time I'm going to consider fluids in motion.

551
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.110
So far my fluids were at rest and this really pretty simple,

552
00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.060
but nor does one more time.
All I ever invoked was Newton's law of motion.

553
00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:06.060
You realize that I just took this fluid and that fluid balance the forces and

554
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:07.470
said that should be no acceleration.

555
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.070
If I can convince you of the one thing I have accomplished,

556
00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:16.071
something to realize that all the mechanics we have done that's not appeal to

557
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:20.730
any other law than f equals m a in all these problems that we Librium a is zero

558
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:26.030
f is zero just from that fact and cloud applications have f equals Amy for

559
00:37:27.001 --> 00:37:30.750
example is a very collaborative thing of a piece of the water and demand that it

560
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:33.900
be an equilibrium.
That's what we find how the pressure varies with that

561
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.370
but there's no new principals so far.

562
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.500
In fact there's got to be no new principals at all.

563
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.660
This term middle activity was different.

564
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.800
The old space time and modified but non the linguistic mechanics.

565
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.130
It's all coming from Newton's law as is this problem.

566
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.240
So we are going to describe for the first time fluid motion.

567
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.980
We're going to take the most general case of fluid motion but there's water in

568
00:37:57.981 --> 00:37:58.814
some pipe.

569
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:03.710
This is the most famous picture in all the textbooks.

570
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.100
We have not thought of a better picture now and all working on it.

571
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.660
This is all we can come up with after 300 years water flowing in a pipe.

572
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.850
This point is going to be called one.
This point is going to be called to

573
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.360
everything.
Here we'll have a subscript one.

574
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.870
That means measure it from some ground.
This at the height,

575
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.140
each one that an h to the velocity of the fluid.

576
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:36.670
Here is some B one over the last year of the fluid there is v two

577
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.460
and is the density of the fluid and that's not valuable.

578
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:48.380
So imagine now a steady flow of some fluid through a pipe whose area of cross

579
00:38:50.101 --> 00:38:53.700
section is changing and the overall altitude results or change.

580
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.610
You can have a huge tie,
you know,
pipe in the basement,

581
00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:00.660
but the whole supply to the house comes brantas hours in the little pipes.

582
00:39:00.661 --> 00:39:03.990
Maybe this could be the pipe in the attic,
small cross section,

583
00:39:03.991 --> 00:39:05.820
possibly at a bigger height,
doesn't matter.

584
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.560
But we're not considering pipes that break up into four or five pipe.

585
00:39:10.561 --> 00:39:11.610
This is a single pipe.

586
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.650
So here's the first law that you have to satisfy.

587
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.400
If the fluid is incompressible,

588
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.550
that's a certain law and we're going to talk about that law.

589
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.560
That's called the equation of continuity.

590
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:34.270
It relates the area here
and the velocity here to the Ada.

591
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:37.510
Hidden never lasted here and the relationship should not surprise you.

592
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:43.890
The basic premise is going to be you're shopping in water from the left and the

593
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:47.620
water cannot pile up between here and here because it incompressible.

594
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.410
Let me send that volume.
You can only pack in so much water,

595
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.150
so what comes in has to go out.

596
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.500
It follows that it's got to go out much faster here because the area is small

597
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.700
and what's the relation?
You can almost guess it,
but let's prove that.

598
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:05.950
How much water do you think comes in through this phase?
If you wait one second,

599
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.720
can you visualize in your mind that in one second a certain amount of fluid

600
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.900
comes in maybe until that point and the cross section of that fluid is a,

601
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.730
the distance it travels is v,

602
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.400
so the volume of the fluid coming in from the left,

603
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.620
it's really a one B one that's called the flow rate

604
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.073
coming in.

605
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.940
That's got to flow out and that's a flow rate great outside,

606
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.240
so if incompressible fluid,

607
00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.560
if I tell you the flow rate at one point I've told you the Florida everywhere,

608
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.460
think of cars going down a freeway and the freeway's getting narrow.

609
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.190
Unlike in real life,
we don't allow the cars to pile up.

610
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.440
You want the density of cars to be the same.
That means if there's a narrow road,

611
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:57.790
they got to go faster.
The maintain the traffic that follows.

612
00:40:57.791 --> 00:40:58.541
Then it follows that.

613
00:40:58.541 --> 00:41:02.020
If I go to one check point and see how many cars crossed me per second here,

614
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.090
say a number,
we'll cross anywhere else,

615
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:08.500
but the speeds will be in inverse proportion to the area so that the product

616
00:41:08.501 --> 00:41:13.440
remains the same.
Oh,
let me show this to you another way.

617
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.920
It's going to be helpful.
Let me wait a small time.

618
00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:19.860
Delta t in a small time,
Delta t,

619
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:23.070
this front that was here would advance there.

620
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.800
It'll go distance be one time that Delta t

621
00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:29.003
or the other end.

622
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:33.530
This front will advance the distance be two times t,

623
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.170
not the volume that got pushed in the time.
Delta t,

624
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:44.650
a m One v one delta t and that's the volume that came out on the other side and

625
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:47.870
you can cancel the Delta t's and come up with the result I gave you,

626
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:49.700
so wait a short time,

627
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:54.140
see what comes into the left face and see what goes out of the right face and

628
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.063
equate them.

629
00:41:59.050 --> 00:41:59.440
Okay.

630
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.440
Now we are going to find a constraint between the state of the fluid here in the

631
00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:10.330
state of the fluid there.
What I'm going to do,
look,

632
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.380
think about what's going to happen before you drive any formula supports.

633
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.320
You're going up hill.

634
00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.500
Does it make sense to you that when the fluid claims uphill,

635
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.450
it's going to slow down?

636
00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.850
It will slow down on the way to the top because it's got to work against
gravity.

637
00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.790
Even if you threw a rock up there,
it's going to go up and slow down.

638
00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:32.890
Therefore there's going to be some connection between the gain in height and the

639
00:42:32.891 --> 00:42:37.090
velocity of the fluid
gets from the law of conservation of energy.

640
00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.920
That's all I'm going to do.

641
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:44.080
Here's what I'm going to do you remember if there are no external forces on a

642
00:42:44.081 --> 00:42:47.380
system,
kinetic was potential is kinetic plus potential.

643
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.440
If there are external forces on a system,

644
00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.040
kinetic plus potential after minus candidate plus potential before it's the work

645
00:42:57.551 --> 00:43:00.160
done by external forces.

646
00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.390
That's what I'm going to use here.

647
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.050
What are the external forces and what's the energy is what I'm going to think

648
00:43:12.051 --> 00:43:14.840
about.
So here's what I'm going to focus on.

649
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:20.590
Take this region of fluid trapped between these two cross sections at t equals

650
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:25.250
zero weight or short time Delta t.

651
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:30.890
What happens to that body of fluid?
It does what I told you in the front.

652
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.710
It advances the new region there.
Maybe I should draw better.
Fix it.

653
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:37.610
He had,
this is the

654
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.770
advance of the rear guard and in the front,

655
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.380
the fluid that used to terminate here has gone up to there.

656
00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:52.780
In other words,
if I colored this fluid,

657
00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.670
just this part of the fluid between here and here,

658
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.380
different color from the rest of the fluid,

659
00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:01.540
short time later that colored liquid will be occupying this new volume.

660
00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.420
It's the same new medical volume,
but it's a slightly different volume.

661
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.270
I'm going to compare the energy of this chunk of fluid before and after.

662
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:12.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

663
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.190
<v 0>You realize that in that comparison,</v>

664
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:19.930
this written in between the shaded regions as common to both the chunks of fluid

665
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.150
point wise,
the fluid is the same location going at the same velocity,

666
00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:27.820
so I don't have to worry about that.
That's common too.
Before and after.

667
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:33.480
The only difference between final minus is the energy contained in that region

668
00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.220
minus the energy contained in this region.

669
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:41.580
That stuff it like here it was part of the old fluid is part of the new fluid.

670
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.850
It's at the same height going at the same speed so you don't have to worry about

671
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:48.300
it.
So what's the volume?
What's the energy of this region?

672
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.080
Energy is going to be row

673
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:58.760
times a two times delta x to

674
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.500
Delta x two is the distance it advanced here.

675
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.040
That's the volume of the fluid.
That's a massive of fluid.

676
00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:12.030
I'm sorry that time Ge is the mass of the fluid

677
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.890
and the kinetic energy will be mass times B squared over two

678
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:27.550
but initial learn you will be,
I'm sorry,
am I doing something right?
Uh,

679
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.830
I think I made a mistake.
Sorry about that.
That is no g here.

680
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.550
Let me do it more slowly.
What's the mass of the shaded region?

681
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.630
It's got a base a too.
It's got a height.

682
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:44.750
Delta x two that's a volume time density is the mass NV squared over two is that

683
00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:51.600
kinetic energy?
Potential energy would be the same mass times g h

684
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.810
or I should call it g h two

685
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.353
<v 1>yup.</v>

686
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.700
<v 0>Oh,
you're worried about the height varying over the tube.
Yeah,</v>

687
00:46:04.701 --> 00:46:08.180
we are neglecting that aspect.
That's an important point you can ask.

688
00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.180
When you say h two are you talking about the middle or the end and so on.

689
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.360
But we are going to be dealing with problems where the height differences are

690
00:46:14.361 --> 00:46:17.300
much bigger than the cross section of the pipe.
So we don't worry about that.

691
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:19.431
Okay.

692
00:46:19.431 --> 00:46:24.431
Now what does the same quantity here it's going to be minus row a one delta x

693
00:46:29.211 --> 00:46:34.211
one Times v One square over two plus road times g h one.

694
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.140
That's a final energy minus initial energy.

695
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.120
That's got to be equal to the work done.

696
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.380
Now who is doing the work on this

697
00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.990
and you guys understand where is the work coming from?

698
00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.653
<v 1>Yep.</v>

699
00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.370
<v 0>Ah,
no gravity.</v>

700
00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.610
You don't count as a forest when you have a potential energy for gravity.

701
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.690
So gravity is included with the,
the right row g,
H or MGH.

702
00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.460
You don't count gravity again.

703
00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:07.893
<v 1>Oh the foods that</v>

704
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:15.310
<v 0>right.
But if I'm looking at the fluid in question,</v>

705
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:19.180
who is acting on that fluid?
Not what it's doing to others.

706
00:47:19.181 --> 00:47:21.430
Who are the others doing something to this fluid?

707
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.553
<v 1>Yup.</v>

708
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:25.900
<v 0>Or the walls.
Water.</v>

709
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:30.670
The pipe will apply a normal force and that will not do any work.
Okay?
Yes.

710
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.160
Yep.
For water.
Yeah,
but that person is somewhere here.

711
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:39.910
But remember in mechanics,
you don't have to go to people in remote places.

712
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.650
I've told you when you play Newton's law,

713
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.160
the only kinds of forces or what you remember from day one contact forces except

714
00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:51.010
for gravity,
which reaches out and grabs everything.
We've included gravity.

715
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.680
Who is this body of fluid in contact with?

716
00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:56.893
<v 1>Yes.</v>

717
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.520
<v 0>This fluid in between.
No,
but I'm talking about this fluid.</v>

718
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:07.030
I'm talking about all of this fluid.
My taking,

719
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:09.640
the difference of that shared in that shaded region was a convenience,

720
00:48:09.641 --> 00:48:12.850
but I'm looking at the energy change in all of this fluid.

721
00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:16.861
Yeah,

722
00:48:16.861 --> 00:48:21.360
but the point is the fluid to the left here is pushing it and it is pushing the

723
00:48:21.361 --> 00:48:25.980
fluid to the right.
Okay.
That's the only way it is true.

724
00:48:25.981 --> 00:48:28.230
There's a pump somewhere pushing the fluid in the beginning,

725
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:30.750
but you don't have to go all the way to the pump in the end.

726
00:48:30.751 --> 00:48:33.240
You only ask who is in contact with me.
Well,

727
00:48:33.241 --> 00:48:38.241
it's the guys to the left so they will exert a force p one times a one times

728
00:48:40.381 --> 00:48:44.130
delta x one
because that's the force.

729
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.390
That's the distance.

730
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.600
That's the work done on the fluid and the work done by the fluid is p to a to

731
00:48:51.991 --> 00:48:56.490
delta x tooth because if it most of the right it is doing work on the left,

732
00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:58.200
it has has work done on it.

733
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:02.423
<v 1>There you go.</v>

734
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:08.260
<v 0>Oh,
you can see that everyone delta x one and a two delta x two are all equal</v>

735
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:13.240
because that is just the volume of the fluid displaced in the short time that

736
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:14.350
it's just the continuity equation.

737
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:17.680
If you divide everything by Delta t if you like,

738
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:22.960
then you will find that delta x over Delta t is v two I'm just using the fact a

739
00:49:22.961 --> 00:49:27.070
when we,
when is eight to be too,
so if you cancel those factors,

740
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.510
what do I get?

741
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.180
I'm going to just write it for you now.
You guys can go home and check it.

742
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.900
He one minus p two is equal to one half row

743
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.880
B Two Square Roy,

744
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.940
g h two minus one half row v One square minus Roy g h one this is nice.

745
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.770
This is a derivation that you can go home and study at leisure.

746
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.860
In any book you're like,
they're all the same.
The story is the same.

747
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.960
I can only tell you if you'd like to know what the trick behind the derivation

748
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:08.980
was.
I don't mind going over that because maybe there are different volumes and

749
00:50:08.981 --> 00:50:10.540
questions.
You may have gotten confused,

750
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.220
but first let me write down the result by writing everything with one on one

751
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:17.730
side and two on the other side.
I get this result.

752
00:50:17.731 --> 00:50:22.731
P one was Rovy when square over to Roy g h one

753
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.820
is Pete to the steroid,

754
00:50:26.821 --> 00:50:30.920
g h two plus one half row B two square.

755
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.520
This is nothing other than the law of conservation of energy applied to unit

756
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:40.610
volume.
If you take one meter cubed of the fluid,

757
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.010
it's masters at all times one,

758
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.440
so this is really a mass of one cubic meter of the fluid.
This is kinetic energy.

759
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:51.530
That's is potential energy.
That's the candidate.
That's a potential.

760
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:52.540
You mentioned,

761
00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.240
why aren't we just created candidate plus potential to kinetic plus potential is

762
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:58.310
because this chunk of fluid that I focused on,

763
00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:03.200
it's not an isolated system is getting pushed from people behind it and it's

764
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:04.400
pushing people.
I had a fit,

765
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.990
so you've got to take the difference between the work done on it and the work

766
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:09.824
done by it.

767
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.700
Then you will find they don't quite canceled because the pressures are not
equal.

768
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:16.970
The pressures that unequal you get an extra contribution,

769
00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:20.000
but this is simply the law of conservation of energy.

770
00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.810
I got it by writing law of conservation of energy,

771
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.100
but it takes a while for you guys to get used to applying the law of

772
00:51:28.101 --> 00:51:28.970
conservation of energy.

773
00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.870
Maybe always used to saying kinetic plus potential is kinetic potential.

774
00:51:32.871 --> 00:51:33.920
You got used to that.

775
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:38.900
Are you all set a member candidate plus potential may be less at the end than

776
00:51:38.901 --> 00:51:40.280
the beginning because there was friction.

777
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.070
This is yet another thing where there's no friction,

778
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:48.050
but that are external forces acting on a body that is gravity,

779
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:51.170
which has included the military,
right,
or potential energy MGH.

780
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.380
That's a waltz too.
I think some of you brought up a very good point.

781
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.030
The ones that are exerting a force,

782
00:51:56.031 --> 00:52:00.290
but that's perpendicular to the fluid in a real fluid.

783
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:04.820
The Walsall in fact exerting force paddle to the fluid as called viscosity,

784
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:10.430
so in a real fluid that will be a drag on the fluid because the fluid really

785
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:12.230
doesn't like to move right up against the wall.

786
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:14.900
It doesn't mind moving in the middle of the tubes.
I should go near the edge.

787
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:18.860
Just the speed of the fluid will relax to zero and that's a region where there's

788
00:52:18.861 --> 00:52:19.820
a lot of dissipation,

789
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:24.320
so we had ignoring what's called viscosity that ignoring all other losses.

790
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:29.420
Then this is simply law of conservation of energy and as to what I did with

791
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:32.390
those two volumes,
maybe I'll repeat this so you can all follow this.

792
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.080
I'm saying take all that fluid now.

793
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:43.060
Find the total energy in it and ask what happened at that fluid a little later.

794
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.560
Well,
fortunately here the pipe also had

795
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.680
some problems.
Uh,
okay,

796
00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:58.640
where is this fluid?
A short time later,
I want you to think about it.

797
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.870
This end has moved here.
This end has moved there.

798
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.710
So the fluid at the end of the day is sitting there.

799
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:11.540
I want the energy of all of these guys might as the energy,
all of this.

800
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:16.570
Then you can see in the comparison is only this part that is gained in this spot

801
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.630
that is lost.
This part is common.
When I say common,

802
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.810
not only is the mass comm and the location at every location,

803
00:53:23.811 --> 00:53:27.630
the height and velocity or the same.
So in this,
in the subtraction,

804
00:53:27.631 --> 00:53:31.020
this will cancel that,
that'll cancel that.
This will have nothing to cancel it.

805
00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:32.130
This will have nothing to cancel.

806
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:36.240
So you just focus on the relative increments and that difference is what gives

807
00:53:36.241 --> 00:53:40.620
you the net change in energy and you equate that to the work done.

808
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.000
Okay,
so now we are going to learn how to use this Bernoulli.

809
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.460
The main thing to notice about Bertolli is for a minute,

810
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:55.200
if you focus on fluid at the same height,
just think about the same height.

811
00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.880
It tells you when over the fluid picks up speed is going to lose pressure

812
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:06.660
because PE plus v squared or something is people as B squared afterwards.

813
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.620
If you increase be,

814
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:12.910
if you increase via gonna decrease P and that's the trust or Bernoulli at a

815
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:18.090
qualitative level.
I'll give you some quantitative examples.

816
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:21.000
So one example is that baseball,

817
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:25.260
here's the baseball coursing through air.

818
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.133
If you like,

819
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:32.100
you can sit and write with a baseball and say the ad is going backwards

820
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.000
in the baseball is going that way.

821
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.820
Now suppose you spin the baseball like this.

822
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.193
<v 2>Okay?</v>

823
00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.450
<v 0>If you spend the baseball,</v>

824
00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:51.850
it carries some of its own air due to friction between the leather and the air.

825
00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:56.670
So that velocity is countered with the velocity of the drift.

826
00:54:56.671 --> 00:54:58.810
You on the top and additive in the bottom.

827
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:02.890
So the actual add velocity in the bottom,

828
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.490
we'll be more than the bottom and less than the top because it's subtracting

829
00:55:06.491 --> 00:55:08.650
this vector from the top and adding the spectrum.
The bottom.

830
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:13.510
So if the velocity is different,
this is the higher velocity region,

831
00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.150
this the Lord will last region suppressor here.

832
00:55:16.151 --> 00:55:19.930
It will be less than the pressure there.
So the bottle will sink down

833
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.830
the spine of the opposite.
We had the bottle will rise up.

834
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.670
If you spend the ball side to side,
the ball will curve from left to right.

835
00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.330
So that's the spin on the ball.

836
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:36.430
You've got to spin the ball and release it then produces extra forces.

837
00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:40.150
This rising and falling is on top of the falling due to gravity.

838
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:42.910
Even in a planet with the gravity,

839
00:55:42.911 --> 00:55:47.650
you will have this extra force is coming simply because the velocity of the top

840
00:55:47.651 --> 00:55:51.190
and bottom had been modified.
Here's another example.

841
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.260
Here's an airplane.
Wing.
Plane is going like this.

842
00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:01.450
They'll go right with the plane in which gets the air seems to be doing this

843
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.310
far from the plane.
Everything looks the same.

844
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:13.120
I said the wing but not there,
but near the wing.

845
00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.040
This is the flow of air pass the wing.

846
00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:21.900
Notice that these guys [inaudible] have to travel further than the particles

847
00:56:22.451 --> 00:56:25.540
below the wing so they can catch up here.
Everything is the same,

848
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.250
so the velocity on top of the air foil is faster.
That for pressure,

849
00:56:31.251 --> 00:56:34.270
this lower pressures lower than in the bottom.

850
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:38.890
Then the difference in pressure times area of the wing will push the wing up.

851
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:44.830
That's the lift you get when you start a plane.
When you're on the runway.

852
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:49.000
This is why the plane goes up.
Once you're airborne,
you can tilt your wing.

853
00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:52.540
When you tilt your wing to this angle,

854
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.980
then of course it's very clear that you can get a component of lift,

855
00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:00.910
but I'm talking about when the wing is not tilted but horizontal.

856
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:06.190
That's what gives you the lift.
Now,
what if you

857
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:12.580
made a wing that looks like this?
Okay,
shit all laughing,

858
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:18.070
but this has to use to have you seen it anywhere?
Yes.

859
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.800
Mass car on the racetrack.

860
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.310
You want the opposite effect because you want to push down on the car and

861
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:29.020
therefore you manufactured wings and go to the factory where by mistake they

862
00:57:29.021 --> 00:57:30.460
built a wing that looks like this.

863
00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.070
Then you can bring it to your race car and attach it.

864
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.010
Then it'll keep the race card.
Now of course,

865
00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:39.160
you also have the other option of going to the wing and tipping it over and and

866
00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:42.520
applying it to the airplane.
But if it did not occur to you,
if you thought,

867
00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:44.650
once the thing is made like this,
I'm stuck with this wing,

868
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:47.260
I'll go take it to your race car and attach it.

869
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:52.150
That'll push it down because you want to get traction so you can get the upward

870
00:57:52.151 --> 00:57:53.840
lift or the downward lit.

871
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:58.600
Now it turns out this lift theory is actually somewhat naive,

872
00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.260
and I believed it for a long time.
Now I know the story is more complicated.

873
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:05.590
That is a lot of truth to this,
but it's not the whole story.

874
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:07.630
So if you go into aeronautical engineering one day,

875
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:10.840
you will find out that it's a little more complicated reason,

876
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.450
way to calculate the precise lift.

877
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:17.790
But this general notion that when the air moves fast,
it loses pressure.

878
00:58:17.791 --> 00:58:22.000
It is true.
So,
uh,
here's another example.

879
00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:24.310
If you have an atomizer,

880
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:30.140
you know you have a perfume here and you've got a pump and then you have a cube

881
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:35.710
here.
When you squeeze the pump,
the instant you squeeze the pump,

882
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:38.200
you're driving a lot of ad here and high velocity.

883
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.320
Where does the Ed here is addressed?

884
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:45.190
So high velocity air has a lower pressure than Lowville on CBR.

885
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:49.810
Therefore it'll suck the perfume and spray it right on your face.

886
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.560
Yes.
Okay,
very good.

887
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:05.410
You know I've taught you so many things,
planets and Supernova and galaxies,

888
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.930
but now I got a rise out of this class.
They said,

889
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:11.320
now we are telling us something use.
All right,

890
00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.640
so now I'm going to do two problems where I really start putting numbers in.

891
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.990
This is very qualitative.

892
00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:22.070
I'm going to do quantitative problems and there only two kinds.

893
00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:25.430
So when we are done,
we're done.
Here's a tank of water

894
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.780
and I poke a hole in this.
Somebody to here

895
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.640
at the depths,
let's call it eight

896
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:41.670
question is how fast will the water come out of here?
Turn Sour.

897
00:59:41.671 --> 00:59:44.930
Do you can use this bed knollies whether this called Bernoulli's equation can

898
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:46.020
use Bernoulli to derive,

899
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.850
you just have to pick the points one and two cleverly to,

900
00:59:49.851 --> 00:59:52.970
this is going to be 0.1.
This is going to be point to

901
00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:57.260
point to in fact it just outside that whole,

902
01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:01.310
what does Bernoulli say?

903
01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:06.860
P One which is atmospheric pressure plus one half row.

904
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:12.490
The one square plus Roy g h one is equal but p two plus one half Roe v two

905
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:18.300
square foot.
That's Roy g h two.

906
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.540
Let's modify this as follows.
Ah,

907
01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.630
let's bit pick eight store to be zero than h one is just this.

908
01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:30.380
I mean you can pick the zero anywhere you like so bad.
The whole list.

909
01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:33.950
I'm calling zero so I don't have to worry about this one.

910
01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:37.790
V Two is what I'm after.

911
01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.680
What about p one and p Two p one is atmospheric pressure there and right outside

912
01:00:45.021 --> 01:00:46.790
the home it's also the atmospheric pressure.

913
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:51.020
So p one and p two you canceled because they both equal atmospheric pressure.

914
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

915
01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:55.450
<v 0>How about the velocity here?</v>

916
01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.780
You know that if you punk punch a hole in the tank and you drain it,

917
01:00:58.781 --> 01:01:02.500
it's going to start moving down,
but we are going to imagine that's a huge tank,

918
01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:05.710
no 10 meters diameter and this is a tiny pinprick.

919
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:09.790
Then this velocity is negligible.
You can put that back in if you like.

920
01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.530
I'm just going to ignore that for now.

921
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:17.700
That tells me g h one let's go to one half row v two square.

922
01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.840
Cancel the row and you find v squared is equal to two G H S.

923
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.750
O.
B.
Two squared is two g h.

924
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.890
Now you remember this formula from day one.

925
01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:39.450
This is the velocity droplet would have if it spilled over the top and fell

926
01:01:41.201 --> 01:01:42.034
straight down.

927
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.033
<v 1>Okay,</v>

928
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:48.250
<v 0>because that is just the MGH being converted to one half Mv Square</v>

929
01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.600
because by the law of conservation of energy,

930
01:01:52.601 --> 01:01:56.350
the minute the fluid starts coming out of here and draining or the top,

931
01:01:56.950 --> 01:02:01.810
I have traded droplets of water at the top four droplets of water at the bottom.

932
01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.950
Therefore,
since they had potential energy at the top,

933
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.630
they must have kinetic energy at the bottom,

934
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:11.740
but be clear about one thing that drop coming here.

935
01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:16.570
It's not the same drop moving at the top.
If I push it over the top,

936
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:19.590
that would be the same drop and it's very clear all of this.

937
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.460
The beauty of this is this water is pushing down and something's coming out
here.

938
01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.640
It's coming out with the right speed so that drop by drop the kinetic energy of

939
01:02:27.641 --> 01:02:31.140
what comes out here,
the potential energy of what's draining at the top

940
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.160
so you can point the whole at various places.
You know,

941
01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:36.240
once you punch a hole here,

942
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:39.780
it's going to land there and you can imagine the fun you can have with this kind

943
01:02:39.781 --> 01:02:44.370
of problem.
Where do at points the whole so that if my dog is standing here,

944
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:49.020
it's going to feed the dog are don't feed the dog,

945
01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:52.770
go up in front of the dog,
go past the dog,
get the biggest rain,
smallest rain,

946
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:53.980
whole bunch of problems.

947
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:58.740
They will combine this Bernoulli who will tell you how fast it's coming out with

948
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:02.940
chapter one of how to do trajectories once the fluid is coming or this way.

949
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.600
Okay,
last topic.
It's again,
it's not even a new topic.

950
01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.100
Last application of Bertolli has to do with the

951
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.280
what's called the eventually meet her.
By the way,

952
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.900
you can imagine this is just a cross section of possible applications of fluid

953
01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:27.630
dynamics,
lips.
You can take a whole course on fluid dynamics,

954
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.460
so let's take the falling problem.
So you had going in an airplane

955
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:37.110
and you want to find out how fast the plane is going,

956
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.650
how do you think you find out?

957
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:47.300
I will show you now one device people use to find the flow rate to find the

958
01:03:47.881 --> 01:03:50.280
speed of the plane through the atmosphere.

959
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:54.150
So you go to the plane and

960
01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:55.920
<v 1>okay,</v>

961
01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.890
<v 0>you would attest the following device to the underside of the plane.</v>

962
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.070
Melissa,
I'm imagining in my mind a symmetric thing.

963
01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:08.580
This is a pipe with their construction.

964
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:14.350
He had the ad is coming in at the speed of the plan itself.

965
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:18.060
See in real life the plane is going through the airport.

966
01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:23.070
Go sit with the plane because the ad is going backwards at the speed of the

967
01:04:23.351 --> 01:04:27.010
plane,
so that's a cross section.
A one here.

968
01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.360
The one is what we are trying to find.
I hope you understand.
That's our goal.

969
01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:37.690
Then it comes to this region where it has to speed up because able and me one is

970
01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:41.980
eight to be too.
If it speeds up,
the pressure to here is going to be lower.

971
01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.120
Let's first calculate the pressure difference between this point and this point.

972
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:51.520
No,
they had both at the same altitude.
Here's another example.

973
01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.200
You have 5,000 feet above the ground.

974
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:56.350
Don't worry about altitude to here or there or there.

975
01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:01.930
That's python is the big height in that the age cancels on both sides.

976
01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:06.740
We don't worry about the variation in height over this gadget was a very,

977
01:05:06.741 --> 01:05:09.280
very tiny thing.
You attached to the underside of the plane.

978
01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:15.540
So then I can say p one plus one half row B one square plus Roy g h one I'm not

979
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:21.700
going to write because h one and a steward going to be equal.

980
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:24.880
Then it's beat to one half row

981
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:27.743
v two squared

982
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:32.140
that for p two minus p one

983
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:37.660
is equal to one half row B one square

984
01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:40.810
minus v two square.

985
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:46.960
No B one is the speed of the plane.

986
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:51.010
No v two is not the speed of the plane,

987
01:05:51.011 --> 01:05:55.330
but we know what v two is because v two times eight to is it going to be one

988
01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:59.890
times 81 so we can write here one half row.

989
01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:05.170
The one square minus V two squared is B one squared at times a one

990
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:08.320
over a two square.

991
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:15.250
So pull out the V one and you write it as one half row.

992
01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:20.790
You want to squared times one minus a one over 82 square.

993
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:30.580
So let's digest this formula for the second.
In this problem,

994
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:34.060
everyone is bigger than eight two so you may worry that one minus 81 over 82

995
01:06:34.061 --> 01:06:34.960
squared is negative.

996
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:39.610
But so is p two minus p one because p two here is certainly going to be lower

997
01:06:39.611 --> 01:06:42.270
than p one here.
So you feel happier.

998
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:47.020
You can flip it backwards and write p one minus p two is something you see that

999
01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:50.140
you can flip it over.
You flip it over here,

1000
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:54.790
but ask yourself what do I need to know to find the speed of the plane?

1001
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:56.950
Speed of the plane is here.

1002
01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.510
Roy is the density of what can you tell me Roy's density of what?

1003
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.140
A residency of air a one and a two are known because you designed the tube.

1004
01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:13.750
So if you can find the pressure difference somehow you can read up the speed of

1005
01:07:13.751 --> 01:07:14.584
the plane.

1006
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:18.730
So what people do to find the pressure difference is they go and they take,

1007
01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.740
they punch a hole there and they put here,

1008
01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:27.913
<v 1>okay,</v>

1009
01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:29.670
<v 0>okay.
A fluid</v>

1010
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.970
like oil.
If the plane is not moving,

1011
01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.640
you can tell these two heights must be equal

1012
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:41.910
because that's the condition.

1013
01:07:41.911 --> 01:07:45.810
But a hydrostatic equilibrium because these two pressures are equal.

1014
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.490
But if the plane starts moving and the pressure is lower than the pressure here,

1015
01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:51.900
imagine this is a high pressure.

1016
01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:56.040
There's no pressure will push the fluid up and it'll start looking like this

1017
01:07:58.310 --> 01:07:59.840
with a little extra on the other side.

1018
01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:06.830
And how much extra is it?
Well,
let's think about it.

1019
01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.610
The pressure,
these two points is the same depression.

1020
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.780
Here is what I call [inaudible].

1021
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:17.150
The pressure here is p two less row,

1022
01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.640
g times height of this fluid.

1023
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:24.470
This Roy is not the density of air.
This Roy is the density of oil.
Let's see.

1024
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:27.643
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1025
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:30.110
<v 0>so the minute the plane begins to move,</v>

1026
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:33.230
the pressure here will be higher than the pressure here.

1027
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:38.470
The fluid will be pushed up and the difference in these two heights directly is

1028
01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:41.570
a measurement of the pressure difference that internists a measured of the

1029
01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:42.404
velocity.

1030
01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.960
So what you will try to do is then forget all about the height,
the prunes.

1031
01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:52.230
And if you're clever enough you can put markings so that by counting the

1032
01:08:52.231 --> 01:08:55.260
difference in the markings,
you can translate to the speed of the plane.

1033
01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.590
You can also use this to find this rated with oil is flowing,

1034
01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:04.400
that was oil is flowing in a pipe and you want to know the rate at which oil is

1035
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:08.570
flowing.
Again,
create a constriction in the flow,

1036
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:14.450
then put some tubes.
These cannot be oil.
This gotta be some other fluid.

1037
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.750
Once again,
that'll be a pressure difference.

1038
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:19.880
And then the height difference of night different,

1039
01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:22.700
you can find the rate at which the fluid is flowing here.

1040
01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:26.660
So what's the trick we use?
Yes,

1041
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.433
<v 1>yes.</v>

1042
01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.380
<v 0>Oh,
for this one?</v>

1043
01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.120
<v 1>Yeah,
in general.</v>

1044
01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:40.710
<v 0>Well,
I don't,
I think all I'm,
as far as I can tell,</v>

1045
01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:42.690
there's going to be a pressure difference.

1046
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:46.110
There's going to translate into height difference.
And if the two do not mix,

1047
01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.930
I don't know what the danger,

1048
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.870
I think one danger you may have is if the fluid comes in here and if we can

1049
01:09:51.871 --> 01:09:55.170
penetrate this,
it'll start mixing.
Right?
So for that purpose,

1050
01:09:55.171 --> 01:09:58.890
it may be better if this one is a higher density than the one on the top.

1051
01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:05.700
Now in practice,
I'm not really sure what kind of fluids people use

1052
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:09.560
in any engineering thing.
Um,
my,

1053
01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:12.650
I get very shaky when you started going into the real worlds had been my

1054
01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:16.910
practice to avoid it as much as possible,
which is why I chose this career.

1055
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.880
But people who really want to build something,

1056
01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:22.670
have to worry about what fluid to use.
You know,
what starts mixing,

1057
01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:26.630
what does makes,
what's the accuracy.
So I don't,
if I thought hard about it,

1058
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:30.290
I will try to reduce everything to Newton's laws or something,

1059
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.430
lots of thermodynamics,

1060
01:10:31.431 --> 01:10:34.250
but to take years and years to go from there to something practical.

1061
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.460
So I don't know in practice what fluids people use.

1062
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:42.210
So this is another example of uh,

1063
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:47.010
Bernoulli's principle final one,
which is kind of problem you sometimes do get,

1064
01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.640
I'm not going to write the equations,
do the numbers,

1065
01:10:50.641 --> 01:10:54.540
but I'll tell you how to think about it.
Suppose you have a tank of water

1066
01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.880
and I make up another tube here and I cap it and the fluid here comes to some

1067
01:11:03.511 --> 01:11:04.230
height.

1068
01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:08.040
First question you can ask is what's the height to which fluid will rise here?

1069
01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:11.910
Or you know,
from your high school days he'll rise to the same height.

1070
01:11:11.911 --> 01:11:14.220
But what's the argument that you will give today?

1071
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:16.650
But why that high tends to be the same.

1072
01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:21.570
You will use Bernoulli's principle and you will take two points here.

1073
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.083
What example?

1074
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.750
Luckily there's no velocity to what he bought additional height to worry about.

1075
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.680
So p one equals p two which is what we did use by other considerations.

1076
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.040
Those pressures that equal that is atmospheric pressure.

1077
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.330
That's atmospheric pressure.

1078
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:41.310
Then these columns have to be equal because starting with atmosphere plus road g

1079
01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:43.710
eight you want to hit the same number here as there,

1080
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:45.440
<v 2>okay?</v>

1081
01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.790
<v 0>But now if you open this fight and let the fluid really start flowing,</v>

1082
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.530
then the story is different.
The minute fluids stops flowing here starts flowing.

1083
01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.130
You amendment from the Bernoulli.
If you got a velocity,
you lose pressure.

1084
01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:02.360
Pressured here will be lower than the atmosphere and then this will drop.

1085
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:08.770
He drops of that atmosphere.
Plus that highest gives the pressure here.

1086
01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:11.620
Whereas atmosphere plus the bigger height gives the pressure here

1087
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:15.030
and the last you hear us,

1088
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.690
you have to be negligible in the last here to some [inaudible] of fluids coming

1089
01:12:18.691 --> 01:12:21.930
up.
Okay,

1090
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:27.470
so guys have a good holiday in spite of what I've done to you most reluctantly,

1091
01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.120
and I'll see you all after the break.
