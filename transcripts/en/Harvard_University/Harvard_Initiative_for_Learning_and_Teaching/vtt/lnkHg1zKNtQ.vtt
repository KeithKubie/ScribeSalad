00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:05.990
All right.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.760
So we're going to move on
to a different category.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.220
And we're going to
go in this order.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.129
And then at the end,
we're going to have

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.810
a little more depth about the
Social Innovation project.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.230
So I love this project.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.330
It's the project
that when everyone

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.250
says to me what is
curriculum mapping,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.770
it's the one that I bring up
because it's just so clear.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.442
If you said across
the university,

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:38.150
what are all of the
courses, all the ways

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.860
that ethics is being taught?

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.160
It's probably taught in
every Harvard school.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.450
How do we know where are
the ethics courses are?

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.680
So the team, which
you can see here--

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.110
Danielle Allen couldn't be here.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.770
Jess Miner, Michael
Blau, David Comer Kidd.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.620
They have been
working really hard.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.370
And as I understand it, you took
kind of inductive and deductive

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.770
approaches both to narrowing
in on the range of many words

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.800
that could be related
to ethics instruction.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.360
And then you used
that to develop

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.822
a kind of weighted
algorithm, and then used

00:01:19.822 --> 00:01:22.030
that weighted algorithm to
search all of the syllabi,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.380
and then to identify courses.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.440
Survey instructors
get their teaching

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.600
learning materials
that then become

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.000
additional sources of data to
draw out the implicit learning

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.090
theories around ethics and
to begin to think about not

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.300
just which courses,
but the pedagogical

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.910
approaches to teaching
ethics, and how

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.630
to develop a community
here around those issues,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.880
and then broaden that
community outside of Harvard

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.830
and think about
ethics instruction

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.910
out there in the world
and in other institutions.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.220
So key constituents,
undergraduate and professional

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.590
students, faculty, instructors,
and administrators.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.350
That's the whole university.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.260
I think you could add alumni.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.240
And I do think it does have
that sort of applicability.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.620
So look at this visual, how
many courses were identified.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.710
That's a lot of courses.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.850
Then there is how many
were selected out of that

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.860
and unique instructors.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.350
And look at how many
survey responses they got.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.550
This is already a community.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.510
By next year the goal is to
do another round of faculty

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.180
surveys, refine and
administer the pre-

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.090
and post-semester student
surveys, so now learning

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.840
from students, and test and
transfer the methodology

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.390
to other campuses, and
hopes for curriculum

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.670
mapping it at Harvard.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.880
Build student-friendly tools
for identifying ethics courses

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.080
and learning opportunities.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.644
What do student-friendly
tools look like?

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.060
We'll be getting
to that because I

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.850
think Jeffrey and others
in the Curricle project

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.370
are also thinking about
student-friendly kinds

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.930
of tools.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.040
Identify strengths and gaps in
ethics education at Harvard.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.950
Promote discussion
and collaboration.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.820
Similarly, Subu, faculty member
in the School of Public Health,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.070
had another kind of question
that was crossing instruction

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.470
all across Harvard.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.595
Who's teaching applied
quantitative methods?

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:40.220
What are the applied
statistics courses

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.610
that are being taught in social
sciences by non-statisticians?

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.080
How do these courses compare?

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.070
How do students move through
the system to take courses

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.150
in applied statistics?

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.680
And people do move.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.080
They don't just stick
in their school.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.300
They move to other
schools to try

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.630
to get the methodological
training that they

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.950
feel that they need.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.220
Graduate students are the
key constituency here,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.920
and then faculty.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.790
By next year have a web resource
to facilitate optimal course

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.860
selection for students.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.470
A synthesis-based
deep dive of what's

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.019
being taught at
Harvard with an aim

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.930
to develop a taxonomy
of these courses.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.330
That's a big goal.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.300
It should be an interesting one.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.445
And again, it will be drawing
on the data sources of syllabi

00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:28.850
and course materials.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.340
Subu or Judy might
remember as we identified

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.062
these courses, reached
out to faculty and said,

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:40.520
hey, could you send
us our syllabi,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.040
because we couldn't use
syllabus tool because it was not

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.680
just in the FAS.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.740
Within an hour, you
had hundreds of people,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.300
or a whole lot of
people writing.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.910
There is a hunger
among the faculty

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.850
to be able to share their
resources with one another

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.640
and to build this
kind of community.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.230
So one of the goals is just
making this meaningful faculty

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.890
connections, and then providing
more course selection support

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.310
to students.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.950
If you look at this
visual, you can

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.100
see the percentage of the
applied quantitative methods

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.210
by school.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.590
But we don't know if
this picture is accurate.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.940
We really don't know.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.090
I think this is a
first stab, and then we

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.700
have to iterate and
learn to what degree this

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.810
might change over time.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.890
So Curricle is this amazing
intellectual project.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.970
And when I first heard about
it, my jaw almost dropped.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.450
I really couldn't believe
that this ambitious effort

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.640
was underway.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.230
We have Jeffrey, Matthew
Battles couldn't be here.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.980
Sebastian.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.150
We have Jessica, Kim
here from the team.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.640
And you can see here we've
got these two different.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.850
They're both doing user testing
and still collecting data.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.470
As I have thought
about this project,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.420
there's sort of two parts of it.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.670
One is building a
curiosity-driven search

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.110
tool for students.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.130
And the other is drawing
on really interesting

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.830
archival data about the
intellectual curricular

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.390
story of Harvard
over time, going back

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.440
the hundreds of
years of the things

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.380
that have been taught
at Harvard to say, how

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.510
has Dante's Inferno been taught
throughout Harvard's history,

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.800
and to develop these kinds
of stories of a student's

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.550
progression while
they were here that

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.610
might get students to think
in different kinds of ways

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.330
than they usually do about
their own progression and path

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.620
through the curriculum.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.840
So I think it's an ambitious
project because there's

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.070
a lot of data that might not
be digitized and easily put

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.420
into a format where you could
do that kind of deep work.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.120
At the same time, it really
relates to a lot of the tools

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.780
that Dustin has been building.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.470
And as we, in a more
straightforward way,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.020
are building these tools
and increasing data sources,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.910
we can pull it together
with the things

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.450
that Jeffrey and others
have been working on.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.340
So research questions.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.010
How might data visualization
reveal hidden connections

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.330
among courses of study?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.910
How might we provide students
with meaningful data in a user

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.360
friendly format to support
them in course selection?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.744
Using and adapting
historical curriculum data,

00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:43.160
what stories can we tell about
intellectual and curricular

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.590
trends throughout
Harvard's history?

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:51.290
Students, faculty, department
chairs as key constituents.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.620
Goals by June 2019.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.959
One full academic year of public
prototype testing completed.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:59.750
I think-- tell me if
this is right-- you're

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.660
in prototype testing now.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.380
Yeah.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.220
Suite visualization
micronarratives

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.934
published and a mobile
version in demo.

00:08:09.934 --> 00:08:12.110
Hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.640
Visualization and
data integration

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.670
will promote discovery
and course selection.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.870
Visualizations can
show connections.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.370
Now how in the world--

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.880
I was looking at this
visual and I was like, wait.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.370
Are these the schools that
tell the truth, and these

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.990
are the schools that are--

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.910
and so I had to get
some clarification.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.200
No.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.039
This tool allows you
to put in any two words

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.460
and then see which
schools have courses

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.732
that offer things related
to those words overlapping.

00:08:41.732 --> 00:08:43.940
And then if you click on
one of those in the middle--

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.960
this is already in an interface,
a tool that you can play with--

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.570
then you get to actually
see all the list of courses

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.180
and the ways in which they're
talking about either truth

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.210
or lie.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:54.710
All right.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.690
DART.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.930
I cannot do this
project justice.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.510
I think you can't do it
justice in this sort of format.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.590
What you need to do is actually
play with this and have a demo.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.110
You need to go and look at this.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.610
There's a website,
and I should just

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.517
say on the little brochures we
handed out, there's a website.

00:09:17.517 --> 00:09:19.850
You can go and learn more
information about these tools.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.970
Also you can go and look
up DART in particular.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.640
So imagine this
repository where you

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.630
can put teaching and learning
assets of any number of sizes

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.520
and shapes.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.010
Right now the
content has started

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.410
with HarvardX data, HarvardX
videos and other assets that

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.460
are in HarvardX courses, as
well as Harvard YouTube video

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:47.960
assets.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.840
But it could include any
kinds of teaching and learning

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.830
assets.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.780
And then it's this really
powerful search tool.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.610
So you use search for a word
that you're interested in.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.360
I think the demos I've
seen have been like moon.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.370
And all of the things that
are related to moon come up.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.415
And you can do a little
preview really quickly

00:10:07.415 --> 00:10:09.220
of what these things look like.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.640
Then, most magically,
you just say

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.130
I want to put this
in my Canvas course.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:15.990
Boom.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.730
It's in your Canvas course,
and you can use it and share it

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.770
with your students.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.420
So it is a work in
progress right now.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.490
As I understand it,
the more that Daniel

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.590
can get people to use
it and give feedback,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.390
the more he can build new
attributes and new tools.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.327
So you should talk with Daniel.

00:10:34.327 --> 00:10:36.660
You should play with it and
you should talk with Daniel,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.500
and you should begin to see
what else he can do to help you

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.250
use this tool more over time.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.310
By June 2019,
cross-institutional content

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.420
sharing and more direct
reuse of Canvas resources.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.650
So now it's going
the other direction.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.450
You have Canvas resources.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.670
Make it usable for
everybody to then put

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.400
into their Canvas courses.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.414
This is what the
interface looks like.

00:11:03.414 --> 00:11:05.080
Hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.455
Provide data and
tools that allow

00:11:06.455 --> 00:11:09.760
people to more directly
explore Harvard content.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.560
We're going to now
hear from Brittany

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.300
for this last of our
curriculum mapping projects.
