00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.940
We've all missed someone so much that we start to romanticize the past

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.780
It throws off your judgement and soon you're overwhelmed with just wanting to be with that person again

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.480
While people often say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, it instead allows feelings of being miserable and empty to grow instead

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.359
Before deciding to get back together with your ex, watch this video for reasons about why you shouldn't

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.480
After you've been separated from someone, There's a tendency to romanticize the past

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.840
Meaning that you focus only on the good things that happened and ignore all the bad

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.380
By blocking out all the reasons why you two didn't work out

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.689
You're recreating a false image of that person

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.630
You're remembering somebody who didn't really exist

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.270
When you remember only the good you no longer miss your ex and instead miss the idea of them

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.780
For example say you just broke up with "Person A." You start to miss them and think of all the good times you had together

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.180
Ignoring all the times you and "Person A" fought or argued

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.390
You focus so much on all the good things about person a that. You've created a whole new person. "Person B"

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.769
You don't really miss Person A because you miss Person B, who sadly is only an idea

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.029
Instead of blocking out the bad things that happened focus on them

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.669
So you can learn. Learn what personality traits you want to look for and what traits you want to stay away from.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.220
Let yourself grow and move on

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.790
Breaking up is a drastic change and no one likes change. It's natural to crave familiarity

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.690
So we often go back to whatever. We just lost whether it was healthy or not

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.440
You aren't used to being alone or dealing with the loud thoughts in your head

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.500
You're used to having Person A to talk to, so not having them around is frustrating and leaves you with a sense of emptiness.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.420
It was comforting having PersonA around to talk to. Why would you want to keep them away?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.140
However, while familiarity is comforting, you must remember that familiarity isn't always the healthiest choice.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.780
Sometimes, you need to step out of your comfort zone to be happy

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.360
coupled with familiarity

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.729
After our breakup you end up yearning for closeness

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.189
Being close with someone is a special feeling one that often leaves you feeling empty once gone

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.349
You miss knowing the other person inside and out, and them knowing you as well. However,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.790
Remember that being close to someone isn't restricted to that specific person and being close in general doesn't necessarily create happiness

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.000
Instead of focusing on the crave for companionship focus on yourself, and how you can be happy being on your own

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.169
You both have changed since you first started going out

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.170
your experiences together have shaped who you've become and you are no longer the same people you once were as

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.640
You grew as people you also grew apart. You could no longer change together, so you had to make the ultimate change and breakup

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.140
Change is never fun and it can be tempting to avoid it altogether but stopping yourself from growing is not the solution

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.679
You should continue to help yourself grow in that process you will find people who can grow alongside you

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.619
After pouring all your love energy and hard work into a person it can feel like they owe you love

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.020
But beating a dead horse won't do you any good

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.679
You can never force somebody to love you. No matter how much you try

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.169
Human nature has us naturally rebel against force as we don't like being told to do things

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.749
This especially applies to love in relationships forcing someone to love you doesn't make them

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.270
love you. In the end, they may resent you, creating a larger gap between you than there was before

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.690
Don't try to force love and you'll end up being happier

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.969
Compatibility is key in a relationship, and when it's gone. There is little hope for success when revealing yourself in a new relationship

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.230
this is when compatibility is tested and often fails as

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.899
You learn more about each other your true colors shine and you discover whether it's meant to last or not

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.019
After a breakup as more time progresses

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.480
It'll be easier to look back and see how you two were incompatible and are much better being separated

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.819
It can be hard to see it in a heat of the moment

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.119
But remember that it'll pass ,and you'll be happier being on your own

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.089
Well it may seem hard to see someone else will come along and be a much better match for you

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.399
You will have learned from your mistakes from your ex so you know what to look for in your new partner

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.120
And you will be able to spot warning signs before they get out of hand.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.520
You will have grown as a person from your last relationship

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.960
Able to handle different things. You will be able to lead a new life and a new relationship staying on safe and healthy waters.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.489
Don't give up on love. It's out there, and you'll find it when you're ready

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:48.729
Remember that it's healthier to let go than to hold on to a love that isn't there anymore. That's all from us.

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.399
