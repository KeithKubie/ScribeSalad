00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.917
(children talking)

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:09.619
- Victor, I love your ability to admit

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.804
that you wanna do better at times,

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:14.533
and then how committed
you are to doing that.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.153
Circles are a time for the
community to come together

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:19.291
and develop themselves as individuals,

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.379
develop their relationships,

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:22.478
and really address community work.

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:24.779
And we actually believe
that by doing that,

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.619
kids will succeed more academically

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.030
because they feel safe and they're

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.611
in trusting relationships.

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:30.444
- Thanks.

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:39.694
- Valor is a middle school
based in Nashville, Tennessee.

00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:43.172
We really value our
relationships with each other,

00:00:43.172 --> 00:00:46.417
and we work really hard to create

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:51.192
the school community that
we want to be a part of.

00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:53.453
Circle is an important part of that work.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.756
(man speaking)

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:56.130
- Our circle model is something that both

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.770
our adults and our scholars
do every week for an hour.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.436
Is there more you need to talk about?

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.617
- Circle happens in single-gender groups

00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:05.867
of about 20 or so students

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.282
led by their mentor teacher.

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:09.631
- That's really impressive.

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.042
Circle is done in a structured manner.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:13.980
It's very different than
the classroom experience

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.870
that they have at other
points during the day,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.490
kind of invites them to be exploring

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399
and learning in a different way.

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.330
Every circle will follow
the same basic cadence.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.163
- All right.

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:26.708
We're gonna start by doing our True North.

00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:29.659
- It'll always start with what
we call True North Practice.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.319
- Start by taking one
silent, deep breath in,

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.755
and then slowly letting it out.

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:37.064
- It's a mindfulness-based practice

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:40.313
for everybody in the circle
to let go of the busy day

00:01:40.313 --> 00:01:42.589
and really focus their
attention on each other.

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:45.105
- We are going to do a weather check-in.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.865
Who would like to start us off?

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:48.756
- And then it moves into a check-in.

00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:52.447
- Today, I'm feeling
foggy because I'm sleepy.

00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:54.727
- Everybody has to check
in, even if it's minimal.

00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:56.745
- I feel sunny because it's Friday.

00:01:56.745 --> 00:01:58.196
- Being able to name their emotions,

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:00.775
I think it humanizes everybody involved.

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:03.255
It really helps us see each other

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.761
as people who have feelings.

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:07.855
- And then we move into what we call work.

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:10.938
- Outside of the classroom and not...

00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:15.969
- I was a little bit frustrated.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.147
- So this is the biggest step

00:02:17.147 --> 00:02:18.387
of the whole relationship work.

00:02:18.387 --> 00:02:21.089
You need to let Jerron
know that you understand

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:23.019
why he felt frustrated, okay?

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.300
Communities need to work together

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.470
in order to solve problems, and so

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.122
people have the opportunity
to bring work into circle.

00:02:30.122 --> 00:02:32.975
- Examples of work are relationship work

00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:35.469
with your peers or with your teacher.

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.786
We might have people take responsibility

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:40.571
for something that had an
impact on our community.

00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:44.479
We also do activities like
sharing your life story,

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.149
reflecting on your values.

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.240
- Sawyer, are you ready
to do your presentation?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.965
- The topic I investigated was religion.

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:54.256
- Scholars really push themselves

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:57.435
and put a lot of effort
and thought into the work.

00:02:57.435 --> 00:02:59.155
You see them starting to become

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:02.611
more thoughtful about
themselves, more self-aware.

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:05.668
- This experience helped me
learn that I can be kinder

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:08.836
to people with different perspectives.

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:10.988
- Then we always end with appreciations.

00:03:10.988 --> 00:03:12.758
- You always make me laugh.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.739
- You always kept trying to get better.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.625
- It's a way for the
community to appreciate

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.727
the positive impacts
we have on each other.

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:21.276
- I like to appreciate you for talking

00:03:21.276 --> 00:03:22.985
to me over spring break.

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:24.455
It's like a mini family.

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:26.641
It's a place where you know you're safe.

00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:29.641
I don't talk about my feelings much,

00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:31.980
but in circle, I can

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.647
because I know I can trust them.

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.546
- I think having the adults
do the practice themselves

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:43.793
and really know the importance
of it is our main strategy.

00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:47.811
- In through your nose,
and out through your mouth.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.793
Allow your breath to anchor you.

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:54.654
- Adults drive this type
of work in the community.

00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:56.758
- Steven, would you mind kicking assess?

00:03:56.758 --> 00:03:58.851
- There's some work
that I've done with kids

00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:02.251
in this past week that I
need to bring to circle.

00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:03.851
In circle today, I did a process called

00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:07.178
taking responsibility, which is used for

00:04:07.178 --> 00:04:10.904
repairing a relationship with
the community as a whole.

00:04:10.904 --> 00:04:13.835
You step into the circle and you own

00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:15.416
whatever action you took.

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.498
I recognize that my mistake put you

00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:20.116
in a really uncomfortable position.

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:24.007
I have been at schools
where if something were done

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:27.234
and not talked about, it kinda festered.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:31.240
Here, you positively work
to rebuild the relationship.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.040
Moving forward, I commit to using

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.685
the systems that are in place

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:38.475
and thinking before I act in such a way.

00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:40.208
I ask kids to do it every day,

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:42.064
and I think that's why Valor works

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:44.013
is because everything
the kids are asked to do,

00:04:44.013 --> 00:04:47.280
the adults are expected to do as well.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.115
- It helps a lot because they also know

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:50.061
what we're going through.

00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:52.544
Other schools can say, "You
don't understand your teachers,"

00:04:52.544 --> 00:04:55.926
but we can't say that because
they do the same thing as us,

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:57.562
and they know what we're going through.

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:59.383
- Circle is a space that's safe enough

00:04:59.383 --> 00:05:01.434
that we can share and
it can be vulnerable.

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.914
It also builds relationships
that help us become

00:05:03.914 --> 00:05:08.202
better teachers, help them
become better learners.

00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:09.853
- You guys did a really good job.

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:12.436
Appreciate yourselves for that.
