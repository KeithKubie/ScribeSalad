00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.490
The relationship
between scholarship

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.100
and the political world
seems to me an essential one

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.220
because so much of what
scholarly inquiry involves is

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.810
understanding ourselves
and our place in the world

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.230
and the foundations for
advancing human goals

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.230
within that world, and so
to be able to share some

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.380
of the details of that,
the approaches to that,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.700
the changing understanding
of that, whether it's

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.450
in of course the natural
sciences where we see it

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.450
so directly, but also
in the human sciences

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.970
where policy matters
are gonna turn out much

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.910
to be much more effective if
they're rooted in real research

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.260
and deep understanding.
