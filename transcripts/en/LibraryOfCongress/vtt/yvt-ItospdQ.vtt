&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich: Okay, folks,
we'll go ahead and get started.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.240
Please take your seats.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.540
Before we start I
want to do a shout

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.080
out for our ASL interpreters
over here

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.510
who do a wonderful
job every year.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.840
Okay we're back and
running here.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.570
So I just want to briefly
introduce you to Sydney Trent.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.200
She's the social issues editor
over at the Washington Post.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.870
The Washington Post
has been a good friend

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.070
of this Book Festival I think
right from the start so.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.130
[ Applause ]

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.900
And I'll tell you I live

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.240
in North Carolina I
pay a subscription to,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.540
that's my paper.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.510
So, anyway, Sydney, welcome.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.090
[ Applause ]

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.430
&gt;&gt; Sydney Trent: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.230
I am Sydney Trent, and
I'm social issues editor

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.170
at the Washington Post,
which is a charter sponsor

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.680
of the National Book Festival.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.070
First a word of thanks to the
cochairmen of the festival,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.490
David Rubenstein, and the
other generous sponsors

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.790
who have made this
event possible.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.600
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.220
please note the information
in your program.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.100
We'll have some time after this
presentation for your questions,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.660
and I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.950
to the microphone you will
be included in the videotape

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.910
of this event, which may be
broadcast at a later date.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.100
I was particularly
excited to be asked

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.510
to introduce this
author, Tayari Jones.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.210
[ Applause ]

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.380
I read her book, An American
Marriage, recently as part

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.750
of my book club and was struck
by what an inspired idea it was

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.290
to focus on the emotional impact

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.830
of black male incarceration
in a work of fiction.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.710
We are all familiar with
this as a topic in the news,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.420
but Jones's perceptive

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.090
and compassionate narrative
voice reveals the full

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.660
dimensions of the damage
that unjust incarceration has

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.060
on African-American couples,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.930
their families and
the human spirit.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.790
Jones is the author of novels,
Leaving Atlanta, the Untelling,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.130
Silver Sparrow and
An American Marriage.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.050
Her writing has appeared
in Tin House, The Believer,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.390
the New York Times and Callalo.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.300
A member of the Fellowship
of Southern Writers,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.660
she has also been a recipient of
the Hurst-Wright Legacy Award,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.110
from the Congressional
Black Caucus Foundation,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.350
the United States Artist
Fellowship, NEA Fellowship

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.560
and Radcliffe Institute
Bunting Fellowship.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.250
Silver Sparrow was added

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.510
to the NEA Big Read
Library of Classics in 2016.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.460
Jones is a graduate of Spelman
College, University of Iowa

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.330
and Arizona State University.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.490
She is a professor of creative
writing at Emory University

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.510
and now I introduce
Tayari Jones.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:43.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.340
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones:
Thank you so much

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.830
for that generous introduction
and for the invitation

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.320
to be here today and thank you
to all of you for believing

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.790
in literature and books.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.000
This is a holiday weekend.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.770
Ya'll could be doing
other things.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.540
So, on behalf of everyone
who's ever written a book,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.290
everyone's ever wanted to read
a book, who has ever wanted

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.810
to write a book,
thank you for choosing

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.220
to spend your weekend this way.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.060
It means so much because
when you write a novel

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.260
in some ways you
feel like you're

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.070
like you're sending
a letter in a bottle.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.190
You spent all this time writing
on it and you throw it out there

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.620
and you don't know if
it'll ever reach anyone.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.720
And so for all of you to show up
today not just for this session

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.810
but for all the sessions
I just want to thank you

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.510
on behalf of all of us.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.220
[ Applause ]

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.450
I came to the National
Book Festival

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.390
for the first time seven
years ago with my last book,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.910
and I was there as a guest of
the NEA, the National Endowment

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.710
for the Arts, and I want
to just take a moment

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.910
to tell you all how much
these national programs mean

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.310
to writers who are
just starting out.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.480
The NEA nurtures talent back

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.990
like when I wrote my
first three books,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.630
basically nobody read them
but my mother and the NEA.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.660
[Laughter] And I was given
a grant which allowed me

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.190
to take some time off and
work on my book and then

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.600
when the book was out the
NEA selected me to come

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.900
to the National Book Festival,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.520
and that was the first time
I had ever spoken to a room

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.220
with more than say 50 people
in it and it meant a lot to me

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.430
as a writer and also as an
American citizen to be supported

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.400
like that as an artist
by the government.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.930
And the NEA as you know
is in a position now

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.410
where it's fighting
for its life.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.630
So should you ever find
yourself in the company

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.410
of your Congress person
or anybody with any clout

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.420
or even anybody without clout
tell them how much the NEA means

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.220
to all of us.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:58.050
[ Applause ]

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.520
When we were invited
here they said, you know,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.690
you talk about your book
and you talk about yourself

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.420
and I was thinking should I talk
about my books or should I talk

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.140
about myself, but I realized

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.630
on some level they're
the same thing.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.690
And like I said I was
here seven years ago

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.820
and when I was here seven years
ago the world was very different

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.060
than it is now and I was
very, my life is different.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.750
So I was thinking, well, who am
I now versus seven years ago?

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.020
When I came here seven years
ago, my message really was

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.890
to tell everyone out there who
has a dream, who has a passion,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.590
to follow it, that if you do
your part to follow your dreams

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.940
and your passion then
the universe, God,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.210
however you do it
will meet you halfway

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.380
because my life has been full of
stories of times when it looked

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.930
like I would not be a writer.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.680
There are times it looked
like I wouldn't continue

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.860
to be a writer, but
I gave it my all.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.900
I started writing when I was a
kid, I was like 16 years old,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.560
and I knew that I
liked to write.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.190
I had little notebooks
and everything,

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.610
but when I was a teenager, if
you were a girl and you liked

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.170
to read and you liked to write,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.030
people didn't think it
meant you were a writer

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.170
or an intellectual, people
thought it meant you were nice.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.570
Because when I was coming
up if you're a girl,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.180
you were either a nice
girl or a not nice girl

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.840
and that was the only
question and if you liked

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.980
to read all the time,
then you were nice.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.210
I used to say because
no one ever got pregnant

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.970
in the library, but librarians
always raise their hand

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.270
and say that's not true.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.090
[Laughter] So I'll say that
a few people get pregnant

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.800
in the library, But when
I went to college I went

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.850
to Spelman College which is
a women's college in Atlanta

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.200
and it was there that I met a
writer and she was my teacher.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.850
Her name was Pearl Kleg,

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.690
and I took her class
freshman were not allowed

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.250
to take this class, but I had
never met a writer before,

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.900
and I wanted to be in the
class and I thought it over

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.200
and things were not
computerized in the late 80s

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.650
so there was a lot
more wiggle room

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.260
in creating your own narrative
shall we say and you had

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.790
to get your advisor to
sign to give you permission

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.580
to take a class that
was above your level.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.140
And I figured my
advisor had a lot

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.430
of advisees she wouldn't
remember me so what

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.540
if I just kind of were to
sign her name a little bit

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.860
to get into this class?

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.240
So I did this and I signed
up and I got into this class

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.510
and the advisor called
me in and, you know,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.670
she said this is not
my signature and I was

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.900
like yes ma'am, I'm
sorry, but she said to me

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.430
that if a kid wants to take
a class, like if you're,

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:41.500
if the kid is doing
basically fraud but in order

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.750
to take a class, let
her take that class.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.910
So I promised never
to commit fraud again

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:54.950
and to this day I have not but I
took the class and the teacher,

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.750
Pearl Kleg, said to me what
are you thinking about?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.210
And I got ready to tell her
what I was thinking about.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.970
She says no don't tell
me, write it down.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:09.400
And in that she became my first
audience and so I worked hard

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.670
because I wanted to write
down what I was thinking,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.830
and I wanted to follow the
example she set for me,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.810
and I wanted to be a writer,
but I didn't know how to go

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.160
from being a college
student to being a writer.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.650
When I finished school, I didn't
even know there was a such thing

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.620
as a graduate program
in creative writing.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.880
I thought writers just were, and
I didn't know what I was going

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.650
to do with my life and
everyone was pushing me

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.540
to do a PhD in literature.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.430
Everyone said, oh, you can
be a professor, you can write

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.880
on the weekends, right?

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.180
Don't worry about it.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.460
And I didn't want to do it
because I felt like I was a bird

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.240
and they wanted me to
become a birdwatcher

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.390
but I was also very
young so I went

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.550
to do this PhD and
I didn't like it.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.070
I felt I was like I was, I
felt like I was my face pressed

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.080
to the glass of what
I really wanted to do.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.450
And so I wrote to Pearl and told
her I'm so unhappy, you know,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.930
I don't want to be here and
she said to me well just quit.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.730
And I was like I can't
quite, you know, I was raised

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.930
like probably many of you, you
have to finish what you start,

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.520
and I felt that being there
I was representing myself,

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.020
I was representing my family,
I was represented my college,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.910
I felt like I was representing
black people everywhere and that

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.450
if I were to leave then anyone
who had anything in common

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.510
with me would never have the
opportunity to go to school

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.510
to get a PhD there but Pearl
said that's not how it works.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.810
I was like really?

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.750
She's like, no, people
quit things all the time.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.050
I said are you sure?

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.630
She said, oh, yeah, so I just
wrote the people a letter.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.090
I didn't say I quit.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.470
I said a lot of things, thank
you for this opportunity,

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:49.400
et cetera, et cetera,
then I said I quit,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.040
and I started trying
to write a novel.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.950
I wanted to write a novel
about my experiences growing

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.180
up in Atlanta during the
Atlanta child murders.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.980
When I was a kid, 28 black
children were murdered

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.720
in Atlanta and two
of them were children

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.320
in my elementary school.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.850
I wanted to write a novel
not about the murders.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.910
I didn't want to turn my
childhood into an episode of Law

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.340
and Order, or true
crime or thriller,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.540
I wanted to write what
it was like to be a child

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.880
in the early 80s and this was
happening because someone said

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.250
to me, oh, you must not have had
a childhood and my feeling was,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.660
you know, we did
have a childhood.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.380
Our childhood intersected
with this tragedy,

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.520
but our lives were not a tragedy
and that became my mission

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.300
in writing this book and so I
didn't know how to go about it,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.240
but I started it and
this is what I'm saying

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.780
about when you dedicate yourself

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.820
to something with
all your hear,.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.030
I literally ran into a writer

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.300
who directed our creative
writing program and she's here.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.760
She's at a different stage.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.760
I think we're speaking
simultaneously.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.680
Her name is Jewell Parker Rhodes
and I met her and she said come

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.140
to Arizona and work with me.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.420
She said I'll help you,
I'll be your mentor.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.470
And I said oh no, ma'am,
I can't move to Arizona.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.770
I said it' hot out there.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.550
[Laughter] And this
was in the early 90.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.240
Do you remember when they didn't
have the King holiday out there?

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.870
And I said they don't
have the King holiday

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.450
and she said it's only hot

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.490
in the summertime there
has been a voter referendum

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.350
and I will have you
a King holiday

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.650
by the time you get there.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:27.090
[Laughter] So I felt like it was
my own personal King holiday.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.170
So I told my, I was in my 20s
I told my parents I'm moving

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.470
to Arizona.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.900
They're like you
can't move to Arizona.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.010
You don't know anyone out
there, it's hot out there

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.660
and besides they don't
have the King holiday.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:45.680
And I said actually there's been
a voter referendum and so I went

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.860
out there and I wrote
my first book,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.490
and I felt really good about,
I felt that I had done my,

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.870
I was doing my life's work.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.190
You know I probably, I
didn't sell very many copies,

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.270
I didn't earn out my advanced,
no one had ever heard of me

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.310
that wasn't related to
me, but I felt like I had,

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.300
I was doing what
I was meant to do,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.120
but life is full of challenges.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.780
When I wrote my third
book, I turned it in

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.360
and they had computers.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.400
Remember I said there weren't
computers in the beginning?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.680
There are computers now
and the computers have,

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.980
there's a computer program.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.710
Those of you who are in
the business will know it

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.530
but is called BookScan.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.040
BookScan means they can put
your name in the computer

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.020
and see exactly how
many books you've sold.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.320
You used to could fake it.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.570
You could act successful

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.620
and people would think
you were successful,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.530
but now there's this
computer program that says

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.390
like don't believe the hype
and it gives an exact number

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.870
of how many books you have sold.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.340
So for my second book, my third
book, I couldn't get a contract

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.550
because of my BookScan,
and I felt really defeated

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.850
by this computer program.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:53.320
You know it was so exact and
so declarative, not profitable.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.970
So I didn't want to
continue writing the book

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.490
but the book was
important to me.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.880
It was a book I had written

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.000
about my relationship
with my sister.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.360
I have a sister, we
weren't raised together,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.980
we lived completely different
lives, but all my life I felt

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.100
like I both had a sister
and didn't have a sister.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.860
Like I had a sister
who was right there

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.290
in my peripheral vision,
but when I turned my head,

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.590
there was no one there.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.570
And I wanted to write this novel
for everyone who has siblings

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.440
that you didn't grow up with but
you feel connected with them,

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.650
but you don't know
how to bridge the gap.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.250
So I knew I had to finish
writing this book even though I

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.110
had been all but promised that
I would never have a publisher

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.970
for it because of this BookScan.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.060
Well, I wrote the book,
I started writing it,

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.340
and then I got a mysterious
phone call and it was,

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.640
the area code was from LA.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.020
I have one friend in
LA he's very successful

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.280
and when things don't
go 100% right for him,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.380
he calls me to complain.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.320
At this point in my life things
were going 98% wrong for me,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.690
and I did not want
to hear him talk

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.080
about his slight disappointment,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.140
but I thought okay that's
not being a good friend

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.780
so I answered the
phone and the person

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.350
on the phone said
they were calling me

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.930
from an arts organization called
United States Artist Foundation.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.830
I thought they were
telemarketing me,

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.420
and I felt like this was not
a good time for me to be asked

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.770
to give money to other people
because I have no money,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.410
And they said no, no, no,
We're calling to support you

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.040
as a writer, we would
like to give you money

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.280
to spend a year to
work on your book.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.960
And being honest I said well,
I told about the BookScan.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.280
I said I don't think I'll
be able to publish this book

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.110
and they said we don't care
about BookScan, we don't care

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:36.510
about numbers, we care about
art and artists' stories.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.040
[ Applause ]

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.650
So I took that year off,
I finished the book,

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.100
and I put the book in a drawer

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.740
because I just didn't know
how I could publish it,

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.340
but I knew I had done my part.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.770
I feel like when you're given
a gift all God asks of you is

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.810
that you use that gift,
the rest that's his job

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.110
for me just finish the book.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.500
So I finished the book
and I put it in a drawer.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.890
I had one activity left
on my schedule as a writer

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.620
and I had been invited
to a literary seminar

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.890
to give a reading, and
I didn't want to go

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.540
but I had already said yes and,
you know, again always felt

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.940
like I was representing
everybody

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.620
and if I didn't go ruin it,
you know, that same story.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.920
I feel like that story,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.820
that idea of thinking
is probably going

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.120
to follow me the
rest of my life.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.390
This feeling of letting
down the entire race

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.690
if you don't show up.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.310
So I went to the thing
in Florida but the day,

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.730
like a week before the
Florida people called me

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.300
and said we can't get
your existing books

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.130
because your books
are out of print.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.430
Now when your books
are out of print

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.730
that means they're not
printing them anymore

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.290
like it never happened, and I
was like that's impossible but,

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.950
no, it was possible
because of the what?

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.340
BookScan. So but I went to
Florida and I was embarrassed

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.830
because I felt that I
would give a reading

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.130
and I wouldn't have any books
to sign and people would say

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.740
where are you books
and I would have

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.330
to say my books are
out of print.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.500
Because of BookScan I
can't get a book contract,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.580
but I went anyway
and when I got there,

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.350
the bookseller had 4 copies
of my books, 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:05.690
and I said where
did you get those?

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.820
And he said, oh, they
came in this book

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.450
and they showed me the box

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.830
and I recognized my father's
very distinct handwriting.

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:16.410
And I called him and I
said, daddy, he said,

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.840
yeah, I sent my books.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.270
He said and I went
to your uncle's house

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.570
and I got his books.

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.020
He said, he said those books
were unread, they're brand new,

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.320
your uncle hadn't
even looked at them.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.760
[Laughter] And so and daddy
said so this is what you'll do.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.980
You sign those 4 books
and when anyone else comes

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.300
up to your signing table you
just tell them you sold out.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.870
[Laughter] So I read from my
work in progress and I sat

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.290
down at the signing table
and I signed the 4 books

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.330
and then a woman came up to me
and she wanted a book signed,

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.380
and I said oh, I'm
so sorry I sold out,

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.470
and she said oh that's good
because I heard that, you know,

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.310
you're having a hard time
with your BookScan and I heard

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.020
that your books are out
of print, and I was dying

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.350
because I had gone through
all this trouble to pretend

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.370
like this wasn't happening,

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.620
but the woman said I
think I can help you.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.910
Now, if you're a writer you know
there are all kinds of people

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.680
who think they can help
you, they have all kinds

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.200
of crazy schemes, their uncle
might have a printing press

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.440
in the basement you
just don't know,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.270
but she said I can help you
and she took me by the hand

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.050
and she carried me
through the crowd

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.570
and she literally put my hand
in the hand of another woman,

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.990
whom I recognized as a
publisher and I recognized her

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.020
because they had
already rejected my book

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.320
because of what?

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.260
BookScan. I hate BookScan
so much, but anyway

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.480
and the woman asked me she
said what is your book about?

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.180
I said it's about 2 girls
they have the same father,

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.900
but only one of them knows.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.200
She said that's interesting.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.590
You should send it to me, but I
was embarrassed because I knew

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.720
that the company had already
rejected me and I was trying

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.050
to get away but that lady
she had my hand like this.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.930
And finally as I got away she
said wait before you go she

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.590
said, you know, how
do you know Judy?

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:06.530
And I said, oh, I don't
know anyone named Judy.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:13.320
And she says, no, no, no, Judy
Bloom who just introduced us.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:19.110
It was as though my nerdy
childhood had come to rescue me

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:24.010
in my time of need, and I
looked to tell her thank you

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.810
and she had vanished like
a real fairy godmother.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:33.300
And y'all within a week my
career was back on track.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.590
[ Applause ]

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.110
I love to say it's a true story,

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.780
and that book was
called Silver Sparrow

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.450
and my publisher was back, I
had a publisher things were back

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.880
and that's the book that got me

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.190
to the festival the last time I
was here, and I felt really good

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.060
about it, but again this life

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.010
as an artist it keeps
challenging you to grow

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.420
and do something different.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.470
So when it came time to write my
fourth novel, I had a publisher,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.770
I didn't have to
worry about that,

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:06.150
my BookScan was fine thank
you very much, but I wanted

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.340
to write a novel about something
bigger than my own life.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.610
I wanted to write something
about, something meaningful.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.350
Like all of you I noticed that
the world seems to be on fire,

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:22.360
and I felt that as a writer part
of my job is, all of our job is

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.780
to try to put out the
flames with whatever we have

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.370
and what I have is my pen and
so I wanted to write a novel

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.490
to do something about
wrongful incarceration

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.660
and so I wrote a grant and I was
accepted to Harvard University

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.200
to do research on the topic.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.500
And I did all this research
I discovered terrible things

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.710
like did you know that
at any given moment

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.230
over 2.5 million
people are in prison?

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:52.180
Over 4 million people are
on parole or on probation.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.730
Here in Washington, D.C.,
1 out of 4 black men will

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.500
at some time be in
jail or in prison.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:04.690
One out of 28 American children
have a parent who is in prison.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.980
Every time anyone is in
prison, it represents a kind

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.560
of family separation because
we are all members of a family,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.200
and I wanted to write
something about this,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.690
but I had these statistics,
but I didn't have a story.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.280
A problem is not a story,
a situation is not a story,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.950
and I didn't know what to do.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.470
So here I am at Harvard they
want us to give a presentation

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.740
on our work and all
I have to show

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.090
for my time there is a very
underlined, battered copy

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:38.490
of the new Jim Crow, a whole
stack of angry index cards

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:42.080
but no story, and I
didn't know what to do.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.320
I went home to Atlanta where
I'm from to spend some time

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.600
with my mother, which
I do when I'm upset,

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.980
and while I was there I
spent some time at the mall,

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.280
which I do when I'm upset.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:58.050
[Laughter] And when I was at the
mall I heard a couple arguing.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.360
The woman was fantastically
dressed.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.630
She looked just gorgeous and the
guy she was with he looked fine,

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.650
he looked okay, but she
looked great, and I could tell

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.750
that they were in
love and in trouble,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:14.740
and I heard her say clear
as a bell she said, Roy,

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.690
you know you wouldn't have
waited on me for seven years.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.990
And I was interested.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.420
I didn't know him, I didn't
know her, but I was looking

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.800
and I felt like you're
right, girl,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.080
he probably would not have
waited on you for seven years,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.480
and he looked at her and he said
I don't know what you're talking

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.850
about because this
wouldn't have happened

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.220
to you in the first place.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.610
And I looked at her and
I thought, you're right,

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.340
this probably wouldn't
have happened to her.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.530
[Laughter] And for me I know I
have a novel when I'm writing

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:50.030
from a place where both
people are telling the truth,

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.650
both people are right
and both people are wrong

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.770
because when I do that,
I have a moral quandary.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.170
So, An American Marriage is
a story of a young couple

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.130
who are only married 18 months
when the husband is arrested

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.090
for a crime he does not commit.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.800
As she says, I don't
know if I was yet a wife

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.740
or if I was still
a bride, you know,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.030
she said I was still combing
the rice out of my hair.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.460
Her daddy is still paying for
the wedding when he is arrested

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.910
and given a lengthy sentence.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.060
And then the question
is this what is loyalty?

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.140
How do we take care of one
another in times of crisis?

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.890
The question of what is selfish?

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.820
Is it more selfish if she
wants to live her own life

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.520
or is it more selfish for him

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.780
to not want her to
live her own life?

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.990
How do we make compromises?

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.530
And so I started
writing this novel.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.060
When I first started writing it,
I wrote it all from the point

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.870
of view of the wife, Celestial,
because I'm a southern writer

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.520
and southern novels
are all about women

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.950
who don't do what they're told.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.380
And I wrote it but it didn't
feel like the whole truth.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.230
So then I wrote the whole novel
a second time all from his point

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.370
of view, the man who has been
stripped of everything he worked

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.690
for and put into
prison and has to figure

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.120
out how to find his way back.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.450
And when I wrote that,
it still, it was easy,

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.740
but it didn't feel right because
I realized it was a story I

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.940
heard so many times before.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.540
I realized that it
essentially was the same story

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.130
as the Odyssey that I read
in high school, right?

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.290
Like Odysseys he just is
facing all these trials

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.590
and he just wants to come home

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.580
to a faithful woman
and a clean house.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.120
And that was written
in 70 BC, right?

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.260
So I was like what is
the update of that story?

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.050
And then I decided I heard
Claudia Rankin read from a poem

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:49.090
from her collection, Citizen,
and I used it as the epigraph

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.120
of this book and it says what
happens to you doesn't belong

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:59.990
to you only half concerns you
it's not yours, not yours only.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.960
And I realized that this
story was not his story

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.250
or her story it was their story,
and I toggled their points

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.530
of view, but it still
didn't feel complete

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.240
because I don't think
it's a spoiler to say this

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.280
but An American Marriage
is a story about justice,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.750
it's a love story and
it's also a love triangle.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.150
And so I added the
voice of another man

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.930
and when I had all three
of their voices I felt

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.670
like I had the whole
story of what happens

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.560
when people are forced to make
decisions they shouldn't have

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.160
to make in the first place.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.590
I thought I would end my talk
by reading to you just a couple

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.570
of pages from the first chapter

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.670
and then I thought we
could take some questions.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:48.720
I have to put on my
glasses because lately

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.620
like when I turned 40 all the
words in books became so small.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.520
Write to your Congressman
about that.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.430
[Laughter] This is from the
point of view of Celestial

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.420
on the day of Roy's trial.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.000
"What I know is this
they didn't believe me.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.420
Twelve people and not one
of them took me at my word.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.810
There in the front of
the room I explained

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.400
that Roy couldn't have
raped the woman in Room 206

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.240
because we had been together.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.940
I told them about the magic
fingers that wouldn't work,

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.870
about the movie that played
on the snowy television.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.860
The prosecutor asked me what
we had been fighting about.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.650
Rattled I looked to Roy
and to both our mothers.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.220
[Inaudible] subjective so
I didn't have to answer,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.130
but the pause made it appear

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.900
that I was concealing
something rotten at the pit

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.100
of our very young marriage.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.630
Even before I stepped down
from the witness stand,

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.740
I knew that I had failed him.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.680
Maybe I wasn't appealing
enough, not dramatic enough

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.190
to not from around here.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.490
Who knows.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.020
Uncle Banks coaching me had
said now is not the time

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.960
to be articulate, now was the
time to give it up, no filter,

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.910
all heart no matter what you're
asked, what you want the jury

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.290
to see is why you married him.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.420
I tried, but I didn't know
how to be anything other

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.840
than well spoken in
front of strangers.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.400
I wish I could have
brought a selection

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.610
of my art work all
images of Roy.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.450
I would then say this
is who he is to me.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.750
Isn't he beautiful?

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.390
Isn't he gentle?

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.500
But all I had were words, which
are light and flimsy as air.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.000
As I took my seat, not even
the black lady juror would look

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.740
at me.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.340
Time turns out that I
watched too much television.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.090
I was expecting a scientist
to come and testify about DNA.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.780
I was waiting for a pair of
handsome detectives to burst

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.130
into the courtroom at the
last minute whispering

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.430
something urgent.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.050
Everyone would see that
this was a big mistake,

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.950
a major misunderstanding.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.920
We would all be shaken
but appeased.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.880
I fully believed that I
would leave the courtroom

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.820
with my husband beside me.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.520
Secure in our home we would
tell people how no black man is

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.620
really safe in America, but 12
years is what they gave him.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.190
We would be 43 years old
when he was released.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.100
Roy understood that 12
years was an eternity

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.900
because he sobbed right there
at the defendant's table,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.820
his knees gave way and
he fell into his chair.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:23.530
The judge paused and demanded
Roy bear this news on his feet.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.100
He stood again and cried
not like a baby but in a way

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.410
that only a grown man can cry
from the bottom of his feet

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.830
up through his torso and
finally through his mouth.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.790
When a man wails like that,

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.690
you know it's all the tears
he was never allowed to shed.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.050
As Roy howled, my fingers
kept worrying a rough patch

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.710
of skin beneath my skin.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.410
A souvenir of scar tissue.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.160
When they did what I remember
as kicking in the door,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.280
what everyone else remembers
as opening it with a key,

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.160
after the door was opened
however it was opened,

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.090
we were both pulled
from the bed.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.920
They dragged Roy
into the parking lot

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.530
and I followed lunging
for him wearing nothing

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:03.830
but a white slip.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:07.900
Someone pushed me to the ground
and my chin hit the pavement.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.000
My skip rode up showing
everything to everyone

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.310
and my tooth sank into the
soft skin of my bottom lip.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:20.020
Roy was on the asphalt beside me
barely beyond my grasp speaking

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.320
words that didn't reach my ears.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.160
I don't know how long
we lay there parallel

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.160
like burial plots,
husband, wife,

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.290
what God has brought together
let no man tear asunder."

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:36.090
Thank you.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:55.050
[ Applause ]

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.840
Now I'm happy to
take your questions.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.570
Don't be shy.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:05.770
I'm nice. Come on up.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.070
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.370
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: Hi.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.490
&gt;&gt; I really loved the book
you had about your sister

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:16.390
and I was wondering just having
written a lot very personal

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:21.820
stories to you how do
you feel about Celestial

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.300
and all the world you created
in An American Marriage?

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:31.270
Are they kind of your family
now in a sense or what's it

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:37.010
like to come up with
characters that aren't going

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.980
to be your own, your own life?

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.630
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: You know when
I was writing this at first

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.570
when I started writing I felt
I was so far away from my life,

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.300
you know, Celestial's
husband is arrested

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.450
for a crime he doesn't commit,
you know, I don't have a husband

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.230
at all let alone one
that's been arrested

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:57.170
for a crime he didn't
commit, but what I realized is

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:00.070
that the thing that made
this story moving for me

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.860
to write is the extent to which
her problems were the same

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.380
as their problems as
a couple are the same

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.300
as all couples it's
just that it's turned

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.810
up so much higher for them.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:14.780
Like the question at the heart
of her predicament is how much

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.500
of yourself do you devote
to your relationship

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.940
and how much do you hold
back for your own dreams?

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.400
I mean that's her question
it's just so much more intense

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.050
and that also made
it heartbreaking

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:32.270
because it really added a deeper
human dimension to the issue

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.140
when I think about questions
of mass incarceration

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:39.930
that they are just like us
because they are just like us

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.270
and the deprivation of their
rights is just the same

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.430
as the deprivation
of yours or mine.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:53.180
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you for
the gift of your books.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.480
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: Oh, thank you.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.850
&gt;&gt; And ask you whether
you might share

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.120
with us what you're
working on now.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.720
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: The question
is what is working on me?

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.280
[Laughter] I'm trying
to work on a new novel.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.580
I'm not sure of the angle.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.580
See my feeling is like if you
have a real life experience

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.300
that makes you think
there's a novel there,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.600
you don't quite know
the angle yet,

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.980
but I will tell you this
thing that happened to me

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.280
when I was a little girl

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.850
that I've been wondering
about ever since.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:24.080
When I was 12 years old, I went
to a wedding and we were sitting

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.790
out there in the
pews all dressed up

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.400
and the bride didn't come
down the aisle for 2 hours.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.910
And so we went in the
back me and my mom

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.210
and there was a bride,

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:36.140
she looked so pretty
but she was crying.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:40.940
She did not want to marry him
and she was, I mean her mother,

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.080
I mean everyone was there, the
reception, everything was set

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.310
and one of her bridesmaids
said I have an idea.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:52.440
How about you go through the
ceremony, walk down the aisle,

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.450
just don't file the papers.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.600
[Laughter] That way no one is
embarrassed, you don't have

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.830
to actually be married and
you get to keep the toaster.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.190
[Laughter] And I have
always wondered two things.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.570
Why didn't she want to marry him

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.930
and at what point did she
tell him she wasn't filing

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.230
the papers?

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:14.530
[Laughter] You see?

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.540
So I think that that's
at the center of a story,

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.450
there's something in there that
I want to tease out like what

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.530
but I don't know what, but
I'm in there somewhere.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.410
&gt;&gt; Hi, how are you?

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:30.710
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: Hello.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.010
&gt;&gt; I was wondering, well,
first of all I wanted

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.570
to say I love your book and
I've never had the experience

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.240
of having a parent
be incarcerated,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.180
but I can definitely relate
to the emotion of sort

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:45.250
of the separation and this idea
of, you know, sort of being

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:48.430
in a quandary like you
follow this relationship

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.530
or do you follow your own
dreams like you were saying?

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.410
But I also wanted to ask looking
at you kind of Celestial kind

00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:00.300
of reminds me of actually you
from an aesthetic perspective.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.550
[Laughter] And I was
just wondering, you know,

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.170
are there people in your life

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.440
that you model the character's
personality wise after

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.200
or like how do you
develop the characters

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.980
as people when you're writing?

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.630
&gt;&gt; Well, you're right she
does look like me doesn't she?

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.000
[Laughter] Well, also I have
been this tall since I was

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
about 13 years old so I
do try, when I was a kid

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.360
and being this tall, I never
read about a woman or a girl

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.070
that people desired
that were this tall.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.900
So I did kind of do
that as just a gesture

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.040
of love to my teenage self.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.340
[Laughter]

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.640
[ Applause ]

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.680
I mean I think we all, I think
we all have things that we just,

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.390
we wish we could go in a time
machine and give ourselves,

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:50.120
you know, a hug or just a
little heads up from the future

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.270
to say it's going to be fine,
it's going to be fine just hang

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:56.850
in there, but with other
characters I do sort of,

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.810
I have a friend who swears
up and down that I steal all

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.400
of his best lines and
put them in my books.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.460
I'm like I don't steal them,
you still have them, you know,

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.560
but I do try to capture the
way I think people really talk

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.760
because I think that something
that we can do in fiction

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.080
that our peers and like if I
was writing a non-fiction book

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.580
about wrongful incarceration,
I wouldn't be able

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:25.740
to capture the things about
the culture that will never be

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.810
in like a scholarly text,
the funny things people say,

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.800
what people do, little love
notes to people in my life

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.270
to let them know that I am
watching them and seeing them,

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.910
but I try not to stick
too closely to one person

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.350
because if I model a character
off of a person, then I start

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:45.400
to feel like if I let the
character do something else the

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.460
real life person will
feel like I'm lying

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.320
on them or judging them.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.880
So I try, whenever
it feels too close,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.910
I move in another direction.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.510
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: Thank you.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:02.390
&gt;&gt; So I would just like to say
thank you, you've graced me

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.180
with your presence today.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.170
I'm more than inspired because
I'm writing my first novel

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.620
and the title is His
Double Life, it's a story

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.420
about a small-town
hero who let's everyone

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.710
down in a love triangle
that he was in.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.710
So you mentioned a love
triangle it's like, oh, yeah,

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.010
I'm doing something like that.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.490
So what would be your advice

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.380
for me getting started
with a project?

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.200
I mean I've started it but
what can you give me to,

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.520
so that I have a good BookScan.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.820
[Laughter]

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.120
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: I
honestly can't help you

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.230
with the BookScan but,
and also I almost hate

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.990
that I told you about
the BookScan.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.890
&gt;&gt; I'm glad that you
did because I won't,

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.410
you know, be discouraged in se.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:48.430
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: But I feel like
the thing, the writing business

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.650
and the writing are
two different things,

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.310
and I really encourage people
who are just starting out not

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:55.200
to find out anything
about the business

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.380
because no one has ever
come from a lecture

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.110
about the business
and felt like, oh,

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.150
I feel inspired to write now.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.300
You always feel discouraged
by the business.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.830
So, the one thing I would
say, yeah, find out as little

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:11.200
as possible about how it works
until you have your book done

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.250
because I want you to write a
book that speaks to your heart

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.090
and find an editor or an agent

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:19.070
that can sell what
you've written.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.530
I don't want you trying to write
what they will sell, you see?

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.810
I want it to be all
about your unique vision.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.770
If I had known when I wrote my
first book, in my first book

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.510
about growing up in Atlanta
during the child murders,

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.460
all the characters are
like 8 year olds and half

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.580
of the book is written
in the second person,

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.680
if I had known anything
about the business,

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.570
I never would have written
such a quirky, eccentric novel

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.260
because someone would have
said that will never sell,

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.430
but part of the benefit
of my early writing was

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.840
that no one was paying
any attention to me.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.520
I never worried what
anyone would think,

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.070
I never thought anyone would
think anything so I didn't have

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.110
to be bold enough to put
the voices out of my head

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.600
because I felt like in many
ways I was this invisible person

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.240
doing something for my
own spirit, but if I had

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.410
to give you a concrete
piece of advice is this,

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.900
you know how people are always
saying writers write every day,

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.600
you have to write every day?

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.900
That is a myth.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.890
You do and ought have
to write every day.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.880
[Laughter] I feel that we tell
people that because we want you

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.870
to be consistent but I think
that what it accidently does is

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.650
that it sets a bar where
people who have busy lives,

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.390
people who work, people
who have children,

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.380
people who are doing elder care,
they feel they can't be writers

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.160
because they don't have enough
leisure time, and if we end

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.600
up with a canon of American
literature that's written only

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.380
by people with leisure time,

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.160
I feel like the most important
stories will be left out.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.510
The reason why most of
us can't write every day.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.560
[ Applause ]

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.970
We can't write everyday because
we're doing important work

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.120
and that's what needs
to be written about.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.230
So, I say see if you can
write 3 times a week.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.350
I feel, this is how I do it you
know how they tell you you go

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.010
to the gym 3 times a week?

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.310
When the rest of you
all are at the gym,

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.780
that's when I work on my books.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.080
[Laughter]

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.370
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you so
much for writing a book

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:13.820
that captured the human
complexity of emotions

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.410
and nothing is black or white

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:20.500
and if I ever get married I'm
going to adopt a [inaudible],

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.780
but my question is
in an alternate world

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.970
if Roy did not go to jail,
do you think Celestial

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.950
and Roy would have
made it anyways?

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.250
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: Maybe.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.540
I mean I feel that you never
know with any relationship

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.450
if it's going to work, right?

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.050
And also what does work mean?

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.430
I mean if you, because
you can look

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.980
at a relationship that's lasted
50 years but all that says is

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.140
that it has stood
the test of time

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.600
but that doesn't say
anything about the quality

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.030
of that relationship, right?

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:51.020
I mean sometimes relationships
end because they are healthy.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.090
Sometimes relationships endure
because they are not healthy.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.720
So I don't think the
question is whether

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.880
or not they would have made
it the question is whether

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.460
or not they would have
grown from the experience,

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.990
and I think that
they would have,

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.400
but I think it would
have been challenging.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.130
I think that relationships
are challenging,

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.660
but this is what I also think.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.510
Celestial and Roy are in a
situation they never have been

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:16.260
in and you know how,
and I think this is part

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.060
of the racial aspect
of it you know how

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.430
like if you're a black person
and people, when you're growing

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.090
up people tell you you have to
work twice as hard to get half

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.440
as much, you have
to be the best,

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.080
always have to be the best.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.060
I feel like in the context
of their relationship

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.560
with him being wrongfully
incarcerated for them

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.300
to have made it I mean they
would have to have been twice

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.940
as good, 3 times as
good as other couples

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.700
to maintain their marriage.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:43.780
Like what does it mean with that
idiom of you have to be so good

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.280
to even follow you into
your personal life.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.580
I feel like that is one

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.650
of the many injustices
visited upon this couple.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.490
[ Applause ]

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:58.950
&gt;&gt; Hi, I wish I was
as tall as you.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.250
[Laughter] I'm very fortunate.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.280
I've been able to get a book
[inaudible] a number of times

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:08.020
and the place I spend most of
my time is at Algonquin books

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.790
because I believe that the
books that are published

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:14.560
by Algonquin speak
to all aspects

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.510
of the life we should
all be learning about.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.480
So they showed me your
book before I came out

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.990
and said you must
read this book.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:26.750
And I wanted to ask
you how important it is

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:30.970
that your publisher have a
vision of where your work fits

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.100
into the world around you.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.750
How important that is to
making you a better writer

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:41.650
and you a confident,
successful writer.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.560
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: I do
think, I love my publisher.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.240
I'm published by Algonquin
books through Chapel Hill.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.760
I believe in independent
publishing

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.540
and they're an independent
publisher

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.410
and they have a small list.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.710
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.010
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: And every
book they publish is a book

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.310
they love.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.830
They don't publish books they
don't plan to put forward.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.160
It makes a big difference
to have an editor

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.730
that listens to the writer.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.170
I mean my editor understood.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.500
I was really worried with this
book that people would think

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.230
that because it has, that it
was a novel about prison, right?

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.190
That it would be filed
almost like sociology like,

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:17.950
almost like this was like
the new Jim Crow the musical.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.870
I was really afraid that
that's how it would be,

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:25.170
but my editor he read it and
he said this is a love story,

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:28.290
and I knew that he understood
what I was doing because I think

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:31.780
that when you reduce
people to their problems,

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.730
I was told when I was training

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.810
as a writer they say you
should write about people

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.810
and their problems not
problems and their people,

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:41.810
and I was really pleased to have
an editor who understood this is

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.660
about people and their problems

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.010
and it does make
all the difference

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.820
in the world how it's packaged,
how they wanted to look,

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.710
how they talk about
it to other people

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.770
but the most important
thing about being

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:56.400
with an independent publisher
this book was 4 years overdue.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.090
It was 4 years late.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.220
And they wanted the book,
but they didn't pressure me

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.460
and they didn't try to get me
to give them whatever they had

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.760
so they could rush it to market.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.170
Do you remember that,

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.360
do you remember those
commercials I think only people

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.740
of a certain age
remember that commercial

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.700
when the guy would say we
sell no wine before its time?

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.000
Remember that?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.320
That's how they are with books.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.210
They felt like the
book isn't ready,

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.540
it's like a cake you've got to
let the cake stay in the oven

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.840
as long as it needs to.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.990
They're never going to publish
a cake that is still wet

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.350
in the middle, and I feel they
did that for me in this book,

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.780
and I will always be
grateful for the gift of time.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.690
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, we
have time for one more question.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your book.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.820
My question actually dovetails
with your last answer.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.560
You mentioned the
new Jim Crow twice --

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.860
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones:
-- you can wait.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.160
I'll do more.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.460
Okay.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.760
&gt;&gt; Do you have, you mentioned
the new Jim Crow twice,

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.780
do you have other books that
were particularly impactful

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.390
or that you recommend either
fiction or non-fiction

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.410
that include like a
humane or a real personal

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.060
or lived experience
of incarceration?

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.550
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: You know the
thing that was most helpful

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.850
to me there's a book

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:04.280
from McSwiney's called Surviving
Justice and it is oral histories

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.900
of people who have been
wrongfully incarcerated

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.720
and the thing about it that
surprised me is that the people

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.290
who are wrongfully incarcerated
were more interested

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.390
in the reality of
incarceration for everyone.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:19.630
Like they didn't hold themselves
up as I'm innocent, therefore,

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.240
this shouldn't happen to me.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.630
They were more interested in the
way that prison affects everyone

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.660
like they didn't make a line
between wrongfully and imply

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.960
that there is, therefore,

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.220
a rightfully person
that's incarcerated

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.440
and that would be the book
that I recommend most,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.050
but there's also Upstate

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.640
by Kalisha Buchanan
that's really good.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.940
It's a [inaudible] novel.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.050
It's all letters between
a young, young people

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.440
and the boyfriend
is incarcerated.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.170
There's a lot, I'm
really excited

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:50.480
but you know then
there's the middle

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.960
of nowhere the feature film

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.940
by Ava DuVernay I
was really encouraged

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.870
by how many people are
talking about this issue

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.510
in different ways so
I never had to fear

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:03.330
that I wasn't writing
the definitive story.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:04.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:05.950
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: Yes, ma'am.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you for
writing this book.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.380
Our book club just recently
discussed it a couple

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:14.310
of days ago and it was probably
one of the most heartfelt,

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.850
impactful conversions
we've had in a long time.

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:23.030
We're a group of all white
women with one Latina, so we,

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:27.510
I think we grabbed, it grabbed
us deep down and one of the

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.420
like book club questions
that are

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:34.150
out there is how did you
envision Roy's accuser?

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:36.010
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: I knew we
were going to get there.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:37.310
I was thinking maybe
we weren't going

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:38.610
to get there, but we're here.

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:41.490
&gt;&gt; That was the one that I
asked and everyone in the room,

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.870
you know, envisioned her
white, and I did not,

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.600
I did not because I'm thinking
they're in a motel in the south

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.510
and I really didn't believe a
white woman would have talked

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:55.730
to him at that ice machine and
invited him back to their room

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:57.690
to help with whatever,
I can't even think

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.330
of what the issue was
he was helping her with.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:04.740
And that really led to a really
deep soul searching conversation

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.090
amongst us.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.390
So how did you envision her?

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.830
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones: You know this
thing I don't identify the race

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:16.360
of the woman who accused
Roy and I didn't do it,

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.810
I didn't identify her
for a couple of reasons.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:23.370
One is that I felt like
we could get derailed

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.840
from the rest of the story.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.100
It was so tricky with him being
a black man falsely accused

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.900
of rape that in reading the book
I didn't want to like relitigate

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.890
so much of American history
and not be able to get forward

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:40.080
to the rest of the story,
which was about their marriage.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.590
So I thought that I could
just like slide by that.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.630
[Laughter] And also there's
this Toni Morrison story called

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:51.770
Racitatif about 2 girls
who are in foster care

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.300
and they're having all of these
racial conflicts throughout

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.390
their lives and she never tells
you which one of them is black

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:59.600
and which one is
write, and I teach

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.270
and if you teach your students
will almost come to blows

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:04.230
over which one they
think is black and white.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.070
And so I thought would do
a little wink to Morrison

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.620
because I feel like every book
I've written I wink at her

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.510
in some way because I hope
one day she will notice me.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.330
[Laughter] And so I don't
really go into it, but you know

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.750
when it's going to
cause me a problem?

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.970
I'm going to have to step up to

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:24.510
that because we're
making a movie.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:29.170
[ Applause ]

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:32.740
And they have to, they
have to cast somebody.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.200
I was like can't we
just put her in shadow?

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.680
They're like no, no.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.820
So, I'm going to say the answer
to that question will be coming

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.120
to a theatre near you.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.420
[Laughter]

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:49.090
[ Applause ]

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.890
&gt;&gt; Tayari Jones:
Thank you very much.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:54.500
