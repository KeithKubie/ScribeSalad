00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.860
There are certain television shows that attract
such a rabid engaged audience that it is impossible

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.720
for viewers not develop theories and speculation
concerning the characters and plotlines.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.840
Sometimes a show only becomes more interesting
when reading between the lines and not simply

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.439
observing a show at face value.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.090
Here are 10 TV Fan Theories That Make Way
too Much Sense, If you enjoy our list, don’t

Rant channel.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.430
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Buffy the Vampire Slayer has ignited many

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.430
theories from loyal and dedicated fans of
the Joss Whedon series.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.540
One of the more depressing theories is the
why Buffy’s mom, Joyce developed a brain

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.290
tumor that ultimately killed her.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.430
In season five, Buffy gets a younger sister,
Dawn.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.050
This wasn’t a case of the series jumping
the shark with a random new sibling.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.840
Dawn was created by monks.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.330
She was not human but the key to other dimensions.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.980
The monks had to alter the memory of Buffy’s
friends and family to believe Dawn had been

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.500
there the entire time.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.590
What if this brain manipulation was too much
for Joyce and caused a tumor?

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.800
Buffy is a slayer and can take it, her friends
have less memories to stuff in their mind

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.860
but Joyce would have memories since Dawn’s
birth and being pregnant with her.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.610
Was it just too much for Joyce?

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.880
How I Met your Mother
For nine seasons, How I Met your Mother sparked

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.380
many conversations among fans trying to figure
out who exactly the mother could be.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.940
An exhaustively long tale told to his two
children included so many misleads that the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.610
identity of the mother became a true mystery.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.959
It is another fan theory that makes this list,
one in which Barney’s playbook is Ted’s

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:24.959
playbook.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.540
The playbook which showed a variety of over-the-top
ways to court a woman may seem like something

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.730
Barney would write.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.560
However, the version of Barney we see is told
by the unreliable narrator Ted and could just

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.329
be a way to avoid telling his kids that he
was the real womanizer.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.629
The playbook being adorned with calligraphy,
a skill Ted is proud to practice, makes it

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.310
even more likely that The Playbook is the
work of Ted, and not Barney.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.219
Rugrats
Rugrats holds a special place in the hearts

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.849
of many millennials as it was one of the first
Nickelodeon original animated series debuting

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.019
in 1991.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.109
The show which features the daily adventures
of a group of infant and toddlers may seem

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.200
harmless but the fan theory is downright morbid.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.280
The theory claims that Angelica is the only
real character and that everyone else is a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.980
figment of her imagination.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.780
Chuckie died along with his mother.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.150
The twins were aborted.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.719
Tommy was a stillborn.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.091
This explains why Tommy’s father is always
making toys frantically and Chuckie’s father

00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:22.549
is always so anxious.

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.410
The fathers can’t seem to accept what has
happened.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.360
It’s a dark take on a kid’s show that
isn’t completely impossible.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.360
The Simpsons
The Simpsons has been a mainstay on Fox since

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.360
1989 with no sign of slowing down or diminishing
in quality.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360
There are plenty of fan theories derived from
nearly three decades of material.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.360
One of theories is that the Simpson family
are geniuses, but one of the most fascinating

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.360
theories revolves around Homer being in a
coma since 1993.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.360
In the episode “So It’s Come to This:
A Simpsons Clip Show”, Homer falls into

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.360
a coma after being crushed by a vending machine.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360
Fans speculate that Homer never woke up from
his coma and that the episodes that followed

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.360
were all in his mind.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360
Before Homer became comatose, the episodes
were based in reality, whereas after the coma,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360
the episodes became outlandish and silly.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.360
This also explains why none of the characters
have aged in the last twenty-plus years.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360
Friends
For ten seasons fans watched six New Yorker

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.749
pals fall in love, break-up, have children,
divorce, all in an unrealistic world of affordable

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.260
Manhattan apartment.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.370
While Friends only occasionally delved into
the difficult times of adulthood, one fan

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.379
theory claims there was something serious
happening without much discussion, Ross losing

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.060
custody of his son, Ben.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.099
The theory stems from Ben practically disappearing
from Ross’s life after season 8.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.609
Ben does not appear for the remaining two
and a half seasons of the series.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.219
He is mentioned casually only a few times,
and Ben never meets his half-sister, Emma.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.079
When considering how insane Ross became in
the later seasons, it makes perfect sense

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.819
that Carol would seek out sole custody of
their son.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.519
Ross dated his student, hit on his cousin,
became weirdly possessive of Rachel, and judgmental

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:28.970
over most his friend's life decisions, and
lost his temper at work over a leftover sandwich.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.671
Breaking Bad
For five seasons, audiences watched science

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:36.350
high school teacher Walter White go from family
man to the biggest and most dangerous drug

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.510
dealer around.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.720
Breaking Bad itself is filled to the brim
with interlaced stories, character development

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.440
and recurring themes, but fans have speculated
that Breaking bad is also a sequel to Malcolm

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.120
in the Middle and a prequel to The Walking
Dead.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.590
While the Malcolm in the Middle connection
is more humorous than anything, The Walking

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.200
Dead connection holds a lot more weight.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.870
Fans have claimed that Heisenberg’s drugs
caused the zombie outbreak.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.550
In Season 2 of The Walking Dead, Daryl talks
about his brother scoring drugs that are suspiciously

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.580
similar to Heisenberg’s signature “Blue
Sky”.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.420
That along with the description of the dealer
sounding an awful lot like Jesse Pinkman makes

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.850
this fan theory likely.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.060
Firefly
Firefly is one of the most beloved brilliant

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.160
but cancelled television shows ever.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.200
The show which follows a gang of space cowboys,
only aired 11 episodes before being axed.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.280
The fan theory behind Firefly concerns the
real reason Firefly was cancelled.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.590
While the Fox network claimed poor ratings,
fans believe it was the government who wanted

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.840
the show removed.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.620
The series aired in 2002 when the Bush administration
was attempting to get everyone behind the

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.040
Iraq war, which made a show about intelligent
and resourceful outlaws who fought for civil

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.500
rights and peace to be a conflict of interest.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.240
The theory makes some sense considering how
enthusiastic the Firefly fan base is today,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.940
but this could be a case of viewers not realizing
a show’s brilliance until it was too late.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.030
Saved by the bell
The gang from Saved by the Bell seemed like

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.040
the coolest high school students ever.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.600
With their covetable 90s wardrobe, close friendships,
and a principal who seemed obsessed with them.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.080
It all seemed a bit too good to be true, which
is exactly why many fans speculated that it

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.330
was all in the mind of Zack Morris.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.890
For those who watched the show when it was
called Good Morning, Miss Bliss, you may remember

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.040
that Zack wasn’t cool, he was just an average
awkward kid going to junior high in Indiana.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.820
When the show was renamed, it was set in Malibu,
and Zack was suddenly a facsimile of Ferris

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.820
Bueller.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.960
Lisa, Screech and Mr. Belding also returned
but the gang was rounded out with Jessie,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.110
Kelly, and Slater, all of who were much cooler
than the friends he had in Indiana.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.400
The fan explanation makes a lot of sense especially
if you consider the wacky events that occurred

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.070
on the show to be in the mind of an Indiana
teen who wishes he had a much more interesting

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.400
life.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.200
The Office
In season six of The Office, Toby Flenderson,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.950
the sad sap of Human Resources is thrilled
to be on the jury of the Scranton Strangler.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.560
However, fans suspect that it was Toby who
was the real Scranton Strangler all along.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.720
The reason being that Toby’s life was going
nowhere and everyone treated him so poorly

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.370
that he finally snapped.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.591
It wasn’t until he returned to Pennsylvania
after having a go living in Costa Rica, when

00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:18.930
the Strangler appeared.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.250
In the ninth season Toby admits that he sent
the wrong man to prison and the man accused

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.700
of being the strangler attempts to strangle
Toby when he goes to visit.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:35.810
Was Toby’s guilt for imprisoning an innocent
man because he was the real Scranton Strangler?

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.320
The Walking Dead
Ever since The Walking Dead exploded on AMC

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.810
in 2010, there has been a fervent following
eliciting countless fan theories and speculations.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.000
One theory that never seems to die is that
Rick is immune to the zombie-causing disease

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.860
that has affected those around him.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.730
The origins for this theory comes from the
first episode in which Rick wakes up in a

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.370
hospital after being in a coma.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:01.210
When he was in a coma, his brain had limited
activity resulting in the disease not affecting

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.210
him.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.340
Why this makes him completely immune throughout
the show remains unclear.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.200
There is an additional theory that Rick has
been a zombie the entire time and his waking

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.700
from a coma was him waking from the dead.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.370
He is fortunate enough not to experience any
of the terrible symptoms associated with zombies

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.570
such as the need to eat human brains.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:25.110
While unlikely, the theory may be on to something.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.740
