bad and then obviously the animation

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440
bad and then obviously the animation
 

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.530
bad and then obviously the animation
style kind of is but I'm just like a lot

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:49.540
style kind of is but I'm just like a lot
 

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.910

of it to me is just the voice work

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:50.920
of it to me is just the voice work
 

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.940
of it to me is just the voice work
sounds so familiar if you've seen the

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:53.950
sounds so familiar if you've seen the
 

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.770
sounds so familiar if you've seen the
future I think that's why like the

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:55.780
future I think that's why like the
 

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.240
future I think that's why like the
character probably gets the most laughs

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.250
character probably gets the most laughs
 

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.760
character probably gets the most laughs
is the Lucy it character because there's

00:17:59.760 --> 00:17:59.770
is the Lucy it character because there's
 

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.070
is the Lucy it character because there's
nothing like that on that yeah that's

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080
nothing like that on that yeah that's
 

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.680
nothing like that on that yeah that's
just in the theory there actually is and

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:04.690
just in the theory there actually is and
 

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.240
just in the theory there actually is and
this is where I think the voice acting

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.250
this is where I think the voice acting
 

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.210
this is where I think the voice acting
is detrimental like I go well the king

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.220
is detrimental like I go well the king
 

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.940
is detrimental like I go well the king
it's bender and yet really the true

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:11.950
it's bender and yet really the true
 

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.950
it's bender and yet really the true
bender character is Lucy he's actually

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960
bender character is Lucy he's actually
 

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.560

new voice you can't like I didn't even
 

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.890
new voice you can't like I didn't even
think about it till like halfway through

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:19.900
think about it till like halfway through
 

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.420
think about it till like halfway through
I was like I I guess he is like an

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:21.430
I was like I I guess he is like an
 

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.950

enabling smoking drinking like he's
 

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.570
enabling smoking drinking like he's
really probably more the bender all the

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:24.580
really probably more the bender all the
 

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.730

so much with that and as soon as he gets
to the real world you know if he gets a

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.270
to the real world you know if he gets a
 

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.850
