eighth intelligence which I added some
 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.540

intelligences which I'm interested in
 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.110
intelligences which I'm interested in
one of them is called the teaching or

one of them is called the teaching or
 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.120
one of them is called the teaching or
pedagogical intelligence the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130
pedagogical intelligence the
 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.550
pedagogical intelligence the
intelligence which allows us to be able

to teach successfully to other people

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930
to teach successfully to other people
 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.630
to teach successfully to other people
now you could have two people who have

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640
now you could have two people who have
 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.580
now you could have two people who have
exactly the same expertise and knowledge

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590
exactly the same expertise and knowledge
 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.680
exactly the same expertise and knowledge
in a field but one is a very good

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690
in a field but one is a very good
 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.530
in a field but one is a very good
teacher and the other isn't that

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540

much but what got me fascinated was as

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250
much but what got me fascinated was as

how to teach now what does that mean you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520
how to teach now what does that mean you

how to teach now what does that mean you
show a child how to do something let's

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050
show a child how to do something let's
 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.110
show a child how to do something let's
say a three or four year old and then

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120
say a three or four year old and then
 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.720
say a three or four year old and then
you ask the child to explain it to an

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730
you ask the child to explain it to an
 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.670
you ask the child to explain it to an
older person or to a younger person and

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680
older person or to a younger person and
 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.920
older person or to a younger person and
even the three or four year old will

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930
even the three or four year old will
 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.870
even the three or four year old will
explain it very differently to a young

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880
explain it very differently to a young
 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.490
explain it very differently to a young
person we'll go through details and

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500
person we'll go through details and
 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.590
person we'll go through details and
point things and speak slowly and when

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600
point things and speak slowly and when
 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.970
point things and speak slowly and when
older person will be much more

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980
older person will be much more
 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.860
older person will be much more
elliptical and say well you you do this

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870
elliptical and say well you you do this
 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.240
elliptical and say well you you do this
and that and then you can figure it out

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250
and that and then you can figure it out
 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.540
and that and then you can figure it out
so that shows as young as 3 let's say we

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550
so that shows as young as 3 let's say we
 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.670
so that shows as young as 3 let's say we
already have a teaching intelligence the

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680
already have a teaching intelligence the
 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.800
already have a teaching intelligence the
other one is one which I think is going

other one is one which I think is going
 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.600
other one is one which I think is going
to be difficult to prove to a skeptic

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610
to be difficult to prove to a skeptic
 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.000
to be difficult to prove to a skeptic
but I call it existential intelligence

monopoly of a single intelligence which

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:04.099
monopoly of a single intelligence which
 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.360
monopoly of a single intelligence which
sort of labels you for all time I think

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370
sort of labels you for all time I think
 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.499
sort of labels you for all time I think
if we lived forever

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509
if we lived forever
 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.179
if we lived forever
we could probably develop each

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:10.189
we could probably develop each
 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:12.909
we could probably develop each
intelligence to a very high degree but

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919
intelligence to a very high degree but
 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.029
intelligence to a very high degree but
life's very short and if you devote too

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039
life's very short and if you devote too
 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:17.559
life's very short and if you devote too
much attention to one intelligence

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:17.569
much attention to one intelligence
 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:19.330
much attention to one intelligence
you're not going to have much time to

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340
you're not going to have much time to
 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.879
you're not going to have much time to
work on other kinds of intelligences and

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:21.889
work on other kinds of intelligences and
 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:27.610
work on other kinds of intelligences and
so the big question is should you play

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620
so the big question is should you play
 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.469
so the big question is should you play
to strength or should you bolster

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479
to strength or should you bolster
 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:32.020
to strength or should you bolster
weakness and that's a value judgment

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.030
weakness and that's a value judgment
 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.909
weakness and that's a value judgment
scientists cannot give you an answer to

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.290
that if for example you want to be a
jack-of-all-trades and be very well

jack-of-all-trades and be very well
rounded then probably you're going to

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580
rounded then probably you're going to
 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.850
rounded then probably you're going to
want to nurture the intelligences which

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:42.860
want to nurture the intelligences which
 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.830
want to nurture the intelligences which
aren't that strong if on the other hand

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840
aren't that strong if on the other hand
