sudden during this QA what would happen
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420
sudden during this QA what would happen
is that I'd start paying attention to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
is that I'd start paying attention to
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.940
is that I'd start paying attention to
the questions and the screen and what

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
the questions and the screen and what
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.190
the questions and the screen and what
I'm doing and I'd start paying attention

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200
I'm doing and I'd start paying attention
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.750
I'm doing and I'd start paying attention
to how I was feeling and to the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
to how I was feeling and to the
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459
to how I was feeling and to the
nervousness and then I'd start to get

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
nervousness and then I'd start to get
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.580
nervousness and then I'd start to get
aware that I was not responding properly

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
aware that I was not responding properly
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.410
aware that I was not responding properly
and that would make me more nervous and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
and that would make me more nervous and
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.150
and that would make me more nervous and
then I would get more aware of that and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
then I would get more aware of that and
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.520
then I would get more aware of that and
that can just shut me down entirely and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
that can just shut me down entirely and

lecture and sometimes almost happened
when I was talking to Sam Harris the

when I was talking to Sam Harris the
first time I paused for a long time and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
first time I paused for a long time and
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080

yourself because if you start thinking I
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810
yourself because if you start thinking I
should stop attending to myself then

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
should stop attending to myself then
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.670
should stop attending to myself then
you'll just think about yourself more

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
you'll just think about yourself more
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.719
you'll just think about yourself more
what you have to do instead is pay more

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
what you have to do instead is pay more
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.660
what you have to do instead is pay more
attention to the situation and to the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
attention to the situation and to the
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.249
attention to the situation and to the
people that you're talking to so you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
people that you're talking to so you
 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289
people that you're talking to so you
have to increase the degree to which

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
have to increase the degree to which
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.010
have to increase the degree to which
you're attending outwardly and that'll

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
you're attending outwardly and that'll
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.069
you're attending outwardly and that'll
stop you from attending inwardly that's

a very effective technique you can
practice that generally speaking every

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

good suggestion for social anxiety in
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.100
good suggestion for social anxiety in
general is that if you see most people

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
general is that if you see most people
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.289
general is that if you see most people
but not everyone but most people have

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
but not everyone but most people have
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.690
but not everyone but most people have
enough implicit social skill because

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
enough implicit social skill because
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.899
enough implicit social skill because
they were reasonably socialized when

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
they were reasonably socialized when
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.059
they were reasonably socialized when
they were children so that they do know

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
they were children so that they do know
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979
they were children so that they do know
how to act in social situations but they

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
how to act in social situations but they
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.780
how to act in social situations but they
get anxious and then that interferes

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
get anxious and then that interferes
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.430
get anxious and then that interferes
with them implementing

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
with them implementing
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.690
with them implementing
what they know just like if you're a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
what they know just like if you're a
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.360
what they know just like if you're a
pianist and you get anxious and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370
pianist and you get anxious and
 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.680
pianist and you get anxious and
self-conscious while you're playing

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
self-conscious while you're playing
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.870
self-conscious while you're playing
you'll forget what you know because

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
you'll forget what you know because
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.700
you'll forget what you know because
while you've activated a different part

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710
while you've activated a different part
 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.360
while you've activated a different part
of your brain if you can remember to pay

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
of your brain if you can remember to pay
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.980
of your brain if you can remember to pay
attention and you can direct your

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990
attention and you can direct your
 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.600
attention and you can direct your
attention outward and you attend hard

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
attention outward and you attend hard
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.670
attention outward and you attend hard
enough then what will happen and try to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
enough then what will happen and try to
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.290
enough then what will happen and try to
put the other person at ease and try to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
put the other person at ease and try to
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.770
put the other person at ease and try to
ask them questions then that'll kick in

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
ask them questions then that'll kick in
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.350
ask them questions then that'll kick in
the automatic because you're paying

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
the automatic because you're paying
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.270
the automatic because you're paying
attention to what the person is doing

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280

into their facial expressions and all of
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.560
into their facial expressions and all of
that that will clue in the automatic and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570
that that will clue in the automatic and
 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.340
that that will clue in the automatic and
implicit knowledge that you have and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350
implicit knowledge that you have and
 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.950
implicit knowledge that you have and
make things much more smooth and and and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960
make things much more smooth and and and
 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.610
make things much more smooth and and and
anxiety free so attention really

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620
anxiety free so attention really
 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.550
anxiety free so attention really
attention really plays a huge role in

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560
attention really plays a huge role in
 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.220
attention really plays a huge role in
regulating anxiety
