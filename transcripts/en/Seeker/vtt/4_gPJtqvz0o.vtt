00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.260
This hamster eating a burrito is the cutest
thing ever.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:12.640
So... obviously we have to science this cuteness,
bro.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.940
Howdy hamster-lovers, Trace here from DNews.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.640
Hamsters, squirrels, platypus, chipmunks,
some old-world primates, gophers all have

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.820
one thing in common -- they have food pouches.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.880
A food pouch is like a pocket around the mouth
where food can be stored for transportation

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.660
to a den, or to slowly consume.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.739
This amazingly cute video of a hamster eating
teeny tiny burritos has been making the Internet

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.679
rounds, and you can see the hamster shove
this burrito into its food pouch!

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.110
The pouches are huge, stretching from the
mouth all the way to the shoulders.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.410
The tiny burrito just DISAPPEARS!

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.410
It's gone!

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.410
Where'd it go?

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.380
And that's EXACTLY what another rodent would
think.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.219
Food pouches evolved as a way to hide food
from the competition.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.030
Hamsters, squirrels, chipmunks and gophers
are competing for food with a LOT of other

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.030
animals!

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.700
But once the food has been squirreled away
into their food pouches, it becomes a lot

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.570
more difficult for other animals to steal
their prize.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.329
Some, like hamsters, can then slowly consume
the food, while others, like chipmunks, push

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.649
the food back out and bury it for later.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.790
Hamster mommas will also store their babies
in their cheek pouches!

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.840
When the mom spots a predator, her instinct
is to stuff as many babies in her pouches

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.899
as possible and wait until the danger is gone.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.680
Hamsters aren't the smartest, because sometimes
the babies will suffocate before the mom feels

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.680
safe.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.680
The pouches are made of a very thin and malleable
skin, which is highly stretchy, sort of like

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.020
a thin balloon.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.270
But all that stretching means it's pretty
fragile, if a cheek pouch is pierced, the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.270
hamster is in trouble.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.280
But that's more important for pet owners than
the wild ones.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.990
Platypus have cheek pouches // SPINES, BILLS,
BEAVERTAILS, NOW CHEEK POUCHES?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.049
WHAT DON'T THOSE GUYS HAVE? // because it
hunts underwater, and carries it's prey to

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.799
the surface to munch.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.240
Again, I nominate platypus for most weird
animal ever.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.830
Macaques have food pouches too, and they're
the most biologically successful primate in

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.830
the old-world!

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.540
Some species of these omnivorous monkeys evolved
pouches to keep food from competing monkeys.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.700
That way, these intelligent social animals
can hide food they'd rather not share.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.051
It's not that the macaques are dicks... rather
that the best food is tough to come by, so

00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:29.120
when a macaque can get a competitive advantage
to protect its find -- like cheek pouches

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.780
-- it will survive longer and be healthier.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.310
What if HUMANS had cheek pouches?

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.310
Think about it!

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.000
I could put my phone somewhere and would never
miss a call!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What would you keep in your cheek pouches?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.590
I'm anxiously awaiting creative answers from
the comments, this could get weird fast.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.850
Make sure you subscribe to DNews for more
science every day of the week and you can

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.970
find us on twitter at-DNews or me at-TraceDominguez!

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.159
Be sure your pouches are empty people, you
wouldn't want anything dying up in there...

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.189
ew.
