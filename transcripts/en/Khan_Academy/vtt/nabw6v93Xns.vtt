00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.610
What we have here is six
examples of possible surveys

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.700
that might be conducted.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.560
What we want to do is critique
them, see whether they're

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.880
actually doing things that will
give meaningful results,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.400
or results that you can
actually make some

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.370
judgment based on.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.379
So let's read the directions.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.570
It says, comment on the way
the following samples have

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.730
been chosen.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.120
For the unsatisfactory cases,
suggest a way to improve the

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.950
sample choice.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.890
All right.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.020
So A, you want to find whether
wealthier people have more

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.200
nutritious diets by interviewing
people coming out

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.970
of a five-star restaurant.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.120
So this is skewed on
two directions.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
One, if you're only interviewing
people out of a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.880
five-star restaurant, you're
going to have a

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.210
disproportionate number
of wealthy people.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.290
And even the non-wealthy people
who are eating at the

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.390
five-star restaurant, they feel
like they have enough

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.350
money to eat there, so they're
probably not that not-wealthy.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.940
They're probably pretty close
to the threshold of wealthy.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.740
The other skew is that you're
interviewing people at a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700
restaurant, so you're
disproportionately probably

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.980
going to get people who eat out,
as opposed to people who

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.020
cook for themselves.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.300
And depending on whether this
is a really healthy

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.220
restaurant, maybe some type of
organic, vegan, who knows

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.990
what, restaurant, where
you're going to get a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390
disproportionate number
of healthy people.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.140
Or maybe it's a really
unhealthy restaurant.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.580
Maybe it's they put a lot of
butter and sugar in the food.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.420
Who knows what it's all about?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.030
But this seems skewed
on two dimensions.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.160
The best way to do it is, survey
some proportion of

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.610
wealthy people in an environment
where it isn't

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.990
being skewed by the type
of food they eat.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.690
So you, once again, you wouldn't
want to survey people

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.870
at the organic grocery, because
once again, you'd be

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.110
skewing for people who maybe
eat a little healthier.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.660
You'd want to do it maybe at
some type of wealthy type of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.050
event, or something that's
not food-oriented.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.530
I'd have to think more about
what that might be.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.720
And you'd also want to survey
people who are not wealthy, so

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.240
at some other type of event
where most of the population

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.710
doesn't fall under the
wealthy category.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.760
Or probably the best thing would
be sampling people at an

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.410
event that doesn't discriminate
on wealth, and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.960
just surveying people and just
ask them, in a broad bucket,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.290
do you make more than x?

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.120
Whatever your definition
of wealthy is.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.270
Or is your wealth, or is your
income less than x?

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.370
And then ask people what do
they eat on a daily basis,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.540
something like that
might work.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.470
So in general, I'm not
a fan, not a fan.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.830
I don't think this
passes mustards.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.100
It's biased on really
two dimensions.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.850
B, you want to find out if there
is a pedestrian crossing

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.240
needed at a certain intersection
by interviewing

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.050
people walking by that
intersection.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.290
So this is better than the first
survey, but it still

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.770
seems a little biased.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.480
And it depends how you
define needed.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.420
Is needed if the people walking
around the pedestrian

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.010
crossing think it's needed,
then this is OK.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.200
But if you want to objectively
find out whether people in

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.860
your community think it's
needed, you want to have a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.170
broader sample.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.320
So you might want to also
include drivers.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.050
Because obviously, the
pedestrian crossing is going

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.770
to affect them.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.740
You want to interview taxpayers
in general.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.530
And obviously a lot of people
might be all of the above.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.980
And you also might be missing
pedestrians who would be

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.520
walking by that intersection
if there was a pedestrian

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.940
crossing, but they're avoiding
it, and so those are the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.250
people who would want it the
most, but they're not even

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.740
going to be there because they
don't think that it's worth

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.440
walking around there because
you can't cross the street.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.700
So you're missing a whole
sample of people.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.790
The best way I would do this
is I would look within a,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.050
maybe a three block radius, or
maybe a six block radius, of

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.390
all of the homes and offices,
and I would randomly survey a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.000
sample of those people.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.080
And I think that would be a
better indication of whether

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.440
the pedestrian crossing
is needed.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.170
And actually, even a better
way would be do

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.020
it without a survey.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.630
You'd actually want to look at
patterns of people walking and

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.860
all of that, and compared
to other things

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.670
that might be needed.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.680
But this one definitely
doesn't work for me.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.890
Now C, you want to find out if
women talk more than men by

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.830
interviewing an equal number
of men and women.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.450
That seems reasonable.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.760
I guess if your survey, if
you do it in a non-biased

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.440
environment-- if you don't do it
at, like, a business school

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.570
or a law school where people
might talk disproportionately,

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.200
or it might be skewed towards
women or men more.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.190
I don't know which way
it would be skewed.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.930
But as long as you do it in a
neutral place, and I guess

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.640
their survey is, maybe they'll
ask some arbitrary question.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.940
And they'll just time, or
they'll count how many words

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.210
the women talk versus the number
of words the men talk.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.130
That seems like a reasonable
way to see if women

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.880
talk more than men.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.670
And once again, as long as
you're not talking to some

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.390
skewed sample, or biased
sample, this

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.900
seems pretty good.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.990
And it's good if it's
an equal number.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.930
There's an equal number of men
and women in the world.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.880
This seems to be-- I'll give it
a smiley face right here.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.590
D, you want to find whether
students in your school get

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.210
too much homework by
interviewing a stratified

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.400
sample of students from
each grade level.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.600
Well the first thing I want
to do is, what is

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.040
a stratified sample?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.960
And all that means is, you're
going to sample people in the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.210
same proportion that they
exist in the population.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.600
So let's say that your
population-- your school--

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.610
had, say they had 100
ninth graders.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.990
It has 200 tenth graders.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.280
300 eleventh graders.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.680
And 400 twelfth graders.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.940
Actually, the school I attended
actually, it went in

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.710
the reverse order.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.460
I think we had like 800 ninth
graders and 400 twelfth

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.600
graders since so many
people dropped out.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.320
But anyway, we don't have
to be realistic here.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.730
So you had a total
school population

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.010
of about 1,000 students.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.040
So if you want to do a
stratified sample, let's say

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.720
you wanted to have
a sample size of,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.320
let's say, 50 students.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.650
So you wanted to sample 50
students, and you wanted it to

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.440
be a stratified sample.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.490
What that means is, you had 100
ninth graders out of 1,000

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.000
in your school.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.400
So 10% of your school's
population is ninth graders.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.070
So in your stratified
sample, 10% also

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.910
need to be ninth graders.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.650
So 10% of 5-- sorry--
10% of 50 is 5.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.435
So you'd survey 5
ninth graders.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:55.290
In both situations, this is 10%
of the population, it's

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.090
going to be 10% of
your sample.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.080
Likewise, you had 20% were
tenth graders in the

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.450
population, so 20%
of your sample.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:10.640
Or 20% times 50 is 10 tenth
graders should be surveyed.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.560
And then 30% of your school is
eleventh graders, so 30% of

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.720
your survey.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.050
So that should be 15
eleventh graders.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.990
And then finally 40% were
twelfth graders.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.390
So in this situation, 40% of
your survey, which is 20,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.990
should be twelfth graders.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.150
So that's all-- that's what
a stratified sample means.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.220
Now let's talk about
whether this is

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.560
actually a good survey.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.310
You want to find out whether
students in your school get

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.420
too much homework, and
you're interviewing

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.230
students in your school.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.440
The one thing you definitely
will find out is you will find

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:49.860
out whether students in your
school think-- think-- they

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.020
think they get too much homework
by interviewing a

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.470
stratified sample.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.890
That would be true.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.450
That's what you would
find out.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.150
Now, whether you could say
that in a broader sense

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.290
they're getting too much
homework, you might want to

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.240
include a larger audience,
especially the other

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.470
stakeholders in the whole
homework doing process,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:13.250
especially parents
and teachers.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.720
And actually a better way to
do it would be, probably to

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.830
compare the students in your
school to a very similar

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.070
school that has a different
amount of homework, and maybe

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.770
see the results on standardized
tests.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.030
And you want to control.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.430
You want to make sure that there
isn't a huge difference

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.150
between the income levels, or
the education levels of the

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.120
kids' parents, and all that.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.679
I mean, it becomes much
more involved.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.659
But this one still seems a
little bit narrow, and all

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.740
you're going to find out is
whether students think they

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.880
get too much homework.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.220
And I can almost guarantee you,
they will think that they

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.880
get too much homework, and so
this survey might be a little

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.470
bit of a waste of time.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.780
So I will put a frowny face.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.500
E, you want to find out whether
there should be more

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.150
public buses running during
rush hour by interviewing

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.820
people getting off the bus.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.770
So once again, what you're going
to find out is whether

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.670
people who ride, people getting
off the bus think

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.560
there should be more buses.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.110
So I won't write it here, but
you're not going to find out

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.370
objectively whether there
should be more buses.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.210
Frankly, the best way to
evaluate that, I think, is to

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.000
just see how full, on average,
the buses are.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.060
I would actually poll the actual
buses and see how full

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.970
they are during rush hour.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:26.860
If 90% of them are 100% full,
or people can't get on a bus

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.900
because they're full and that's
happening frequently,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.900
and their total wait time is
just getting ridiculous,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.190
that's probably a better
assessment than

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.210
just surveying people.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.950
But even beyond that, this is
skewed on several levels.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.550
One, you are surveying only
the people riding the bus.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.940
You're not surveying the other
people in the community who

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.140
might have an opinion on this:
drivers, taxpayers who would

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.560
have to pay for more buses.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.470
And then even within the
bus-riding population, you

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.290
have to think about when they're
getting off the bus.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.450
If you're getting people off
the bus during rush hour, I

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.090
can almost guarantee you that
they're going to say, yeah,

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.280
we'd like more buses because
then they would have less wait

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.030
time, and the buses would be
less crowded, and they

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.240
wouldn't have to sit
next to anybody.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.860
So even if it's not needed,
they're going to say it is.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.270
But if you interview people
maybe getting off the bus

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.910
during lunchtime, who don't use
the bus during rush hour,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.510
they might say no, we don't need
more buses at rush hour.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.600
We need more at lunchtime.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.740
So you're going to get different
answers depending on

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.180
when the people are getting off
the bus, and obviously,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.700
you're going to get very
different answers from people

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.790
not riding the bus.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.670
So if you want a broader
audience, if you're kind of

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.740
the city councilman trying to
figure out what to do, I, once

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.490
again, like the crosswalk, I
would survey a random sample

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:41.080
of people within three miles
of the bus route, or

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.830
something like that.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.510
I think that might be
a better result.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.450
F, F-- I'll switch colors.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.890
You want to find out whether
children should be allowed to

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.080
listen to music while doing
their homework by interviewing

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.930
a stratified sample
of male and female

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.000
students in your school.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.320
Once again, stratified sample
just means that, OK, if my

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.580
school is 60% male, then 60%
of my sample will be male.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.830
And that doesn't really
seem relevant here.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.370
F seems very similar to the, do
students think they get too

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.390
much homework?

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.590
Just as almost every student is
going to say they get too

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.830
much homework, almost every
student should say they should

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.550
be allowed to listen to
music if they want to.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.920
And that's not going to be--
that's not really going to

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.630
answer the question of whether
children should be allowed.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.800
If you want a broader sample,
you might-- just like the

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.270
situation with the homework--
include

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.840
parents and include teachers.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.220
But really, if you wanted to
answer this question, the best

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.390
way would actually be to look
at, to survey students who

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.840
listen to music while doing
their homework, and students

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.930
who don't listen to music while
doing their homework,

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.480
and see their relative grade
performance, and that might

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.180
give you a better answer.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.855
So once again, I think this
one's a little weak.

00:11:55.855 --> 00:11:58.020
And the bus one was also
a little weak.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.150
So the only good one here,
if it's done right, is C.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.840
The other ones, they all needed
a little bit of work to

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.050
actually be surveys that would
give meaningful information.
