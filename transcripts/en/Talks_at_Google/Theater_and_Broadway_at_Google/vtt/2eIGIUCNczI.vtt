00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.050
SPEAKER 1: OK, thank you
everyone for joining us today.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.580
We are super excited to have
the entire cast of SKIN,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.540
which is the third
theatrical production put on

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.850
by Deaf Spotlight.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.310
SKIN will be showing at
the 12th avenue theater

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.319
main stage the first
two weeks of May,

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.860
and it was written
by Crystal Roberts

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.507
and directed by
Alexandria Wailes.

00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:33.840
It's performed in American
Sign Language, as you'll see,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.770
with English captions.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.920
And the story follows
four deaf, queer women

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.230
who are struggling to make
sense of violence, sex,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.890
and love and friendship amidst a
changing landscape in Seattle's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.820
Capitol Hill.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.690
Deaf Spotlight is an
organization based right here

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.650
in Seattle, and they have
the mission of inspiring,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.760
encouraging, and
showcasing creative works

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.349
of and by and for deaf people
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.000
They put on all kinds of really
cool productions and offerings.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.560
They put on the Seattle deaf
film festival, Epic Jams,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.290
theatrical productions,
group art exhibits,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.990
and they also have a deaf
drama group for youth.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.970
So now, the cast will perform
an excerpt from the play

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.090
and then afterward we'll have
and a panel session, I'll

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.430
let them take it away.

00:12:29.437 --> 00:12:30.020
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:30.710
Thank you, guys.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.340
That was awesome.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.870
We'll go ahead and
open it for Q&amp;A,

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.150
but first why don't each
of you introduce yourself.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:46.760
Tell us your role in the play
and a little bit about how

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.120
the play was designed.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.660
PATTY LIANG: Sure.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.524
So hi, my name is Patty Liang.

00:12:57.524 --> 00:13:00.450
I'm the executive director
for Deaf Spotlight.

00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:04.980
We'll talk more
about that later.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.920
Let's just do introductions.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.120
ALEXANDRIA WAILES: Hi, my
name is Alexandris Wailes.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.250
I'm the director
for the show, and I

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:19.440
want to thank Alanis
from the New York office

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.260
for getting here today.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.770
MICHELLE MARY SCHAEFER: Hi, my
name is Michelle Mary Schaefer.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.640
I am playing Ash.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.410
KALEN FEENY: My
name is Kalen Feeny.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.660
I am playing Quinn.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.700
RHONDA COCHRAN: My
name is Rhonda Cochran,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.970
and I am playing Rose.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.960
AMELIA HENSLEY: And my name is
Amelia, and I am playing Sammy.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.590
ALEXANDRIA WAILES:
We just finally got

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.230
the three different versions
of the script pared down

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.690
to the final version,
so we're in the process

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:07.940
of rehearsing at this time,
and we're opening on May 5th.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.041
We have some minor
adjustments to make

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.540
until we get to
that point, so thank

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.206
you so much for joining us today
and being part of that process.

00:14:15.827 --> 00:14:17.660
PATTY LIANG: And thank
you, Google and Anna,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.400
as well for the
opportunity to come here

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.450
and showcase this production
that we're putting on.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.830
I wish that Crystal
Roberts could be here,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.650
unfortunately she
couldn't, she's the writer.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.665
But the history of
Deaf Spotlight, I'll

00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:40.740
just give a little
bit of that history.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:49.020
We do cinema as well as visual
arts and performing arts,

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.030
those are our three
areas of expertise.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.090
And we believe in
supporting artists

00:14:53.090 --> 00:15:00.410
in each of those avenues
because there are often not

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.337
enough deaf artists in
any of these fields,

00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:03.920
and we really want
to see that change.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.003
We want to support artists
in each of those fields

00:15:06.003 --> 00:15:08.900
that we are working in, and
want to give the opportunity

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.420
for deaf artists to
show their stories

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:17.030
and add their voice to
the stage and create

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.540
higher visibility for the deaf
community in film, theater,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.040
and art.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.520
So we're trying to
create opportunities

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.030
that inspire people to be
artists and start to join

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.500
the art community as well.

00:15:33.322 --> 00:15:35.030
We're trying to give
people opportunities

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.970
to work in the field, as well as
some experience in that field.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.610
And how Crystal fits into
that picture and this show,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:48.210
we had an open call
for playwrights,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:55.152
any deaf playwrights,
and we chose this script

00:15:55.152 --> 00:15:57.110
and we are in the second
year of the production

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.860
process with that.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.670
We got a second script
from a hearing writer

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.950
which was translated into
American Sign Language, that

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.494
was our second show.

00:16:12.494 --> 00:16:13.910
And then we wanted
to do something

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.920
that was local, that
was really inspired

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.890
by it's environment, that's
where Crystal Roberts came in.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.760
She is a writer and she wrote
this script two years ago,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.220
submitted it to
us, we told her we

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.100
wanted to hear her story of
her experience of Seattle

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.170
and the Pacific Northwest
area, so she wrote us

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.000
a script in that vein.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.170
She's a deaf woman who
has lived in the area.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.500
She went through a long process
of developing this script,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:45.320
and we did some test
reads, et cetera.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.310
Now we're excited
to start working

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.550
with this finished
script with our cast here

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.812
and flesh out the
real concept entirely,

00:16:55.812 --> 00:16:57.145
that's been part of the process.

00:17:00.717 --> 00:17:03.300
ALEXANDRIA WAILES: Yeah, often
as I'm working with the script,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:10.670
I look at some of the
language, and some of it

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:23.859
I have on my phone
here, get it to load.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.600
So her words, she
says, I wrote SKIN

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:45.870
for personal and political
reasons, this is Crystal,

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.540
because I have not yet
seen a real representation

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.305
of deaf, lesbian women on stage.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.310
And this is a story
about the women

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:05.480
that I have broken bread
with, that I cherish,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.760
Butch, Dykes,
Queers, none of them

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.710
often represented on stage.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.750
So, I was searching
for an outlet

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.380
that encompassed both of my
identities as queer and deaf.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.020
Because there is a
disproportionate rate

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.950
of suicide and
mental health issues

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.590
and addiction in our
community and every day we

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:38.100
go through these
struggles, we have

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.420
to find meaning
in our friendships

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.990
and in the violent political
climate in which we live.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:56.472
Theater seems like the
perfect outlet for this.

00:18:56.472 --> 00:19:01.365
These characters
which I have written

00:19:01.365 --> 00:19:08.290
are deep, personal
collage, and it

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.080
is an image of the people
whose shoulders the future will

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.890
stand on.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.480
It is important to
me that their story

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:24.940
is told, that these characters
are complex without judgment

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.000
of good or bad, and show
them in this world which

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.690
is unkind to them,
the resilience

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.040
that they have with themselves
and with one another.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.330
And it is also a farewell
letter to my beloved community

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.670
which I have seen
change significantly

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.280
in the last decade.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:57.710
The process itself has
been a great journey,

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.470
from the request to
the initial script,

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:05.030
to finally understanding the
depth of the story until it

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.390
has reached the stage.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.270
So those are Crystal's
comments that she sent to me.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.020
ALL SPEAKERS: Wow.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.772
Thank you for sharing that.

00:20:13.772 --> 00:20:15.980
ALEXANDRIA WAILES: Yeah, it
was beautiful, I thought.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:30.230
In addition to what Patty
said, I think for deaf women,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.170
in work in many different
capacities in the theater,

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.190
writing, directing, et cetera,
I am really appreciative

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.260
of Patty's support.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.070
I came here from New
York, I'm visiting,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.210
and we all came together to
create this piece together

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.730
from all over.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.010
And we have to always
find this inner strength

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:56.330
to keep going on and continuing
our work all over the country

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.090
as deaf women in this art.

00:21:01.165 --> 00:21:03.540
PATTY LIANG: Of the four women
that we have who are cast,

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.800
three of them are
from out of state.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:15.970
Michelle is from Austin, we have
Kalen from Portland, Oregon,

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.670
and then Rhonda is the
one who's from Seattle,

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:27.547
and Amelia is from L.A.

00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:29.130
ALEXANDRIA WAILES:
Do you want to talk

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.810
a little bit about your role
in the show, each of you?

00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:40.050
MICHELLE MARY
SCHAEFER: I've been

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.990
acting now for a long time,
but kind of professionally

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.720
for a couple of years.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.160
I got my degree in
Deaf Education at RIT,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.960
and then I had my
master's there,

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:59.700
and then I was Billy
in Tribes I was

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:05.490
the first deaf female
actress to take on that role

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.230
and I faced a lot of challenges.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.670
I played Billy three
times, in 2016,

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.630
and I traveled with
that show a little bit,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.840
and that has led me
to here, so that's

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.420
been my process of
becoming an actor.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.850
KALEN FEENY: I'm
a script writer.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.950
I've been living in
L.A for about 10 years

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.715
and I recently moved
back to Portland.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:35.920
I've been writing
my own short films

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.140
and I'm interested in
getting into television

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.790
writing as well.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.310
So I have sort of two
avenues that I'm pursuing

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.830
and really there is just
not enough deaf characters

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.360
in television period, so that's
one of my motivations for that.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:58.510
I am trying to develop my
skills in a few different areas.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.100
RHONDA COCHRAN: And
I'm just an actor.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.980
I am an actor here, I've
been an actor for a bit.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:12.220
I haven't done a lot, I
enjoy going to the theater.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.700
I've worked as a deaf
interpreter as well.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:33.620
So my experience in the theater
has really been social justice,

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.660
area of expertise
is social justice,

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:41.360
political, national
deaf advocacy work.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.960
I was a trainer, and so
that's been my field,

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.150
my area of expertise.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.500
But I have learned so much
by being involved with SKIN.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.030
Being involved in
this experience

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.570
has been a wonderful experience,
wonderful process, that's

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.480
a little bit about who I am.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.370
AMELIA HENSLEY: Hi
there, I feel like I

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.890
started acting in the womb,
probably in my mother's belly.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.420
I'm from a deaf family,
so we were very visual,

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.300
it's been incorporated into
my life from the get go.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.145
I went to Gallaudet university
in D.C., graduated from there

00:24:21.145 --> 00:24:26.420
with a degree in
education, and then I

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.890
became involved with
Spring Awakening.

00:24:34.752 --> 00:24:36.210
I had a lot of
opportunities that I

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.750
think often deaf people don't
get in the arena of acting,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.890
I've been involved in
some shows on Broadway.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.317
To be a deaf actor, you want to
get work, you have to travel,

00:24:48.317 --> 00:24:49.900
you have to travel
across the country.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.066
And that's great, you get
to go all over the country

00:24:52.066 --> 00:24:55.050
and meet beautiful women
like these here today,

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.620
and have this kind
of experience.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.640
It feels good to be among
deaf people, in a deaf cast,

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.980
I feel like I've come home by
being part of this experience.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.460
PATTY LIANG: Should I say
something about myself?

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.520
OK well, I went to the
University of Washington, yay,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.620
Anna and I were both alumni from
there, and I studied ceramics.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.430
I grew up mainstream.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.430
I went to public school, but I
have deaf siblings, a brother

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.432
and sister, and we all
worked with interpreters,

00:25:29.432 --> 00:25:30.390
going to public school.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.110
And then I went to college, and
I was seeking my own identity

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.510
as a deaf person in the deaf
community here in Seattle.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:44.370
I was also picking up who I
am as an artist along the way.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.290
So I went to college.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:55.020
I went to a residency
program, met other artists,

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.470
and then as a deaf
artist, I wasn't

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.620
meeting other deaf artists.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:06.450
I went to graduate school and
set up this organization, Deaf

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.320
Spotlight, and I was
thinking about the future

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.490
of deaf artists, what I had
before, where it was at,

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.310
and where I'd like it to go,
what I'd like for deaf artists

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.080
to have in the future.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.820
So working with
this kind of group,

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.030
this kind of a cast,
this production,

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:29.220
I really believe that all of
us have our own community,

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.950
our own space and
we need to support

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.512
our internal space, our
creativity, what inspires us

00:26:35.512 --> 00:26:37.470
and spread that and share
it with the community

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.010
that we live in.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:44.070
Deaf, queer community, they
tend to be different groups,

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.930
different groups of people.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.350
I don't know if you
want to add to That Want

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.930
to talk about the LGBT community
here, about how to bring people

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.610
together?

00:26:53.610 --> 00:27:01.300
Right, out in the world, we
have this intersectionality,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.800
what it means to
be deaf plus what

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.650
it means to be a lesbian,
what it means to be queer,

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.430
what is the a story out there.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.060
So I'm excited to work
with this group, this cast,

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.090
to provide this opportunity
and this viewpoint

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.946
to a broader community.

00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:20.320
ALEXANDRIA WAILES:
Right, we work

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.560
with the creative team
for this performance,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.410
and it's only in ASL.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.930
The reason we've done
that is because we really

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.540
want people to have
that experience

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.140
rather than listening to
a voiceover of the actors

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.130
in their performance.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.620
We want people to really
get into the space,

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.310
really become part of
what we're sharing.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.970
It's with intention
that we do this,

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.370
we've created the sign space.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:53.110
I grew up as a dancer, and I
went to University of the Arts

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:58.840
in Pennsylvania.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.210
And it was a broad
area of study.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.380
I did some performance work
in that area, choreography,

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:10.180
directing, for the
stage, for small groups,

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:15.160
for web based small films,
and made that transition

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.000
back and forth.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.880
It became an opportunity
that was there,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.920
and I'm not one
to sit by and just

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.370
wait for things to be handed
to me and then take it on.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.570
I wanted to make things happen.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:31.780
So I found that the reality is,
there are many of us out there

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.330
but we need to find an
outlet, a way for us

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.600
to interact with
the broader world

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.880
to create this kind of a space.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.780
And to do that we have
to meet it halfway.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:49.240
So this kind of a story creates
that space, Crystal's writing,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.760
all of us here.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.640
It's inspiring.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.250
It's a breath of
fresh air for people.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.370
You know, we've been
on this journey,

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.020
so it's nice to
finally meet it here.

00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:07.300
PATTY LIANG: Ana are
there other questions?

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:19.880
AUDIENCE 1: OK, so my question
is sort of a two part question.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.930
One is about Deaf Spotlight,
and one is about SKIN

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.660
in particular, but they're
really both the same question.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.510
And when you're doing
something that's so focused,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:32.170
right, so we're talking about an
intersection of two communities

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:37.829
where we now have a really small
community, because obviously

00:29:37.829 --> 00:29:40.370
your audience isn't going to be
all people of that community.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.640
You're hoping to share
that experience with people

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.556
outside the community.

00:29:43.556 --> 00:29:49.690
So how do you make it
accessible to those people

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:55.210
without diluting the experience?

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.640
How do you make
it so that people

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.800
who aren't deaf and aren't
queer and aren't any

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.820
of those things,
how do you do that

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.140
without losing what
makes that special?

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:17.080
ALEXANDRIA WAILES: Do you
appreciate the theater?

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.500
Do you appreciate
going to the theater?

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.050
Then come, right?

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.100
It's open to everybody.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.080
I mean, I think
that's the point.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.710
Please do come, it's
not a closed group.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.671
We want people to
feel like, you know,

00:30:31.671 --> 00:30:33.670
we don't want them to
think that specific story,

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.790
specific community, specific
group of people that we're

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.320
trying to cater to, it's
really for people to come to,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.150
theater goers.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:48.490
It's a small community
with human issues,

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.000
but it's applicable to anybody,
it's applicable to any group.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.620
We all have that
commonality, we all

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.900
have that space where
we have common ground.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.520
And theater is
such a great venue

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.490
to explore that, it's
welcoming, it's inviting,

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.350
we want people to
come, we want people

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:06.220
to learn about other stories,
other groups of people.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.940
So the theater is a
great space for that.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.540
Please put out the
word, advertise,

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.420
we want people to come,
it's a great experience.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.860
Amelia and I, we worked on
Spring Awakening together

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:25.690
on Broadway, and a lot of
people who came, they were like,

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.350
oh it's a musical with deaf
actors why should I go to that?

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.810
And then they came,
and they were like,

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.720
oh, it's not just
about deaf actors,

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.530
it's about communication,
It's about the story,

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.150
it's a human story, it's
about the connection.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.170
It happens that
it's with teenagers

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.010
finding themselves,
coming of age,

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.760
something we all have
been through, right.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.560
We've all been
teenagers, so that's

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.250
the bigger catch for everybody.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.170
We can all connect
with that, it's a lens

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.000
that we're looking
through and it's powerful,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.470
so please do come.

00:32:05.454 --> 00:32:06.870
AUDIENCE 2: I was
wondering if you

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.703
could talk a little bit
about the challenges

00:32:08.703 --> 00:32:12.795
and opportunities of writing
and performing and ASL.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:23.124
INTERPRETER: That's a good
question, Patty's deferring.

00:32:23.124 --> 00:32:24.790
ALEXANDRIA WAILES:
So talking about some

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:29.964
of the challenges in
a signed performance.

00:32:29.964 --> 00:32:31.630
RHONDA COCHRAN: Sure
one thing that I've

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.338
noticed that is
particularly challenging,

00:32:33.338 --> 00:32:37.240
the script itself was written
in English right, of course,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.050
and then sometimes it doesn't
translate well to ASL.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.320
It's not a direct translation,
so we're like a little stuck,

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.570
like how do we do this,
how do we sign that,

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.630
where do we go with that, how
do express that concept that

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.430
can be clearly
accessible to people

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.130
in a way that's meaningful
that we get it from the script.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.660
It's a big challenge.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.340
And luckily we have a lot
of support for each other,

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.900
we've had a lot of
discussions back and forth.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.510
Crystal would show
up in the evening

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.620
than we would just hammer
her with questions.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:06.590
What do you think about this?

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.798
What do you think about that?

00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:11.920
And I feel like that process,
it's been a big challenge,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.380
but you know, translating
from English to ASL

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:20.254
and how to express it and not
lose the meaning behind it.

00:33:20.254 --> 00:33:21.670
KALEN FEENY: Another
challenge has

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.960
been with the written
script, the words,

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.350
you could hear the words,
you know oftentimes they

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.960
have a double meaning.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:40.160
You have a pun, so it could
have a double meaning.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.540
And when we sign it, ASL
has different language,

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.160
different puns, so
different from English

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.390
the grammatic structure
is very different.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.750
So when you see that
double meaning in English,

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.610
or layers of meaning,
we're thinking

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:58.480
about how to come up with
something equivalent in ASL

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.570
that will be meaningful,
that will hit the mark

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:06.202
and honor that language that
we're seeing in written form.

00:34:06.202 --> 00:34:07.660
ALEXANDRIA WAILES:
Let me just give

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:12.130
an example, one of the
phrases from the script

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:23.320
that we spent a lot
of time on discussing,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:27.020
razor burn, the
concept of razor burn.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.810
So the context is there when
you watch the play, where we're

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.210
using it on the
body, how it shows up

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:38.409
in ASL really is reflective of
what it means in the script.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:39.460
So, is it on the face?

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.690
Is it on the arms,
or somewhere else?

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:44.409
So we really had to
play with that in ASL

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:47.500
and figure out a way
to give the information

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.330
but not give too
much because it's

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.949
a little bit of an entendre.

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.860
Razor burn, you know, if I
just said that doesn't really

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.150
have the meaning.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.210
However, if we
identify where, wow, it

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.780
does have a lot of meaning.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.410
So those kinds of things
would come up in the script,

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:08.690
and how to make that maintained
and meaningful in ASL

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:14.810
with four deaf women who come
from various backgrounds,

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.040
from different educational
backgrounds, how they express

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.280
themselves, it varies.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.807
They didn't go to
the same school.

00:35:22.807 --> 00:35:24.640
They didn't grow up in
the same communities.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.170
Their ASL may be
different depending

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.090
on where they grew up.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.700
So being respectful
of that, and seeing

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.530
that in the development of
this script, and honoring it.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:40.840
Deaf bodies, deaf women,
it's been very interesting.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.616
This journey has
been interesting.

00:35:42.616 --> 00:35:44.740
RHONDA COCHRAN: Do you mind
if I add something too?

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:49.720
I noticed as well, with the
character development of Rose,

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.870
and thinking about
myself, my background, who

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:58.180
I am, as a lesbian, yes,
I'm a black woman as well,

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.460
what does that mean?

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.830
You know, did I grow up oral?

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.810
Did I grow up learning sign?

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.472
The deaf community, it can vary.

00:36:06.472 --> 00:36:07.930
You know, if you
go to a mainstream

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.480
school, public school,
residential school

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.320
for the deaf, those all have
huge impacts on language

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.870
development and how we
communicate with the world.

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.930
Maybe I learned pigeon
sign language or ASL

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.240
or English order sign language.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.090
It all varies and that
all affects our thinking

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.860
and how we approach this script.

00:36:29.535 --> 00:36:31.410
ALEXANDRIA WAILES: Are
there other questions?

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.030
PATTY LIANG: I'd
like to add as well,

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:48.700
so the writer,
Crystal Roberts, she

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.230
has a specific vision
of the four characters.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.990
And she gave us some
hints, some stories,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.110
background of these women, but
it was their responsibility

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.660
to really flesh
out the characters,

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:06.280
to go on the journey to
experience it to internalize

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.830
some behaviors that they think
that their character would

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.240
exemplify.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.730
Crystal didn't give
that information.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.180
She was very inspired by
what she saw in the community

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:23.120
here in Seattle and
as we move forward,

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.210
it really created a mosaic.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.250
A mosaic has been created by
these four actors, these four

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.420
women.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:36.290
One other thing I'd like
to add, Crystal, she really

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:40.460
wanted to work with a women
only team, women only director,

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:44.120
women actors, all the
volunteers, everybody

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.430
on the set, everybody
involved with the production

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:52.244
would be women to make it a
very safe space for everybody.

00:37:52.244 --> 00:37:53.660
ALEXANDRIA WAILES:
Right, this has

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:59.460
been a truly unique experience
because of that energy.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.040
It's very different.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.000
We're used to
something different,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.520
so it's very different really.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.960
PATTY LIANG: Deaf
Spotlight, this

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.930
is the first time we've
done a women only team,

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.240
a women only production,
first time in three years.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.920
It's exciting, and I think
that there will be more

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.500
ALEXANDRIA WAILES: And yes,
so however you identify, come!

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.400
It's not only for women,
that's not the point,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.250
I don't think that's the
point Patty is making.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.860
PATTY LIANG: Right, if you
go to the film or theater,

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:36.530
you go to a film festival,
they have different groups that

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.390
have different film
festivals, but you're

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.310
interested in learning
more about that group

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:43.760
so you might go in for a couple
of hours and kind of delve

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.740
into their life by
viewing this film

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.860
and feel what they are feeling.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.340
Really, any expression
through the arts

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.920
is valid and
valuable and creating

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.860
a safe space for
discussion and that process

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.150
in a healthy positive way.

00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:05.550
And someone asks
about the challenges

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:09.720
of producing this
piece, I think it always

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.090
depends on the script itself.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:13.730
How many characters do you need?

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.480
What kind of director
are you looking for?

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.240
What's the energy of the piece?

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.130
What kind of actors
are you trying to cast?

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:23.880
Who will express these
characters that best on stage?

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.860
And getting the people,
the right people

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.610
to be involved with
the production, that's

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.830
always a challenge.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.550
It's a team effort.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.430
It's a huge
collaboration, so getting

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.500
everyone's different
perspectives

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.966
and bringing that
all together is--

00:39:42.966 --> 00:39:44.340
ALEXANDRIA WAILES:
As a director,

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.800
I do believe that the
collaborative process,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.380
and having that collaborative
space when we are creating

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:52.590
each character,
is really inspired

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:56.280
by the collection
of individuals.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.777
It's never just one person.

00:39:57.777 --> 00:39:59.610
I know I go through
each of these characters

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.340
four times, right,
with each character.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.630
And then all of
those experiences,

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:14.056
that's the challenge of getting
the language of the play,

00:40:14.056 --> 00:40:15.180
or the language of theater.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.580
Often it's a process
and we're often

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.160
working with both deaf
and hearing people

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.029
and sign language is not
always natural in those mixed

00:40:27.029 --> 00:40:27.570
environments.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.546
You have to bring
interpreters in, there

00:40:30.546 --> 00:40:33.990
is a little bit of a language
delay, just enough for it

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.780
to be noticeable.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.280
I know that I signed
quickly, right,

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.590
so I'm working with
interpreters and sometimes I

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.975
have to make
adjustments for them

00:40:38.975 --> 00:40:40.350
and the interpreter's
catching up

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:42.510
to me, and that sort of thing.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:45.480
You have to have time
to listen and respond

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.720
and that adds time
to the process.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.110
I sometimes have to keep
in mind and open myself

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:58.110
up to being flexible
with that accommodation

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.140
because we're working
with these two languages

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.834
and you're also working
with one and other,

00:41:02.834 --> 00:41:04.500
and each of those
people in that process

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.666
needs to be honored as well.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.930
And as a deaf actor in a
production with a script that's

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:16.080
already been produced
in English and you're

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.700
working on translating
that process,

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.900
you want to honor the meaning
and the intent of that piece,

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.270
and that takes a lot of time.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.360
There's a lot of
discussion around that.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.090
I want to give the
cast about a week

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.830
beforehand, before
we start actually

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:31.947
rehearsing to just get
into the script, start

00:41:31.947 --> 00:41:33.780
understanding what it
means in American Sign

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.730
Language for them.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.950
We sat down and had a
discussion about how

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.450
we would sign some
of these concepts

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:45.420
with each of the actors,
what each line meant.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.200
Those puns, like Kalen
mentioned, translating

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.312
a lot of the work really.

00:41:51.312 --> 00:41:52.770
And then when we
started rehearsals

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.344
we already had a good sense
in our bodies of the direction

00:41:55.344 --> 00:41:56.760
that we were going
with the piece,

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:04.570
so it's different from
a hearing actor who

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.000
might just read from a script.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.710
They might go through a table
read just reading the lines,

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.479
but we are reading
these lines, we

00:42:11.479 --> 00:42:13.270
need to understand the
intent of the piece,

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.670
and then translate
from the English

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:19.170
into a meaningful expression of
that work in our own language.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.950
So that takes a lot
of time and energy

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:25.180
and we really try to
honor that entire process.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.960
PATTY LIANG: And if you happen
to know any other scripts out

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.400
there, especially if they're
deaf authors, let me know.

00:42:41.774 --> 00:42:43.612
Any other questions?

00:42:43.612 --> 00:42:44.820
This is your opportunity, so.

00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:49.650
AUDIENCE 3: You just mentioned
other scripts, what kind

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.224
of other projects do you
have coming up, if anything?

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.150
PATTY LIANG: Well, Deaf
Spotlight, after SKIN closes,

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.370
will be shifting our
focus to our drama camp.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.950
We have a youth drama
camp in the summers that's

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:10.060
a two week, free day camp
for deaf and hard of hearing

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:19.180
and children of deaf
adults ages 8 to 13.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.880
So we're hiring deaf artists,
professionals to come and work

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:28.262
with those youth teaching them
drama and other forms of art.

00:43:28.262 --> 00:43:30.220
And then we also have a
film festival coming up

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.678
in the spring, so if you're
interested in other events that

00:43:32.678 --> 00:43:34.400
are public, that
one's coming up.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.531
It's going to be an
international film festival

00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:37.780
that's hosted here in Seattle.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:42.490
We have films from Japan,
Australia, New Zealand,

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.320
all over.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.780
All of them in different
signed languages, each country

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.050
has their own, and
they are all subtitled.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.800
So it's just like
watching a foreign film,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.930
and in fact, they
are foreign films.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.930
So that's exciting as
well and that's coming up.

00:43:58.509 --> 00:44:00.800
Did you have any other projects
that you're working on?

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.817
Anyone else in the cast or crew.

00:44:02.817 --> 00:44:05.150
AMELIA HENSLEY: Yeah, I have
a project that's coming up.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.960
I will have a film
in the festival.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.645
ALL SPEAKERS: Yeah,
that's so exciting.

00:44:10.645 --> 00:44:12.270
MICHELLE MARY SCHAEFER:
My next project

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.030
is looking for another
acting opportunity.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.520
I'm trying to focus
on my web series,

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.991
I've found some work
there so, I'm working

00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:21.240
on one that's being developed.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:35.490
And then I'm setting up a
deaf theater in Austin, DAT,

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:47.106
and that's with Russell Harvard
and [? Bellamy, ?] I think

00:44:47.106 --> 00:44:48.480
I'm spelling his
last name right,

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.230
Bellamy [? Aquillie, ?] I'm not
sure if I spelled that right,

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:55.440
but the three of us are
establishing a theater

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.840
in Austin called the Deaf
Austin Theater and we're just

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.760
in the beginning stages of that.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.739
Hopefully we'll be doing
more shows there in Austin.

00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:04.530
So I'm looking forward
to that, and maybe I

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.020
can bring some of
these folks over there.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.270
Maybe Deaf Spotlight's
interested in getting involved.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.820
We'll talk to Crystal
as well, but I

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.600
would like to see SKIN
produced there potentially.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.240
KALEN FEENY: I have a
few projects coming up.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:29.980
I just did a TV Pilot and also
a feature film that I'm writing.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.930
There's a few women
involved in that

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:38.340
and there's a new play that's
being written that I'm working

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:42.030
on with some other people.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.020
And then Patty mentioned before
about providing opportunities

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.220
for deaf artists in the
future, and personally,

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:55.140
I would like to start developing
workshops to teach storytelling

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:59.760
and writing for deaf
artists and signing people

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.670
because going through the
process of becoming a writer,

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.680
and looking for opportunities
as a deaf writer,

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.470
there's really very few.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.136
I think I was very fortunate.

00:46:13.136 --> 00:46:15.480
And I want to
bring my experience

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.120
to a larger group
of deaf artists

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.080
as well, so I'd like to
start working on the project.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.900
RHONDA COCHRAN: My
next step is, I'm

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:34.540
a deaf interpreter for Dream
Girls, for the village theater,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.210
so that's my next project.

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:42.512
Once I'm done here, I'll be
studying for that project,

00:46:42.512 --> 00:46:43.720
so that's what's next for me.

00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:49.870
AMELIA HENSLEY: I just did, I
think I just talked about mine.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:55.880
Just the film that's coming and
that's all, and sleep and food.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.130
RHONDA COCHRAN: Yes, that too.

00:47:01.209 --> 00:47:03.500
PATTY LIANG: Do you have
anything else you want to add?

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.499
ALEXANDRIA WAILES: Well,
I will land in New York

00:47:05.499 --> 00:47:08.980
and hit the ground running when
I'm done with this project.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:17.360
So I have a few ASL
consulting jobs for a stage,

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.330
and one web series
that's coming up.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:26.060
And then I have another project
in the works, which I'm not

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.160
allowed to fully
disclose at the moment

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.230
until I have that
contract signed.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.760
PATTY LIANG: Alexandria and I
will be working again together

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.820
during the camp this summer,
so I'm looking forward to that.

00:47:42.977 --> 00:47:45.560
And if you're wondering how you
can support the deaf community

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.935
in the future and
Deaf Spotlight,

00:47:46.935 --> 00:47:49.070
you can come to
our events, you can

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:55.160
donate to projects, and share
information with your friends.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.494
If they don't know anything
about the deaf community,

00:47:57.494 --> 00:47:59.285
this is a great
opportunity to get a taste.

00:48:02.761 --> 00:48:05.260
And we want to be connecting
with other communities as well,

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.843
and if you have
people who are wanting

00:48:06.843 --> 00:48:09.380
to do that, refer
them to us, they

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.505
get to see a new perspective.

00:48:12.505 --> 00:48:14.630
ALEXANDRIA WAILES: Yeah,
and I think for outsiders,

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:19.970
a lot of people don't understand
what the deaf community offers.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:21.710
We have this concept
of deaf gain,

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:24.620
and we know that the
deaf community has a lot

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:28.940
to offer the world.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:33.560
These successes are a
result of our experiences

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.987
and our own lens and
experience the world,

00:48:35.987 --> 00:48:37.070
and we want to share that.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.920
So it can expand your own way
of thinking about the world

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:50.950
by coming to experience what it
means to live in a visual world

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:59.350
because we're visual beings and
people often maybe rely on what

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:02.770
they hear, but we have a
different way of picking up

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.310
on what's going on around
us and seeing the world.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.662
So that's one way that you can--

00:49:08.662 --> 00:49:10.120
RHONDA COCHRAN:
Yeah, I just wanted

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.780
to add to that like
you were saying before.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.110
You know, the death experience
is a human experience.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:20.260
We all go through the
same things in our lives,

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.740
we experience
heartbreak, we experience

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.320
many different challenges
in our lives, [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.080
violence, maybe sexual
violence, we have

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.910
so many diverse experiences.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:36.720
And experiencing this piece, or
other pieces by deaf artists,

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.740
gives us an opportunity
to relate to one another

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.840
on that human level.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.030
ALEXANDRIA WAILES:
Yeah, and you'll

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:47.270
see these four amazing actors
in their prime as well.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:55.010
PATTY LIANG: And if you're
following us on social media,

00:49:55.010 --> 00:50:00.680
we have hashtag, deaf talent,
deaf talent is the hashtag.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.360
If you follow us
there, you can keep

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.860
track of what's going on with
Deaf Spotlight and deaf talent

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.030
and see what's
coming up or support

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.460
any of the projects
that are going on.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.280
Yeah, we have some
posters here if you

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.030
want to take some with you.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.987
Yeah, any other questions?

00:50:17.987 --> 00:50:20.320
SPEAKER 1: No, I think we
should just thank our speakers

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.802
and thank you guys for
coming and for giving us

00:50:22.802 --> 00:50:24.010
such a wonderful performance.

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:25.050
This was really great.

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:28.550
ALL SPEAKERS: Yeah, thank
you so much as well.

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.300
Thank you for the opportunity.
