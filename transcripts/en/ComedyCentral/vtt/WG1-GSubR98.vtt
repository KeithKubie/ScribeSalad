00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:01.702
Hey, where at you?

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:02.870
I'm at that
dog shelter.

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:04.371
Lincoln, just
get a dog.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.073
Ilana, I can't
inflict upon a dog

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.008
the crazy life
of a dentist.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.843
Anyway, Abbi's not picking
up any of her calls,

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:11.378
so I'm pretty
sure she's dead.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.280
<i>I need you to be my
eyes and ears here.</i>

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.850
Stay on the local news, they
only cover rapes and murders.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:18.252
She didn't even say
"bye, Lincoln."

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.419
That takes
one more second.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.955
People have no phone
etiquette these days.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.391
Abbi!

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.867
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:35.369
What?
You wouldn't pick
up your phone.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.637
I thought you
got SVU'd.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.039
No, dude, I'm fine,
I just lost my phone.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.440
Remember that hot
dude at the bar?

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:41.475
He was supposed to text me,
so now, I'm, like,

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.776
never gonna hear
from him again.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.810
Oh, my God.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.112
You should use
the FindMyPhone app.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.747
I watch myself run around
the city all the time on it.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.815
Oh, okay, well,
we'll just do that.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.784
There's my phone,
I knew it was stolen.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.553
Ugh.
Okay, it's in Harlem.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.154
Great, let's go
track it down.

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:57.658
No, wait, wait, wait,
it's moving south.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.595
It's in the
Upper East Side.
Oh, dude.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:05.365
I-- I don't want
to go there.
Must we?

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.733
My son-in-law's
such a disgrace.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.702
He went to Cornell.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.905
I'm fine with the tsunami,
but not in St. Bart's.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.508
Anywhere else
is fine.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.310
It's the tenth horse
that died this year.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:18.912
That's ten horses
I've had to replace.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.214
Why does anybody
come up here?

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.382
It is a horrible,
vapid wasteland.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.351
Um, excuse me,
where's the Met?

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.719
Oh, right down here,
you make a right.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.321
Yeah, you can't
miss it.
Thank you.
