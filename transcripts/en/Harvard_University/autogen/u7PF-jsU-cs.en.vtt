MICHAEL BRENNER: So
everybody, let's start.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.474
So Dominique asked that
we start with a video.

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:28.438
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.140
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.310
MICHAEL BRENNER: So this
week, in the Harvard class

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.490
that goes along with this lecture
series is the time that we review things

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.710
and we give the students an exam.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.190
And since this is a lecture series, then
it seemed unfair to give you an exam.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.300
But I thought that it
should only be fair if you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.010
feel a little taste of this, as well.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.830
And that's the point of
what I'm going to do.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.840
So just a review.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.180
So this is week number seven.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.220
Time flies.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.180
So week number one, we
talked about food components.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.680
Week number two, we had
Harold McGee and Dave Arnold.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.760
And we talked about energy,
calorimetry, and bonds.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.810
And in particular, and
this will be relevant today

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.820
when Dominique shows one of her--
well, speaks about one of her recipes.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.570
So Dave Arnold showed us, and
this is just a picture of him.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.350
He showed it on the stage, here, how
dramatically the texture of an egg

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.920
changes when you heat it by just
an extraordinarily small amount.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.820
So from 60 degrees to around 70 degrees.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.820
Every degree, there's a change
in temperature of the egg.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.000
And Dave told us that his favorite
texture was the 64 degree egg.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.820
And for those of you who are
here, you know that-- you laugh.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.140
But you really can tell the difference
between a 63 degree egg and a 65 degree

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.640
egg.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.650
And I believe that
Dominique and Chris are

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.100
going to show us something
about the 64 degree egg.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.610
See?

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.310
And it can't be 63 degrees--

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.440
CHRIS BLEIDORN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.970
not 65 degrees-- doesn't work.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.240
It has to be 64 degrees, which is,
anyway, one of our messages, here.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.180
So then, the next week, we
talked about phase transitions.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.470
And Joanne told us about sugar.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.470
Then, the next week, we
talked about elasticity.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.469
And there was this wonderful
food truck outside.

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.130
And mark told us about
gluten free pasta.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.020
And then, the next week, we talked
about gelation, spherification,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.880
and diffusion.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.530
And Bill Yosses came and made
explosions, for us, of various types.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.880
And then, last week,
we had heat transfer.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.210
And Enric Rovira came.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.260
And he made chocolate on the stage.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.940
And we talked about chocolate.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.220
And that's basically a review.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.370
Now, there was a
version of these slides,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.521
that I neglected to upload on my
computer, in which every week came

00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.770
with an equation because you'll remember
that every week, we have an equation.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.769
And I was going to make you clap,
mainly to impress Dominique and Chris,

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.060
that everyone here claps
when they see an equation.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.010
But the equations didn't
show up in my slides.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.384
So you just have to imagine them.

00:03:27.384 --> 00:03:29.600
So if you go look up
how to temper chocolate,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.190
you will find out that you can't just
cool it down, heat it up, and then cool

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.120
it down to 31 degrees.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.900
If you do that, it
doesn't work very well.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.150
That's not what's recommended.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.480
And everyone should go home
and contemplate why that is.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.980
I'm not going to tell you right now.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.479
OK.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:47.000
So instead, I'm going to remind
you about the 64 degree egg.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.250
And I just want to tell you
one thing, as a sneak peak

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.930
into Dominique in Chris's lecture,
just as an elemental review.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.790
And then I'm going to
turn it over to them.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.290
So OK.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.950
So it turns out that in the
middle of this lecture--

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.740
there are going to be lots
of things in this lecture.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.489
But one of the things that's going
to play a prominent role-- if I

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.180
say something wrong, you guys,
at any moment, should yell at me.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.180
This is supposed to be informal.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.110
DOMINIQUE CRENN: I don't
want to yell at you.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.818
SPEAKER 1: Well, you
can tell me to stop.

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:10.510
So one of things that will play
a prominent role in this lecture

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.100
is this-- the dehydrator.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.970
How many of you own a dehydrator?

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.249
How many of you want
to own a dehydrator?

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.040
That's pretty good.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.539
OK.

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.459
So dehydrators are
really cool, actually.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.105
And inside of a
dehydrator, there are all

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:26.230
of the physical concepts
that we just talked about,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.355
as a review for this class.

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:30.382
You just have to think about what's
going on inside of the dehydrator.

00:04:30.382 --> 00:04:33.090
And Dominique and Chris are going
to show you amazing things that

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.160
go on inside of a dehydrator.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.660
But we will get to that in a minute.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.930
So as my sort of silly
warm up to them, I just

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.320
wanted to show you a recipe that I
found on the web, for dehydrating meat,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.440
just so you can look at
it and contemplate it.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.310
So this is unsophisticated.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.680
So this is what it says to do.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.290
It says select beef, cut off the
fat, and cut into thin slices.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.850
So you have to cut off the fat.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.800
If you don't cut off the
fat, it doesn't work as well.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.280
And an interesting question-- it's
a scientific question for you all

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.620
to contemplate, when I tell
you how this thing works--

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.647
is why you have to cut off the fat.

00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:06.230
What changes when you cut off the fat?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.730
So then you're told to marinate the
meat and cut it into very thin slices.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.000
You have to cut it into thin slices.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.540
And then what you do is
you dehydrate the meat.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.120
And you dehydrate it at a temperature
of about 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.580
is about 50 degrees Celsius.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.190
And you're supposed to do it
between two and six hours.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.710
Now, does the meat cook at a
temperature of 50 degrees Celsius?

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.210
No.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.230
It doesn't cook.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.580
It's below the temperature at which
the transitions that cause meat to cook

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.500
occur.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.650
And so why do you heat it?

00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:44.330
So one of the reasons you heat it
is to evaporate water more quickly.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.079
Another reason you
heat it is that this is

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.412
a range of temperatures where
you kill bacteria, which

00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:49.870
is good if you're dehydrating meat.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.180
And then what happens is you're supposed
to let it sit for two to six hours.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.030
And the recipe that I
looked at said, well,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.363
we don't really know how long
you should just look at it

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:59.370
and see when it dries out.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.620
Scientifically, though, it's
a very interesting thing,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.030
how long you're supposed to
wait, because what has happen

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.780
is that the water in the meat
has to basically evaporate away.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.770
And so this is a question
of, how long does it

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.840
take for the water to evaporate away?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.430
And the physical process to
dictate that is called diffusion.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.700
It's the same process that we talked
about, several weeks ago, here.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.492
And just as one simple
thought experiment--

00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:22.575
which we could have done
the experiment right now,

00:06:22.575 --> 00:06:25.140
but we're not-- to have in front
of you, if you take a coffee

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.280
drop, a drop of coffee, and you put
it on the table, and you let it sit,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.050
then what happens is that the
liquid evaporates, and at the end,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.430
you're left with a ring
of coffee around the edge.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.470
And that ring occurs
because of the evaporation,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.120
which leads to very
interesting phenomena, which

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.070
I could go on about at length.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.850
But instead, I'm going to stop now.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.210
That's enough.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.510
And I'd like to welcome
Dominique and Chris.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.950
And we're really just so happy you guys
are here to share your ideas with us.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:56.790
And so let's clap.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.110
And we're gonna start--
before I turn to them,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.610
I'm gonna start with one more movie.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.089
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.634
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:26.300
DOMINIQUE CRENN: That looks pretty good.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.133
MICHAEL BRENNER: Looks
good to me too, chef.

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:30.585
DOMINIQUE CRENN: I wanna go there.

00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:34.836
Well, good evening.

00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:35.960
My name is Dominique Crenn.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.619
This is my chef de
cuisine, Chris Bleidorn.

00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:41.160
The reason why he's here is not
because he wanted to be here.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.815
It's because he used to live here.

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:47.550
So he wanted to come back
on a free trip to Boston.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.420
Just kidding.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.790
Well, you saw this video.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.110
And so this is what we
do at Atelier Crenn.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.810
So what we're going to talk about
today is a little bit of history

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:03.770
about how Atelier Crenn
came alive, or to friction,

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.510
and then kind of the idea about
what Atelier Crenn is about.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:14.120
It's about, obviously,
understanding taste and flavor,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.690
and also bringing the memories,
this aspect of memories,

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.400
into the creativity of the food.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:28.110
So we opened Atelier Crenn in 2011.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.630
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Four years now.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.630
DOMINIQUE CRENN: You were a baby.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:39.890
The reason why I wanted to open
Atelier Crenn is a lot of reasons.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:45.900
The number one reason is, in
2009, I almost lost my life.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.360
And I was very close, obviously, to die.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.970
And then I realized
that life is too short,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:02.280
and you need to really follow your dream
and do those things that you think,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.860
I mean, are good to be done by you
and just maybe to have a platform

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.120
to just realize your vision.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.820
And we can go through life
and go to school and work

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.320
for a company or whatever, you
know, and just-- and be happy.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.690
But I was not happy.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:23.130
And I wanted to do something that
had meaning and not just meaning

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.760
for me but a meaning for a team
that I wanted to create around it.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.090
And also, it was also-- part of
it was also an homage to my dad

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:38.320
that also taught me so much about
the world and diversity and art

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.430
and people and politics and community.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.960
And it's about community.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:50.180
So in 2011, I opened Atelier Crenn.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.650
And actually, it means
workshop in French.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:59.200
And Crenn is, I guess, is my last name.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.910
It's also the last time of my dad.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.860
My dad used to be a politician.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.880
But he also used to be a painter.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.430
And he used to have this
workshop called Atelier Crenn.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.340
And when you walk into
the restaurant, you

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.990
can see paintings all over the place.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.210
So-- of his artwork.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.770
So the idea was, really,
to open something

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.180
like not just a restaurant, a
place where people come together

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:32.696
and try to create something that
is more than just food, you know?

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.350
I mean, I'm still a kid.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.490
I'm sure you have kids.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.450
You know?

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.190
Right?

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:47.370
And I think, to be able to be--
for me to be able to be creative

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.180
and to go through that
creative process, I

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:55.420
need to hire-- needed to hire
people that were also children,

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.150
but not children in a sense that
they're not mature-- children in a sense

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:06.430
that the way they think because I
think that kids think with so much

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.590
curiosity that it's a very clean
and there's nothing around it.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.190
It's just curiosity.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:20.780
And it means, also, that, well,
you drive by natural curiosity.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:21.870
That's why I hired you.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.578
Or it's just because
you're good looking.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.250
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Atelier Crenn
has no boundaries on this.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.100
DOMINIQUE CRENN: No prejudice.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.180
We don't have prejudice.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.680
We don't have boundary.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.040
And I think we like to learn new ways.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.900
We didn't want to be put in a
category where you open a restaurant

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.250
and you have to do this because
you have to please your guests,

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.470
and just in a box, and you just have
to cook whatever else other cooking.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.970
You know?

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.136
But there's a lot of great
restaurants that do that.

00:13:54.136 --> 00:13:57.540
But this is not what we are about.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.690
It's also about evolution.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.400
So I don't believe in perfection.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.775
CHRIS BLEIDORN: It doesn't exist.

00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:07.210
DOMINIQUE CRENN: There you go.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.710
And I think, evolution gives us
a chance to create something.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.540
But when you create, there's
always something else after that.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.120
And it's not just about in food.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.900
It's about the way you think in life.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.550
You know?

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.880
I think you can have ideas about things.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.790
But I think it's always
important for you

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:28.080
to just understand your surroundings
and maybe to get other ideas.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.870
And maybe you can grow from it.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:34.670
So it's also a place where we wanted
to start a dialogue with whoever

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:39.370
wanted to come to Atelier Crenn--
the guests, even the waiter,

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.020
even the people in the kitchen.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.520
You know?

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.590
I'm always fascinated with the people
that we hire because they are people

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:47.800
and they have minds.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:53.670
And even if we have a
vision, it's so rewarding

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:59.670
to be able to talk to a new cook and
try to understand where he comes from

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.690
and what's his idea about life.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.645
And from that, you can create maybe some
type of memories and dish through that.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.450
So anything can happen at Atelier Crenn.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.690
There's no rules.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.030
We break the rules.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.135
We pay our taxes, though.

00:15:16.135 --> 00:15:17.510
That's the only thing that we do.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.920
Well, did I do it?

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.420
No.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.280
I still have my 2012s.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.860
I just had the IRS talk--
I mean calling me to death,

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.590
like, you didn't pay your taxes.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.290
I'm like, I'm still doing my taxes.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.400
[INAUDIBLE] we break the rules.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.110
Are you guys in the industry, or
you just-- are you other industry?

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.610
OK.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.070
So who's in the industry, here?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:46.610
All right.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.860
And you guys are going to
school for it, or are you

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.230
done with school, in a restaurant?

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:56.850
So learning to cook is amazing.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.620
You know?

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.180
But when you go to those--
there's an old school

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.080
where it's a very narrow-minded
way of looking at things.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.540
And one hand, it's good
to have the basics.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.210
You know?

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.720
But on the other hand, how
do you evolve from something

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.470
that is very narrow-minded and
you can't grow outside of the box?

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:23.400
And I think, probably 20--
before [INAUDIBLE] came along,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.460
you never see any restaurant
kind of being very creative

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.880
and thinking outside of the box.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.460
So I think that cooking is an art.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.199
And people can argue.

00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:35.740
I don't know.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.960
Maybe you guys can argue with that.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.250
So it's kind of like getting-- in a
way, you know, like before, it was,

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.310
you can have a menu,
and it can go from-- I

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.840
don't know-- from winter to summer,
and you still have the same vegetable,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.260
and you still have-- OK.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.920
Well, it's leave it like that.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.460
And I think, we want to push,
also, the boundary of creating

00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:00.700
new things because I think,
when you create new things,

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.010
you create kind of a legacy.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.440
And from that, you can-- the technical
legacy-- and you can evolve from it.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.660
I, mean [INAUDIBLE] was the first
one that started this class.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.970
And I can tell you how many
cook, or aspiring cook,

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.950
just look at him as being just
a master of a lot of things.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.760
It doesn't mean that we
have to like what he did.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.980
But it's kind of opening
you, the way-- your mind.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.160
And it's also giving you the ability
to realize that cooking is not just

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.590
cooking, but you have
to think before cooking.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.770
And I think that's quite rewarding.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.700
We are not-- I don't know.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.830
I mean, we're a little bit
cerebral, but we're not academy.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.890
But you guys are like,
obviously, you're here, I mean.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:50.890
It's a big school.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.510
You know?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:18:00.420
But I think we want to talk about
and have a conversation about things

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.500
that we think are worth to talk about.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.390
And then with that, also, getting more.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.440
It's not just about food
but getting more involved

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.651
with the social economy around
us and see what's going on.

00:18:14.651 --> 00:18:16.400
But I'm not going to
be political about it

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.890
because obviously, there's a big debate
right now, about the climate change.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.990
And I'm just going to say one thing,
that as far as-- the food industry

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.660
is probably the number one food
industry in the United States,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.365
but all over the world, and as
chef, we have the responsibility

00:18:31.365 --> 00:18:32.910
to also look at that.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.830
And everything we do, we
need to really be thoughtful.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:45.560
So I mean, a lot of people look at
a restaurant, and they will think,

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.950
it's like, what are they doing?

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.366
I mean, what kind of food is that?

00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:51.700
There is no steak or fries, or this
is something that we don't understand.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.650
Well, it's kind of
another way of cooking.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.100
And I think what's important
to us is the main thing that

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.770
is very important to us is to
understand taste and flavor.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.930
But I think a lot of people
use that word, taste,

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.970
because it's been used
in a lot of language

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.610
in one way of, like, the words.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.110
It's taste, but it's also flavor.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.002
And it's not.

00:19:14.002 --> 00:19:15.210
So it's two different things.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:20.610
So I think the sense
of taste, like you say,

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.480
is triggered by the reaction inside of
your mouth, you know, with your tongue.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.760
And it's one of the senses.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.350
I will say that.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.070
And the flavor is definitely a
combination of odor and taste.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:41.780
So that's what our basic-- with
Atelier Crenn, when we create a dish,

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:49.120
is the test and flavor
are very, very important.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.250
I'm saying this because a lot of people
categorize our type of restaurant

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.710
as being molecular gastronomy cuisine.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.510
I'm not crazy about that term.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.660
But molecular gastronomy
cuisine-- usually,

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.100
like, when people use that term,
is oh, they're very innovative

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.440
and the taste doesn't taste anything.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.650
And this is not what we are about.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.960
And by the way, molecular-- when
you cook anything, it's molecular.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.451
When you boil some
water, it's molecular.

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:19.950
Right?

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.090
It's molecular cooking.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.450
So I just want to put
that in the air, that it's

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:31.600
just I think there is a
misunderstanding about this.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.350
So this is for us.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.750
It's to understand, you know,
also the flavor of pairing.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.060
And then what we want to show you
right now, it's a couple of things

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.420
that we're doing at Atelier Crenn.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.170
And it's about transformation.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:51.100
One is transform a carrot
from a-- to a carrot jerky.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.840
And the next one will be an egg.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.189
Where did the egg come from?

00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:58.230
MICHAEL BRENNER: The egg?

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.580
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Or was
that a stupid question?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:20:59.680
What do you think?

00:20:59.680 --> 00:20:59.850
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:00.300
That's good.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:00.650
Ask them.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.983
DOMINIQUE CRENN: From a chicken.

00:21:01.983 --> 00:21:04.080
Where did the egg come from?

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:10.620
And the egg is transformed to an egg
sheet without nothing else, just egg

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.280
and pliable and workable.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.092
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Which do you want first?

00:21:16.092 --> 00:21:18.050
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Do you
wanna do the egg first?

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:18.925
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Sure.

00:21:23.698 --> 00:21:27.177
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:38.225 --> 00:22:40.350
CHRIS BLEIDORN: This is a
64 degree egg yolk puree.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.400
That's what that is, right there.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.170
So what we do, we cook
those eggs for two hours.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.300
That's how long it takes
to pasteurize them.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.500
And we pass out any
impurities, maybe like whites,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.520
skin around the egg yolk, that film.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.666
Then we create this pure--
basically pure cholesterol.

00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:03.110
OK?

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.190
That's what it is.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.550
And right now, we're
vacuuming out all of the air.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.700
So once this happens, it
becomes very clear that's

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:17.020
the pretty unique trait about
this, about 64 degree eggs.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.820
The yolk, it actually
cooks very translucent,

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.320
which makes it really, really great.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.670
So we've use this technique a
couple times at the restaurant.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:35.750
On and off, it comes on.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.980
Essentially, it's just an egg,
a nice clear egg yolk sheet.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.760
Sometimes we serve it as pudding.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.150
We garnish several dishes with it.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.440
Here, we take this.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.470
We take the technique a step further.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.357
So it goes into this piping bag.

00:23:54.357 --> 00:23:59.110
And what the video's
gonna show next is we're

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.260
going to lay this egg yolk very thin.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.170
So we cook it to this temperature
to create this pudding texture.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.360
And it allows us to
spread it really thin.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:15.040
So if it was cooked hotter,
we would lose the clarity.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.670
And if it was cooked lower,
it would be too runny.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.564
So this just allows us-- we treat
it like putty, almost, inside of it.

00:24:24.564 --> 00:24:26.730
So spreading it between
these two pieces of plastic.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.445
So this is part of a recipe.

00:24:38.445 --> 00:24:41.080
So we're weighing it out.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.660
So we calculated that maybe, I
think it's 50 grams or 55 grams.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:53.790
Spreads out to the thickness
of the sheet that we want.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.020
And there, it goes into the plastic bag.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.260
And we're gonna seal it and
take out all of the air.

00:25:07.732 --> 00:25:09.940
The air is already taken
out of the egg yolk mixture.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.350
But that's just like to
clear the bag from air.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.060
This is where we roll it.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.400
So this is what really makes
this technique pretty unique.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:25.640
And it really takes this-- the egg
yolk even further, even further.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.880
So here, we spread it out really thin.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.550
And then, from this point,
we cook it one more time.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.960
So it goes from 64, now, to 72.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.640
So we reset the eggs that
we already denatured.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.580
And it doesn't take long for this to
cook, just about 20, 20 to 30 minutes,

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.080
or so.

00:25:48.984 --> 00:25:52.945
And you'll see, I can peel
this right off of the plastic.

00:25:52.945 --> 00:25:57.120
And from this point, we use
it for many applications.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.816
We've rolled beef in it, which one of
the videos showed a dish, actually.

00:26:01.816 --> 00:26:06.140
And we've created pasta noodles.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:06.640
You know?

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:16.600
We get this nice, clear glass egg
yolk sheet, which tastes great.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.939
It's pliable.

00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:18.855
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Yeah.

00:26:18.855 --> 00:26:20.155
It tastes like egg, yeah.

00:26:20.155 --> 00:26:21.030
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Yeah.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:26.340
And basically-- an egg and salt.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:26.916
OK?

00:26:26.916 --> 00:26:28.665
DOMINIQUE CRENN: And
it's gluten free too.

00:26:30.685 --> 00:26:31.560
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Yeah.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:31.970
There you go.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.450
There's some gluten free
noodles, right there.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.491
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Exactly.

00:26:38.357 --> 00:26:39.190
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.898
CHRIS BLEIDORN: So
that's just an example

00:26:40.898 --> 00:26:43.760
of where we take certain
ingredients and just bring them

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.130
further and try to make something
out of them of what they're not.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:59.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.330
DOMINIQUE CRENN: He's a good speaker.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:06.055
So let's do the next one, which is--
and I would like to get also the--

00:27:06.055 --> 00:27:08.180
CHRIS BLEIDORN: I think
it's also important to talk

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.760
about the level of
responsibility we take

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.960
at the restaurant about organic sugar.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.150
We even have bio-organic
sugar for the restaurant.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.274
DOMINIQUE CRENN: All right.

00:27:18.274 --> 00:27:20.644
So let me tell you a story.

00:27:20.644 --> 00:27:22.560
CHRIS BLEIDORN: What
story are you gonna tell?

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.760
DOMINIQUE CRENN: So we try and
we are a sustainable restaurant.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.540
But we take this further than that.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:40.190
So when I hired Chris, and I thought
you were very happy when I told you

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.950
that, I say, you know,
it's not just about us

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.080
using everything sustainable
and organic and all of that.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:52.700
But anybody that we are feeding needs
to also eat organic and good food.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:28:00.250
And so we go further than that, which is
everything is-- it's basically organic.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:04.260
So I think we have one of the
best employee meals in the city,

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.430
I would say.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.520
And it's very thoughtful.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:13.760
And what I will do is, I worked in
places where we worked, I don't know,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.470
12, 14, 15 hours.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.220
And then when you go
to the employee meal,

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.220
it's just like this
not really good meal,

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.010
which, I don't know, kind of
processed and not thoughtful.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.220
And I put this in my body.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.420
And then I go back to work.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:34.840
So I wanted to really make
sure that the restaurant also

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.160
takes care of the employee
because they are part of it.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.310
So if you think-- it's
organic, it's kind of crazy,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.740
and it's cost me a lot of
money, but it's worth it.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.390
CHRIS BLEIDORN: It cost me a
lot of headaches, actually.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.550
When I first got hired, she said,
we're gonna have an organic restaurant,

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:56.850
everything's sustainable-- be really
responsible on top of being innovative.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.180
And I was on board.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.530
I truly believed that too.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:04.430
And I almost thought it was gonna
be with the meat and the vegetables.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.590
And then I started working.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.780
Maybe a couple of months
into it, all of a sudden,

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.860
like, the sugar has to be organic.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.760
And sugar-- organic sugar--
has trace amounts of molasses.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.940
So all of our previous
recipes all had to be changed.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.680
You know?

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.530
And of course, I'm the
guy who has to do it.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.080
But I mean, those are the type
of things that it's really

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.660
kind of-- we value as important.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.270
And sometimes, it doesn't
get translated to the guest.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:34.770
You know?

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.690
They don't know that
we use organic sugar.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:40.860
But we feel it's important
to use organic sugar

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.780
and just to support
that and that belief.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.940
And throughout the restaurant,
I mean, it's double the price.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.940
Double the price, just
to do that, for something

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.550
that is undetectable for the most part.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:57.429
But that's really, I don't know,
how we feel about our food.

00:29:57.429 --> 00:29:58.345
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Yeah.

00:29:58.345 --> 00:30:01.610
And it's also for us, also,
to just be a part of this,

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.279
to be conscious about what we are doing.

00:30:04.279 --> 00:30:06.570
It's not just about, like I
said, put food on the plate

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.500
but also everything we do.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.890
And it adds meaning.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:18.920
And I hope I can, when we
finish this dish lecture,

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:24.120
I hope that you can maybe have a sense
of maybe a knack of transformation

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.990
with yourself and your surroundings.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.387
And maybe that might maybe help you
to think about maybe doing things

00:30:30.387 --> 00:30:31.095
very differently.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.610
The carrot used to be refined sugar.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.010
We don't like refined sugar.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.801
CHRIS BLEIDORN: No.

00:30:40.801 --> 00:30:43.540
We don't use it at all.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.552
DOMINIQUE CRENN: So we're gonna show
you how we came up with-- oh, so the way

00:30:47.552 --> 00:30:49.260
that we came up with
it is like, I think,

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.280
when I interviewed-- what was that?

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.934
We were having coffee at [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:54.934 --> 00:30:56.850
It's a very good coffee
shop in San Francisco,

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.760
if you want to ever
come to San Francisco.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.330
And then we were just thinking
about, so Chris has a great pedigree,

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:13.460
and he has a great background, and
obviously, you're from here, Boston.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:19.540
And then he worked in Chicago, which
is very much-- I think most of the food

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.870
is there's a lot of meat
and things like that.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.440
And then you [INAUDIBLE] which
is a little bit different.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.120
And then he worked at
Benu, in San Francisco.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:33.150
And then we were thinking about, I
mean, vegetable are the new meat,

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.536
for me, personally.

00:31:34.536 --> 00:31:35.410
I'm not a vegetarian.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.340
I'm not vegan.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.710
But I just, I think that
vegetables are amazing.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:44.134
And nobody really cares.

00:31:44.134 --> 00:31:45.550
Not a lot of people care about it.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:49.410
So we were talking about doing a
lot of things about vegetables.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.690
And obviously, I'm not American.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:52.760
He is.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.360
And then the first thing that came out
of his mouth is, let's make a jerky.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:00.770
Jerky?

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.520
CHRIS BLEIDORN: We
were brainstorming, OK?

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:10.289
DOMINIQUE CRENN: So I'm going on
my iPhone, like, what's a jerky?

00:32:10.289 --> 00:32:11.560
I know.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.920
But I didn't grow up with it.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.210
And it's like, at first, I was
like, oh, yeah, vegetable jerky.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:15.350
Yeah.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.840
Boom.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.340
OK.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.240
So let's try to work on this.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.165
And then so that's how
the carrot came around.

00:32:23.165 --> 00:32:24.040
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Yeah.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.970
It took about a year.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.210
Still evolves, actually.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:27.530
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Yeah.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.830
It's still-- what it was, a year ago,
what it is now is quite different.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.710
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Yeah.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:33.210
Yeah.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:33.800
Let's show the video.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.000
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Yeah.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.153
Let's show the video.

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:36.040
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.800
CHRIS BLEIDORN: So that's a
bath of calcium hydroxide.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.890
Basically, it's an alkaline solution.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:47.740
And we take organic carrots, and we
soak them in there for about two hours.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.040
So the onion process is
nixomol-- nixomolization.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.412
So I use it for masa.

00:32:53.412 --> 00:32:54.870
Usually do it to corn to make masa.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.650
This is a salt and sugar mixture.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:06.070
And just like most jerkies, or
some jerkies, they get cured

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:13.270
or we'll cure meat, fish, just to
basically take out some of the moisture

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.050
and then to add seasoning, as well.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:20.050
So the carrots get packed in this
sugar mixture for three days.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.770
Now, at the restaurant,
we do cases at a time.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:30.530
This is just a small batch.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.090
And that's what's really interesting.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:38.930
All of that liquid in there is
from the-- it's from the carrots.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:43.880
So it draws out so much moisture,
which was really surprising.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.800
First time we did this, we put them
downstairs, in our dry storage area.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.165
And it was wrapped in plastic.

00:33:50.165 --> 00:33:52.540
A couple of days later, I went
down there and look at it,

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.858
and it was filled up with water.

00:33:54.858 --> 00:33:57.092
You know, it just caught me by surprise.

00:33:57.092 --> 00:33:58.050
So that's what happens.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:02.170
The carrots become very
pliable and really denatured

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.530
and shrink by half the size, almost.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.704
And also, at that stage,
they taste completely raw.

00:34:08.704 --> 00:34:11.935
They're crunchy, which
is also interesting.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:22.510
So we cook them in a sugar solution,
some spices, things like that,

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:25.920
try to infuse as much
flavor as we can into them.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.170
That's the sugar, right there.

00:34:34.594 --> 00:34:35.719
So they get packed in bags.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:40.270
And then we boil them, I don't
know, three to four hours,

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.270
until we try to overcook
them as much as we can.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.160
So when we made this video, this
was, I don't know, maybe a year ago.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.470
Since then, this dish has
actually evolved even further.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:11.800
So after this stage, or sorry-- before
this stage, we actually brine them.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.930
We make a tea with ginger and orange.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.995
And we rehydrate the carrots with
a brine and then rinse them off

00:35:16.995 --> 00:35:18.400
and bag them.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.090
So it's one of those recipes that we've
been working on consistently and making

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.340
it better.

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:34.220
So here we have basically cured,
brined, and boiled carrots.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.890
It takes about three days
to get to this point.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.235
And then they go into the
dehydrator for anywhere from,

00:35:41.235 --> 00:35:43.080
you know, small ones
will take 30 minutes

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:48.120
and larger ones will dehydrate
for three hours or so.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.270
This is a solution-- a sugar
solution made with cayenne

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.370
that we brushed in and glazed them.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:05.390
So about here, we just
try to basically give it

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.540
some of the spicy flavors that
jerky may have traditionally.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.677
And then we wrap it with an orange rind.

00:36:12.677 --> 00:36:14.718
So that orange rind has
been cooked and seasoned.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.930
So you can see, right there, that
the carrot has shrunk almost by 60%.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:36.435
So the result is this really
dense, concentrated carrot flavor

00:36:36.435 --> 00:36:40.200
with notes of ginger and orange
and a little bit of spice.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.250
And this is how we serve
it at the restaurant.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.839
We take a branch that's
filled with moss.

00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:47.880
That's the natural color
of the moss, by the way.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.662
We always get that question.

00:36:49.662 --> 00:36:51.120
And now we serve it right on there.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.036
It looks very natural.

00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:57.510
That's sort of the
theme of our restaurant.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.579
And it'll go on the table, just like
that, and you eat it with your hands.

00:37:06.537 --> 00:37:09.281
So the result becomes a very
chewy carrot, kind of playful.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.469
Carrot jerky, chef.

00:37:31.469 --> 00:37:32.510
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Amazing.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.480
The great thing is, like, we've
been doing that for-- this-- for

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.400
like, I know, a year.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.040
And every time we look at
the video of the process,

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.906
we're just so excited about it.

00:37:45.906 --> 00:37:47.260
That's what kind of drive us.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.150
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.220
DOMINIQUE CRENN: So jerky--
jerky is into your memories.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:51.790
Right?

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:52.664
CHRIS BLEIDORN: Yeah.

00:37:52.664 --> 00:37:56.860
I mean, favorite all time snack,
maybe, other than Fruit Rollups.

00:38:00.099 --> 00:38:01.390
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Fruit Rollups?

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.264
Well, maybe we should
do something like that.

00:38:03.264 --> 00:38:04.190
What do you think?

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.710
CHRIS BLEIDORN: We could.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.220
It's not as interesting as--

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.230
DOMINIQUE CRENN: You grew up on jerky.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.343
I grew up on fois gras.

00:38:08.343 --> 00:38:08.968
That's amazing.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:21.520
So memory is also a huge
part of our thinking process.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.250
And I don't know if you know
anything about, Atelier Crenn menu.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.910
I mean, I don't know if anyone
knows about how we do the menu,

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:31.180
but it's-- there is no menu.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.560
There is a poem.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:39.580
And the poem-- I mean, I've been
writing poetry since the age of four.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.859
I studied writing in French, obviously.

00:38:41.859 --> 00:38:43.150
I still have the French accent.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:45.250
I'm from there.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:49.420
And then I think it was-- I don't know.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.410
I think it was in the '90s when
I started to dream in English.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.630
Not sure why.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.340
But I did.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:01.190
And my brain started to change
the way I was writing things.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:04.245
And I kept myself writing
in English instead

00:39:04.245 --> 00:39:06.850
of in French, which is a bit scary.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.700
I don't know if it's scary or not.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.980
CHRIS BLEIDORN: I never heard
of such a thing, actually.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.470
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Transformation.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.967
CHRIS BLEIDORN: That's right.

00:39:18.967 --> 00:39:21.300
DOMINIQUE CRENN: But I think
that happens when, I think,

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.230
when you move to another place.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.360
So I write poetry.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.440
And I write the menu as a poem.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.560
And basically, it changes every season.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:38.900
And each poem tells a story about
that moment and that season.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:44.925
And then every line of the poem
is connected to a dish that we do,

00:39:44.925 --> 00:39:45.425
actually.

00:39:45.425 --> 00:39:48.080
So I would say it's
kind of interpretation

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:55.450
or it's also-- we describe it in a way
that we feel it should be described.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.310
We have a dish called
Walk in the Forest.

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:03.604
And it's a dish about the
memory where a trigger-- I mean,

00:40:03.604 --> 00:40:05.520
I used to walk through
the forest with my dad.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.760
And this is where we used to
pick blackberries and mushrooms.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.810
And that was one of the greatest
moments that I spent with him.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.690
And I wanted to recreate
that feeling with this dish.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:21.570
So when you eat it, it's
just very much the sensation

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.860
of walking through a
forest, which means, for me,

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.396
the forest means life because
when you walk in the forest,

00:40:28.396 --> 00:40:29.520
you have all of the senses.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:36.430
You have the sweetness, the
bitterness, the acidity of it.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:40.070
And I thought that's what
I wanted to do with dish.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.590
So that's one of the dishes that do.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:54.400
What we understood is we are all
different and all unique in our team.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.250
So we come from different backgrounds.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:00.460
And Atelier Crenn is not just
about the [INAUDIBLE] Crenn.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:05.750
It's about the people
that work together.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.290
And so the way that we
create dish and story,

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:13.660
it's about coming together and
kind of getting a sense of a story.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.795
One he created is beef tartare.

00:41:17.795 --> 00:41:20.650
It's a beef and broccoli, I think.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.590
I never-- I mean, that's
not in my-- I never said,

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.490
I used to eat beef and broccoli,
Chinese restaurant, all of the time.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:31.540
So that's where he kind of, like,
let's do a dish that kind of triggers

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.695
those tastes and favors.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.995
And that's--

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:40.786
CHRIS BLEIDORN: You do it in a way
to match the restaurant, though.

00:41:40.786 --> 00:41:41.160
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Yeah.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:41.760
I mean, yes.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.140
Absolutely.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.360
And so that's kind of like,
memories is a very important.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:52.930
And also, when we bring
those dishes to the table,

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:59.950
we also want to trigger
memory to the customer,

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:04.210
for them to have a deeper
sense of themselves.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:09.790
And I think, when we created
a dish, or if I eat that dish,

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.450
it's going to trigger something in me.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:15.720
If that customer or that guest eats
it and it triggers something else,

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.774
I know that we won because
we are in dialogue with them.

00:42:20.774 --> 00:42:21.940
And that's what we're doing.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.023
That's what we want to do.

00:42:23.023 --> 00:42:28.040
We want to make food that also
starts a discussion and a dialogue

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:33.750
with the guests and with all of the
texture and the sensation and, I think,

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:34.880
what food is about.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.600
So that's basically what
we're doing at Atelier.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.210
So do you guys have any questions?

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:42.860
We will have more, but--

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.810
MICHAEL BRENNER: It's what we do.
