00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
&gt;&gt; Again, welcome. We're very honored to have
with us today a noted sociologist, philosopher,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
cultural critic, Slavoj Zizek. Slavoj is a
senior research, right, in the Institute of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.840
Sociology at the University of Lubljana in
Slovenia, a professor in the European Graduate

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.231
School. He has been a visiting professor at
several universities including the University

00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.980
of Chicago, Columbia, Princeton, and many
others. And he's currently the international

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.050
director of Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities
at Birkbeck College in the University of London.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.320
The Wikipedian horde has deemed him an intellectual
outsider and a confrontational maverick. And

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.590
he comes to us today to discuss his recent
book "Violence" a book which challenges us

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.330
to look deeper in to the topic of violence.
To see beyond the ephemeral manifestations

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.790
of violence, gunshot and explosion, the clash
of metal on metal, blood stains, and to discuss

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.840
systemic violence, the violence inherent in
our systems of living our way of life. And

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.190
in a sense our age is an age--of the age of
technological and biological exploration is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.330
an age of philosophical exploration as well.
I know that many of us at Google are familiar

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.840
with this. And to quote Slavoj himself which
I found on the Internet, of course, "The age

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.740
of philosophy is in a sense, again, that we
are confronted more and more often with philosophical

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.530
problems in everyday level. It is not just
that you withdraw from daily life into a world

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.539
of philosophical contemplation; on the contrary,
you cannot find your way around daily life

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.689
itself without answering certain philosophical
questions is unique time when everyone is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.649
in a way are forced to be some kind of philosopher."
So, let's take this opportunity, please, for

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.679
everyday philosophy and welcomes Slavoj Zizek
to Google

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.990
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: I hope this works, yeah. Thanks
very much, I'm really glad of being here,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.520
you know why, because let me begin with a
funny association which came on my mind now.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.240
You know of what from my communist youth,
this scene here now reminds me. And the communism

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.759
when I was young, you'd not only have to work
in factories in Slovenia but you get so called

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.469
hours of ideological education, you know like,
exactly like now, like, during lunch time,

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.220
workers has to sit through some boring short
talk which ruin your lunch about, I don’t

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.980
know, great result of our construction of
socialism and so on, and so on. I feel right

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.630
back in those times, well, sorry for ruining
your lunch. So, in contrast to the kindness

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.460
of the good guy who introduced me, I would
say, please, don’t let me terrorize you

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.730
if your mind is with your computer, go on,
go on. I would feel better about it. What--I

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.730
was thinking about what to do here, of course,
I don’t want to give the resume of a book.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.350
I never was able to be so arrogant, like,
I know some guys. Poet and so on who treat

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.130
themselves as classics, you know, like, they
open their own book, read a paragraph and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.620
say, "Let's now look at what the thinker wanted
to say," now, I will--the proper dialectical

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.480
way to approach this book is, I think, to
do the opposite of the book. To focus not

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:17.180
on violence but on what violence reacts to,
usually on the everyday texture of our lives,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.280
everyday ideology. Now, your first reaction
probably would [INDISTINCT] here but aren’t

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.520
we beyond ideology? I mean, am I an old Marxist
from, you know, like, the species which basically

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.950
died around 1990 who still believe in big
causes and so on. No, I will try to convince

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:46.290
you that ideology is, of course, not in the
sense of big world view vision to impose on

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.930
society, but ideology in the sense of complicated
network of ethical, political, social, whatever

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.900
prejudices, which, even if we are unaware
of them, still determines the way we function.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.220
It's still something which structures our
lives. What is ideology? Maybe some of you

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:14.100
know this but I cannot resist repeating this
story because it works perfectly, namely,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.730
do you remember? You must, my God; it was
endlessly reproduced on Google. That unfortunate

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:30.200
interview of Donald Rumsfeld some five years
ago just before the Gulf War when he wanted

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:38.360
to explain why, where is the danger of Saddam
and he used his famous parallel--he basically,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:46.040
they have a whole theory of knowledge claiming
that there are--you remember, known knowns,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.650
things we know that we know. Then, like, we
know that Saddam is the boss of Iraq. Then

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:01.650
he went on--there are, there are known unknowns.
There are things we know that we don’t know.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.389
Like, for example, I don’t know--I know
there are some cars in front of this building

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.070
but I don’t know how many they are. But
I know that I don’t know this, you know.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.460
Then he went on, there are unknown unknowns.
In the sense of things that we even don’t

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.310
know that we don’t know then. Like, his
ideas was--the known unknown was how many

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:33.660
and where Saddam has his weapons of mass destruction,
like, we don’t know but we know that we

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.460
don’t know. But then his paranoia was what
if there are unknown unknowns, some secret

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.389
weapons that we don’t even know what they
are, yet, they're more radically unknown.

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.520
Now, my claim is that--okay, there goes this
idea, my claim, my joke here is that if you

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.910
have a little bit of a sense for structural
analysis thinking, you’ll see immediately

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.600
that something is missing here, a fourth term,
known knowns, we know what we know. Known

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:09.220
unknowns, we know what we don’t know, or
then, unknown unknowns, the totally other,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.430
like, we don’t even know what we don’t
know. Something is missing the most interesting

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:22.330
category, not the unknown, not the known unknowns,
but the un-unknown knowns, not think we know

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.300
that we don’t know, but think we don’t
know that we know, that’s the unconscious

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.691
[INDISTINCT] ideologically. Although silent
prejudices, which determine how we act, how

00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:42.830
we react, and we, in a way, there are so much
the texture in to which we are embedded, that

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:50.640
we literally don’t even know that we know
them. And I think this was why you were in

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.860
such trouble in Iraq. Not so much that you,
there was some mystery that you didn’t know.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.940
The U.S. Army and administration basically
didn’t know what they already know. All

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.440
the unconscious political military prejudices
as it where which determined their activity,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.979
which is why I don’t know if some of you
know it or not. To give you another example,

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:18.250
I'm sorry of repeating myself; I hope you
are a new public here. The analysis--because

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.550
of which and again it was mocked endlessly
in Google. It brought me some negative thing

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:30.669
but I still think it works perfectly. Or these
unknown knowns are the structure of toilets

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:36.490
in our Western civilization. It's ideology
at its purest. Now, will you say, am I crazy?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:42.449
Where is ideology? Did you notice something,
I simplified the analysis but I know I simplified

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:51.830
but basically it's called cycling [ph]. What
do we get? We get three basic types of toilets.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:58.830
The French one, where, sorry for relative
vulgarity, where the hole is in the back of

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.949
the toilet so that shit falls directly into
the hole and disappears--I mean, not the hole,

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:11.490
I mean, not just the bowl but the hole where
it then, you know, get in. Then we have the

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:18.229
German type where the hole, where the shit
disappears is in front so that the shit is

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:24.120
somehow displayed there. You know Germans
have all this ritual of, I'm not kidding,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.370
around 50 percent of toilets, check it up,
if you go to Germany are still structured

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.820
like this that the shit is displayed there
and they have this old ritual, every morning

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:40.680
you should smell your shit, check it for traces
of, I mean, Erica Yong, in her Fear of Flying

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.700
makes wonderful a comment, she said, she writes,
“A nation which get such toilets, they--no

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.350
wonder, they imagine Auschwitz and all the
horrors.” Okay. Then, you have the Anglo-Saxon,

00:08:53.350 --> 00:09:00.270
American and so on, toilets which are mixed
its--not doesn’t matter where the hole is

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:06.510
because it's all full of water so that the
shit floats freely there. Now, I was always

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:13.140
intrigued by this, I asked my friend’s architects
in one of the other country, "Why this?" And

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:19.260
they try to give me utilitarian answers, like,
Germans said; isn’t it natural to inspect

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:26.029
your shit? French said, if shit smells, let's
get rid of it. Americans and English men said,

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:30.480
let's be practical, it should float in water
so that it doesn’t smell and so on. But

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:37.440
obviously, it's not purely a utilitarian level.
Then I asked myself a simple question, "Where

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.680
did they already hear, this trinity?" Let's
call it a French-German-English-Anglo-Saxon

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:54.380
civilization. Do you know that already 200
years ago, there was around Hegel’s in French

00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:01.130
evolution time. There was this popular idea
among philosophers and so on about so called

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:07.850
European trinity, claiming that the spiritual
backbone or fundamental structure of Europe

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:14.360
is composed of these three nations. Each of
the three stands for a certain political principle

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:22.130
and for a certain sphere of society. Germans
are politically conservative and instead of

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:30.830
society privilege there is--the Germans said,
a nation of poets, thinkers and so on, culture.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:38.290
France is a revolutionary and the preferred
political sphere is politics. Anglo-Saxon

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:43.600
universe is more, how do you call it, liberal
centrist, utilitarian, the political sphere

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.529
is economy. And then I got it. That’s it,
that's the key. French revolutionary, shit

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:55.390
disappears; liquidate it as soon as possible.
You Anglo-Saxon, more pragmatic, float it

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.980
there, let's see how it is, utilitarian approach.
Germans, metaphysical and poets, reflect on

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:05.500
it and so on, you know, conserve it. And then
I spoke with architects and they admitted

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:12.710
it, crazy as it may sound. That’s the only
way to ultimately account for a totally vulgar

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:17.680
object like the concrete structure of a toilet.
You see now my point which is slightly more

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.280
serious--not only a tasteless joke—that
even to account for the most elementary, vulgar

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:31.640
object how it is structured--the goal, I wouldn’t
say worldview but basic attitude towards civilization

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:39.360
and so on, it’s not just a utilitarian object-—this
is what interests me, this type of ideology.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:46.060
Ideology which is, all this set of cultural
and so on prejudices which structure our daily

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.839
lives and you don’t even have to be fully
aware of them, especially today in our so

00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:59.540
called “cynical era” where very interesting
things are happening. How do we deal with

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:05.170
ideology today?--Maybe you know it, it’s
also endlessly in Google—-the wonderful

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:11.250
anecdote about Niels Bhor, you know Copenhagen,
the quantum physics guy. The story is a wonderful

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:17.640
one. The story is that, once a friend visited
him in Demark, in the countryside where he

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:23.490
had a house—for, go there on weekend, whatever--and
the friend, also a scientist saw above the

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:29.170
entrance a horseshoe—-I don’t know how
it is here but in Europe, horse shoe above

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:35.680
the entrance door is a superstitious item
destined to prevent evil spirits to enter

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:42.600
the house-—So, the shocked friend ask him,
“Wait a minute. Are you crazy? Why do you

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.710
have this here, do you believe in it? Aren’t
you a scientist?” Niels Bhor answered him,

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.600
“My God! I’m not crazy, I’m a scientist.
Of course I don’t believe in this thing.”

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.180
Then the friend asked him, “If you don’t
believe in it, why do you have it there?”

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:58.890
Ahh, he gave a wonderful answer--Niels Bhor—he
said, “Of course I don’t believe in it

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.339
but I have it there because I was told that
it works even if you don’t believe in it.”

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:09.140
That’s how ideology functions today, we
are all cynics—-who will believes what and

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:16.840
so on but we somehow rely on it that it will
work even if you don’t believe in it [INDISTINCT].

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.970
We, in this sense, we live in a cynical era,
not cynical in the usual sense, bad people

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:28.709
manipulating, but in a much more refined way.
We practice beliefs without believing in them

00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:36.459
as it were. And this is what fascinates me
in ideology. Especially today, the old image

00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:42.110
of ideology was, you have some explicit beliefs
and then privately you let it know, “Oh,

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:47.110
I’m not crazy as that,” and so on. Today,
it’s the opposite, what was most private

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:52.610
is now public and vice versa-—privately,
we like to play that we are not crazy to believe

00:13:52.610 --> 00:14:00.240
in some stupid ideology we just--what is ideology
today, explicitly? I think some kind of vaguely

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.640
Dalai Lama spiritualized hedonism, no? It’s
no longer, do this, sacrifice yourself—-inspite

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.560
of what Republicans are saying they—-just
react to it, basically ideology today is some

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:20.560
kind of a vague injunction, be truly yourself,
realize your potentials or whatever and so

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:29.360
on and so on. But I claim we believe much
more than we appear to believe. We obey or

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:39.959
whichever way you put it much more than we
appear to do. And this again, is what all

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:48.660
these tension between, let me call it, explicit
beliefs or absence of beliefs and this cobweb

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:55.750
of-—to put it in the terms of your great
philosopher, Donald Rumsfeld—-of the unknown

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.700
knowns, this is the crucial dimension. At
the end—-I hope I would have time, I would

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:05.920
really like to mention briefly even the whole
Sarah Palin phenomenon, I think is--you cannot

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:15.870
understand it without, not toilets, let’s
forget that but--sorry. Okay, let me go a

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.850
little bit further here, did you noticed another
extremely interesting phenomenon about which

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:27.310
I’ve written and which points in the same
direction. What my friend, Austrian philosopher,

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:34.149
Robert Pfaller—-you can Google him to be
tasteless, you know, I will endlessly repeat

00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:40.959
this joke being here. At least on the German
Google, you find him. He proposed a wonderful

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:49.680
category of Interpassivity. The idea is, that
it’s not only that, we like in what we philosophers

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:55.600
call, Coming of Reason, that we like to manipulate
others. So, you see in the back others are

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.680
active for you. Robert Pfaller drew attention
to a much more mysterious phenomenon, opposite

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:10.260
one, of what he calls Interpassivity where
we transpose onto the other our passive reaction,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:15.930
others are passive for us. The most elementary
phenomenon and I love it, this, I think this

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:22.880
is arguably the greatest contribution of American
civilization to world cultural heritage—-Canned

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:29.420
laughter on TV. You know, when this-—just
think about it, it’s a much more mysterious

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:36.310
phenomenon than it may appear. It’s not,
as some wrong Pavlovian psychologist think,

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:41.649
the function of you hearing the laughter there
as part of the soundtrack is not automatically

00:16:41.649 --> 00:16:49.110
to trigger your laughter. No, it works so
that literally the TV set laughs for you-—at

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:55.930
least that’s how it works with me. Really
the same thing as--remember those, I always

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:01.389
like them, in Tibetan Buddhism those praying
wheels or mills and so on where you write

00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:06.990
down the prayer, you turn it around or even
better you let the wind turn it around and

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.980
then you can masturbate, whatever, it doesn’t
matter-—objectively you pray. You pray to—-here

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.550
it’s the same, it laughs for you-—that’s
my experience, you know, in the evening you

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:22.840
arrive home, dead tired, you put on some stupid
show with canned laughter on TV, Cheers, Friends,

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:28.910
whatever and you don’t even laugh—-the
mystery is admitted at the end of the show,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:34.830
you feel relief as if you have laughed, that’s
the mystery, how it works. In my thesis—-back

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:43.059
to Donald Rumsfeld topic—-is that it’s
the same with beliefs, it’s not so much

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:50.900
that we believe, we need as it where another
one to believe for us. From—-this is how

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.790
our ritual functions, for example, take Santa
Clause, I mean, of course nobody believes,

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:01.180
I mean, parents, if you ask parents they said,
“No. We are not crazy. We pretend to believe

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.000
not to disappoint our children,” but I can
guarantee if you ask then the children they

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.711
said, “No. I’m not crazy. We pretend to
believe not to disappoint our parents and

00:18:08.711 --> 00:18:15.700
to get presents and so on...” You got the
point, nobody has to believe only if every

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:23.520
individual actually existing presupposes another
agency to believe then, belief functions—-the

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.179
whole system of believe functions. The first
to use this structure consciously, politically,

00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:34.450
you know, the old Israeli Prime Minister Golda
Meir, who when asked, “Do you believe in

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:39.919
God?” Of course she didn’t, I mean, that’s
the irony. Israel who makes this claim of

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:45.990
the West Bank like, “God gave us this land”
and I like it for that, about the misunderstanding,

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:52.549
is the most atheist country in the world.
According to statistic that I read there,

00:18:52.549 --> 00:19:01.530
between 60 and 70 percent of the Israeli Jews
don’t believe in God. And the irony is that--so,

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.390
Golda Meir was asks this, her answer was,
“No. I don’t believe in God,” No, she

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:10.650
did not, she just answered, “I believe in
Jewish people and Jewish people believe in

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:17.400
God.” But the point is that, there are no
individual Jews who have really to believe

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:24.919
in God. Everybody just has to evoke this specter,
and so, the most terrifying experience is

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:29.960
when you learn not that you don’t believe
but that the other which was in a way the

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.830
guarantor of your belief doesn’t believe.
If you know a little bit of literature, that’s

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:42.020
so shocking. You remember Age of Innocence,
Edith Wharton—-at the end, the guy-—okay,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:50.020
I speak in cinema terms—-Daniel Day Lewis
is told by his son that Winona Ryder, his

00:19:50.020 --> 00:20:00.320
dead wife, knew all the time about his affair
with Michelle Pfeiffer but pretended not to

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:07.950
know. When he learns--everything gets ruined.
That’s I think our much more fundamental

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:15.540
need than directly to believe, to have another
one as protected innocence. So let me go on

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:22.380
a little bit here after we return to ideology,
to explicit ideology—-how do these prejudices

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.730
function, they are something much more complex
than the way they appear. Recently, three

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:32.020
months or two ago, I gave a talk at Harvard,
at the end of the talk we were invited--you

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:37.760
know, this is the most boring part of academic
meetings, where we have an official dinner,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.770
where, you know, people who are really bored
by each other, you have to pretend and so

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:49.480
on—-So, the older professor who was coordinating
dinner, 10 of us said, “Okay. Since, we

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.539
don’t know each other well, please, can
everybody here present him or herself. State

00:20:55.539 --> 00:21:00.750
your name, position, state you work, field
of interest and your sexual orientation.”

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:06.620
Now, this shocked me a little bit. For my
European sensitivity, like my idea was almost,

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:15.450
you know, like what’s--none of your business,
no. But now, I don’t want to play the vulgar

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:25.010
anti-America, American bashing because, you
know, this bar of discretion is less different

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:31.030
in Europe. Immediately, I remember how a friend
of mine visited me the previous summer in

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:39.299
Europe and we went to the Slovene coast where-—Slovenia,
you know, we where already under communism,

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:45.539
sexually, culturally, a very liberal country
so, as in most of Europe in the last 20 years.

00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:50.170
Most of the women were simply with naked breasts,
no bra on the beach, it’s considered totally

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.799
normal nobody even notices it. Here, I’m
told it’s not so normal like I was told

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:59.780
you can even get arrested or what. And typically
that friend of mine leftist, liberal, whatever

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:05.501
you want—-self oppressed, almost harassed,
aggressed, and totally traumatized. So, here

00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:11.980
we have a nice difference and again, I think
that the formula which is closer to me, I

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:18.130
don't think discretion means oppression, the
proper attitude is the one maybe, you know,

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:24.419
the anecdote Gore Vidal, your writer gave
the best formula of discretion, he’s a well

00:22:24.419 --> 00:22:30.920
known bisexual. He was asked in a TV interview
some years ago, “Was your first sexual experience

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:37.350
with a man or with a woman?” You know what
was his answer? I was too polite to ask. That

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:47.120
attitude is for me the proper one. Let me
go on a little bit to show you why I am hated

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:56.370
in some, not only rightist but even more maybe
leftist circles.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:05.960
I think that today when different cultures
are thrown together in what we call globalization,

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:14.100
I think we should break the spell of this
liberal multi-culturalist injunction, “understand

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.299
each other, we should understand more each
other”, and so on. First, it’s impossible

00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:22.700
to fully understand each other because I claim
we don't even understand ourselves like, you

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.820
know, it’s not that we are separate entities
who fully know what we are and then we should

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:33.130
open, no liberals always slide this endless
task, “Oh, there is still something that

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.830
eludes me in that culture,” and so on. I
think quite the opposite. I don't want to

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:43.390
understand all other stupid cultures; I can
be stupid for them. I think we need precisely

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:52.000
a code of discretion. We need a code which
tells us how to politely, politely, sincerely

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.960
politely ignore each other. I don't want--if
I live in a building here in a big condominium

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.830
where for example, where, you know, all races
are there, I don't want to understand everybody.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:10.530
I want to be treated nicely in a non racist
way by others and I want to treat others like

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:18.640
that. I think this sense of proper distance
is very important. And I don't think we miss--now

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:25.990
I go even a step further. I don't think we
miss anything deep in this way. Let's say

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:33.280
do I really understand you? Well, first as
a psychoanalyst a counter question would be,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:39.980
“But do you realty understand yourselves?”
I claim that another post-modern multicultural

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:47.530
myth is that we are the stories we are telling
ourselves about ourselves. That's the moment

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:55.289
of truth which is by the great liberal motto
is articulated among others by the philosopher

00:24:55.289 --> 00:25:04.750
Richard Rorty. The basic freedom is the freedom
to tell your story, your side of your story.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.650
The best expression of this attitude is the
well known motto which sounds very deep. I

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:16.460
hate it, I think it’s wrong. The motto of
tolerance which is an enemy is somebody whose

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:22.250
story we didn't yet hear. It sound so deep,
you know like, if you are just a foreigner

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:27.870
for me, I see you as evil, impenetrable enemy,
then I hear all your boring details which

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:33.669
I don't care about, your dreams, your fears
and all of a sudden I see, “Oh, you are

00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:38.340
a human person like me,” and so on and so
on. This is getting as boring as--and this

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:43.919
is ideology at its purest as Batman and all
these movies, did you notice how in the last

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:50.730
installments of this heroic sagas, Batman,
Superman, Spiderman, what everybody emphasizes

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:58.210
is how they are no longer flat cartoon heroes.
We see also the anxieties, fears of the--as

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:04.179
if this makes them somehow deeper these films.
No, this is ideology at the purest, why? Now,

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:09.110
it sounds very nice, this, and even in Europe
we can be worse in political correctness than

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:15.559
you, we practice a so called living libraries
maybe it’s going--that is to say in some

00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:23.110
countries I know about Iceland, and United
Kingdom where some local communities do again

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:30.720
this living libraries which means the authorities
pay members of sexual religious race minorities,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:37.870
just to visit the majority families, spend
the evening with them and tell them about

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.691
their lives, their fears and so on. The idea
is precisely this one, when you get to know

00:26:41.691 --> 00:26:47.651
a guy, his inner life, you no longer can,
and he no longer could be your enemy. Of course

00:26:47.651 --> 00:26:52.711
at a certain level, this works and I’m fully
for it. But there is a limit, the limit is,

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:58.520
let’s just do something. Let’s replace
this generality with a concrete name. Would

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.130
you al say, “Oh my God, Hitler was our enemy
because we were not ready to hear his side

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:10.110
of the story or whatever”. No, Hitler really,
and others, really was an enemy. And he was

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:16.270
telling him a story about himself, and that
story was a lie. And that's my point. That's

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:23.510
a very interesting and tragic, difficult to
accept insight of psychoanalysis. It’s basically,

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:31.990
what I ironically refer to as the X files
insight. Truth is out there, truth is not

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:37.150
in your story, in what you are telling yourself
about yourself. What we are telling yourself

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:43.049
about yourself is basically a lie that you
construct in order to cope with usually some

00:27:43.049 --> 00:27:47.830
horrible dimension, and so on, and so on.
It’s wonderful to look at all these worst

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:54.380
nations, worst in the sense of maybe in an
unjust way. Identify it with horrible crimes

00:27:54.380 --> 00:28:01.890
and to look what stories they were telling
ourselves to justify their position, attitude,

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:08.980
because, again a very radical conclusion.
Let me give you two extreme examples here,

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:14.860
one, so that I will be balanced, one from
Europe, one from the Far East. Europe, if

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:20.309
there is a book that you should read I think;
it’s a very interesting book. Shattering,

00:28:20.309 --> 00:28:27.100
its—Aldous Huxley, yes, the guy of The Brave
New World, who wrote a book called Eminence

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:32.610
Grise, The Grey Eminence. It’s a biography
of a guy, a priest called Pere Joseph; father

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:40.909
Joseph, who was basically the State Department
foreign ministry guy of Cardinal Richelieu

00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:48.490
during the 30 years war in Europe. Now, this
guy in his politics was a monster, the worst

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:55.320
you can imagine. He saved France by ruining
Europe, in what sense? In this 30 years war

00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:03.370
between Protestant and Catholics, he concluded
a pact with. Protestant Sweden against Catholic

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:10.580
Hapsburg Austria to prevent unification of
Germany. Ruthless, torturing, poisoning, whatever

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.880
you want. So, even if we play this stupid
game of who was ultimately responsible for

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:22.960
the rise of Hitler? This guy is maybe the
best candidate because we all know that what

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:31.700
laid the foundation for Marxism, the ultimate
cause was the so called delay of Germany in

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:38.490
becoming a united nation state. And this delay
was decided again, at the end of the 30 years

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:45.289
war so, a bad guy. Now, what intrigued Huxley
is that every evening after finishing his

00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:52.179
dirty drop of poisoning, plotting and so on
this same guy Pere Joseph wrote wonderful

00:29:52.179 --> 00:30:01.419
mystical meditations. He had regular correspondents
with some feminine convent and exchange mystical

00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:08.730
notes with sisters there. The mystery is that,
no way to avoid the conclusion this is gold,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:13.520
authentic stuff. You know, you cannot dismiss
it as, “Oh, the guy was cheating and so

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.710
on and so on,” sorry, it’s the level of
who would be the top of guys. Saint Theresa,

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:23.770
John of the Cross. It’s the real thing.
So, that's what bothered so terribly Huxley.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:30.570
How is it possible to have both in the same
person, a ruthless, manipulator and undoubtedly

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:38.650
authentic, mystic with the deepest imaginable
spiritual experience. Huxley’s answer was

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:42.930
to blame Christianity in the sense of there
is something in our Christian fixation on

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:47.840
the way of the cross, Christ suffering which
opens up a door for this kind of political

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.900
manipulation, so he turned towards the east.
“Oh, is there any better there?” My favorite

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:59.820
book on that topic, I advise you to read it.
Brian Victoria, himself that Buddhist priest,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:10.059
Zen At War. This guy did something very simple,
he simply made a research into how did the

00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:18.840
Japanese Zen community relate to the Japanese
military expansion and invasion of China and

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:24.110
all that stuff in the late, throughout the
30’s and early 40’s. And the discovery

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:30.570
was shocking, except, with the exception of
literally three, four, five decedents. They

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:38.679
not only, fully supported it, they even provided
justification for it. The true color is to

00:31:38.679 --> 00:31:44.140
read the works from that time of a guy who
some of you and I see there are who are like

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:49.250
me and unfortunately old enough to be around.
Who was very popular here in the hippy time,

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:56.640
60’s early 70’s, D. T. Daisetsu Teitaro
Suzuki. You know, the big model of introducing

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.250
Buddhist tradition here. Were in the 30’s
he was writing slightly different texts. For

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:06.399
example, he wrote a text where he celebrated
Chinese, Japanese Invasion of China as he

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:11.670
put it the work of love and the Chinese people
should learn that the spark which is killing

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:20.429
them is a spirit of love but what's more important
is that the same Suzuki provided a wonderful

00:32:20.429 --> 00:32:29.159
argumentation on how an ordinary soldier should
train himself psychologically to be able to

00:32:29.159 --> 00:32:34.289
kill without having traumas. And he gives
a wonderful description of how this Buddhist

00:32:34.289 --> 00:32:39.860
attitude of overcoming your false self helps
you. He said, “When you are still identified

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.659
with your false self and think you are the
substantial agent, then of course it’s traumatic.”

00:32:44.659 --> 00:32:51.160
The only way to put it is I have a sword and
I’d stuck it into you. But he says, if you

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.630
go through, Buddhist enlightenment, then the
whole perspective changes.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:33:01.610
You are just an observer. You see your sword
moving in the air and you see the enemy somehow

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:08.460
getting stuck on it and so on. It's depersonalized.
He even went so far, Suzuki, I should say

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:14.659
that for ordinary people who don’t have
time to do meditation--don't--the military

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:20.909
discipline is the easiest way to achieve enlightenment
in the sense of overcoming your false self.

00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:27.770
He says, when you learn that--when the officer
says, "Shoot," you shoot without a moment’s

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:32.380
reflection, you are above your false self,
and so on, and son on. Now, what's the conclusion

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.710
here? Let me be very clear--again, to avoid
the misunderstanding. I'm not saying, "Oh,

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:42.990
you see all this Japanese Buddhist stuff is
just a mask of militarism." No, the truly

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:49.950
difficult thing is to accept that, like Pere
Joseph, that Suzuki's meditations are absolutely

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:56.309
authentic. It's the real gem, the real stuff,
but this doesn’t prevent you from legitimizing

00:33:56.309 --> 00:34:03.820
with it or doing quite horrible things, and
so on, and so on. So, you see my point here?

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:11.349
My point is that our truth is not the inner
life, mystical stories we are telling or whatever.

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:17.969
I'm even tempted to claim in a more radical
psychoanalytic way that what we deal is our

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:23.559
inner life, stories we are telling ourselves,
the narrative we construct to face what we

00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:30.399
are doing is always a zero level ideology,
a kind of a protective screen. So now, let

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:37.249
me go a step further. All these rules of discretion,
unwritten rules, how do they function? Here,

00:34:37.249 --> 00:34:43.389
we are in for some surprises considering,
for example, censorship. Let me take the genre

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:50.579
which you will maybe agree, it's the most
popular I think--or your only competition,

00:34:50.579 --> 00:34:57.019
more people than Google, more people probably
look for hard core porn. That's your only

00:34:57.019 --> 00:35:02.700
competitor. So, if you have the misfortune
of looking at some of the hardcore porno,

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:08.410
but especially full-featured fillers. Did
you--where is censorship there? You will say,

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:13.089
"But there is no censorship,” my god, you
can see everything. What can be more uncensored

00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:19.050
that's going to--there is nowhere. If you
get a full feature one hour, one hour and

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:24.789
a half of hard core film, of course, you cannot
show just sex, there must be a minimal narrative

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:32.010
which somehow justifies it narratively, I
mean, you know. And did you notice how absolutely

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:38.920
ridiculously stupid and self-mocking these
narratives always are? Like, I remember how

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.969
it's embarrassing even now for me to think.
When I was young, you know, the usual story.

00:35:42.969 --> 00:35:47.859
Housewife is alone at home, a plumber comes,
fixes the hole in the kitchen and then the

00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:51.849
housewife said, "But I have another hole to
fix. Can you--or maybe..." I mean, you are

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:59.390
embarrassed. I claim this is not that they're
so stupid. There is a precise function of

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:06.880
censorship here, which is you cannot have
it both ways. You can see it all. But the

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.869
price you pay is to sabotage emotional involvement
in the sense of having an engaging story,

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:18.009
and so on, and so on. No wonder that the French
cinema director, Kathrin Brea Romans [ph],

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:25.480
who tries to do precisely this both; emotionally
engaging serious drama, plus, full sex. It

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.519
cannot somehow really penetrate the big market.
Now, you're telling me--as many critics made

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:34.259
fun of me. They told me, "Man, but you are
crazy. Where do you live? This kind of plumber

00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:39.319
or housewives stories they are 40 years old."
And I ask him, "Okay, what's in today?" And

00:36:39.319 --> 00:36:45.260
what they told me I think it's even worse.
It's so-called Gonzo sex, which is wrong.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:50.700
It's like embedded journalism. It's that the
camera is part of the action in the sense

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:55.700
that they don't even pretend that it's a story.
They make fun of it. You know, in Gonzo sex,

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.329
you see the camera man, the camera man tells
to be actors, move like that. A woman, who

00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:06.109
is being screwed smiles to the camera. Am
I okay like this? They make fun. I think this

00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:12.529
is the high point of censorship. They're afraid
of even a minimum of narrative. At this level,

00:37:12.529 --> 00:37:20.499
we find rules of--we find rules of discretion
and all that. Okay. So then, time is up--well,

00:37:20.499 --> 00:37:25.099
unfortunately, there are many other things,
nonetheless. What's the basic constellation

00:37:25.099 --> 00:37:31.180
that I want to develop here? That whenever
we are dealing with, if you give me another

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:37.559
five to ten minutes, what always fascinated
me in ideology is the following thing; it's

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:45.049
this tension which is always here between
what is explicitly said and what is understood.

00:37:45.049 --> 00:37:52.190
You are supposed to know it, but it's prohibited
to publicly state it. This is the mystery

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:58.709
of customs and it's crucial for out social
co-existence, and it's here that ideology

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:03.420
inscribes itself. What do I mean by this?
Did you notice that whenever you want to penetrate

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:10.349
a certain social circle, you have to know
the rules from nation to company like Google

00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:15.200
to at class or whatever. But did you notice
that there is always something mysterious

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.789
with the rules. It's not enough to know the
rules. You must know as it were meta-rules

00:38:20.789 --> 00:38:27.109
which tells you how to deal with the rules.
That is to say, isn't it that always I claim?

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:36.800
There are rules which prohibit you something,
but if you follow them, you are an idiot.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.479
Between the lines, they call you to, like,
do it silently, and so on and so on. Like,

00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:47.069
I didn't claim, I don’t know. In my own
country, ex-socialist, I'm not saying that

00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:52.339
you are any better, but it was more open there.
And in all communist systems, like, or--what

00:38:52.339 --> 00:38:59.059
you call it, corruption and all that was like
that. Corruption was prohibited officially,

00:38:59.059 --> 00:39:04.259
which meant you just had to know and it was
exactly codified, you know. For example, I

00:39:04.259 --> 00:39:10.470
remember, for a doctor, you have a quick examinations
so that you didn't have to wait two, three

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:17.799
months so much at that point make the prices
for bribery in German marks. It was 200 marks

00:39:17.799 --> 00:39:22.829
and so on. But--again--so, we have--especially
sexual prohibition such as like this. No,

00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:29.180
don't do it means--if you are a man, do it
but discreetly, and so on. So, we have prohibitions

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:36.809
which are effectively functions as something
to be violated, and even much more interesting.

00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:45.539
This is my favorite point. We have statements
which allow you, even solicit you to use a

00:39:45.539 --> 00:39:52.819
freedom, to do--they give you freedom on condition
that you don't choose it. They are much more

00:39:52.819 --> 00:39:59.200
around than between. For example, I remember,
when I was in Japan, French told me that,

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:05.259
usually, in their work contracts, you have
guaranteed 40 days per year holiday. But they

00:40:05.259 --> 00:40:11.980
told me it's considered very impolite. You
are not basically allowed to use more than

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.109
20 days. Then I ask him, then why don't you
write 20 days? They told me--and they were

00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:20.979
quite justified. You are a total idiot. You
don't understand it. And they were right.

00:40:20.979 --> 00:40:26.400
In what sense? Because in this way, by giving
you an offer which then is supposed to be

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:34.259
rejected. Like, I give you 40 on condition
that you use only 20. This is the basic link.

00:40:34.259 --> 00:40:39.589
In this way, a link is created between people.
Through this politeness and debt, don't we

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:43.999
have many daily rituals like this? Like, for
example, I don’t know how it is with you,

00:40:43.999 --> 00:40:48.539
but in my country, let's say--which is not
true, "I am rich. One of you is poor. I invite

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:53.369
you to lunch." Isn't it clear that I will
pay? But even in this country I think, you

00:40:53.369 --> 00:40:58.390
have this ritual that when the bill arise,
you have to insist just a little bit, not

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:03.760
too match that I will pay, I will pay. And
we both know it's a fake. But it's in a way

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:10.390
a sincere fake or I don't know, with apologies
with my--maybe you know it. You can Google

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:15.680
her, she is my theoretical enemy, personally
good friend, Judith Butler, Gender Travel

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.920
and so on. Once I behaved very rudely towards
her, in a friendly way but I use vulgar words.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:27.029
Like, I--I wanted to ask her if a friend of
her is also a lesbian like her and I put it

00:41:27.029 --> 00:41:31.180
and I'm ashamed. I said something like, "Is
she also a degenerate stinking bitch like

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:37.430
you?" Okay, it wasn't nice. So, I wonder why
she felt hurt. So, afterwards, I called her

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:40.839
by the phone and told her, "Listen, Judie,
my god, I don’t know what it was. It's my

00:41:40.839 --> 00:41:46.839
extremely bad taste. I really apologize."
She was very nice. And she told me, "Listen,

00:41:46.839 --> 00:41:53.609
Slavoj, I know you. No problem. We are friends.
Let's be serious. No apology is needed." But

00:41:53.609 --> 00:42:00.019
did you get the paradox of this situation?
She was able to say, "No apology is needed,"

00:42:00.019 --> 00:42:07.359
only after I did apologize. That's the normal
logic. If I were not to apologize, she would

00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:12.650
have been offended. And I would have been
probably a little bit offended if she were

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:18.099
to say, "Good, I deserve the apology. Don't
do this again." You see the paradox? I made

00:42:18.099 --> 00:42:24.740
an offer of apology; she said it's not necessary.
But in this way, that's how it functions normally.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:33.130
This level of ideology fascinated me. This--how
should I put it? It's not only to put it in

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:39.559
ultimate terms. It's not only that something
is prohibited. It's that prohibition itself

00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:46.199
is prohibited to stay--to be stated publicly.
That is the mystery why so many of my books

00:42:46.199 --> 00:42:51.670
I deal extensionally with Stalinism. Stalinism
is a very mysterious phenomenon. On the one

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:57.049
hand, it's very a ruthless regime killing
millions. On the other hand, it's extremely

00:42:57.049 --> 00:43:01.569
sensitive to maintaining appearances. What
do you mean by this? Let's imagine a crazy

00:43:01.569 --> 00:43:09.400
scene. My dream, at least--we are Moscow 37,
Central Committee, I'm Stalin. I give a speech,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.400
you applause, we know that's life. Okay. Then,
one of you does a crazy thing. Stands up and

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.720
says, "Comrade Stalin, I don’t agree with
you. I think you are totally wrong, blah,

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.589
blah, blah.” Okay. We know. No mystery here.
If you would be the guy, the next day the

00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:27.799
big question will be who has seen you last
alive? Okay. But let's imagine something else

00:43:27.799 --> 00:43:31.039
that after--sorry to personalize. If there's
somebody has to be blamed, that's life. After

00:43:31.039 --> 00:43:36.569
you stand up and tell to him, "Are you crazy?
We don't talk to Comrade Stalin like this

00:43:36.569 --> 00:43:40.559
in our country. We don't attack him," and
so on. Like, this is--you will even have to

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:43.529
disappear even earlier. Sorry, don't take
it personally. That's life. Now, what I mean

00:43:43.529 --> 00:43:50.599
to say, you know, it wasn't only prohibited
to criticize Stalin. It was even more prohibited

00:43:50.599 --> 00:43:57.719
to announce this prohibition publicly. It
was a prohibition which worked only on condition

00:43:57.719 --> 00:44:06.420
that it's not publicly proclaimed or whatever.
Now, slowly to draw to the end--if you allow

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.670
me, at least, I talk too much; at least, you
will learn why my friends called me Fidel,

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:15.719
not for my communist leanings, but, you know,
like, Fidel Castro, you know, comrades like

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:23.279
ten minutes and seven hours. It's not my--okay,
did you see a good, naive, but I like naively.

00:44:23.279 --> 00:44:28.650
Hollywood Film; The Best of the Hollywood
Left, They Live, by John Carpenter from 1988

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:34.780
with that wonderful totally naive paranoiac
idea, it's a story of an ordinary guy who

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:41.440
stumbles upon some mysterious sunglasses and
when he puts them on, what he sees is what?

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:47.539
What he sees is, as it were the true ideological
message. Like, the guy walks along the street,

00:44:47.539 --> 00:44:51.279
sees a big publicity poster, “Visit Kavai
[ph], you’ll have the holiday of your lifetime,

00:44:51.279 --> 00:44:57.170
blah, blah, honeymoon.” Then, he puts the
glasses on the wonderful colored picture,

00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:03.249
disappears, all he sees is the order; reproduce,
obey, enjoy, don't think, consume or something

00:45:03.249 --> 00:45:07.819
like this. Like, almost a Marxist dream, you
know, the glasses which tell you directly

00:45:07.819 --> 00:45:15.739
the social order. What's--I think that what
is--maybe even more interesting, the dysfunctioning

00:45:15.739 --> 00:45:24.170
which is actual today, because today as we
all know, we are addressed not only by publicity

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:31.540
but even by ideology at the level of not do
your duty but enjoy, have a full spiritual

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:36.420
life and so on, and so on. You must have noticed
this how--to put it in very simple terms,

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:42.519
there were three big stages of publicity.
The original one is--let's call it, naively

00:45:42.519 --> 00:45:47.609
utilitarian publicity. You are solicited to
buy something because you need it and because

00:45:47.609 --> 00:45:52.200
of its quality. It's like you need a Land
Rover. Okay, publicity says it's the best

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:58.589
car, it's the strongest, greatest space; it
doesn't spend a lot of gasoline, whatever.

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:03.719
Then, we get this more consumerist publicity
which is keeping up with the Jones' status

00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:11.789
symbol. There they refer to what status we
give to you owning a Land Rover. It's not--you

00:46:11.789 --> 00:46:19.420
don't by because you really need it, you buy
to signal your social status. But that’s

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:25.309
not all, I claim today precisely after 68,
we have different mode of publicity which

00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:34.989
is neither utilitarian, these are good qualities,
nor symbolic status but this typical “me”

00:46:34.989 --> 00:46:43.460
generation. They refer to your--the--to yourself,
to your potentials. The idea is buy Land Rover

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:48.680
and you will realize your potentials, you
will feel free, you will feel authentic and

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:53.680
so on. It's--as we all know, the experience.
And unfortunately, although, I'm very much

00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:03.209
for green topic, unfortunately, I claim that
even, that even with organic food and so on,

00:47:03.209 --> 00:47:08.880
let's be frank, it's mostly dead. Why do you
buy those rotten two times more expensive

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:14.650
so called organic apples than the normal chemically
produced perfectly red or whatever apples.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:21.920
I don't think you really believe that it's
so much better for your health. I also don't

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.730
think that it's a big, like, you don't boast
around, you see I have these staples. I think

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.969
basically it's to make you feel good, you
know, and not just a stupid consumer or if

00:47:30.969 --> 00:47:36.799
it's endangered, I do something, I'm more
authentic, and so on, and so on. So, then,

00:47:36.799 --> 00:47:44.160
in these conditions the ideological injunction
is hidden, but often we have the opposite.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.079
And this--I'm sorry, I don't have time. I
will conclude. Don't be afraid. Who is the

00:47:47.079 --> 00:47:52.539
boss? I don't know him. Three minutes. We
have the opposite where what you see is the

00:47:52.539 --> 00:48:01.709
explicit order, and then what you--what you
are able to see if you were to put these glasses

00:48:01.709 --> 00:48:08.109
on is as it were the bribery, like, what the
ideological text offers you between the lines,

00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:15.309
the obscene enjoyment and so on. For example,
let's imagine Nazi Germany, you look at it

00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:20.160
without glasses, the message is; sacrifice
yourself for your country, enough of decadence,

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:26.579
of promiscuity, of Jewish immorality, do something
for your country, or use your terms, my country

00:48:26.579 --> 00:48:31.420
first and all that stuff. What do you get
when you put the glasses on? It says, "Do

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.789
this, pretend to do this and we can have some
fun. We can beat the Jews. We can blah, blah,

00:48:36.789 --> 00:48:42.029
blah," you know, all the dirty obscene sights.
Wouldn't it be the same, let's say in the--in

00:48:42.029 --> 00:48:48.450
some nice small--nice, ironically, of course--town
in the American South, in the 20 surveys,

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:54.279
the official message is Christian values and
so on, our country. Then, you put the glasses

00:48:54.279 --> 00:48:59.209
on and you see, "Do this and we in Ku Klux
Klan, you know, on weekend evening we can

00:48:59.209 --> 00:49:04.420
have some fun, raping some black girls, lynching
some guys and so on and so on." That's what

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:11.140
always fascinated me. How beneath the official
message of sacrifice, duty for your nation

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.859
or whatever, ideology always offers you, how
should I put it, some bribery in this sense,

00:49:16.859 --> 00:49:21.999
some obscene--actually, I don't have time
to go into how this affects today's nationalism,

00:49:21.999 --> 00:49:27.999
since I do have to slowly come to the end.
Now, I would also say that another procedure

00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:37.799
of these two levels is--let me be frank, what
were to happen if upon seeing this on TV advertisement

00:49:37.799 --> 00:49:43.589
or in a newspaper, an ad saying, you know,
this disgusting manipulation like in Starbucks

00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:49.969
coffee, you know, like, you see a child star
with wasted lips and then this message of,

00:49:49.969 --> 00:49:54.509
are you aware with the cup of one cappuccino--with
the price of cappuccino or whatever, you can

00:49:54.509 --> 00:50:00.189
save this kid's life, and so on, and so on.
What's the message if you put the glasses

00:50:00.189 --> 00:50:05.030
on? If you asked me something like, don't
think, don't politicized, forget about the

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:11.900
true causes of their poverty, contribute a
little bit money and you can buy your consciousness.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:17.520
I think, the reason we do it is to make us
feel good. You know, we know people are starving

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:24.680
there but F three points off, I did my duty.
I send my $5 per month there, I can live--so

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:31.400
basically, I think, we don't pay really to
help them, we pay to feel well and especially

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:38.829
to keep them at a distance there. A lot can
be said here even about charity; why is charity

00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:46.789
such a big thing today. But let me conclude
now very, very briefly with Sarah Palin and

00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:52.122
generally, what I can say as a naive external
observer, you know, like Montesquieu, who,

00:50:52.122 --> 00:50:57.910
in order to analyze France wrote his famous
Persian letters, no? I know--okay, not an

00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:05.009
envoy from Armadinajab, but let's say Persian
view upon United States. A couple of things,

00:51:05.009 --> 00:51:10.931
I think that it's crucial, not in any kind
of deep psychological analysis. I think it's

00:51:10.931 --> 00:51:17.531
already in the message. What is the true message
of a republican country that's--partly, that's

00:51:17.531 --> 00:51:25.509
how I really--of message to their voters,
this change, change, change. Then, of course,

00:51:25.509 --> 00:51:30.180
it's easy to say what Obama and his camp are
repeating all the time. What change? Let's

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:35.180
look at your politics. If you are basically
saying is less taxes, less state power against

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:40.230
Washington, stronger foreign policy and so
on and so on. But wait a minute, the Republican

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:44.009
Party is saying this for the last 20 years.
So, where is the change? But I think that's

00:51:44.009 --> 00:51:49.780
the message is, the message is, you know,
that French proverb [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:56.089
the message is let's do some changes which
will guarantee that things basically stay

00:51:56.089 --> 00:52:01.829
the same or how should I put it, or another
much more ominous duality that I think. You

00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:07.420
know, they play Republicans on this populace
motif. Look, Sarah Palin, ordinary girl from

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:14.569
there, I mean, this giving voice to the rage
of the ordinary people. We don't know what

00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:20.500
goes on. Washington corrupted, and so on,
and so on just, the message is what, it's--I

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:26.559
think it's a much more refined message between
the lines. The true message would be to put

00:52:26.559 --> 00:52:32.729
it in complicated terms. I think something
like that. You are furious. We are also. But

00:52:32.729 --> 00:52:39.640
we all know very well that, I mean, you cannot
run a country with this populace, with less

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:47.719
money here, more there. The message is I think,
we guarantee to you that, how should I put

00:52:47.719 --> 00:52:55.079
it, let's pretend that we guarantee that discreetly
we will keep our experts who will do it and

00:52:55.079 --> 00:53:02.299
so on. They're basically--the message is I
think we are playing a game here. We will

00:53:02.299 --> 00:53:08.430
have backroom boys who will know how to do
it. And it's the same as we'd, for example,

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:14.529
you know, when people tell me Bush, I claim,
okay, Karl Rove impresses me, this backroom

00:53:14.529 --> 00:53:21.130
boys who do the manipulation. So, my question
to McCain would have been, "Okay. I don't

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:24.180
care if you are sincere or not. Just tell
me who is your Karl Rove or how should I put

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:29.709
it, no? Who will be the backroom boys who
will be doing the job?" Another thing where

00:53:29.709 --> 00:53:35.680
Democrats were failing. So, again, my point
is that we shouldn't be naive to get the Republican

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.939
message and maybe with Democratic, it's similar.
I'm not entering to go there. To get the Republican

00:53:40.939 --> 00:53:46.199
message, you should definitely not take it
literally, I’m not engaged here in any dark

00:53:46.199 --> 00:53:52.759
plot like what dark--no, it's in the message
itself that is it’s redoubled by another

00:53:52.759 --> 00:53:58.119
much more pragmatic message, and so on, and
so on. Okay, I'm not going to details now.

00:53:58.119 --> 00:54:04.359
Just another thing where I think Republicans
succeeded. Did you notice that Sarah Palin,

00:54:04.359 --> 00:54:10.239
there is something new about her from what
I can judge? When until now we get feminine

00:54:10.239 --> 00:54:17.680
women politicians who really made it, they--I'm
now using--not using the terms in a precise

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:23.220
way but very vaguely, metaphorically. They
were phallic women. They try to imitate and

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:29.410
be stronger than men. You know, like, Indira
Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, and so on. Here

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:38.469
we have something, I think, maybe new. Here
we have a woman who can be sarcastic, aggressive,

00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:43.299
even, if I may use this horrible term which
is not quite appropriate in the strict sacramentic

00:54:43.299 --> 00:54:53.289
[ph] sense, maybe even castrating, castrating
in the sense of revealing your fake, your

00:54:53.289 --> 00:55:02.019
impotence without in anyway renouncing femininity.
Sarah Palin does not play the game of, as

00:55:02.019 --> 00:55:08.979
a woman I am more men than men. No, see, even
in a magical way, unites three dimensions

00:55:08.979 --> 00:55:16.790
of femininity. What's her image; a, mother;
b, teacher? It's clear with this glasses and

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:23.479
hair. And she is the obvious sex object because
that's the dream, you know, prim teacher and

00:55:23.479 --> 00:55:29.019
so on, but wait a minute, after she indeed
move--puts the glasses off and unwraps her

00:55:29.019 --> 00:55:36.849
hair and so on. So, she combines this in a
masterful way with this sarcastic assertiveness.

00:55:36.849 --> 00:55:42.480
Like, I think, it was really masterful the
way it functioned, not at the level of argument

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:48.449
but as a discursive strategy that making fun
of community organizer and so on, and so on.

00:55:48.449 --> 00:55:57.829
It was feminine sarcasm, feminine making fun
at masculine phallic authority at its best.

00:55:57.829 --> 00:56:05.200
And I don't think Democrats had found a way
how truly to answer this because--okay, now,

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:10.461
this is cheap psychology, I know. But things,
unfortunately, function in this level. It

00:56:10.461 --> 00:56:19.059
brings, I think, they gently, softly evoke
something which I'm afraid to say publicly,

00:56:19.059 --> 00:56:25.929
but it's clear. The way Barack Obama is skinny
and big ears and so on, there is something

00:56:25.929 --> 00:56:32.829
of a slightly emaciated weak guy in him, and
I think all this is subtly referring to death.

00:56:32.829 --> 00:56:38.429
But again, this is a problem for feminists,
I claim today. How--this is the sad thing

00:56:38.429 --> 00:56:43.959
because the Democratic, like, is so much caught
in this politically correct feminism, and

00:56:43.959 --> 00:56:48.949
so on, and so on, they didn’t even notice
that what they were dreaming of, to have a

00:56:48.949 --> 00:56:56.469
woman who wants power, but not by playing
a weak, not by renouncing her femininity but

00:56:56.469 --> 00:57:05.469
by violently asserting it, that if were Republicans
beat Democrats at their own terrain that it’s

00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:11.500
almost--it's a very interesting paradox. And,
you know, it would be wonderful to go into

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:17.499
this logic of how there are certain things
which the left should have done, but only

00:57:17.499 --> 00:57:22.439
a conservative can do it starting with, you
know, only Nixon could have recognized China

00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:28.799
and so on, all that, all that stuff. So, again,
of course, these all is fake, fake, in the

00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:34.099
sense that, no, I don't believe she really
is all that. Like yesterday, I also saw her

00:57:34.099 --> 00:57:39.089
interview when she was talking about that
war with Russia problem. And there, you could

00:57:39.089 --> 00:57:44.170
have seen for a brief moment--I mean, the
girl doesn’t know what she's talking about,

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:52.549
but it doesn’t matter. We should not underestimate
this--again, this ideology. You know, this

00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:59.730
is where maybe Democrats are a little bit
too naïve when they repeat this mantra. Let's

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:07.959
talk about real causes and real issues, and
so on, and so on. So, you should see--not--again,

00:58:07.959 --> 00:58:14.710
my point is not a cheap psychoanalysis in
the sense of let’s look into some deep Oedipal

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:22.160
complex. But just--let's look into the message
which is the old McLuhan [ph] phrase, which

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:33.029
is embodied in the--embodied in the annunciation,
in the statement itself. You never say only

00:58:33.029 --> 00:58:39.559
what you say. The mystery is that what you
say, the way you say it, the style and so

00:58:39.559 --> 00:58:44.709
on can give a different message, can undermine
that message and so on. That's for example

00:58:44.709 --> 00:58:50.299
for me, the problem with so-called religious
fundamentalists. Not that they are too fundamentalists,

00:58:50.299 --> 00:58:55.039
but they are fake; they’re not fundamentalists
at all, my most beloved one for example, beloved

00:58:55.039 --> 00:59:00.690
in the sense of when I see him. Remember the
good old Jimmy Swaggart, the Southern cause.

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:06.509
I had the misfortune of seeing one of his
shows. My god, the official guy's message

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:12.390
is, you know, Christianity, repent for your
sins against ego, hedonism, but his show is

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:19.119
one big ego-trip. The way he delivers his
messages undermines the message. But he doesn't

00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:23.810
necessarily undermine you, it can also sustain
you. I was too long, I know. Thanks very much

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:29.039
for your patience. I'm just sad we don't have
more time. Thanks very much. Is this a limit,

00:59:29.039 --> 00:59:31.619
do we still have time for democracy or no
democracy?

00:59:31.619 --> 00:59:32.619
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: Okay.

00:59:32.619 --> 00:59:37.949
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have the good fortune of having
the room for the next extra half hours, so

00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:39.960
I think we can take two or three question.
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: Okay.

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:45.329
&gt;&gt; Please use the mics for the question.
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: I'm sorry.

00:59:45.329 --> 01:00:01.150
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming today and speaking to
us. I have a question. I guess, from my perspective,

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:15.509
I grow up in America. I went through the public
school system in America. And I really didn’t

01:00:15.509 --> 01:00:21.969
get any background or even introduction to
philosophy until I went to college. And I

01:00:21.969 --> 01:00:23.589
don't know if it's similar in Europe, but
I'm just kind of curious of why you think

01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:25.430
there are certain subjects that are stressed
more to younger individuals as they're going

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:26.430
up. And, you know, something like philosophy
that seems very important to me, and what

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:29.730
do you think if anything can be done about
that?

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:34.690
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: Oh, my god. This is a big question
because my first reaction is that you know

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:39.749
that in the last years, unfortunately, because
I think this is a good thing in Europe. The

01:00:39.749 --> 01:00:44.989
key, I think, is--one good thing about Europe--you
in the United States you have elementary school

01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:49.359
and you come out, is it nine or ten years?
And then you have this college, two years

01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:55.170
or whatever and you go to university, but
in Europe, this two years expand into four,

01:00:55.170 --> 01:01:01.049
we call it, lyceum, gymnasium, high school.
High school is not just a short passage. High

01:01:01.049 --> 01:01:07.059
school is where you get serious education,
all sciences are covered, and there, we get

01:01:07.059 --> 01:01:14.679
philosophy. Unfortunately, Europe is now becoming
more like United States. But the reason, I'm

01:01:14.679 --> 01:01:21.459
an optimist here is that I think that what--when
I was interviewed, as it was kindly pointed

01:01:21.459 --> 01:01:28.630
out, I really think that now we need more
and more philosophy in the sense of delinquent

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:33.259
problems, which if you want it or not are
philosophical, even the self problems that

01:01:33.259 --> 01:01:40.421
everybody of us confront. For example, problems
like abortion, brain biogenetics and so on,

01:01:40.421 --> 01:01:46.829
my god, to get an opinion on that, it's not
just an abstract question of ethics. You have

01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:52.599
implicitly to decide, "Are we free beings?
Are we free at all?" And here, again, the

01:01:52.599 --> 01:01:58.140
analysis that I made through that glasses,
it brings out some very funny results. For

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:05.469
example, I was always perplexed by the standard
Catholic answer, which is don't mess biogenetically

01:02:05.469 --> 01:02:12.459
with brain because if you do it, you diminish
man to a biological animal, but we have immortal

01:02:12.459 --> 01:02:18.759
soul, blah, blah. My god, my problem here
was--wait a minute, if you believe we have

01:02:18.759 --> 01:02:24.239
an immortal soul, what's then the problem
with messing with brain? I mean I cannot touch

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:30.209
the soul. So I think the true message in between
lines of this Catholic anti--anti-biogenetic

01:02:30.209 --> 01:02:39.150
brain sciences experiment is a different one.
It's a--let's--it's better not to know some

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:47.400
things. Let’s avoid knowing that because
knowing too much there may deprive us of our

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.269
dignity, may diminish our freedom and so on
and so on. So, again, it's not only this.

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:58.249
It's other prob--where I think effectively
that we are at such a crucial moment, now,

01:02:58.249 --> 01:03:04.619
truly, not in the religious sense of a catastrophe
but in a sense of apocalyptic moment that

01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:07.910
we have to make decisions which are much more
radical.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:16.069
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming today. I had a question
about how you normally respond to claims that

01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:21.380
Marxism and radicalism is dead?
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: I mean, no, mystery here and the

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:26.299
mystery is rather this one to put--I will
be very short. Why do I consider myself still

01:03:26.299 --> 01:03:31.949
some kind of a Marxist without any illusions
and so on. Look, the question we have today

01:03:31.949 --> 01:03:36.779
is that--the only serious question is this
one. Is Fukuyama Francis, right or not? Even

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:43.319
most of today's left, isn’t did there are
Fukuyamaists as it were? They basically adapt

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:49.059
liberal democracy, some kind of capitalism
as if not the best at least the least worst,

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:53.229
the least bad system, and yet, the idea is
just--you know, when I was young we’ll have

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:57.829
a saying, we want socialism with a human face.
What even the left today basically offers

01:03:57.829 --> 01:04:03.519
is global capitalism with the human face.
Make it a little bit better as Bill Gates

01:04:03.519 --> 01:04:07.150
would put it, create this capitalism. You
can have your cake and it eat it, you can

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:13.429
have profit and help the poor, whatever, to
make it more. So my question is, is this all?

01:04:13.429 --> 01:04:21.440
Is this our ultimate horizons? Or are there
crises, antagonisms on the horizon? Which

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:28.359
for which in the long term--and by long term,
I don't mean this 200 years, but 10, 15 years,

01:04:28.359 --> 01:04:34.009
20, global capitalism will not be enough to
solve them. I think there are from biogenetics,

01:04:34.009 --> 01:04:39.289
even Francis Fukuyama, you know, his next
book on human freedom or whatever, he explicitly

01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:45.559
says that this biogenetic possibilities undermine
his vision of global capitalism, that one.

01:04:45.559 --> 01:04:51.529
Then ecology, I claim and so on, so I think
if you want to know my argument in detail,

01:04:51.529 --> 01:04:55.519
now, I will do an unfair thing and refer to
an another book of mine, In Defense of Lost

01:04:55.519 --> 01:05:02.079
Causes, in the last chapter, I try precisely
to argue where I see and only in this sense,

01:05:02.079 --> 01:05:09.019
I'm a Marxist. I claim, let's not be so sure,
this liberal democratic capitalism, maybe

01:05:09.019 --> 01:05:15.740
is not the ultimate horizon. We should just
keep our mind open. I'm not now saying of

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:20.609
course, oh, will there be--that there will
be a new Leninist party or whatever, no, that

01:05:20.609 --> 01:05:26.589
is over. But we should, that's the limit of
my Marxism. I even don't see a solution because,

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:32.249
you know, all Marxist--always have this satisfaction
the train of history is on my side or should

01:05:32.249 --> 01:05:37.460
I put it, you know, like we are just realizing
historical necessity, no, I don't think. I'm

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:42.489
only saying I see ominous signs here and there,
and I want that if global capitalism will

01:05:42.489 --> 01:05:48.179
be able to cope with it in the long terms.
One of the problem, I see purely economic

01:05:48.179 --> 01:05:53.269
is the one with which you are dealing a lot,
you again, as Googlers, namely, the problem

01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:58.890
of intellectual property. I think that more
and more it's exploding as a problem because

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:03.709
I think that intellectual property if you
pardon me the expression is in its nature

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:10.349
closer to communism than to capitalism. You
have to force it. It's very difficult to contain

01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:16.579
it within the limits of private property,
which is why you get all these paradoxes.

01:06:16.579 --> 01:06:25.309
If you allow too strong logic of private property
to determine the domain of knowledge, intellectual

01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:30.179
achievements, then you get somebody like Bill
Gates. I have nothing against him; I'm just

01:06:30.179 --> 01:06:36.150
saying that if you have a guy who in 30 years
becomes from a nobody, tinkering in his garage,

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:42.640
to the richest man on the earth. Doesn’t
this show that market mechanism, you cannot

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:48.400
in any way say that, his wealth reflect his
achievement or how should I put it, you know,

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.920
it's just market cannot reflect it properly.
So that would be my answer, but read the book,

01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:00.799
I talk too much. Now, aha, you want it balanced,
left, right, left, right, okay, right again.

01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:03.839
Okay.
&gt;&gt; I've enjoyed your talk very much; I came

01:07:03.839 --> 01:07:07.859
a little bit late, so I didn’t hear whether
you said anything about it, but I was wondering

01:07:07.859 --> 01:07:14.459
if you've used the toilets here at Google?
We have an optical sensor in our toilets.

01:07:14.459 --> 01:07:18.710
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: What do they--does it do?
&gt;&gt; Well, when you stand up, it flushes.

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:21.669
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: Yeah, I'm used to them from the
airport and here.

01:07:21.669 --> 01:07:24.680
&gt;&gt; You get up and you don’t have to touch
anything and I was wondering if--to me it

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:31.289
seems that we have some sort of ideology here
that technology will address even the most

01:07:31.289 --> 01:07:36.609
fundamental human problems and will sort of
transform us and I was wondering…

01:07:36.609 --> 01:07:42.559
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: No, no, no, what my answer here
would just have been--no, maybe I am too naïve,

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:48.890
utilitarian, but my--I always thought that
they come up with this, because people care

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:54.609
about bacteria with that and the point is
rather I think, how to prevent you touching

01:07:54.609 --> 01:07:59.809
something. Wasn’t this the origin was to
keep you--so it's a--but on the other hand,

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:05.019
I agree with you and I've seen even--no, this
is, I mean there it's to go on and on, for

01:08:05.019 --> 01:08:10.640
example, in Japan, I was told, you know, that
it's also a nice cultural detail that in many

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:19.199
public toilets, so I was told, there is music
while you are shitting on the toilet, why?

01:08:19.199 --> 01:08:24.889
Because people are so sensitive and embarrassed
by potential sounds you make while you are

01:08:24.889 --> 01:08:30.000
shitting and so on. So the idea is the only
way to make it tolerable is to have a background

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.589
of music enough, and so on, and so on. So,
I totally—how should I put it--maybe even

01:08:37.589 --> 01:08:42.429
more than eating, shitting is a measure of
civilization. In the sense of, if you want

01:08:42.429 --> 01:08:48.400
to see the basic of a civilization, it's not
look at how people eat, look at how people

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:54.679
shit. The true color for me would have been
in--and I read somewhere, there are already,

01:08:54.679 --> 01:09:00.469
the plans which are even worse that--sorry
for vulgarity, you will not even have to do

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:07.949
that the--sorry, obscene gestures to press
the shit out. That there is some kind of vacuums

01:09:07.949 --> 01:09:13.380
stuff, you know and so, it will just be done
for you, totally, how that would we know.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:20.259
That will be pretty terrible, I mean, no?
But again, yes--again, I love details like

01:09:20.259 --> 01:09:25.039
this, because I think that through them, you
get that ideology, which is like for example

01:09:25.039 --> 01:09:30.889
in my books, I love another detail. Did you
notice for example, if you know a little bit

01:09:30.889 --> 01:09:35.140
about history of totalitarianism and how,
if you look at Hitler when he speaks or a

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:40.969
Fascist leader, people applaud; Hitler accepts
the applause. Look at the communist leaders

01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:48.190
speaking, people applause, what does the communist
do? Stands up and joins the applause. This

01:09:48.190 --> 01:09:53.870
tells everything, it's totally different logic,
Stalin is dictator, is not a master, it's

01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:59.380
a perfect servant of the people. It's always,
I'm not thinking myself, I'm only you, and

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:05.239
it points out a totally different logic, which
can be substantiated by the other claims.

01:10:05.239 --> 01:10:11.909
For example, I write in a book on Upper Bamum
Gulag, that every year on Stalin's birthday,

01:10:11.909 --> 01:10:17.320
all the arrested in Gulag, all the people
imprisoned there where collected, even in

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.230
the darkest years of Stalinism, were assembled
and have to sign a telegram, wishing Comrade

01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:27.260
Stalin all the best for birthday, and wishing
him greater, even success in building socialism

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:35.139
and so on. Now think about it, you cannot
even imagine the same thing in Fascism. Well,

01:10:35.139 --> 01:10:40.170
together all the Jews in Auschwitz and make
them, all the best wishes telegram to Hitler

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:45.010
and so on. You see, I love these details,
like your electronic toilet, or whatever,

01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:51.940
which, you know, a small meaningless feature,
but like crystal, it shows, it condenses a

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:59.210
fundamental difference. You know, sorry to…
&gt;&gt; So, you give a great example about how

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:05.350
the TV is a proxy for our laughter, so I'm
going to ask an obvious question, what do

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:10.409
you--what is God essentially a proxy for or
do you use Him or Her for?

01:11:10.409 --> 01:11:12.270
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: God?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:20.130
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: It all depends on what we--on, I
mean, first I don’t think there is one God,

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:25.829
I mean, I'm an atheist, so, sorry. So, if
we talk about God, of course, it's about how

01:11:25.829 --> 01:11:33.599
God functions, as an idea, representation
and so on and so on. I think God is many things,

01:11:33.599 --> 01:11:40.289
but I think, what God is--it's a very nice
question that you ask, because I think that

01:11:40.289 --> 01:11:50.139
God is at its most fundamental and radical,
not so much a determinant proxy, but the very

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:56.570
structure of having a proxy. God is the original
proxy, I don’t know, but He knows for me.

01:11:56.570 --> 01:12:03.659
I don’t but He does in Christ. I'm not compassionate
enough, you know, God is this very formal

01:12:03.659 --> 01:12:08.860
structure, it is by alone anything. I don’t
think we can get over God as simple as that.

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:14.420
There is in the very structure of language
not that shit about, is there a gene for emotions

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:21.940
of God? But more in a purely semantic way;
the moment we are in language, there is a

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:27.130
divine dimension that we presuppose it, that
we practice it in a way. So, again, I would

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:34.099
say, God is originally this very dimension
of having a proxy, or how should I put it.

01:12:34.099 --> 01:12:40.699
And it’s original, this dimension. I don’t
think there ever was originally, a humanity

01:12:40.699 --> 01:12:45.381
which fully lost itself. No, it's from the
beginning that we have these gaps. What do

01:12:45.381 --> 01:12:49.770
I mean by this? Let's take a little--let's
say we are half-French, I see you, I stumble

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:55.929
on you tomorrow on the street here and we
say can’t--and I tell you, nice to meet

01:12:55.929 --> 01:13:02.370
you, how are you? We both know that probably,
I'm in a way, lying. First, I don’t really

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:07.570
care how are you, if I were really to give
a full right to tell me to F... off. It's

01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:13.349
none of your business how I am. Or--but you
know what I mean, we--it's a lie, but it's

01:13:13.349 --> 01:13:19.940
a sincere lie. It's wrong to say hypocrisy.
So I don’t think that we have to presuppose

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:25.350
that there was an original, phenomenal, logical
moment when--when people said, "How are you?"

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:31.440
They really meant it, authentically. No, the
gap is--from the very beginning here, others--others

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:39.000
believe for you, others feel for you and God
would have been--God is this very other dimension,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.070
there has to be what Jacques Lacan calls--Jacques
Lacan precisely calls this dimension the Big

01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:49.389
Upper. The one for whom we have to maintain
appearances and so on and so on. So, yes,

01:13:49.389 --> 01:13:54.889
it's a very nice question and I love to dwell
on this, all these, thanks very much.

01:13:54.889 --> 01:14:00.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for coming it's been
fascinating. Google famously has an informal

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:03.709
motto, "Don't be Evil," as the next tunnel
observer, what do you think our unknown knowns

01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:10.239
are?
&gt;&gt; ZIZEK: No, I'm not saying that the true

01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:16.400
message is--it’s not simply like, oh, in
a Freudian way, you know, when you say, this

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.340
woman is not my mother then Freud said, ha,
ha, ha, the negation, blah, blah. So I'm not

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:27.590
saying that you are fundamentally evil. But
what does interest me is what is the model

01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:34.550
of evil which is presupposed in it, nonetheless
the inherent logic is that, you know, because

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:41.550
why warn them precisely against this? What
is the model of evil here? What is--why the

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:49.139
need to react against this? I think it's not--these
kinds of injunctions are never general injunctions.

01:14:49.139 --> 01:14:54.489
Like of course, nobody should be evil. No,
but which is evil is there? It is--I don’t

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:59.219
know, you leave the perception, but you, being
the most powerful search machine and so on,

01:14:59.219 --> 01:15:03.679
are open to the temptation of manipulation,
I don’t know. The question to be asks would

01:15:03.679 --> 01:15:12.801
have been, what dimension of evil? On the
other hand, generally, I think that in a way

01:15:12.801 --> 01:15:20.270
evil is good. No, no, I'm not part of some
crazy, pseudo-dialectic. What I'm saying is

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:27.059
that, what is evil? Evil is something which
as it were brutally interrupts the normal

01:15:27.059 --> 01:15:33.360
run of things. Evil is a cut and so on, which
is right, for example, for traditional pagan

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.210
religions, Jesus Christ is evil embodied and
in a way, they are right. Because the message

01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:45.570
of Christianity is--it's over with that karma,
everything circulates and so on; it’s a

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:53.949
cut. So I claim that this, "Don’t be Evil,"
it's more like, we are doing something terribly

01:15:53.949 --> 01:16:00.179
great, let's not do it too fast or whatever.
And I totally, accept this, I think. I totally

01:16:00.179 --> 01:16:06.280
accept this, what you are doing is evil, which
means, it shakes things the way they were.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:12.460
I mean, something, you are doing something
which is in a way crazy. You also are changing

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:18.059
what means being human. I mean, you know,
how it changes our perception that basically,

01:16:18.059 --> 01:16:22.360
if we are not a total idiot, I'm close to
it, but hope not totally total, like, you

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:27.170
know, it's no longer that by bibliography,
whatever, you get everything. This life in

01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:36.310
a permanent presence as it were, no? So, I
would say that it's a negative recognition

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:42.150
that there is a radical dimension to what
you are doing. It affects the normal community

01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:49.800
life, and so on, and so on. And my conclusion
is that, in order to say don’t be evil,

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:59.780
you must already dwell in that space of evil
and I congratulate you for it. Thank you very

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.329
much.
