00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.310
Definitely this one. The trend is downward sloping. So it can't be any of these

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.810
positive slopes and it definitely doesn't look like the data go through this

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.340
value up here or here. And this one looks like it slopes downward too steeply.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.000
We can see which one is better, but how do we determine mathematically which is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.080
the best. For example, how do we know that this line, in blue, isn't slightly

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.200
better? There are a lot of lines that could look like they best approximate the

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.940
data. So we have to mathematically find the exact a and b, the y intercept and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.560
slope that will get us the line of best fit. How do we find these regression

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.572
coefficients? Let's look at these examples again. Remember how we talked about

00:00:47.572 --> 00:00:51.350
observed and expected values? Let's say we're deciding whether this would be a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.410
good regression line. For this x value. The expected value is way down here.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.520
For this x value, the expected value is also pretty far. This x value looks to

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.100
be pretty close to the expected value but these two are really far from their

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.660
expected values. The same with this. The expected value for this value of x. Is

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.250
way up here. So this residual actually isn't too bad. But the amount of the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.430
residual gets worse and worse as we continue. Same with this one. If we

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.635
continued this line really far out, the residual for this data value would be

00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:37.740
huge. All of them would be pretty big. And these would be really big. But here,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.190
the residuals are pretty small, especially compared to the other possibilities.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.150
For these two points the residuals are about zero.
