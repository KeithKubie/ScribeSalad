Congress in Washington DC.

&gt;&gt; Michael Apfeldorf: Now
I have the great pleasure

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.770
to introduce our next
presenter, Herve Tullet.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.580
Herve is an award winning
author and illustrator

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.470
of more than 20 childrens books.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.950 position:56%
And he is considered one of the most
innovative childrens authors today.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.570
Born in Normady, he has
lived in Paris France

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.290
and today he makes his
home in New York City.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.720
Herve started his career
as an art director

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.020
in advertising and communications.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.820
Then after the birth
of his first child,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.720
he decided to become a
childrens illustrator.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.600
Eventually he took on the
role of author as well,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.430
which is helped him achieve
his own unique style.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.720
Since then his works
have been translated

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.820
into 25 languages worldwide.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.860
Some of the titles you might
recognize are Press Here,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.150
The Big Book of Art, I am Blop

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.770
and Let's Play Games
series of board books.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.850
His most recent work is Let's Play.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.360
Herve also leads workshops for
children all over the world

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.740
in which he helps them to unlock
their own creative energies

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.360
through art.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.460
Like many of you I
have had the pleasure

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.080
of reading Herve Tullet's
books with my children

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.290
and enjoying how unique they are.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.900
We have particularly enjoyed not
just reading them, but being able

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.590
to play with them as
physical objects.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.330 position:56%
For as many of you know with Herve's
books you're frequently invited

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.820
to take action.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.440
This could be as simple as pressing
a dot, to see what it will do

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.870 position:56%
or it could be drawing on your
fingers and using them as characters

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.610 position:56%
in the book or any number of things.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.650
Either way Tullet's books invite
children to become active partners

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.750
in creating their own unique
experience with books.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.560
And as a parent and an educator
I really appreciate this.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.860
