00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.166
[bell]

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.700
Ernst, my good man.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.967
Ah.

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:06.100
Two tins of the
usual, professor?

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.400
Indeed.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.800
And I would like you
to meet my good friend,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.867
and thorn in my scientific
side, Dr. Niels Bohr.

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:12.867
Hello.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.734
An honor to meet you, sir.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.834
Ernst, are you familiar
with Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:19.133
principle?

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.433
I can't say that
I am, professor.

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:23.667
Well, it states that the
more accurately we measure

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.700
the velocity of a particle,
the less accurately

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.734
we can measure its
position in space.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.667
So you know exactly how
fast the thing is going.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:40.066
Yes, but if we do, we cannot
also know where that thing is.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.867
Does that sound logical to you?

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:42.767
No, sir.

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:44.033
EINSTEIN: Of course not.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:45.567
And according to my
esteemed colleague,

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.166
the particle does not exist
at all until we observe it.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.266
That makes absolutely
no sense to me.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.633
EINSTEIN: Exactly.

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:56.667
Thank you, Ernst.

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.700
Shall we stop by
your butcher's as well?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.000
Perhaps he has an
opinion on the matter.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.834
Ha ha.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.033
Very amusing.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.233
Albert, the uncertainty
principle works.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.467
It functions, and
it allows us to make

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.567
use of the quantum world.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:12.266
The goal of scientific pursuit
should not be merely to make

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.900
use of the world around us.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.100
It should be to understand
it fundamentally, no matter

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.967
what use it might have.

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:19.900
Albert, look out.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.400
[car horn]

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.533
Just watch where
you're going, please.

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.867
Why should I?

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:31.333
Why should either of us?

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.100
According to you, if that
automobile was a particle

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.967
but we didn't see
it, it wouldn't

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:39.800
have been there at all.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.533
We would be perfectly safe.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.767
Automobiles aren't
subatomic particles, Albert.

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.467
EINSTEIN: Niels, it defies
common sense that the rules

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.834
which govern those
things we can see do

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:54.834
not apply to those we cannot.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:56.834
[car horn]

00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:59.367
I will not turn off my
brain simply because you've

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:01.100
decided the matter is settled.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.300
Well, then, if you don't start
using your brain to observe

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.800
what's right in
front of you, you're

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.800
going to get yourself killed.
