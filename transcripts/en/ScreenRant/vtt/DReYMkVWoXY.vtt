00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.639
No matter how big, expensive or complicated
a movie might get, it's still everyday people

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.040
making it - which means a ton of&nbsp;mistakes,
errors, or oversights in even the&nbsp;biggest&nbsp;box

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.310
office hits. Nobody's perfect, but you'll
be amazed to find out just how many&nbsp;mistakes&nbsp;fans

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.790
are willing to ignore - or never even catch
in the first place. Here is Screen Rant's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.390
Know Your Movies: The Biggest Mistakes In
FROZEN.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.210
Properties Of Ice
The ice saws in the opening number are used

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.640
properly, but it would be impossible to start
by stabbing directly through ice that thick.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.640
Ghostly Shadows
The shadows cast by Anna and Hans are fine,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.390
but the silhouettes hovering in midair isn't.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.260
Hair Clipping
Instead of pulling her braid over her shoulder

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.980
from behind, Elsa teleports the braid directly
through her shoulder.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.630
Unfrozen Water
Anna's dip into an icy stream leaves her with

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.620
a&nbsp;frozen&nbsp;solid dress, but having seen a
fountain, and a waterfall&nbsp;frozen&nbsp;solid,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.340
there's no reason why the stream should still
be flowing.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.230
Weather Woes
Aside from the snow, the weather is pretty

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.509
calm on the mountain. But that doesn't stop
the Trading Post door from being slammed violently

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.840
shut, or Kristoff stepping out of a blizzard.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.999
Reindeer Nouns
The plural of "reindeer" is "reindeer," not

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:26.270
"reindeers." Having grown up around them,
you'd think Kristoff would know that.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.639
Missing Tune
Kristoff's guitar clearly has four strings,

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.799
but only three tuning pegs.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.240
Side By Side
Elsa's not the only user of magic. Kristoff's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.119
sleigh has enough room for he and Anna to
share, but when she makes a point of moving

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.420
to the edge of her seat, the next shot puts
her back at his side, packed in closer than

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.420
ever.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.729
Directionless
Kristoff and Anna are heading towards the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.789
north mountain when she stops to look back
at Arendelle. With the camera flipped, they

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.840
should be heading camera right, but the north
mountain is revealed to be to the left, from

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.619
the same way they just came.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.549
Head Hurt
When Anna and Kristoff run into Olaf, he winds

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.090
up with his head turned upside down. His view
should have their positions reversed, with

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.560
Kristoff and Sven on the right, but they're
on the same sides as the shot before.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.350
Reflections
The ice columns reflect Anna's face with a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.790
view from head-on, not to the side, which
they should.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.390
The Hat Trick
The animators apparently forgot about Anna's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.970
hat when she and Kristoff slide out of Elsa's
castle, since it magically reappears in the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.970
next shot.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.489
Got Rope?
Anna makes the right call in cutting herself

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.569
and Kristoff loose, but they're still tied
to one another - until they land, and the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.489
rope is gone.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.659
Royal Family
Hans charges Queen Elsa with treason while

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.099
acting as regent, even though most monarchs
can't actually be charged with treason against

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.879
the state, since they ARE the state. But his
entire plan was a bust, since the husband

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.620
of a queen doesn't become king if the queen
dies.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.909
Hot And Cold
When the guards come to execute Queen Elsa,

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.299
they discover she's&nbsp;frozen&nbsp;her way out of
her shackles. The problem is that hot metal

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.319
bends - cold metal would shatter instead.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.299
Ninja Feet
Kristoff and Sven leave a trail of footprints

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.319
when they leave Anna behind, but when turning
back for their rescue, the snow hasn't even

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.319
been touched.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.951
Door Versus Doors
When we first see Queen Elsa's study, her

00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:13.280
double doors fittingly open onto the end of
a long hall. But when Anna is later locked

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.989
in the same room, the double doors now open
onto a wall.

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.439
Secret Sword Sheath
Apparently Hans wields a magical sword, since

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.650
it appears and disappears throughout the movie,
including when he draws it from a make believe

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.540
sheath in the final act.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.260
Block Magic
When Anna saves her sister's life, the power

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.800
knocks Hans unconscious, sliding behind a
block of ice a few feet away - that is completely

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.780
missing just seconds later.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.639
Thumbs Down
Even Disney makes&nbsp;mistakes, including Kristoff's

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.760
thumb passing though Anna's digital clothing
for a split second.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.389
There you have it: every&nbsp;mistake, error,
or inconsistency in Disney's&nbsp;Frozen. We've

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.209
kept our list to only the&nbsp;mistakes&nbsp;that
are impossible to dispute, and we think fans

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.249
would agree that they're easy to forgive - even
if we have to spot each and every one of them

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.909
during our next viewing. Did we miss any of
your favorite slip-ups? Let us know in the

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.709
comments (and maybe what other movies we should
put under the microscope), and remember to
