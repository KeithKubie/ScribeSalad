00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.000
James: Another favourite squared square

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.520
Well it's this one

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.440
I say it's favourite because

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.500
This one was actually found before the Trinity students found theirs

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
They were scooped

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
It was just before them

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.860
And this was published first, and that's so disappointing.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.880
So, if I'm being technical this was the first squared square found.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.880
But, there's no theory behind it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880
Brady: It was just some fluke or --

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.860
J: It was some fluke, yeah

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.800
It's made out of squared rectangles

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.020
It was actually those previous squared rectangles that had been found

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020
There's copies of those in there

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.260
He's put them together and scaled them up and scaled them down

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.400
There's no maths in that, it doesn't help you find more...

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.400
It tells you no theory about it.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.800
B: It's the first though

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.820
J: But it was the first.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.820
That is so annoying as well

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.760
Here's one more square

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.660
And this, this one I like because it's more

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660
Aesthetically pleasing

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.220
Notice the squares are more 'round about the same size

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.760
So instead of having a squared square were you have one tiny square, one massive square

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.200
Which, a lot of them seem to look like that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200
This one's more balanced

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.040
The squares are around about the same size

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.120
If they take the ratio of the biggest to the smallest

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.700
This has the kindest ratio

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.700
This is the more favourable ratio

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.380
B: The kindest one?

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.860
J: I don't know, maybe

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.860
It's called a nice squared square

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.800
It's the smallest ratio between the biggest and smallest

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.580
B: It's like you, James, a nice square

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580
J: Yeah, I like to think so

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.740
One thing that's tempting to do with these squared squares is to turn them into puzzles

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.160
'Cause you can cut them up and say can you make them into a square or something like that

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
This is actually a rectangle

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.240
This is a rectangle that I've made out of the smaller squares

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.240
I must find the complete set

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.840
I think some of the smaller ones are still in here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840
B: Yeah, having missing ones is no good

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.900
J: There you go

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.580
So it's like a jigsaw

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.800
Can you put these together like a jigsaw?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.680
And, so that's what one of the Trinity students did

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.180
He actually

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.060
This is the one he turned into a puzzle

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.260
And he gave it to his mum

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.580
And he said, "Well, I know what the solution is, but can you find it?"

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820
And so, she tried to find the solution

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.660
And it turned out that she found a different solution

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.020
Using the same squares

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.640
B: No?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.240
J: So there are two ways

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240
To use the same squares

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.500
To make a rectangle

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.220
Of the same dimension as well

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.620
So the same dimension

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.040
And that's nice

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.140
So those are called isomers

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.440
So they are two rectangles, the same dimension, using the same squares

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.060
But in a different order

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.000
Okay

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.620
I'm gonna say it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.760
This was Bill Tutte's training in maths

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.720
Bill Tutte was given problems at Bletchley Park

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.220
Because they knew he liked puzzles

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.340
They knew was the kind of a guy who liked to do a problem [as] a puzzle

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.360
And they gave him problems that they thought couldn't be solved

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.360
And they thought, "Oh, we've given up on this

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.260
"Here you go and do it"

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.120
And so he worked away

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.240
And people were kind of looking over going,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.300
"Is he actually doing anything? 'Cause he doesn't seem to be doing anything"

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.660
But he was

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.940
And he solved these massively important problems

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.700
That helped us break codes in World War II

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.800
