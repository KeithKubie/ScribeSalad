00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.940
So it started with a hilariously
awkward picture of John Green 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.560
pretending to write in the most
uncomfortable position possible, 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.510
a photo that was taken for an article about
him in the Hollywood Reporter, 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.150
so congratulations for that, John. 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.080
Then my girlfriend, Emily, thought
that it would be funny 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.750
for me to copy his pose
in our own picture. 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.590
I put it on the internet with
the hashtag "#Johning,"

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.480
and I guess that Twitter must have
been having a particularly slow week 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.700
because, for some reason,
it became it's own little meme. 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.340
While I am definitely proud, I think,
of the success of Johning, 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.740
I'm less happy about the fact that I think
it is the most successful project 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.280
I've working on in...let's just
say quite a while. 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.980
The problem that I've been
experiencing is that 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.180
all of the ideas that I've had
recently that I actually like 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320
have been for things that I just do not have
the skills required to actually accomplish. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.920
For example, my ideas for a website
and for a video game. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.730
As much as I do definitely feel like just
some dumb kid who doesn't 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.190
understand how ambitious and difficult
his "cool" ideas actually are, 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.230
I still feel like I have to try and so,
I'm going to pitch my ideas to you 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.690
because I don't know
what else to do. 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.930
Firstly: the website. 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.290
So just like everyone else who
uses YouTube regularly, 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.890
I have a bit of a love/hate
relationship with the website, 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.480
and, more than anything, I'd really like them
to have some proper competition 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.700
in the hopes that it might encourage
them to up their game a bit. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.520
But, obviously, you can't make just
another video streaming website 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010
and hope it does
a well as YouTube. 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.480
There has to be something different
enough about it to justify it existing. 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.820
And so I asked myself, "What is the one thing
that I would change about YouTube if I could?" 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.860
and I decided that I would want
to get rid of view counts.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.230
Instead, the videos on my hypothetical
website would be ranked 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.830
based on overall engagement. 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.960
So, a view would actually be
worth the least because, 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.760
although you are engaging with the content,
it's only in a very passive way. 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.190
And the longer you watch something,
the more that view would be worth 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.190
because the more
engaged you are. 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.560
If you click "like" on a video, that would
be worth more engagement than a view 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.630
because the video is actually encouraging
you to take some kind of action. 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.940
If you share a video, that's worth more
engagement, if you leave a comment,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.450
the longer and better written your comment is,
the more engagement it's worth, 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.940
and if you decide to leave a video response,
that's the most engaged you can be

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.700
because you've actually been
encouraged to create something new 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.600
based on what you've seen. 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.670
And so all of that data would be
put through an algorithm,

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.020
that would come up with an
engagement rating for a video, 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.680
and that number would be the big one that
would appear underneath the video 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.990
as opposed to a view count. 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.830
I think that to start with, it would just
have to rank existing online videos 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.500
as opposed to hosting all of its own stuff, but,
yeah, that's my website. Now the video game. 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.020
So you play as a ghost who died hundreds of
years ago in this big old warehouse building, 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.170
and it's been so long now since you've
did that two things have happened: 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.210
you've completely forgotten
about your past, 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.500
so you can't remember what
you're unfinished business is, 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.970
and the warehouse in
which you died 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.980
has since been converted into
a block of trendy apartments. 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.650
And so the gameplay would be
that you'd be able to wander freely 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.390
and around all of these
people's apartments, 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.990
observe their lives, and then decide
to haunt them however you like. 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.680
For example, you're
wandering around, 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.530
you discover somebody trying to
break into someone else's apartment, 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.380
you scare the hell out
of them, they run away. 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.200
Or you could wander into someone's
apartment, observe them,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.180
discover that they are procrastinating
from putting up their shelves, 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.280
you can wait until
they're gone, 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.320
and then you can haunt them nicely
by putting their shelves up. 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.200
Even as someone who's only
ever played video games, 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.150
I can see a lot of potential
issues in the idea, 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.440
but I still really like the general
concept of like a ghost simulator, 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.300
and it feels like the kind of story
that would just work best 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.030
if told through a video game
for whatever reason. 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.380
So if there is anybody out
there who thinks 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.520
they'd be able to make these ideas
a reality, please do get in touch, 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.390
and if there's anybody out there
who wants to steal these ideas, 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.640
I guess I'm making it pretty
easy for you to do that, 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.910
so I will ask you
politely not to. 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.770
Because, like I said, I don't
know what else to do here. 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.410
Thank you very much for
your potential help, 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.420
and let's hope the ideas
don't die with this video 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.300
'cause that would be sad.
Goodbye! 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.490
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.490
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.340
A lot of you have probably
noticed this already, 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.840
but I will now confirm it for you. 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.210
I bought the lights.
I'm not sorry. 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.850
Thank you for watching. 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.180
If you'd like to watch my previous video,
you have ten seconds to find it. Good luck. 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.540
[CLOCK TICKING SOUNDS]

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.420
It was here all along,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.850
and you're terrible at finding things. 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.088
Sorry...I mean deal with it.
