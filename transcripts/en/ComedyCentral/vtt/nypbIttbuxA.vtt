00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.570
(dubstep)

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.243
- I'm Dr. Armond, California's
premier dog plastic surgeon.

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:12.645 align:start size:75% position:25%
Do you--
- Dr. Ar-Armond?

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.180
- Armond, mm-hmm.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.484
- (Armond drowns out sound)
think that's more romantic.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.651
- What does that mean?

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.653 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm making a sexual
innuendo to you.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.989 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm not sure if the
sexual chemistry's there,

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.625 align:start size:97% position:3%
but I feel like I've finally
found a real partner.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.093 align:start size:84% position:16%
It feels like Denise
has been going

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:30.063 align:start size:88% position:13%
for K-9s when she
really deserves a K-10.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.831
(harp plays)

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.099
I'm ready.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.001 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Just took an Ambien,
you got 20 minutes

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.269 line:0%
before it's non-consensual.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.104 line:0%
- That seems a bit
passive-aggressive.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.106 align:start position:0%
You're trying to get a reaction
out of me, but you won't.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.108
(yells)

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.047
(loud licking)

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.516
I'm feeling a bit
nauseous right now.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.317
Do you want to press pause?

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.619
Or have you made a dog-cision?

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.288 align:start size:84% position:16%
All in a day's work
for Dr. Armond.
