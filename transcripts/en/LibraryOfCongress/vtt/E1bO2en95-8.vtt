AMAZING COMING TO CLASS ONE DAY.
  AND WAS COMING TO THE COLLEGE 

00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:23.486
ONE DAY AND WAS TORRENTIAL RAIN

MADE A TURN INTO THE FREEWAY.  

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.967
AND THAT RAIN AND ALL THAT 
HAPPENED AT THAT MOMENT CAUSED 

00:29:32.968 --> 00:29:38.754
HER TO FLIP OVER INTO THE NEXT 
LANE OF THE OPPOSITE WING. 

00:29:38.755 --> 00:29:44.688

00:32:53.045 --> 00:33:02.360
MEET ME DOWN THE AVENUE AND MAKE
 ME STAY OUTSIDE AND IT WAS THE 

00:33:02.999 --> 00:33:09.060
LAST ONE JOINING AND THE LAST 
ONE SINGING, AND THE LAST

00:33:14.379 --> 00:33:18.138
 ONE SAYING. 

00:33:24.979 --> 00:33:34.277
 GO HEAT AND LOOK AGAIN AND YOU 
CAN'T DENY IT.  YOU CAN'T DENY 

00:33:34.496 --> 00:33:40.161
IT.  YOU CAN'T DENY IT. 

00:33:46.929 --> 00:33:48.929
 I

00:34:08.303 --> 00:34:14.497
 AM MS. UNITED STATES.  I AM MS.
 UNITED STATES. 

00:34:20.408 --> 00:34:23.570
 I AM MS. 
UNITED STATES. 

00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:39.753
 WE ARE THE PEOPLE.  MS.

00:34:46.506 --> 00:34:48.844
 UNITED STATES.  MS.
UNITED STATES. 

00:34:56.935 --> 00:34:59.355
 [APPLAUSE]. 

00:35:14.713 --> 00:35:20.370
 ON POEM, PARADING DOWN 
BLACKSTONE AVENUE.  AND THAT 

00:35:20.512 --> 00:35:24.681
VOICE, THAT POEM HAS REACHED ALL
 OF US WITH THE VOICES OF OUR 

00:35:25.344 --> 00:35:28.374
CHAMBER CITIES.  AND NOW YOU 
HAVE THE VOICE.  AND HER 

00:35:28.732 --> 00:35:33.550
ENCOURAGEMENT AND HER ENERGY.  
AND THEN IT MAKES ME ASK THE 

00:35:34.838 --> 00:35:39.663
QUESTION.  WHAT CAN A POEM DO?  
WHAT DO WE DO WHEN IT TAKES 

00:35:39.878 --> 00:35:42.873
PLACE?  SOMETHING THAT LEAVES US
 HELPLESS.  SOMETHING THAT IS 

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:47.221
FAR AWAY.  MAYBE IT'S BOSTON.  
MAYBE IT'S A TERRIBLE INCIDENT. 

00:35:47.928 --> 00:35:52.181
 AND MAYBE IT'S THE MASSACRE 
THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT IN SOUTH 

00:35:52.362 --> 00:35:56.630
CAROLINA.  SO I SAID WHAT CAN I 
DO -- I THINK WHAT WE CAN ALL DO

00:35:58.122 --> 00:36:04.774
 IS MAKE AN OFFERING. MAYBE IT'S
 TO MEDICATE ON IT.  MAYBE IT'S 

00:36:05.527 --> 00:36:09.074
TO SAY HELLO.  AND ITS BEING 
INTIMATE AND CARING.  AND MAYBE 

00:36:09.395 --> 00:36:14.148
IT'S ALSO A POEM THAT WE CAN 
WRITE AND SEND TO THE PEOPLE.  

00:36:14.409 --> 00:36:18.097
AND THIS POEM, POEM BY POEM,

00:36:21.696 --> 00:36:24.861
 SPEAKS ABOUT THIS.  AND IT WAS 
RECEIVED IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND 

00:36:25.093 --> 00:36:32.476
PUT ON A NEWS LETTER IN THAT 
AREA IN PARTICULAR.  AND POEM BY

00:36:32.759 --> 00:36:36.247
 POEM, WE CAN END THE VIOLENCE. 

00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:18.096
[MUSIC].  POEM BY POEM WE CAN 

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.159
END THE VIOLENCE.  EVERY DAY.  
POEM BY 

00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:34.794

 YOU HAVE A 

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.610

00:41:20.048 --> 00:41:22.048
WHEN YOU FIND IT.

00:45:18.598 --> 00:45:20.598
 [APPLAUSE]. 

00:49:47.969 --> 00:49:54.425
HIS?  WHO ARE YOU?  WHAT AM I?  
I'M A 5TH GRADER.  I COME FROM 

00:49:55.283 --> 00:49:58.558
THE VALUES.  I'M AN ONLY SON.  I
 COME FROM THE 

00:50:03.398 --> 00:50:06.884
FUMES.  WHAT ARE YOU?  I DO NOT 
HAVE A PLACE.  I DON'T KNOW A 

00:50:06.885 --> 00:50:12.205
STREET.  I AM HERE.
INVISIBLE.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I 

00:50:12.206 --> 00:50:18.804
MUST BE SOMETHING.  MAYBE FROM 
THE ISLAND.  MAYBE I'M HAWAIIAN.

00:50:19.938 --> 00:50:28.592
I WANT TO SING MEXICAN.  BUT I 
CANNOT SAY IT.  THE FIRE INSIDE 

00:50:29.172 --> 00:50:33.274
IS ALL I HAVE.  YOU KNOW, IF I 
HAD A 

00:50:36.342 --> 00:50:44.010
SAXAPHONE, I WOULD BLOW IT AN 
ALL THE STREETS AND OPEN ITS 

00:50:44.295 --> 00:50:47.683
BELL SHAPED MOUTH AND MAKE IT 
COME ALIVE.  IF I CAN MAKE EVERY

00:50:53.401 --> 00:51:01.205
 STREET COME ALIVE.  AND THE 
VOICE.  VOICE.  VOICE.  IF ONLY 

00:51:01.817 --> 00:51:07.172
I HAD A CHOICE.  I WOULD SING.  
I WOULD RING OUT THE BELLS.  AND

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.436
 TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT HAVE 
BEEN NEVER BEEN TOLD FROM THE 

00:51:11.437 --> 00:51:15.073
FIELD TO THE MOUNTAINS AND 
VALLEYS AND THE YARDS AND THE 

00:51:15.347 --> 00:51:19.217
FIELDS, I WOULD SAY, YEAH,

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:29.143
 WE ARE ONE PROVEN.  IN THE 
GOLDEN LIGHT OF THE VOICE.  NO 

00:51:31.706 --> 00:51:38.942
SAXAPHONE FOR ME.
SO BASS FOR ME.  I WILL HIDE 

00:51:39.064 --> 00:51:42.552
BEHIND.  AND POINT TO THE BACK. 
AND I WANT TO BREAK FREE FROM 

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.180
ALL OF THE 

00:51:47.086 --> 00:51:51.218
LIES.  I WANT TO BREAK FREE FROM
 ALL OF THE SHAME OF BEING 

00:51:51.416 --> 00:52:00.567
ALONE.  AND WITH THE MELODY AND 
THE TONE.  SPEAKING WORDS.  LET 

00:52:00.568 --> 00:52:07.218
ME HAVE FUN.  I WANT TO BREAK 
FREE.  LEAVE MY VOICE ALONE.  

00:52:07.219 --> 00:52:14.418
SOMETIMES LIKE A CRY, MY VOICE 
ALONE UNDER THE TREES UP SO HIGH

00:52:16.093 --> 00:52:18.093
 AND THE VOICE CAME.  AND YES, 
IT

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:28.537
 CAME.  IT CAME.  AND CALLED 
POWER.  THEY CALL POWER. 

00:52:28.538 --> 00:52:35.096
BLACK POWER.  THEY CALL BROWN 
POWER.  WOMEN'S POWER.  POWER, 

00:52:37.572 --> 00:52:39.572
POWER.  YELL POWER.  POWER, 
POWER,

00:52:45.131 --> 00:52:54.906
 POWER, FOR THE PEOPLE.  
[SPEAKING SPANISH].  FOR YOU.  

00:52:55.130 --> 00:53:04.459
AND MAYBE ME.  ON THE ROAD.  
WHERE DO I GO?  HOW DO I MAKE MY

00:53:05.044 --> 00:53:09.865
 VOICE CRY?  HOW DO YOU MAKE 
YOUR VOICE KNOW WHY?  HOW DO YOU

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:16.864
 GIVE YOUR VOICE TO THE PEOPLE? 
 DO YOU STAND ON YOUR HEELS, A 

00:53:17.107 --> 00:53:25.631
STAPLE OR JUST TAKE A STEP ON 
THE ROAD NEAR AND FAR.  FAR, 

00:53:25.856 --> 00:53:32.892
FAR, FAR.  TAKE A STEP.  ON THE 
ROAD.  COME UP TO THE FRONT.  

00:53:33.749 --> 00:53:39.676
BUT WHERE?  HOW FAR?  THE ROAD 
OF THE PEOPLE.  DO THEY HAVE A 

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:46.486
VOICE?  WHO STARTED?  YOU?  WHY 
AREN'T THEY HEARD?  DID YOU STOP

00:53:46.997 --> 00:53:52.459
 THEM?  YOU HAVE A VOICE.  DON'T
 YOU SEE?  YOU CAN TELL THEIR 

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:57.791
STORIES.  YOU CAN SPEAK THEM.  
CAN YOU WRITE THEM?  CAN YOU 

00:53:59.019 --> 00:54:05.776
SING THEM?  BE A POET.  BE A 
POET.  AND YOU FIND, DON'T 

00:54:07.275 --> 00:54:13.842
FORGET, NOW IS THE TIME.  ALL 
THE VOICES NEED A SLICE MADE OF 

00:54:14.085 --> 00:54:22.073
LOVE.  NOW IS THE TIME.  ALL THE
 VOICES MADE OF LIFE, OF LOVE, 

00:54:22.074 --> 00:54:29.432
OF STRIVE.  DO YOU DARE?  I DO 
NOT KNOW.  WHAT ABOUT IF THEY 

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:34.665
WOULD HAVE?  THERE IS NO CHOICE.
  WHAT IF NO ONE CARED?  AND 

00:54:34.666 --> 00:54:36.666
WHAT

00:54:41.432 --> 00:54:46.743
 IF I HAVE NO VOICE.  THE ROAD 
IS LONG.  THE ROAD IS LOST.  NO 

00:54:46.744 --> 00:54:53.198
ONE KNOWS.  THE ROAD IS YOU.  
THE ROAD IS NEW.  WHEN DO I ACT?

00:55:01.558 --> 00:55:03.558
 THE PART.

00:55:08.263 --> 00:55:15.363
MIDDLE IT ALL.  BLACK AND DEEP 
AND THINGS BURNED.  THINGS 

00:55:16.003 --> 00:55:18.770
