Speaker 1:          00:00          What's your opinion on calisthenics versus weights? Again, for me, both, I like them both. You know, with calisthenics you get that endurance strength, you get some flexibility and some mobility out of it. They're pretty natural movements, right? They're pretty natural movements or things that you're doing with your human body. So they're going to be more natural. Weights obviously make you stronger, more explosive. At a certain point they also can be more injury inducing. Sure. And at another point they're also less injury inducing. So there's a certain point where if you have an injury in your shoulder and you normally would do handstand pushups, which means you're lifting up 230 pounds, well with weight training you could lift up 40 pounds if you want to. Right? So, so there's, it goes both ways where sometimes calisthenics might be the more injury inducing thing and sometimes weight training might be the more injury inducing things.

Speaker 1:          01:09          That's why you got to balance the two of them, you know? And for instance, when I, if I like I hurt my ankle a couple months ago and I could not put any weight on the squat bar. So I was just doing, you know, pistils and, and you know, air squats, jumps and box jumps. You know, I was using things that didn't have any way cause I could do all that. But the minute I put weight on my back, you know, anything above body weight, it started to hurt. And so I just needed to let that thing heal. And I used the calisthenics to get me there. And then the same, exact opposite. I had a, my shoulder was tweaked six months ago and I was having a hard time doing handstand pushups cause it was just the wrong angle. And so I was just using, just using, I was doing press with a lighter weight than my body weight in order to keep the blood moving in court in order to keep the, in order to keep the system moving.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Cause that's what I think you've got to do. So I think you gotta be, you gotta find a balance of both, which means, which means I'm not great at either one of them. I'm not going to win in any weightlifting competitions. And I'm not going to win in a gymnastics competition either. And there are some guys, especially now, I mean there's some guys that are getting in sick shape. Um, you know, you watch the guys in the crossfit games right now, they're savages and they're doing both the calisthenics and the weight lifting. And actually I was reading something about it the other day and it's becoming more weightlifting focused, you know, whether it's Olympic, what is crossing the crossfit, I shouldn't say it's getting that more focused, but if you wanna win the crossfit games, you got to be able to lift some heavyweights. You got to be able to dead lift a lot, snatch a lot, clean and jerk a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:58          And if you can dead lift a lot, clean and jerk a lot and snatch a lot, you're going to be able to do end, at least you practice the other movements, the muscle up, the pullups you're going to have, you're going to be much more apt to be able to do those things then the other way around. So yeah, I mean, it's, for somebody that can do a body weight snatch is more likely to be able to do 50 pull ups in a row than somebody that's able to do 50 pull ups in a row. And that's their focus in life is able to automatically do a bodyweight snatch. I mean, that's just the reality of it. That's what I think right now. Um, but the bottom line is on those, I use both of them. I find, I like to try and find that balance and I think I use both of them according to what my body prescribes me.
