00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:03.317
- [Instructor] The goal of
this video is to appreciate how

00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:07.524
ideas of natural rights and
social contract and limited

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:11.333
government and popular
sovereignty are embedded in

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.836
America's founding documents.

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:16.859
Before we start looking at the
documents themselves, let's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.236
just make sure we understand the context

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:21.302
in which they were written.

00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:23.377
As we enter into the mid

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.019
1770s,

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.451
you have the beginning of

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:31.132
the American Revolutionary
War, which begins in 1775.

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:34.128
A little more than a year
after the beginning of the war,

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:38.033
you have the Second Continental
Congress decide to formally

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.596
declare independence on July 2nd

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:43.052
and the Declaration of Independence,

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:45.671
which we will study a bit in this video is

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:48.048
formally approved on July 4th,

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.283
1776,

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:50.973
which is when we now

00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:53.615
celebrate Independence Day,
even though some could argue

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.488
that it was July 2nd.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.703
Now, as soon as the colonies
decide that they are

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:01.420
independent from the Kingdom
of Great Britain, they have to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.336
think about how do we govern ourselves?

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:07.450
Within roughly a week, a little
more than a week after the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.554
Declaration of Independence
is approved, they start

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:13.626
drafting the Articles of Confederation.

00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:17.435
Remember the Revolutionary
War is still going on.

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:20.016
Eventually what will be
known as the Articles of

00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:23.099
Confederation go into effect in 1781.

00:01:24.044 --> 00:01:26.848
Now, this Articles of
Confederation really treat the

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:29.756
various colonies as you could
almost view it as separate

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.720
states that agree to work
together for purposes of getting

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.796
independence from Great
Britain, for purposes of

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:41.417
fighting the war, for
purposes of diplomacy.

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:44.192
Now, over the course of the
next several years, it becomes

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:46.815
clear, especially through
things like Shays' Rebellion,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.403
which we will look at in other
videos that the Articles of

00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:51.367
Confederation don't provide

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:54.084
a strong enough central government.

00:01:54.084 --> 00:01:58.324
In May 1787, you have what
is called as a Constitutional

00:01:58.324 --> 00:02:00.542
Convention convening.

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:04.595
It's presided over by George
Washington, who led the

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:07.544
Americans in the Revolutionary
War, which they eventually

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.077
will win as you see and obviously

00:02:09.077 --> 00:02:11.461
we're independent country now.

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.626
The original intent of the
Constitutional Convention was to

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:18.287
revise the Articles of
Confederation, but folks like

00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:21.533
Madison and Hamilton were
really intent on just completely

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:22.692
replacing it.

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:26.074
What they replace it with
was what is now the US

00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:30.694
Constitution, which goes
into effect in March of 1789

00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:33.025
and shortly thereafter,
you have the beginning

00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:35.117
of Washington's two terms.

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:39.175
To be clear, the idea of even
having a powerful executive,

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:42.607
the idea of even having a
president was not present in the

00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:47.112
Articles of Confederation that
comes with the Constitution.

00:02:47.112 --> 00:02:50.635
With that context out of the
way, let's look at, especially

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:55.225
the Declaration of Independence
and the US Constitution.

00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:58.261
Here's the beginning of the
Declaration of Independence,

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.980
written by Jefferson and edited by

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.039
Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.571
I encourage you to pause this
video and first try to read

00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.329
it on your own and see if you
can identify these ideas of

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.820
natural rights, limited
government, popular sovereignty,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.653
republicanism and social contract.

00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:18.430
Let's read this together now.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.267
When in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:26.087
for one people to dissolve the
political bonds, which have

00:03:26.087 --> 00:03:27.662
connected them with another ...

00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:30.121
Remember, this is a
Declaration of Independence.

00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:32.989
They are dissolving the political
bonds with the Kingdom of

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.631
Great Britain and to assume
among the powers of the earth,

00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:40.829
the separate and equal station
to which the laws of nature

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.429
and of nature's God entitle
them, so that's starting to

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:48.403
refer a little bit to natural
rights, a decent respect to

00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:51.946
the opinions of mankind requires
that they should declare

00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:54.913
the causes which impel
them to the separation.

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:57.160
They're saying, "Hey, we're
writing this document because

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.118
"we're trying to show the rest
of mankind why the reasons

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:04.154
"for which we are deciding to declare

00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:06.996
"our independence from Great Britain."

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:10.259
We hold these truths to be self-evident

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.273
that all men are created equal,

00:04:12.273 --> 00:04:15.132
let me underline this, that all men are

00:04:15.132 --> 00:04:19.395
created equal, that they are
endowed by their creator with

00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:22.317
certain unalienable rights,

00:04:22.317 --> 00:04:23.880
that among these are life,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.201
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:30.766
This is a direct reference
to natural rights.

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:33.563
In fact, the phrase life,
liberty and the pursuit of

00:04:33.563 --> 00:04:36.959
happiness, most historians
believe is in direct reference

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:41.126
to John Locke's phrase
life, liberty and property

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:44.453
when he talks about natural rights.

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:48.323
This is direct reference to
the enlightenment ideas or even

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:52.156
the pre-enlightenment
ideas of natural rights.

00:04:53.463 --> 00:04:57.105
That to secure these rights,
governments are instituted

00:04:57.105 --> 00:05:01.374
among men, deriving their
just powers from the consent

00:05:01.374 --> 00:05:02.692
of the governed.

00:05:02.692 --> 00:05:06.316
This is worth underlining as
well because they're talking

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:10.494
about governments being
instituted among men to secure

00:05:10.494 --> 00:05:11.760
these rights.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.927
This is all about social
contract, so that's social

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.709
contract that we form a government

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:20.632
in order to secure rights.

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:22.637
We might give it some
rights, but in exchange the

00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:24.637
government has to protect our rights.

00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:29.244
They derive their powers from
the consent of the governed.

00:05:29.244 --> 00:05:31.387
Let me underline that actually
in a different color, derive

00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:33.630
their powers from the
consent of the governed.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.734
That is popular sovereignty,

00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:38.010
popular.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.715
I'll just write as pop sov,

00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:41.754
popular sovereignty right over here.

00:05:41.754 --> 00:05:44.337
That the people are the sovereigns.

00:05:44.337 --> 00:05:47.522
That whenever any form of
government becomes destructive to

00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:51.329
these ends, it is the right
of the people to alter or to

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:55.349
abolish it and to institute
a new government, laying its

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.209
foundation on such principles
and organizing its powers in

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:03.275
such form as to them shall
seem most likely to effect

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:05.128
their safety and happiness.

00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:07.298
This is more about social contract.

00:06:07.298 --> 00:06:09.926
They're like, "Look, if a
government breaks its social

00:06:09.926 --> 00:06:13.056
"contract, we have a right to replace it."

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:17.042
The document also makes reference
to organizing its powers

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:19.946
in such form, so that's really talking

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:22.049
about limited government.

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:23.556
They're talking about, "Hey,
this government just won't

00:06:23.556 --> 00:06:27.019
"have the absolute right to do anything,"

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.936
so that right over there is limited

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.506
government.

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:35.490
Prudence, indeed, will
dictate that governments long

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.463
established should not be changed for

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.228
light and transient causes.

00:06:39.228 --> 00:06:41.353
They're essentially saying,
"Look, you shouldn't just

00:06:41.353 --> 00:06:44.641
"overthrow your government on
a whim," and accordingly all

00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:47.839
experience hath shown that
mankind are more disposed to

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:51.770
suffer while evils are sufferable,
than to right themselves

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.560
by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.986
They're saying, "Look, if you're
prudent, you wouldn't just

00:06:56.986 --> 00:06:59.485
"overthrow your government on
a whim," but they're kind of

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.331
saying, "We're not so worried
about that because history

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.324
"has shown us, experience has
shown us that if anything,

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.459
"people are more likely to
keep suffering even when they

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:09.631
"should be overthrowing their government."

00:07:09.631 --> 00:07:13.703
But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations, pursuing

00:07:13.703 --> 00:07:17.189
invariably the same object
evinces a design to reduce them

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:21.221
under absolute despotism,
it is their right,

00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:24.644
it is their duty to
throw off such government

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:26.444
and to provide new guards

00:07:26.444 --> 00:07:28.294
for their future security.

00:07:28.294 --> 00:07:31.013
They're saying, "Hey, look,
the Kingdom of Great Britain,

00:07:31.013 --> 00:07:33.561
"they are abusing us,
they are usurping power."

00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:36.775
Usurping is taking something
from you that is yours and so

00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:40.476
we need to throw off such a government

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:43.132
for our own future security.

00:07:43.132 --> 00:07:43.965
Here it says,

00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:47.498
"Provide new guards for
their future security,"

00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:50.289
so this provide new
guards, once again making

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:52.960
reference to limited government.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.738
Now, let's fast forward
roughly 13 years to the US

00:07:56.738 --> 00:08:01.225
Constitution, which continues
of course to be in effect.

00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:03.443
This over here is a picture
of the Constitutional

00:08:03.443 --> 00:08:06.656
Convention, which we
mentioned happened in 1787.

00:08:06.656 --> 00:08:09.853
The original intent of the
Constitutional Convention was to

00:08:09.853 --> 00:08:12.919
revise the Articles of
Confederation, but folks like

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:16.201
Alexander Hamilton and James
Madison really wanted to

00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:18.503
replace the Articles of Confederation.

00:08:18.503 --> 00:08:22.245
You can see it's being presided
over by George Washington.

00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:24.220
It starts, the preamble says,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.859
"We the people of the United
States, in order to form a more

00:08:27.859 --> 00:08:30.450
"perfect Union, establish justice,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.401
"insure domestic
tranquility, provide for the

00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:37.434
"common defense, promote the
general welfare and secure the

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.834
"Blessings of Liberty to
ourselves and our posterity, do

00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:43.625
"ordain and establish
this constitution for

00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:46.613
"the United States of America."

00:08:46.613 --> 00:08:49.926
Once again, pause this video
and think about whether you

00:08:49.926 --> 00:08:54.114
see ideas of popular
sovereignty, limited government,

00:08:54.114 --> 00:08:57.507
social contract, natural
rights going on even in this

00:08:57.507 --> 00:09:00.632
preamble or even from the fact
that they took the trouble

00:09:00.632 --> 00:09:03.289
to create this constitution.

00:09:03.289 --> 00:09:04.970
Well, let's start at the beginning.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.399
It starts with, "We the people,"
we the people are the ones

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:12.095
that are creating this
Constitution and not only does it

00:09:12.095 --> 00:09:14.113
start with we the people,
but we the people is

00:09:14.113 --> 00:09:17.188
intentionally written in
this very, very large writing

00:09:17.188 --> 00:09:18.021
right over here.

00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:20.101
This is a picture of the Constitution.

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.649
It's really of all about we
the people, the people are

00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:23.888
sovereign, so

00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:27.046
this idea of popular sovereignty comes out

00:09:27.046 --> 00:09:31.405
loud and clear in not just the
Declaration of Independence,

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:34.280
but also the US Constitution.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.759
The fact that we the people
are setting up this government,

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:40.681
this is all about social contract.

00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:43.016
They are forming a government.

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:46.940
They're forming a social contract
with a government that is

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.168
going to protect, that is
going to establish justice,

00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:55.318
provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare.

00:09:55.318 --> 00:09:56.263
Let me make this clear.

00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:58.348
That is this, this is all social contract.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.736
This is what we expect, this
government that we're creating

00:10:00.736 --> 00:10:04.910
to do, promote the general
welfare and secure the blessings

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.410
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

00:10:09.373 --> 00:10:12.405
Now, what about things
like limited government?

00:10:12.405 --> 00:10:16.572
Well, just the very fact
that we have a constitution

00:10:17.565 --> 00:10:20.754
is a sign of limited government

00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:22.276
that it isn't just a pure

00:10:22.276 --> 00:10:25.327
democracy that whoever is governing

00:10:25.327 --> 00:10:27.604
is going to be constrained.

00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:30.604
The rights of the government
are going to be described by

00:10:30.604 --> 00:10:32.402
this constitution.

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:35.887
We also talk about the
Blessings of Liberty, so this is

00:10:35.887 --> 00:10:38.224
another reference to natural rights.

00:10:38.224 --> 00:10:40.476
The Declaration of Independence
is a little bit more clear

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.926
about natural rights or a little
bit more explicit, but the

00:10:42.926 --> 00:10:46.545
Blessings of Liberty does
talk about or that's maybe in

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.878
reference to natural rights.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.225
I will leave you there.

00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:55.555
As we study US government,
both the Declaration of

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:58.378
Independence and even more
so, the US Constitution are

00:10:58.378 --> 00:11:02.585
going to be things that we keep
going back to to understand

00:11:02.585 --> 00:11:06.739
how we are trying to form a
more perfect union and what is

00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:09.122
in line with the vision of our

00:11:09.122 --> 00:11:11.772
Founding Fathers and what isn't.
