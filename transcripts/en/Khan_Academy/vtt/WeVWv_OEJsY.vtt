00:00:00.775 --> 00:00:02.803
- [Voiceover] The graph
of F is shown below.

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:05.930
A total of 24 right hand rectangles

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:06.978
are shown.

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:09.417
So, what do I mean by
right hand rectangles?

00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:10.919
So, there's clearly 24 rectangles.

00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:12.108
You can count them.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.308
And right hand rectangle means that

00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:16.524
for each of these rectangles the height

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:19.357
of the rectangle is defined by the value

00:00:19.357 --> 00:00:21.499
of the function on the right hand side

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:22.429
of the rectangle.

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:24.377
So you can see this is the right hand side

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:26.313
of this first rectangle and if you take

00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:27.771
the value of the function of that point

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:29.748
that is the height of the rectangle.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.059
A left hand rectangle would define

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.852
the height of the rectangle by the value

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:36.080
of the function on the left hand side

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.827
of the rectangle.

00:00:36.827 --> 00:00:38.576
So, a left handed rectangle's height,

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:39.927
the first rectangle's height would look

00:00:39.927 --> 00:00:40.325
like that.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:41.652
That's what they mean by right

00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:42.891
handed rectangle

00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:44.962
Fair enough, eight in blue.

00:00:45.022 --> 00:00:47.311
We see that. 16 in red. All right.

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.847
All 24 of the rectangles
have the same width.

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:52.780
Which of the statements below

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.806
is or are true?

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:57.198
They give us three expressions

00:00:57.198 --> 00:00:59.400
in sigma notation and they say,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.679
like this first one is the sum of the

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.253
areas of the blue rectangles.

00:01:02.253 --> 00:01:03.182
This is the sum of the areas of

00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:04.101
the red rectangles.

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:05.464
This is the sum of the areas of all

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.586
of the rectangles.

00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:09.110
So, I encourage you now to pause

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.625
the video and try to
determine on your own,

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.242
which of the statements is or are true.

00:01:16.363 --> 00:01:19.354
So, I assume you've had a go at it.

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:20.529
Let's just go through each of these

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:22.720
and see whether they make sense.

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:24.182
So this first one, the sum

00:01:24.182 --> 00:01:25.701
of the areas of the blue rectangles.

00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:27.385
Well, we know we have one, two, three,

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:30.350
four, five, six, seven,
eight blue rectangles,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.849
and we're summing from one to eight.

00:01:32.902 --> 00:01:34.827
So it seems like we're summing eight

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:36.177
things right over here.

00:01:36.177 --> 00:01:39.195
This is one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:41.713
six, seven, eight.

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:43.928
So, this is looking good right over here.

00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:46.272
And then we take F of something

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.446
times one half.

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:50.595
So, we're not even looking at this yet.

00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:52.339
It looks like this would be the height

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:53.483
of each of the rectangles.

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:54.362
Remember, we're taking the value

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:56.021
of the function on the right hand side

00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:57.942
for the height, and this would be

00:01:57.942 --> 00:01:58.829
the width.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.166
So does it make sense that the width

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.427
of each of these rectangles is one half?

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:06.834
Well, the total distance between X

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:09.932
equals negative five and X equals seven,

00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:11.597
that distance is 12.

00:02:11.782 --> 00:02:13.784
Five plus seven, that's 12,

00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:17.005
and we're dividing it into 24 rectangles

00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:18.094
of equal width.

00:02:18.182 --> 00:02:20.521
So, if you divide 12 divided by 24

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.832
each of these are going to have a width

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.304
of one half.

00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.893
So this is checking out that the one half.

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:30.830
Now let's think about this part.

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.150
Let's think about the F of negative five

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.103
plus I over two.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.172
So, let's see.

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:41.186
When I is equal to one, so we're going to

00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:43.518
take one half times F of negative five

00:02:43.572 --> 00:02:46.541
plus one over two.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:47.329
Right?

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.084
I is one. So negative five plus one half

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:50.218
is going to get us to this point right

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:51.078
over here.

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:54.492
F of that is going to be this

00:02:54.492 --> 00:02:57.539
distance, this height right over here.

00:02:57.993 --> 00:02:59.606
This is consistent with these being

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:00.850
right handed rectangles.

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:02.897
So, this is definitely the case.

00:03:02.897 --> 00:03:03.904
When I is equal to one we're

00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:08.381
definitely finding this
area right over here.

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.753
When I is equal to two it's going to be

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:13.499
negative five plus two over two.

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:15.612
So two over two, we're going to add

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.549
one, we're going to go over here.

00:03:17.745 --> 00:03:19.761
So once again we're doing one half,

00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:21.903
which is this right over here.

00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:26.130
That's the width times F of negative five

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.967
plus two over two, which is F of negative

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:30.786
four, which is this
height right over here.

00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:32.532
So, once again that is that area.

00:03:32.593 --> 00:03:33.790
You can keep following it.

00:03:33.798 --> 00:03:35.763
Everytime we're taking the function

00:03:37.578 --> 00:03:39.774
this first one is negative five

00:03:39.774 --> 00:03:42.322
plus one half, and then for each

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.030
increment we're adding a half to

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.620
I guess the right hand side is one way

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.495
to think about it.

00:03:48.532 --> 00:03:50.545
So, this actually makes complete sense.

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:52.194
We're doing this for the first eight

00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:55.236
so this is indeed true.

00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:58.188
This is the sum of the areas

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.600
of the blue rectangles.

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:02.833
Now let's look at this one over here.

00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:04.416
The sum of the areas
of the red rectangles.

00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.762
At first this looks pretty interesting.

00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:09.753
We're taking the sum of 16 things,

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:11.740
and we do indeed have 16 things

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:12.740
right over here.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.401
We have the width of each of those

00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:18.472
16 things or for each of those things

00:04:18.472 --> 00:04:19.713
we want to figure out an area,

00:04:19.808 --> 00:04:21.660
and it is indeed the case that each

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.904
of these has a width of one half.

00:04:24.253 --> 00:04:25.872
But what happens when we take F of

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:28.512
negative one plus I over two.

00:04:28.797 --> 00:04:32.261
So, we're starting right over here at

00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.802
negative one.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:35.983
Negative one plus I over two.

00:04:35.983 --> 00:04:36.968
When I equals one we're going

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:38.428
to be at this point right over here,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.885
and F of that is going to be --

00:04:41.196 --> 00:04:42.034
You might say, "Hey, isn't that going

00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:43.322
to be the height of that rectangle?

00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:44.482
When I equals two isn't it going to be

00:04:44.482 --> 00:04:45.645
the height of that rectangle?

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:47.747
And when I is equal to three isn't it

00:04:47.747 --> 00:04:49.020
going to be the height of that rectangle?"

00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:52.384
And that's where we
have to be very careful.

00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:54.352
They're going to have the same

00:04:54.352 --> 00:04:56.612
absolute value, but these are going to be

00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:58.809
these are all going to be negative values.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.120
These are all going to be negative

00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:08.162
because we see between this value of

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.875
our function.

00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:11.701
So that looks like between negative

00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:14.274
one half all the way to seven our function

00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:15.601
is actually negative.

00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:17.029
So one way to think about it, you'd be

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.422
having negative height so when you

00:05:18.422 --> 00:05:19.972
multiply these two things you're going

00:05:19.972 --> 00:05:21.215
to get a negative number.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.541
So this whole thing is going to be

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.412
a negative number and so you're

00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:27.484
essentially going to get
the negative of the sums

00:05:27.484 --> 00:05:29.359
of the areas of the red rectangles,

00:05:29.527 --> 00:05:30.498
but that's not the same thing as the

00:05:30.498 --> 00:05:32.003
sum of the areas of the red rectangles.

00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:35.477
An area is, at least in
the traditional sense,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.066
you would expect to have, if you were

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:39.793
just seeing what's the
area how much carpet

00:05:39.793 --> 00:05:41.882
you would need to cover
this someone would say

00:05:41.882 --> 00:05:43.278
that will be a positive value.

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:44.778
But this is going to be a negative version

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:45.462
of that.

00:05:45.462 --> 00:05:46.596
So that is not the sum of the areas

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.958
of the areas of the red rectangles.

00:05:47.965 --> 00:05:50.574
It's the negative of the areas of the red

00:05:50.574 --> 00:05:52.466
rectangles. So we'd rule that one out.

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:54.265
Then this last choice.

00:05:54.468 --> 00:05:55.630
So, this expression is the sum

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.090
of the areas of all the rectangles.

00:05:57.573 --> 00:06:00.193
And so this one is going from I equals

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.110
one to 24.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.373
So it's literally 24 things.

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:05.505
It's starting here and
it just keeps going.

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.086
And if this said from I
equals one to I equals

00:06:08.086 --> 00:06:10.246
eight it would be the first choice,

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:12.036
but then this falls into the problem

00:06:12.036 --> 00:06:14.058
again of once we get
past, when we get to I

00:06:14.058 --> 00:06:17.464
equal nine this thing right over here

00:06:17.693 --> 00:06:19.233
will turn negative, and it's going

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:20.551
to give the negative area.

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.031
So it's essentially going to net out

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:24.299
this positive area against this negative

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:26.082
area right over here.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.104
So it's not the sum of the areas

00:06:28.104 --> 00:06:29.053
of all the rectangles.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.536
It's going to be this area

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.244
essentially minus this
area right over there.
