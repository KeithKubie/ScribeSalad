00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.190
Cara Delevingne, Miley Cyrus, and even Johnny
Depp’s Daughter Lily-Rose recently revealed

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.010
they are something other than straight.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.429
Hmm all ladies, just a coincidence or are
women more likely to be bisexual?

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:20.330
Human sexuality is stranger than what our
culture tells us.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.930
Alfred Kinsey was one of the early pioneers
to realize this.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.980
His famous 1-5 scale is still widely used
nearly 70 years later.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.150
Kinsey identified as bisexual and believed
most people fall somewhere in the middle too.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.550
While 2015 has been a huge year for advances
in LGBT rights, bisexuality still remains

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.210
an enigma to much of America.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.130
Some consider it a phase on the way to admitting
homosexuality or just a way to get attention

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.800
or have fun in college for women.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.610
And those misunderstandings and stereotypes
might do some real damage to bisexuals.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.340
Only 28% of bisexuals are out, compared to
over 70% of gays and lesbians, according to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.109
a 2013 Pew Research Center survey.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.440
So low visibility might be a reason why myths
about bisexuality are so hard to dispel.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.239
But let me reassure you, the latest research
says female bisexuality is very real.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.700
Many studies show that women are more likely
to say they’re bisexual than men.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.210
A recent study from the American Sociological
Association found that to be true.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.560
Researchers followed 5,018 women and 4,191
men from adolescence to young adulthood.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.340
The study asked participants whether they
had same sex attractions or sexual experiences

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.370
in the past year.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.990
And women did have a higher probability of
being attracted to both men and women.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.350
Earlier studies seem to find that women in
general are just more likely to be attracted

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.659
to both sexes.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.869
One early study, when I say early I mean 2003,
found that women both heterosexual and homosexual

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.930
were aroused by both male and female erotica.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.110
And a 2008 study published in the journal
Developmental Psychology also demonstrated

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.200
self disclosed fluidity in non-heterosexual
women.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.490
But perhaps more importantly, this study also
found that fluid sexuality isn’t just a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.490
phase.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.080
The survey of 79 queer women found that bisexual
women maintained their attraction to both

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.350
men and women over the course of ten years.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.149
But still bisexual women and women who didn’t
label themselves were more likely than lesbians

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.149
to change their label.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.840
But mostly it was a change between bisexual,
and unlabeled than it was to lesbian or heterosexual.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.830
Only 8% of women changed their identity to
lesbian or heterosexual.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.940
So think of the Kinsey scale.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.320
Sexuality is a spectrum, where most people
fall in the middle; certainly a lot of women

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320
do.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.940
But unfortunately, social biases codify attraction.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.360
The ASA study also found that social context
matters a lot when it comes to female sexuality.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.550
Women who were rated as more attractive by
their interviewers (there’s a big old asterisk

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.390
here), had higher levels of education and
avoid young motherhood, were more more likely

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.420
to rate themselves as “100% heterosexual”.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.570
The researchers think maybe romantic options
could influence a woman’s sexual identity.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.500
Even if she feels attraction to more than
one gender, a more attractive woman would

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.700
have better heterosexual options simply might
make her less likely to explore her homosexual

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700
options.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.780
And on the other side of that coin, maybe
that women who have had same sex experiences

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.740
are more likely to incorporate that attraction
into their identities.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.340
But the question a lot of people ask, is why
did homosexuality, or in this case bisexuality

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.340
evolve?

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.260
One of the most prominent theories is that
like bonobos, we bone to bond.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.320
Because sex feels good and is very intimate,
it could help create and strengthen social

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320
bonds.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.900
As for female same sex bonds, one study published
in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, puts

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.590
forward the idea that bisexuality helps women
raise their young.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.170
For example if a father dies a woman could
form an intimate partnership with another

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.170
woman.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.490
That extra set of hands could help ensure
that child reaches adulthood.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.060
Maybe we’ll never know the “reason”
for bisexuality.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.860
But really at the end of the day, bisexuality
is real.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.890
Science says so.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.890
People say so.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.440
People are aroused by and attracted to lots
of different things.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440
And that’s okay.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.440
And that’s beautiful.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.490
