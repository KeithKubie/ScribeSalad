00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.270
Learning management systems are tools or
collections of tools that are meant to

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.600
help teachers and educators with
the administration of their classrooms.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.409
They take a lot of things that
traditionally we may have done in

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.353
person or done by hand and
put them online or

00:00:13.353 --> 00:00:15.783
put them on a computer in
order to make things easier or

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:19.308
to help with distrivuted classrooms
like the one's here in the LMS program.

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:22.196
They might have things like
a grade book or a facility for

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:26.020
collecting assignments or
a workflow for grading assignments.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.870
By now, you're very familiar with one
particular learning management system,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.721
which is T-Square.

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.650
You've seen T-Square's assignment
system, its announcement system,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.870
its resources system,
its testing quizzes system, maybe.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.970
Those are all different tools that are
collected together under one management

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.610
system in order to try and deliver
a cohesive classroom environment.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.300
Even though we use a lot of tools here,
the ultimate goal of learning

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.950
management systems is to put
a lot of things together.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.820
Of course, one difficulty with
learning management systems is it's

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.890
easy to approach them from
a purely system perspective.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.160
It's easy to look at them as software
solutions to a software problem.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.670
But that actually can be
a little bit dangerous.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.500
To design good learning
management systems,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.850
we need to have some understanding
of the learning process as well.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.320
We need to have some understanding
of the pedagogy behind

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.410
learning management systems.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.450
We need to have some understanding of
the learning behaviors in which students

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.190
will engage while they're
using our systems.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.800
So that's what we'll
talk a lot about here.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.800
Not only what a learning management
system needs to be able to do, but

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.710
how to design it in such a way that it
actually helps the learning process.
