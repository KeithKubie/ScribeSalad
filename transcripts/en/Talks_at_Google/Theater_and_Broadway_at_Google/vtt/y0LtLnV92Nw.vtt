[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.520
BEN FRIED: I'm Ben Fried.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.560
I'm Google's CIO.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.940
I'm one of the site
leads here in New York.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.950
And I am thrilled and
overwhelmed to welcome

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.680
the playwright and cast of
"To Kill a Mockingbird."

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.668
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.470
It seems redundant to have
to introduce the crew here,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.040
but I will, Celia Keenan-Bolger,
Gideon Glick, Aaron Sorkin,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.580
Jeff Daniels, Gbena
Akinnagbe-- agbe?

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.140
I'm trying.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.515
GBENGA AKINNAGBE:
I know you are.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.420
BEN FRIED: The glottal G. I'm
sorry, not enough practice.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.420
And I have, actually,
a summary that I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.213
was given from the
publicists of the play.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.130
Do I need to summarize
"To Kill a Mockingbird"

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.790
for this audience?

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.290
No?

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.630
It seems like there's
better uses of our time.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.670
So anyway, so welcome.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.350
We're really, really, really
excited to have you all here.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.390
Thank you very much.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.258
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.770
And I guess it's a big week.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.190
Nine Tony Awards?

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.373
Congratulations.

00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:09.540
Nine Tony Award nominations.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.860
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER:
Nominations.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.305
BEN FRIED: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:12.400
Nine Tony Award nomin--

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400
I hope I didn't jinx it.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.520
Nine Tony Award nominations,
including to Jeff,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.930
to Gideon, and to Cecilia.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.430
Well done.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.410
And you set a record for, is it
highest grossing American play?

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.780
GIDEON GLICK: We
all look to Aaron.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.030
AARON SORKIN: We're actually
the first, second, third,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.450
and fourth highest grossing.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.020
We broke our own
record four times.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.554
BEN FRIED: Congratulations.

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:40.120
I guess it was
announced, in 2016,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.010
that Aaron was going to be
adapting the novel into a play?

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.950
I guess to start, Aaron,
what led you there?

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
What led you to the project?

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.630
Where did your
interest come from?

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.480
AARON SORKIN: The producer Scott
Rudin, with whom I've worked

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.198
a number of times, called me.

00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:59.740
He said, I have something very
exciting to talk to you about.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.740
After trying for a long time,
I've acquired the stage rights

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.060
for "To Kill a Mockingbird."

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.949
And he asked me
to write the play.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.510
And honestly, I felt
like it was a suicide

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.370
mission, but the
idea of doing a play,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.170
and I just loved doing plays.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.120
And he was dangling the
director, Bartlett Sher,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.160
in front of me, and the
chance to work with him.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.260
We knew in that first phone
call that it was going

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.210
to be Jeff playing Atticus.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.770
So the chance to work with Jeff
again was what made me say,

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.220
go ahead on the suicide mission.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.205
And I wrote a first
draft that was terrible.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.830
Really, the best you
could say about it

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.780
was that it was harmless,
which is probably

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.770
the worst thing you could say
about a play, and particularly

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.170
"To Kill a Mockingbird."

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.970
I was very gentle.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.280
I didn't want to ruin
anyone's childhood.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.580
And so I just I took the most
necessary scenes in the book

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.950
and I stood them up.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.670
And the whole
thing ended up just

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.390
reading like a greatest hits
album done by a cover band.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.160
There was really just
nothing to it at all.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.260
And Scott Rudin, the producer,
told me so, and he was right.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.350
But the big thing
he said, and this

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.542
was my big motivation going
forward, was simply this--

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:38.500
and I assume I'm talking
to a roomful of people

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.507
who have read the book,
seen the movie, or both.

00:03:41.507 --> 00:03:42.340
Here's what he said.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.820
Atticus can't be Atticus from
the beginning of the play

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.010
to the end of the play.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.220
He has to change.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.090
He has to be put through
something and he has to change.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.740
I thought, of course.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.345
I mean, a protagonist
has to have a flaw,

00:03:57.345 --> 00:03:59.470
has to be put through
something, and has to change.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.530
And flying home--

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.630
I live most of the
time in Los Angeles--

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.020
I just kept wondering, how
did Harper Lee get away

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.422
with an Atticus in the
novel that didn't change,

00:04:12.422 --> 00:04:14.380
that was the same at the
beginning of the novel

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.250
as he was at the end.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.208
How did Horton Foote,
who wrote the screenplay,

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:20.260
get away with an
Atticus who was the same

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.780
at the end of the movie as
he was at the beginning?

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.780
And the answer is that
Atticus is not the protagonist

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.670
in the book or in the movie.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.460
Scout is.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.400
She changes.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.130
She loses some of her
innocence and her flaws,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.230
that she's young.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.400
And I wanted to keep
Scout and Dill and Jem,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.650
who was played by Will Pullen.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.220
And I wanted to keep
them as protagonists.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.200
I wanted them to
change, but I wanted

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.130
to move Atticus front and
center, make him a protagonist,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.950
put him through something.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.480
That was the impetus for
the next draft that I did.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.130
And I did that draft over the
course of about six months,

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.200
sent it to Scott.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.110
And the way I knew that he
liked it wasn't from him

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.610
calling me and telling me.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.640
It was that six days later,
in the Sunday "New York Times"

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.920
Arts and Leisure section
in the fall preview,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.670
he took out a
two-page ad saying,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.200
"To Kill a Mockingbird," a
new play by Aaron Sorkin,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.650
opening Christmas 2018.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.630
There we were.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.050
BEN FRIED: So he's
a man of action.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.200
So a question for all of you.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.310
You had, I read, something like
18 months of rehearsal time.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.180
How did the play develop
over the rehearsal?

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.500
Did it develop over the
course of the performance?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.650
I say that having seen
you all perform it

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.630
on the first week of
November, and then

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.430
having seen it again
the week before last.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.808
So it seems like things happen
you learned along the way.

00:06:01.808 --> 00:06:02.600
What was that like?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.183
What happened?

00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:05.180
How did you develop
your characters?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.680
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER:
I would say one

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.790
of the great joys
of this process

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.540
was watching Aaron, who I
have admired for a very, very

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.340
long time, write and
rewrite this play,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.870
and understand what
needed to be pulled out,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.420
where he needed to cut the fat.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.060
So a lot of the
beginning process

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.880
was that, was us
sitting around a table,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.630
reading it, Aaron going away,
coming back with a new draft,

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.360
going away.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.730
I mean, and that happened.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.750
We did two readings.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.190
We did some workshops.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.270
And during one of the workshops,
Bart Sher, the director,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.300
he was like, this
section seems hard,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.050
and so let's try to stage it.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.440
And I had never worked on
something-- usually when

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.930
you began a theatrical
process, there's

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.230
like the set model and
the costume renderings.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.680
And they're like, this is
what it's going to look like.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.600
And in this version,
none of that existed.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.550
So the designers were coming.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.380
They were watching how we
were trying to build the play.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.700
And it was truly one of the
most collaborative experiences

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.940
I've ever had, because then
we started putting things up

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.540
on their feet.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.730
And Miriam, the set
designer, was like,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.350
maybe we could have
the jury over here

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.780
and the porch could
come in from the sides.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.330
And that's now what
our set looks like.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.230
So we went through all of
that developmental process

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.350
of trying to figure out how we
were going to tell the story.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.940
And then we had six
weeks of rehearsal

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.470
and six weeks of previews.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:46.140
And the previews were
really when shit got crazy,

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.380
because Aaron just kept at it.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.650
And I remember the
second week of previews,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.330
I was like, it's ready.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.458
We're ready.

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:57.000
And then six weeks
later, I was like,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.630
here we are, still putting
in new Aaron Sorkin dialogue

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.840
every single night.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.210
And we would rehearse a
version during the day.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.052
We would put it on its feet.

00:08:08.052 --> 00:08:10.510
And then at the end of the day,
we would say, it's no good.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.635
We're not going to do that.

00:08:11.635 --> 00:08:13.680
We're going to do the
version we did last night.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.110
And then we would come in the
next day with something new,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.980
and they would say, it's really
good, but it's not ready.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.000
So you do the version that
you did last night tonight,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.110
but tomorrow, we'll
put the version

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.170
in that you rehearsed today.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.080
So your brain is
just doing a lot

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.880
of mental Sorkinese gymnastics.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.049
I mean, it's exhilarating.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.559
And also, you're like, these
people did pay a lot of money

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.740
to be here so don't
ruin it for them.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.600
So that's sort of a snapshot
of what that looked like.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.440
BEN FRIED: Wow.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.705
Anything you want to add?

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.330
GBENGA AKINNAGBE:
That's what happened.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.320
BEN FRIED: Wow.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.450
So as a, perhaps,
naive audience member,

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.600
I had a question that has to
do with the performance, which

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.660
is to people who
are literate in TV

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.590
and in movies, the fractured
narrative that you have,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.240
the intersperses,
the trial and segment

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.640
with the different,
more linear narrative,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.260
it's very natural to watch.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.690
But I realized the second time
I saw the play, that can't

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.890
be the natural to perform.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.920
And that was before I even knew
that you were switching it up

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.770
and you were jumping
backwards and forwards across

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.750
takes on the performance.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.760
Is that kind of
fractured timeline

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.630
hard to work through as actors?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.870
Is there lots of
switching, and you

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.000
have to keep track of tense,
and am I an adult now,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.824
am I a child?

00:09:37.824 --> 00:09:40.350
JEFF DANIELS: We
heard that a lot.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.580
AARON SORKIN: Yeah, you didn't
like those conversations.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.760
You're like, enough.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.260
Yeah.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.102
I think it's still
even in process.

00:09:50.102 --> 00:09:52.310
And that's kind of the
beautiful thing about theater,

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.820
is that sometimes we were sure
we were adults in one scene,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.020
or in one narration, and now
we're just not, and vice versa.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.890
And I'll say it is
challenging to have--

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.860
sometimes you have
an emotional response

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.860
to something that happened
maybe four minutes ago,

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.737
but now there's a narration,
and in the middle of it,

00:10:13.737 --> 00:10:16.320
and then it comes back, and now
we're at the end of that scene

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.820
again.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.710
So then you have to be
emotionally present.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.290
So it's like a
weird juggling act

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.710
that you're doing, where
you're trying to ride the wave,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.170
but also kind of sit in the
emotion at the same time.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.370
AARON SORKIN: And for
them, in addition to

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:38.080
the juggling act of, am I an
adult, am I a kid right now?

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.520
They also talk to the audience.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.370
BEN FRIED: Yeah, they
break [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.360
AARON SORKIN: And it's more
than just exposition, especially

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.450
with Scout.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.760
She's trying to puzzle
something through with them.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:58.050
Once that happens, then the
logic, their logic on stage--

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.240
you have to ask yourself, if
I'm talking to the audience,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.100
aren't I in the Shubert
theater right now,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.510
but I'm also in Macomb?

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.130
And I might be a little
kid, I might be an adult.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.860
And we never actually say
how old the adult version

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.480
of the person is.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:27.320
So it is a lot for the actors
to get their arms around.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.490
Less gifted actors
than Celia and Gideon

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.590
and Will Pullen I
think either would just

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.290
become frustrated
with it or would not

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.340
bother to deal with it, but it
would just kind of be general.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.720
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: I also
think so many things in life

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.460
that that problem,
which presented itself

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.420
during the rehearsal, which
was the thorniest and the most

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.470
frustrating in the running of it
and the doing of it every night

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.670
has become the most gratifying.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.560
And because we had a good
director and a good writer,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.100
who didn't feel the need to
give absolutes about the answers

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.690
that we were in pursuit
of, it stayed open-ended.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.790
But we had a foundation
that was strong enough

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.610
that now, the doing of
it, because it isn't

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.100
so clear or linear,
I think is actually

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.560
more interesting to do it, if
you have to do it eight times

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.060
a week.

00:12:23.968 --> 00:12:25.010
GIDEON GLICK: For a year.

00:12:26.965 --> 00:12:28.590
BEN FRIED: Well, as
an audience member,

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.330
I can get that because you
never consciously ask yourself,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.540
wait, what point is it in this
character's life right now?

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.780
You just absorb
it and you feel it

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.510
without it having to have
been explained to you,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.860
even as it changes.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.913
AARON SORKIN: That's
helped right away.

00:12:44.913 --> 00:12:45.830
It's more than helped.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:51.350
It's set up, right away,
by Bart Sher, our director,

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.130
and the design of the play,
Miriam boother, our set

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.250
designer, Jennifer Tipton,
the lighting designer, and Ann

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.660
Roth, the costume designer.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.372
And when the curtain
goes up on the play--

00:13:02.372 --> 00:13:03.830
it's actually not
a curtain at all.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:10.820
It's a wall that kind of
resembles the side of a barn,

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.860
but weathered.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:18.770
It hasn't been tended
to in 60 years or so.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.782
When that goes up, if you
know "To Kill a Mockingbird"--

00:13:22.782 --> 00:13:24.740
most people who are
sitting in the theater do--

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.800
you're expecting to
see a front porch,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.020
or a bucolic rural
street, maybe an oak tree.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.470
You don't see any of that.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.150
You see something that
resembles the place where

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.050
they shot the Childish Gambino
video, This is America.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.630
It's an abandoned warehouse.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.600
It's a warehouse
structure, but again, it

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.400
hasn't been tended to,
visited in a long time.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.220
There are broken windows
and paint is peeling.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.033
And scout is standing on
stage, along with a newspaper.

00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:02.450
And the first line
of the play is,

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.720
something didn't make sense.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.950
And so what happens
is, because of that,

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.890
at least the effect is,
we're revisiting something,

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:17.520
this story that hasn't been
revisited in a long time,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.830
and we're going to ask
questions about it.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.450
And I guess that
was a very long way

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.370
of saying because
we don't start off

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.650
the play in a literal space.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.660
They bring in the
literal space when

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.427
they start talking about what
the court room looked like.

00:14:31.427 --> 00:14:32.760
Then characters start coming on.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.110
They bring in the literal space.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.720
I couldn't tell
them where exactly

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.645
they are when the play begins,
and I'm not sure I'd want to.

00:14:42.645 --> 00:14:43.270
BEN FRIED: Wow.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.093
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER:
You said it once.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.260
AARON SORKIN: I did, but
you didn't like the answer.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.120
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: I loved it.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.295
It was like a beautiful--
what did you say?

00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:52.337
AARON SORKIN: Oh, really?

00:14:52.337 --> 00:14:54.893
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: It was
like space or something.

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:56.560
AARON SORKIN: I
wouldn't have said that.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.030
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: No.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.822
AARON SORKIN: I'm glad
that it was helpful.

00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:02.177
I wish I could remember it now.

00:15:02.177 --> 00:15:03.760
GIDEON GLICK: I said
the astral plane,

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.795
the time-space continuum.

00:15:04.795 --> 00:15:07.003
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: Continuum,
that's what you said.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.270
BEN FRIED: OK.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:10.770
All right.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.910
Slight shift of subject.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.340
Jeff, moving on.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.886
AARON SORKIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:16.886 --> 00:15:18.910
GIDEON GLICK: We're in
the time-space continuum.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.440
BEN FRIED: Jeff, a
question for you.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.170
JEFF DANIELS: Continuum?

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.300
BEN FRIED: Someone described
Atticus Finch to me

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.030
as the patron saint
of fatherhood,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.510
at least as captured by Horton
Foote and by Harper Lee.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:36.670
And that seems like kind
of a heavy burden to carry.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.130
Did the new take on the
character, and this idea

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:44.320
of a journey and development,
make the approach

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.295
easier, or less daunting,
or maybe it wasn't daunting?

00:15:47.295 --> 00:15:48.670
JEFF DANIELS: When
Aaron said, do

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.870
you want to do Atticus,
it was, of course.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.540
Yeah, I wanted challenges
ever since "The Newsroom,"

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.640
and some other
things before that.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.390
"God of Carnage."

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.430
I've just been going, if
you aren't challenged,

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.750
then don't do this anymore.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.850
And this is the
ultimate challenge.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.880
I mean, you're taking on
not only Gregory Peck,

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.520
but you're taking on
paternal saint of whatever,

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.480
fatherhood, whatever that
means to people, whoever

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.650
Atticus is in their own minds
having read the book 27 times.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.910
You're taking on all that.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.750
BEN FRIED: Yeah.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.940
JEFF DANIELS: And
I didn't blink.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.750
I just didn't.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.090
Whether it's naive, or
whether it's just innocence,

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.880
or whether-- you know what?

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.420
I mean this is Google,
you hit Delete.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.470
You hit Delete on
all of that stuff,

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.470
because it isn't the
Horton Foote script

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.900
and it isn't the book.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.590
It's a play based
on the book and it's

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.890
what Aaron is doing with it.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.900
And I know how to
get around Aaron

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.390
and how to execute Aaron
in a way that he can--

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.690
and to be in a rehearsal
room with where

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.270
he gets the time to rewrite.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.890
That was the battle
on "Newsroom."

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:00.640
BEN FRIED: Really?

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.340
JEFF DANIELS: Was that he had
to turn it in Thursday at noon.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.220
That's it.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.000
That's it.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.359
And every two weeks,
this guy would come out

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.540
with 75 pages of, how
the hell does he do it?

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.170
BEN FRIED: Wow.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.140
JEFF DANIELS: But to
watch him have the time

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:20.619
to really do what playwrights
do, which is what he is,

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:21.760
it was thrilling.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:29.410
If we're going to climb Mount
Everest, and Harper Lee,

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.970
and the Pulitzer,
and Gregory Peck,

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.250
and all the people who
loved the book, then

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.190
who do you want in your foxhole?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.590
And you start
there, as an actor.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.310
You've got Scott Rudin, who
is the producer you need

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.430
for something like this and
the journey this one took,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:50.450
Bart Sher, who directs
operas in his spare time.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.870
And then you get into
that first reading

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.450
and you get these people.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.120
I mean these people were all
here in that first reading,

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.070
I think, way back in October.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.450
Other people kind of came and
went, but not these three.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.290
And Will Pullen also.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.770
We got a core group that
can now take this thing on

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.690
and now it's pedal to the metal
and fifth gear, and all that.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.510
Now, let's go.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.140
Who's with me?

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:17.670
Who's going?

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.490
And these people were, from day
1, let's go, and didn't blink.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:22.660
And that was thrilling.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.330
We may have failed.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.220
Oh my god, yeah.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.330
This had failure
written all over it.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.050
He does not measure up to
Mr. Peck, I'm so sorry.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.350
What he does to the
book is criminal.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.870
And why do you have three
adults playing children?

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.420
Going into that first preview,
that was all on the table,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.720
and it all worked,
and that's what

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.510
makes it even more gratifying.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.110
BEN FRIED: It really did.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.545
Hey, Gbenga, a question for you?

00:18:51.545 --> 00:18:53.420
So first of all, this
is your Broadway debut?

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.280
Do I have that right?

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:54.820
GBENGA AKINNAGBE: Yes.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.695
BEN FRIED: Well done.

00:18:55.695 --> 00:18:56.330
Well done, sir.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.238
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.340
GBENGA AKINNAGBE: It's
all downhill from here.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.100
BEN FRIED: So you wrote
this really powerful piece

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.530
for "The Washington Post"
some time ago about how

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.840
the show has affected you.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.130
And I was struck
by the way that you

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.660
speak about how far we have
not come for African Americans,

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.080
for black Americans, about the
feelings of safety that you

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.170
don't have, about how
the experience of being

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:32.220
Tom Robinson every night fills
your life as you go through it.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.470
What more can you tell us,
can you tell this audience,

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.020
about the process?

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.850
How do you feel, Tom?

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.490
How do you let that go
at the end of the day?

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.460
GBENGA AKINNAGBE: Brownies
and ice cream every night,

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.900
every single night.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.360
I'm not exaggerating.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.943
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER:
He's not kidding.

00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:51.890
GBENGA AKINNAGBE:
I'm not kidding.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.510
What she described, as far
as the development process

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.120
and the rehearsal process,
was quite accurate.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.650
For me, for a lot of us,
this was the most organic

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.190
coming to being of a piece
that we've ever been a part of,

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.840
at least for me.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.200
Having been able to
workshop it with them

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.180
for over a year, and then the
rehearsal period, and then

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.230
the previews, which went twice
as long as normal previews go,

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.125
so it really baked into us.

00:20:23.125 --> 00:20:26.380
But sitting around
the table and having

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:31.300
these minds and these
artists and Aaron really

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:36.850
do this work in front of us,
it felt like a safe space

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:41.380
where we could create
whatever this was going to be.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:48.250
And it helped me open up
and let go into this world

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.930
that we were creating,
which was not

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.820
and is not safe for
black people, and open up

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.190
and live that.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.090
And it was funny because when
we left the basement of Lincoln

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.210
Center, I was reluctant.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.070
I was like, why do
we have to move?

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.220
Let's continue to do
this for us every day.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.950
It was very gratifying.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.860
It was time for us to get the
hell out of that basement.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.550
But I had forgotten that it
was ever going to be part of,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.770
or disassociated
from the fact that it

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.600
was going to be on
a Broadway stage,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.970
that it was based on a book
that so many Americans felt

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.110
ownership of.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.600
It was just us doing it
for us in that basement

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.710
and just working on it,
working on it, which I loved.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.670
So that helped, when it was
time to go to that stage

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.110
and just do what we have--

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.780
like everything that Jeff said.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.970
We had the band
together and like,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.640
all right, you
work on that base.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.230
You tune the amp.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:52.390
So we got together and just do
what we started to learn to do

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.160
and what we loved doing.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.157
And then when we started to
do it in front of audiences--

00:21:59.157 --> 00:22:01.240
and you could feel,
especially the first few weeks

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.640
that audiences showed
up, just daring

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.460
us to screw up their childhood.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.460
I wish you would.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:06.820
BEN FRIED: Really?

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.278
GBENGA AKINNAGBE:
I wish you would.

00:22:08.278 --> 00:22:12.250
And then that started to
change when they felt like they

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.990
could trust us with it.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.200
But to answer your question,
having that process,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.090
leading up to it,
is what enabled

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.410
me to be able to do this there.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.470
Now, you mentioned
"The Washington Post"

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.490
piece that came out this
weekend, or this past weekend.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.430
I wrote that because
what I didn't realize

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.960
was how doing that,
playing this role,

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.920
in front of so many people,
so many white people

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.930
with disposable income,
how that would affect me.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.910
I did not see that
coming, and every night.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.210
Can we curse?

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.876
It started to fuck with me.

00:22:55.876 --> 00:22:57.753
BEN FRIED: Yeah, please, please.

00:22:57.753 --> 00:22:59.170
GBENGA AKINNAGBE:
So I just needed

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.560
to get it out and
express it somehow,

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.690
and I was fortunate enough to be
able find a platform, a venue,

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.440
to do so.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.960
But it's still
something I process.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.840
And taking into
everything that we

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.680
worked on into that
rehearsal space, when

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.670
it came to race and the use of
the n-word and class and so on,

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.870
and understanding it
intellectually and creatively--

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.890
but when I got out there
on the stage, the creative

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.840
and the intellectual
was right out the door.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.780
Because I'm looking
at audience full

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.260
of people who, most likely,
share the same politics

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.150
as I do, but are definitely
benefactors of this

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.790
really fucked up
system, and I'm playing

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.990
this role in front of them.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.730
So it was just
like, this is crazy.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.460
But it's a beautiful
opportunity as well.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.690
Did I answer it?

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.590
BEN FRIED: Yes.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.010
AARON SORKIN: I really
recommend the piece.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.720
Well, it's
magnificently written.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.490
I found it fascinating.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.040
And it's online, if you
know how to google it.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.020
BEN FRIED: We can provide
some help for that.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.635
So on the subject of process and
kind of touching on differences

00:24:12.635 --> 00:24:15.010
with the source material a
little bit, it was hard for me

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:19.108
not to read recent events
into the play, [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:19.108 --> 00:24:20.650
It was hard for me
not to hear echoes

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.400
of Ferguson and
Charlottesville and the murder

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.430
of James Byrd, who's
killer was executed,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.900
back at the end of April.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.280
It was hard.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.240
There seemed to be explicit
references to the language,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.160
like I said, the language
of Charlottesville

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.670
and the events of Ferguson
and the murder of James Byrd.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.600
Am I just hallucinating?

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.480
Was there intent to bring that?

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.490
AARON SORKIN: You're
not hallucinating.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.880
After that first draft,
which I just think scared me

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:57.090
into taking a chance,
doing something better,

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:02.702
one of the things that
I sort of vowed to do

00:25:02.702 --> 00:25:04.410
was that I wasn't
going to pretend that I

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.110
was writing the play in 1960.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.520
I'm writing it now.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.860
Things have happened since then.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.430
One of the things
that happened--

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.750
I had mentioned
before that Atticus,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.890
now as the central
protagonist, needed a flaw.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.230
In the book, in the movie,
he doesn't have one.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.260
He's a guy carved out of marble.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.970
He's the guy who
has all the answers.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:34.420
And in the play, I wanted
him wrestling with questions.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.440
So in searching for a
flaw, I thought, boy,

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.350
if I wasn't going to get killed
before giving Atticus a flaw,

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.240
what am I going to do,
turn him from a bad lawyer

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.360
into a good lawyer, a bad father
into a good father, a racist

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.740
then to someone who believes
in equality and justice?

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.070
I realized I didn't
have to give him a flaw.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.390
He already had one.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.500
It's just that when I
learned the book, at least

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.460
in the 7th, 8th, and 9th grade,
and I'll bet people still

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.130
today, that it's regarded
as a virtue, which

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:13.350
is that Atticus believes that
there is goodness in everyone.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:18.120
Atticus, throughout the
book, excuses racism.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:24.905
He excuses Bob Ewell as someone
who just lost his WPA job.

00:26:24.905 --> 00:26:27.240
So please, you gotta understand.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.690
Excuses Mrs. DuBose as someone
who recently stopped taking

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.270
her medication, her morphine.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.970
So you got to understand,
he excuses the whole town

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.050
of Macomb.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.340
Things happen slower here.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.360
This is the deep south.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.365
Don't worry, they'll catch up.

00:26:42.365 --> 00:26:43.740
There's goodness
in everyone, all

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:48.202
you have to do is crawl around
inside their skin for a while.

00:26:48.202 --> 00:26:49.410
There's goodness in everyone.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.600
There's goodness in everyone.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:59.502
And while I was dealing with
this as something, which now,

00:26:59.502 --> 00:27:02.430
a long time after I'd read
the book for the first time

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.430
and sort of formed my
thoughts about Atticus--

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.910
who'd always been
a hero, still is--

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.490
suddenly, this was like
a pebble in my shoe.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.250
I wasn't crazy about
this part of Atticus.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.070
Right smack in the
middle of thinking

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:21.330
that, Donald Trump said there
are fine people on both sides,

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.960
and that's what it is.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.470
Atticus is going to have
to, by the end of the play,

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.610
understand that there aren't
fine people on both sides,

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.970
and that his other mantra
throughout the play, which is I

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.240
know these people.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.077
My family, we've lived in this
and make them for generations.

00:27:41.077 --> 00:27:41.910
I know these people.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.202
They are friends and neighbors.

00:27:43.202 --> 00:27:44.190
I know these people.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.670
Sure, some of them are
still stuck in the old ways,

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.420
but none of them are
so far gone that they

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.695
would send an obviously innocent
man to the electric chair.

00:27:52.695 --> 00:27:53.820
He's wrong about that, too.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.090
And I felt like that
feels like today, too,

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.450
that a lot of us for the last
few years, no matter where you

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:05.960
are on the ideological spectrum,
a lot of us have felt like,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.590
God, I thought I knew my
neighbors in this country.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.520
I thought I knew everybody else.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:19.480
I didn't, personally.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.720
And a lot of people here
will roll their eyes

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.665
and say, welcome to reality.

00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:30.100
I had no idea the
level of misogyny,

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.620
until Hillary Clinton
ran for president.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.930
It's not sexism,
straight up misogyny.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.660
Anyway, you asked,
did the current--

00:28:40.102 --> 00:28:41.560
BEN FRIED: You
exceeded [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.102
AARON SORKIN: You
have to understand.

00:28:43.102 --> 00:28:44.710
Growing up in my
family, anybody who

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.780
used one word when they
could have used 10 just

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.170
wasn't trying hard enough.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.840
So did what's going
on now, yes, it just

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.240
made its way into the
air supply of the play,

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.480
into the water supply.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.272
BEN FRIED: So it's
something you mentioned,

00:29:02.272 --> 00:29:07.040
it's Calpurnia who challenges
Atticus, especially about

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.990
Mrs. DuBose at [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.820
She was a racist
before she got sick.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.343
AARON SORKIN: She was a negro
hating sack of dirt before.

00:29:13.343 --> 00:29:14.510
It was medicinally enhanced.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.302
JEFF DANIELS: Nice.

00:29:16.823 --> 00:29:18.990
BEN FRIED: Yeah, there's a
reason you're the writer.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.670
So the two primary African
American characters

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.370
have an agency and
an independence

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:30.550
that isn't present in the
prior material at all.

00:29:34.348 --> 00:29:34.890
It's amazing.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.110
Tom is, if you'll go back
to the source material,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.965
is very lightly
sketched, if at all.

00:29:39.965 --> 00:29:41.590
Maybe he's kind of
a Christlike figure,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.290
but we get no insight into him.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:47.290
And as an audience
member, the thing

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.750
that I saw that
was so impressive

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.560
was a man finding agency
in a situation where

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.840
his victimhood is
assured, where he

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.600
has no actual, for good
reason, has no expectation

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.650
of just treatment.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.080
But he finds a path to
agency and expression

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.600
that wasn't present
in the prior world.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.730
And in a different
way, Cal expresses

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:11.130
a voice, a grounded voice,
that we don't see elsewhere.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.340
How did that, really,
for the two of you,

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:17.120
how did you think about bringing
those ideas into the play?

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.680
And I think it's a big change
that really adds to the power,

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.217
measurably.

00:30:21.217 --> 00:30:22.800
AARON SORKIN: Yes,
you're right there.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.870
There are two, only two,
significant African American

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.700
characters in the book,
Calpurnia, Tom Robinson.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:40.840
And in a play about racial
friction in the Jim Crow South,

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.850
neither of the two African
American characters

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.470
really have anything
to say about it.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.750
And you're right, they
don't have agency.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.260
I always want to tread
lightly here because I do not

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.660
want to give the impression
that in writing the play,

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.530
I set out to correct
mistakes that I perceived

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:00.770
Harper Lee made.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:02.330
It's not it at all.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.880
It's simply, again,
that I wasn't

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.650
going to pretend I was
writing the play in 1960,

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.750
and I wasn't going to try to
do a Harper Lee impersonation.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:15.670
So I was just following my
own instincts a little bit.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:21.160
I thought, A, you simply can't
use African American characters

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:28.340
only as atmosphere,
and B, what a waste.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:34.990
These are two characters that
can be sensational characters

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:40.540
and add to kind of the
conversation of the play.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:50.670
So with Tom, Tom gets
to make decisions now.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:54.047
He makes the
decision now-- and I

00:31:54.047 --> 00:31:55.755
don't want to give
away too many spoilers

00:31:55.755 --> 00:31:57.310
if you haven't seen the play.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.700
He makes the decision
to go to court.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.480
When this play begins now, he
has a different lawyer, not

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.810
Atticus, and he's taken
a plea bargain 18 years.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.090
Then he makes a
different decision

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.680
after talking to Atticus.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.400
All of these decisions are based
on what is best for his kids.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.710
He's trying to
reason through that.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.640
And then in the second act,
he makes another decision

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.920
that I won't articulate.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.190
It is a spoiler.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:33.270
And it's a grave decision.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.010
I don't mean that
in the pun sense,

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:36.330
like Shakespeare would use it.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:40.920
It is a decision
that makes him dead.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.420
He doesn't know that.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.230
It's a serious decision
is what I mean to say.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.490
He gets a chance to
grab at this opportunity

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:50.040
to just take control
over his life

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.040
for one moment in the
midst of this trial,

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.350
where he's being accused of
being sexually monstrous,

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.970
where he's being
called the n word,

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.970
where he's being called boy.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:00.510
It's harsh.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.780
Plus, he's been in jail
seven months already.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:10.080
So he gets to do more than
just plead for his life.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.710
We get to see some
in our life there.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.820
GBENGA AKINNAGBE: But one of
the things that attracted me

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:20.100
to this project, aside
from the people involved,

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.950
is the perspective
of the creative team,

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:30.640
that they wanted to
eliminate as many instances

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.740
of this white savior motif that
is throughout literature, even

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.720
with great writers.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.570
I mean, I'll say
it, that Harper Lee

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.180
wouldn't be the first
amazing writer who

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.690
was blind to the full lives
of minorities, of women,

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:47.530
of the people.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.962
So it might not be
safe for other folks.

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:53.170
I don't want anyone to get
in trouble, but it's true.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.750
And this creative team
wanted to address that,

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.530
and so that was
attractive to me.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.680
And one of the immediate
ways to do that

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:12.199
is to give these two characters,
whose lives are affected,

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:15.980
one to the point where
his life comes to an end,

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.500
by what goes on.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.690
And I love the book,
but it was problematic.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.159
You have this
thing that happened

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:28.600
to this black person that
affects entire black community,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.449
and it's seen through the
eyes of this white family,

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:32.800
in this white little girl.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:40.150
Beautifully told, but to
me, that's problematic.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.320
And those are some
of the things,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.389
I think, the playwright wanted
to address and bring to life

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:50.320
and kind of fill
out on stage, and I

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.449
think he accomplished that.

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:55.960
BEN FRIED: I read somewhere
that all Harper Lee's friendship

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.270
with Truman Capote
influenced the construction

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.800
of the character of Dill.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.800
I was wondering, you
worked through rehearsal

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.240
to create that character.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.040
Was that an idea in
your mind somehow,

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.590
that the fact that Capote--

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.990
and I guess it is rumored
that he helped edit the book,

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.240
or something like--

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.740
GIDEON GLICK: Capote's his
life was infused into the text.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:20.710
I mean, his back story
was added in a small dose.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:25.840
And it is known that Dill
was based off Capote.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.580
And so yes, that was a gigantic
part of the inspiration

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.790
for this Dill.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.643
But what I also realized
was that this piece,

00:35:33.643 --> 00:35:35.560
it's about race, but
it's also about identity.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.270
It's about intersectionality.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.010
It's not just one thing.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:45.910
And that was something that
blew my mind, in that you

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:49.190
have a protagonist who
kind of feels like a boy.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.960
She's a tomboy, and her best
friend is this queer boy.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.350
And this is a book that
is taught ad nauseum,

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.220
and we don't talk about that.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.900
And so I was really excited
about exploding that and making

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.900
sure that this is going to
be talked about from now on.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.460
BEN FRIED: And it
is masterfully,

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.632
masterfully handle.

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:09.340
Because it is, again,
one of these things

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.810
that appears so
natural on the stage,

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:13.310
that you just see
it in front of you

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:14.530
without having to
think about it.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.310
GIDEON GLICK: Well, thank you.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.300
That's his doing, too.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.340
AARON SORKIN: You know what?

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.120
I appreciate that,
but this whole thing

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.040
has been a triumph
of collaboration.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.740
But during that process that
Celia was talking about,

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:32.110
the labs, the six-week rehearsal
period on the previews,

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:36.100
with Gideon and Dill,
I found, oftentimes,

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.480
we were following each other.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.458
You'd do something, and Bart
and I, standing back, would say,

00:36:42.458 --> 00:36:43.000
that's great.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.690
I get that.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:48.740
Let's codify that.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.560
Let's make more of that.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.630
So I was following Gideon a lot.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.210
BEN FRIED: So why
don't we start here.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:56.040
Ma'am?

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.040
AUDIENCE: Hi Thank you
all for being here today.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.555
I actually had a question
for Gideon and Celia.

00:37:00.555 --> 00:37:01.930
You talked a little
bit about how

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.263
you're deciding, or figuring
out, when you were an adult

00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:05.365
and when you were a child.

00:37:05.365 --> 00:37:07.490
But I was wondering, once
you had figured that out,

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:10.390
how did you try to inhabit the
characters differently and take

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.980
that knowledge into
your performance

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.815
and try to make those
characters slightly different?

00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:17.440
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: I think it
was sort of twofold, that there

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.680
was the physicality of kids.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.350
There is this really
amazing interview

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.500
with Harper Lee, where she
was talking about growing up

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.520
in Monroeville.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.640
And she just said,
we had nothing.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.980
There was nothing
there for us to do.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:38.620
So our imaginations
were the only escape

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.850
from the monotony of a summer
in Monroeville, Alabama.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.350
And that, somehow, just
planted a strong seed in me.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.960
Like, what do you do if you're
a kid and there's nothing to do?

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:56.620
And so a lot of what we ended
up building physically had to do

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:00.895
with, what kind of
games do kids play?

00:38:00.895 --> 00:38:05.140
Just how do you use the world
around you, an empty space,

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.570
like a stage, that
has nothing, and try

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.240
to create the life, the
physical life, of a kid.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.550
And so that was
a big part of it.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:18.160
I think, vocally, this in and
out of (HIGH-PITCHED ACCENT)

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.702
when I'm Scout, who's eight,
it's pitched way up here.

00:38:21.702 --> 00:38:24.160
And then (LOW-PITCHED ACCENT)
when I'm talking a little bit

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.890
older, I drop into
a lower register.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:32.020
That's just a stupid theater
trick that is as old as time.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.170
But there is that as well.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.410
And then I think,
honestly, the writing took

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:46.990
care of so much of who we were
and how these little creatures

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.630
went through the play,
that there was so much that

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:54.378
was there that I felt like
we could always do less,

00:38:54.378 --> 00:38:56.170
particularly when we
were playing the kids,

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.170
that I would have these
ideas and Bart was like,

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.950
don't do that.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.390
No problem.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.280
But that the writing
was good enough

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:09.940
and it supported us, both
as children and as adults,

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.560
that in doubt, do us.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.970
GIDEON GLICK: I can't
improve on that.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.360
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: Thank you.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.360
AARON SORKIN: I'm sorry.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:31.230
I just think Celia really soft
sold what these guys are doing.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.240
It's not just about
dropping down a register.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.140
They are doing something,
and have been doing it

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.870
since early in rehearsals, but
it just got better and better.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.980
They're doing something
much more nuanced than that

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:51.180
and it's, to me, a magic trick.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:56.650
It's the slightest
adjustments in their posture,

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.290
slightest adjustment
in their voice,

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:03.150
but just also a slight
adjustment in their attitude

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.770
going back and
forth, which they are

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:07.830
doing not just
throughout the play,

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:12.900
but they'll do it throughout
a scene, inside of a scene.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.020
And it's not at all jarring.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.520
I have never been a
particular fan of grown men

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.670
and women acting like children.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.890
I didn't like Jerry
Lewis or Lou Costello.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:27.120
It just creeps me
out a little bit.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.910
But this isn't at all like that.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.000
And so I just
think that you made

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.810
it sound much easier
than it actually is.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.600
AUDIENCE: My question is,
whenever you adapt something,

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.640
people forget it's
a different medium

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.110
and it's a different time.

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.480
And maybe it's just me and
watching too many YouTube

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.080
previews, but people get
very aggressive to take

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.630
the originalistic gospel
and everything that

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.330
deviates as like sacreligious.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:59.010
Where do you take the
courage to address changes?

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.140
And especially to
the actors, how

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.150
do you deal with
the backlash you

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.490
get and the critiques,
if people say, yeah,

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.615
you ruined my
childhood, or whatever.

00:41:07.615 --> 00:41:09.240
GIDEON GLICK: I think
it was definitely

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.865
terrifying in the beginning.

00:41:10.865 --> 00:41:14.910
And it was definitely
terrifying, conceptually,

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.910
for an adult to play a child.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.130
That's off-putting.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.470
But I will say, I
think what's kind of

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:26.790
remarkable is that because
the medium is different,

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.660
we get to do whatever we want.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.260
So it is a theatrical piece.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.320
And so in a strange
way, having, let's just

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.380
say adults playing children,
the audience is sitting there

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.960
and they go, oh, this
is not what I know.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.160
This is not the movie.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.300
This is not the book.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.190
This is a theater
piece that can only be

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.830
seen right now on this stage.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:50.070
And in a strange way,
what I was most afraid of

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.580
is actually what
freed us all up.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.913
BEN FRIED: Can I ask a quick
follow-up question on that.

00:41:53.913 --> 00:41:55.330
What do you hear
from audiences--

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.670
One of the amazing
things about Broadway,

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.170
you leave the stage
door and there's

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:00.060
a bunch of people
waiting to talk to you.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.978
What did you hear
from those audiences?

00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:04.770
GIDEON GLICK: A lot of
people go, oh man, I

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:08.160
came in really not
looking like this,

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.326
and really not looking like
those [? white ?] kids.

00:42:12.326 --> 00:42:14.490
But I say that was
what I find remarkable

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.220
is that the cult of
"Mockingbird" is big.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.410
And we're seeing a
lot of people who've

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:21.840
never seen a play
before, and that's really

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.270
the kind of the most remarkable
thing at the stage door.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:28.440
This is the first
play they ever saw.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.648
And yeah, it's just been
a remarkable experience.

00:42:33.648 --> 00:42:35.940
AARON SORKIN: In New York
City, a public school student

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.310
can see the play for $10.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:43.050
And so we've been doing
matinees that are entirely

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.900
filled with students.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:50.470
And as Gideon said,
for a lot of them,

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.820
it's their first time at a play.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:58.680
They respond differently than a
typical Broadway audience does,

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.520
but they are incredibly
enthusiastic and vocal

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.020
about it.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.810
BEN FRIED: I mean,
they're not jaded, right?

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:11.060
AARON SORKIN: No.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.510
When they like something,
they'll say something funny

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.070
and they'll laugh at it.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.920
And then they'll turn to the
person next to them and kind of

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.160
enjoy it all over again.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.022
And then they'll all
quiet each other down

00:43:24.022 --> 00:43:25.980
because they'll realize
the play is continuing.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.620
No one hit pause.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.020
And so they're kind of
learning how to watch a play.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.290
They're having a
great experience,

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:41.670
on top of which, I
think, that there

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:47.340
are kids leaving the theater
who it never occurred

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.560
to them before that they
might like doing what

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.800
Gbenga and Gideon and Celia do.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.630
And that they might
be good at it,

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:56.590
it just never occurred
to them to try it.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.593
And I like to think
that, once in a while,

00:43:59.593 --> 00:44:02.010
there's somebody who leaves
the theater thinking that they

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.070
might like doing what
I do and it never

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.150
occurred to them to do that.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.600
So anyway, if you
couldn't guess,

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.622
I'm proud of those $10
public school matinees.

00:44:13.622 --> 00:44:15.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you all
so much for being here.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.905
My question is for Aaron.

00:44:16.905 --> 00:44:18.780
One of my favorite things
you've ever written

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.290
was the open letter to your
daughters the morning--

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:22.540
AARON SORKIN: Oh, gee, thanks.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.760
AUDIENCE: --after Donald
Trump was elected.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.590
I was in this
office, at my desk,

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.470
shaking, holding back tears,
trying to stay professional,

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.270
trying to figure everything out.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.910
And there was a part of that
open letter that really got me,

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:36.370
where you said, well,
what are we going to do?

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.630
We'll fucking fight.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:38.290
We'll stand up.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.010
We'll roll up our sleeves
because America did not stop

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.910
becoming America overnight.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.760
And I'm wondering, when
in retelling this story

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.380
and sharing it with
so many audiences,

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.180
in America and globally,
how much of this

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:52.037
encompasses that fight
you're talking about.

00:44:52.037 --> 00:44:53.620
AARON SORKIN: That's
a great question.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:57.460
First of all, thanks very much.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.860
When I wrote it, it
wasn't an open letter.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.197
On election night
2016, I was in Toronto.

00:45:07.197 --> 00:45:09.280
I was about to start
shooting a movie the next day

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.080
and I wasn't home.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.050
But I was talking to
my daughter all night

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:17.320
as states started
turning red and people

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.040
started getting nervous.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.525
She was genuinely upset
when this happened.

00:45:22.525 --> 00:45:23.900
And I was saying
on the one hand,

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.400
I was really proud
that she'd become

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.990
engaged in something like this.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.360
But I saw how upset she was.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.080
And like a lot of people, I had
been telling her for a year,

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.390
for two years, please,
there's no way.

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:36.210
It's never going to happen.

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:40.780
So when you're a father and
you break that kind of promise,

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:41.950
it's tough.

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:48.650
I wrote the email to her early
in the morning East Coast time.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.560
And a couple of hours later,
a woman from vanityfair.com

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.280
got in touch with me somehow.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.280
I guess my daughter's mom
had maybe sent it to her.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.380
So that's how that happened.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.310
But yes.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.330
I could've been a lot
shorter by saying, yes.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:09.670
This is a part of that.

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:13.120
I enjoy writing romantically
and idealistically.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:17.140
And Scout's repetition
of All Rise,

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:22.400
and particularly at the end,
is meant as a call to action.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:23.980
AARON SORKIN: Thank you.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.647
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER:
Can I also just say

00:46:25.647 --> 00:46:29.620
that part of what has been so
special about this experience

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.750
is that I think there aren't
that many spaces where we get

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.950
to come together and
process these big questions

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:41.560
about our country and
where we have been

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.870
and where we are going.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.910
Church, I suppose.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.590
And Aaron gave a
speech this morning

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.890
about cathedrals and theaters,
that I was like, yes,

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:53.180
that is what you're doing.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.980
But that, in fact,
to come and see

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:59.450
a play where there is a real
transaction between the people

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.880
on stage and the
people in the audience,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.760
a play does not exist
without the audience.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.130
A movie or a
television show does.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:14.090
And to get to, during this
time, have a real conversation

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:17.150
and to create a space
for all of us to come

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.460
and be together with
1,400 other people

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:25.350
and process these big questions
about our country, it feels--

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.050
whatever you think
about the play,

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.960
you can think about the play,
but that act of coming together

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.070
is so deeply important
and so moving,

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.720
to me, to get to do every night.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.970
GBENGA AKINNAGBE: It's a gift.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.680
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: It is.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.878
BEN FRIED: I agree.

00:47:40.878 --> 00:47:41.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.150
So thank you for being
here and for making

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:47.750
some of my favorite things
ever on TV, on stage.

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.780
And my question for Celia,
because we talked a lot about--

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.750
you talked about playing a
child in this particular show.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.480
But I've seen you play
a child on stage before.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.090
I saw you in "Peter
and the Star Catcher,"

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:02.360
and I listened to
"Spelling Bee" often,

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:08.050
especially when I need to cry
a little bit, like good cry.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.268
I wanted to know if
this is a coincidence,

00:48:10.268 --> 00:48:11.810
or if it's something
you're drawn to,

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:15.350
or if you see Molly and
Scout and [INAUDIBLE] three

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:20.450
different beings, and just
they happen to be children.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:23.390
CELIA KEENAN-BOLGER: It's funny.

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:25.220
I don't know why I play kids.

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.070
I really don't.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:30.800
I mean, it was certainly not
anything I set out to do,

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.960
but it has been a
theme in my career.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.940
And there was a point when I
was like, I'm done with this.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.550
I don't want to do it anymore.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.970
And then things kept
coming up, where

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.290
I was like, oh, that's a
really, really great part.

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.290
Yeah.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.370
I said to Gideon once.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:53.860
I was like, it
feels like asking--

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.360
I don't know if you guys know
who Kelli O'Hara is, but she's

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.610
this glorious soprano--

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:01.490
like, why do you keep playing
these amazing ingénues.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:04.910
And it's like, there is
something inside of her,

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:08.300
the gifts that she was given,
which are this glorious voice,

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.920
that she just knows what to do.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.920
And the only thing
I can liken it to

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.900
is that there is
something inside of me

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.580
that knows what to do.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.290
And obviously, I really hope
this is the last kid I play,

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.500
but I bet it's not.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.080
I mean, there's a good
chance that it's not,

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.590
that I'm going to do it
again, and that will be fine.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:33.260
It's just something in my
career that has followed me.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.540
And I think, probably,
your body of work

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.890
always influences
where I am now.

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:42.740
And I'm sure there is a part
of Olive, to a part of Molly,

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.830
to a part of Laura in
"The Glass Menagerie."

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.640
You bring it all with you.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.560
So I think they're not
completely separate entities.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.797
But this is--

00:49:52.797 --> 00:49:55.130
I mean, I don't want to pick
favorites, but Scott Finch,

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.630
come on.

00:49:58.047 --> 00:49:58.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, Aaron.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.300
This is a question for you.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.940
First of all, I grew up
watching "The West Wing"

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:02.690
when I was seven.

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:06.050
It really means a lot to me,
so I really appreciate it.

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.750
My question is--

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:07.583
AARON SORKIN: Seven?

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.020
BEN FRIED: It's a young company.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.460
AUDIENCE: It means a lot
to my family as well.

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.867
They were older than
seven when it was on.

00:50:18.867 --> 00:50:20.450
My question is, do
you have any advice

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:23.240
for managing the
creative process,

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.410
specifically hitting deadlines
and what to keep in mind when

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:28.988
working against that?

00:50:28.988 --> 00:50:29.780
AARON SORKIN: Yeah.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.970
I'm probably the worst person
to get advice from on that.

00:50:43.526 --> 00:50:47.960
When you're writing a play,
when you're writing a movie,

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.320
and it's not going well,
you're not writing well,

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.500
you can call whoever
is waiting for it,

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.580
the producer, the studio, the
director, and you can say,

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.780
hey, I've kind of
run into a snow bank.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.420
I know I said I'd deliver
the first draft in June.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.055
It'll probably be
more like September,

00:51:04.055 --> 00:51:05.030
or that kind of thing.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.898
In television,
you can't do that.

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.190
You have hard deadlines
because of the air dates, which

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:13.610
means that you
have to write, even

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.280
when you're not writing well.

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.600
And that's a really
tough pill to swallow.

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.320
And then you have to
take that and put it

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.590
on the table for the
cast, for the table read,

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.215
and that's really
difficult. And then

00:51:27.215 --> 00:51:28.590
you have to point
a camera at it.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.360
Did you ask me about
managing anxiety?

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.170
Because I'm feeling anxiety.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:50.020
Listen, people ask me
if I get writer's block.

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.920
Writer's block is
my default position.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:59.526
I have periodic bursts
of, hey, I have an idea,

00:51:59.526 --> 00:52:01.840
a writable idea.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.180
But the rest of the time,
I'm climbing the walls.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.210
I love writing.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.000
I hate not writing.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.980
I hate what I'm supposed
to be writing and I can't.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.410
It drives me out of my mind.

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:15.330
I'm making it
worse, your anxiety?

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.150
AUDIENCE: I think it's
already much better.

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.870
AARON SORKIN: OK.

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:22.680
I have no advice.

00:52:25.137 --> 00:52:25.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:26.762
AARON SORKIN: Sure.

00:52:29.002 --> 00:52:30.460
BEN FRIED: On that
note, I'm sorry,

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.160
I'm told we are out of time.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:33.960
Thank you so much.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.770
AARON SORKIN: Thank
you very much.

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:36.853
BEN FRIED: Celia, Gideon,
Aaron, Gbenga, and Jeff.

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:41.480
[APPLAUSE]
