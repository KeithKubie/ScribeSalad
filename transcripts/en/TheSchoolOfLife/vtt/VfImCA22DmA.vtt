00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.800
It sounds paradoxical to talk of the problems of being beautiful

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.340
Almost so alive to all the advantages

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.600
But oddly, being beautiful isn't problem free

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.380
There are a range of ailments, too little discussed, that go with being extremely beautiful

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.900
And that we should all, perhaps, know a bit more about

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.380
Here are some of the greatest

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.000
The likelihood of having nothing to say is so high because

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.300
Since you were 12 you've never had to begin a conversation

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.100
They had to crack the jokes

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280
Just for the pleasure of seeing you smile

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.340
Indeed, you often wanted to put people off

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.700
Being a bit boring has been a sort of survival strategy

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.540
It's the only way to stop people pestering you

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.300
You are weird about your body

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.040
In bed you're always wondering, "Is it me, or is it my body they want?"

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.500
You want to be loved for the whole of who you are

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.960
But your exterior is so fantastic, it overshadows anything else

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.020
You want to be appreciated for your take on the french novel

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.220
Your loyalty to your troubled sister, your views on the future of the left

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.420
But even when people say the right things, the fears won't go away

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.660
They make too much sense

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.220
Everyone assumes you are stupid

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.360
They don't wait to find out

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.040
Their imaginations refuse to picture you carfeully unpicking a page of Plato

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.220
Or analysing the state of the Swedish economy

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.920
They like the idea of you being a bit dim

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.700
You can't be that beautiful and understand nuclear phsyics

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.480
That would be too much good fortune ending up in one place

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.280
Everyone insists you can't be very intelligent

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.720
No one imagines you have any problems

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.740
Fortune, people feel, has smiled on you already

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.580
You can't need anything

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.200
And that's why they hate you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.540
A fair few people just like finding fault with you

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.240
They feel you need to be shown that you're nothing special

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.580
Although you never claimed to be

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.780
They're using you

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.440
To vent their frustrations with life in general

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.120
You're fair game, you're too beautiful, they think, ever to be hurt

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.140
Ageing is worse

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.500
You have this rare thing

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.440
Your body is ideal... for now

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.300
That's why getting older terrifies you a lot

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.440
Yesterday you found another wrinkle

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.140
Your left knee twinges when you climb the stairs

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.140
You have so much to lose

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.860
You'll look in the mirror and foresee a wreck

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.680
From being so high, the fall will be harder

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.440
Fortunately, the problems of being very beautiful are transient

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.800
Thankfully no one stays at the peak of loveliness for long

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.200
Time will take your troubles away

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.480
In a few years, almost certainly, your looks will have lost their uncanny perfection

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020
Your physique will shed its grace

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.320
You'll be nice enough looking

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.840
But you will no longer be one of the outstandingly attractive ones

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.640
And you will no longer share in their unique

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.160
But very real, and very under-appreciated problems
