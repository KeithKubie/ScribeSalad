00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.220
In late February, came an announcement…

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.120
Astronomers had discovered Trappist-1!!

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.900
A potentially habitable planetary system!

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.760
The planets were Earth-sized and rocky!

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.760
There were seven!

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.550
That’s so many planets (probably)!

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.779
Now that the media has stopped losing their
collective chill, Seeker is here to bring

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.080
y’all back down.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.839
This is the image you probably saw of Trappist-1.

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:21.839
Beautiful right?

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.210
Well, guess what sport, that’s an artist
rendition.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.230
Here’s the actual image of Trappist-1.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.019
That’s the star.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.960
The planets are too small to be seen.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.250
It’s still great!

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.250
Revel.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.250
Love.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.250
Okay..

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.250
Now.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.250
You cannot move to Trappist-1.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.809
You cannot live on Trappist-1.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.309
Chances are nothing else does either.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.170
That said, it’s still exciting!

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.170
To catch you up.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.359
The hubbub came when NASA announced a multi-planet
system 39 light-years from Earth.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.280
The scientific paper was published in Nature
and detailed everything…

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.489
The seven exoplanets are “Earth-sized”
(not the same as Earth-like), and they orbit

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.999
really close to their star, Trappist-1.

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:03.280
The star is less than a tenth the size of
The Sun, and colder.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.130
So, several of the earth-sized planets are
in the habitable zone; meaning they orbit

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.229
the perfect distance to get surface temperatures
that could support liquid water (though that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.340
doesn’t mean they have any).

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.719
Some scientists got carried away, calling
Trappist-1 our “sister solar system,”

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.890
and some of your twitter friends were ready
to move there.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.480
Again, all very exciting.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.480
Then, to add to the hype, another study of
the Trappist-1’s planets found they’re

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.061
so close together, that if they were to harbor
life (and they didn’t say they would) any

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:38.320
meteor impact on one could throw life onto
their neighbors.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.840
Like blood spatter!

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.580
I should mention, they hedged their bets on
this, writing that the vacuum of space would

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.441
make it really hard for life to move from
one to the other, but if there was life on

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.870
one, there’d likely be life on more than
one.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.310
But, now, as is their job, A group of scientists
pointed the Hubble at Trappist and were like,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.670
woah woah, slow your yaw, NASA.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.270
With all these planets being so close to their
cool dwarf star (the farthest is 94 percent

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.570
closer than Earth)... they are definitely
bathed in radiation.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.570
X-Rays mostly.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.160
Trappist could release enough x-ray energy
to strip all its planets of their atmospheres.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.180
Yep.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.020
Chances are these earth-sized rocks don’t
have an atmosphere to support life, or your

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.200
twitter friends.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.180
On top of that, when planets are as close
to their star as the Trappist-1 planets are,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.200
gravity makes them “tidally locked.”

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.920
Meaning, they don’t spin relative to their
orbit.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.050
The light side bakes, while the dark side
is super cold.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.410
Further decreasing the chances for life.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.810
There is a small glimmer of hope: if perchance
the system is only 500 million years old,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.300
then the planets might still have atmospheres;
the x-rays wouldn’t have blown them away.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.900
The Hubble data could also show there might
be water vapor in the upper atmosphere of

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.440
the planets -- but there are no guarantees.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.600
More research is needed.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.760
So, again, probably no atmospheres, probably
no spinning, probably no life.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.590
But still exciting!

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.540
This is the most number of planets around
a single star, and the most that could hold

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.540
liquid water.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.900
Reminder: we didn’t know there were any
planets outside of our system until 1992!

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.240
And if any of the planets have volcanic activity,
or a magnetic field to protect the surface

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.200
(like we do) then the might have some type
of life on them.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.190
We’re going to keep an eye on this and will
update you if they find anything else out

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.960
(trust me, they’ll be lookin’).

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.340
In light of all this, would you still want
to visit Trappist-1?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.070
Tell us your thoughts in the comments.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.520
What if Pluto was a planet again?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.820
What if our moon was a planet?

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.440
What if we had 110 planets in our solar system?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.300
All of this could happen -- to learn more
watch this video.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.310
Thanks for watching everybody.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.060
See you next time.
