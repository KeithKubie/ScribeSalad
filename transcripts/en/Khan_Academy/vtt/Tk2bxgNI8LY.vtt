00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:02.663
- [Voiceover] A college
bookstore charges $60

00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:04.477
for a yearly membership.

00:00:04.477 --> 00:00:07.739
The first book is free
with the membership,

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:12.417
and any book after that
costs $7.60 including tax.

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:14.739
How much money, m, does a student spend

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.918
after buying b books
and a yearly membership?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:22.158
So m, the amount of money
that they're going to spend,

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:23.946
it's going to be the yearly membership,

00:00:23.946 --> 00:00:25.838
which is $60.

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:27.440
So we're gonna do everything in dollars.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.115
$60, plus the amount
that they spend on books.

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:35.238
So they're gonna buy b
books at $7.60 per book.

00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:36.938
So it might be tempting to say all right,

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.385
I'm gonna do $7.60 per book,

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:45.288
and then multiply that times b books.

00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:48.585
So this right over here
might be very tempting.

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:50.502
We have to remember something.

00:00:50.502 --> 00:00:52.961
The first book is free.

00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:55.429
The first book is free.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.430
So if you buy one book,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.322
you're not going to pay $7.60.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.714
You're gonna pay nothing.

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:03.421
If buy two books,

00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:06.533
you're not going to pay $14.20,

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.158
you're only going to pay $7.60.

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:11.283
So you're only going to pay for one less

00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:13.362
than the number of books you buy.

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:16.496
So instead of $7.60 being
times the number of books,

00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:19.353
it'd be $7.60 times one less

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:21.897
than the number of books you buy.

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:23.186
One way to think about it is

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.136
this b minus one, you could think of this

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:28.251
as books you need to pay for.

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.432
Books that are not free, I guess.

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:36.785
Books that are not free.

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.306
The first book is free,
and every one after that

00:01:39.306 --> 00:01:40.212
you would pay for.

00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:41.013
And this makes sense.

00:01:41.793 --> 00:01:43.148
If b is two.

00:01:43.148 --> 00:01:43.948
Two minus one.

00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:45.399
You're going to pay for one book.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.983
If b is 10,

00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:48.399
that means you're only gonna have to pay

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.560
for nine books.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.939
Nine times 7.60 plus the membership.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.380
All right, now let's see
which one of these choices

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.565
actually match what we just wrote.

00:01:56.565 --> 00:01:57.586
So this one doesn't.

00:01:57.586 --> 00:01:58.726
It doesn't include the membership

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:00.156
and doesn't take one from the b

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:01.744
to account for the free book.

00:02:02.737 --> 00:02:04.123
This one over here,

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.583
it does account for the free book,

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.183
but it doesn't account for the membership.

00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:08.693
So you don't want to do that.

00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:10.505
This one accounts for the membership,

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.808
but it doesn't account for the free book.

00:02:12.808 --> 00:02:13.934
And then we have this one here,

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.048
which is exactly what we wrote,

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:16.406
except they just swapped...

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:18.194
If you just swap these two terms.

00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:21.308
If you do $7.60 times b minus one,

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:22.493
plus 60.

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:25.401
So we're gonna go with
that one right there.
