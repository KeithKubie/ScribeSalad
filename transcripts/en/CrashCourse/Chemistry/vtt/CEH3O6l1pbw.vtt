00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.560
Propane, methane, butane, those single-bond
carbon chains we talked about last week,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.190
they are important,
but they're kind of boring.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.410
Alkanes are just more of the same, add another
carbon to lengthen the chain.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.490
But toss a double bond in here or there, and
the situation gets a lot more complicated,

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.420
and interesting, and delicious.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
Hydrocarbons can fuel cars and stoves and
stuff, but they can also fuel you:

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.740
dripping off your hamburger, melting into
your biscuit or frying up your tater tots.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.640
Delicious, marvelous, complicated fats.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.380
Fats have a bunch of jargon associated with them, that the average person uses daily and with abandon,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.980
despite having absolutely no idea what it
means.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.360
But they still jabber on about saturated, or mono- polyunsaturated, omega-3, hydrogenated, or trans.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.760
The differences between fats and what
makes them better or worse for you

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.260
is whether or not they have double and triple
bonds, and where and how those bonds occur.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.140
Seemingly trivial changes in the structure
of a carbon chain

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.920
can completely change the chemistry of the
molecule,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.680
including the chemistry of what happens when
you ingest it.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.720
Yes, your body can tell the difference between them, and by the time we're done here today, you'll be able to as well.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:14.380
[Theme Music]

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.000
Alkanes, as you'll recall, are saturated hydrocarbons.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.440
All of the carbons in a saturated hydrocarbon are bonded to the maximum number of atoms that carbon can accommodate: 4.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.380
In unsaturated hydrocarbons, some of the carbon atoms are double or triple bonded with each other,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.720
so they're only bonded with three or two atoms.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.960
And when those double and triple bonds appear,
we've got whole new classes of hydrocarbons.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.700
If they've got a double bond, we call them
alkenes, and those with triple bonds are alkynes.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.850
So three words representing three different
groups of organic compounds:

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.960
alkanes for all single bonds, alkenes if they
contain double bonds,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.070
and alkynes if they contain one or more triple
bonds.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.290
How do you remember which is which?
Well, I have a trick that I use.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.420
There's only one letter changing here: A in alkanes changes to E for alkenes and then to Y for alkynes.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.940
In alphabetical order, A is first, E is second,
and Y is third.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.440
Not too complicated, I hope.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.720
And it's actually pretty nice that the words
are so similar,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.970
because it means we can reuse all of those
old alkane rules.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.250
The prefixes remain the same, but the suffixes
change in some fairly easy-to-predict ways.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.620
Hydrocarbons that have one or more double
bonds end in -ene,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.190
while the ones that have triple bonds use
the suffix -yne.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.340
So a compound with 3 carbons and 1 double bond would be propene, 3 carbons and 1 triple bond: propyne.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.480
All the other naming rules apply to alkenes
and alkynes too.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.599
For instance, the main carbon chain, the longest one, is numbered in such a way that the various components,

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.980
including the double bond, have the lowest
numbers possible.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.280
Now, the bonds in alkenes have a few tricks up their sleeves. It's not as simple as you might imagine.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.180
Single bonds, also called sigma bonds, are
pretty simple,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.480
and carbon atoms attached by them can rotate
around the bond freely.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.959
That may not sound like a big deal at first, but alkenes and alkynes don't have that kind of freedom,

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.499
and that simple fact has a huge affect on
their properties.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.360
Double bonds consist of a sigma bond and a
pi bond.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.100
That pi bond bridges the sigma bond, locking
it in place.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.340
So whatever's attached to the other sides of the carbon atoms can't change their orientation with respect to each other.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.600
If all of those things attached to those carbons
are the same, it doesn't matter.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.620
But if the parts are different, it's possible to have two totally different isomers of the same compound.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.940
Let's build an example for ourselves.
2-butene should suffice.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.950
So it starts with but-, so it has to be a
4 carbon chain.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.740
It ends in -ene, so it needs to have a double
bond.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.060
The 2 tells us that the double bond starts
on the second carbon.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.000
So we've got our structure!
Or do we?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.280
With the information we have, this 2-butene
could be one of two different isomers:

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.020
one with the methyl groups on the same side or one with the methyl groups on different sides.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.100
They're not structural isomers like n-butane and i-butane, instead, they're what we call cis-trans isomers.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.260
These have the atoms in the same position on the molecule, but the atoms are oriented differently in space.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.460
Cis- comes from the Latin word that means on the same side and trans- is Latin based prefix that means across.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.680
If the matching groups are on the same side
of the double bond like this, we call it cis-2-butene.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.120
And if the two components are across from
each other, it's called trans-2-butene.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.720
Note, by the way, that organic compounds cannot switch from cis- to trans- or the other way around.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.860
You would have to break the pi bond, and thus,
the entire molecule to rotate between isomers.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.099
The same rules apply no matter what's attached
to the double bond.

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.409
It might be a long hydrocarbon chain or a
halogen or an oxygen.

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:23.300
All that matters is that the matching components are next to each other or across from each other.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.300
The triple bonds in alkynes, meanwhile, are composed of 1 sigma bond and 2 pi bonds for a total of 3 bonds.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.520
The pi bonds prevent the triple bonds from
rotating here as well,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.860
but triple bonded carbons can only bond to
one other atom, so even if it could rotate,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.140
nothing would change.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.960
Thus, no isomers with alkynes.
Phew.

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.069
OK I'm done describing for the moment.
Let's talk about some actual chemistry.

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.440
Pi bonds are significantly more unstable than
sigma bonds,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.840
so double and triple bonds are pretty easy to break, opening the doors for some good chemistry.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.039
Certain reactions open up a double or triple
bond to insert various atoms,

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.339
leaving only a single bond between the carbons.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.520
These are called addition reactions because atoms are added to the carbons that were previously double bonded.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.879
Probably the simplest addition reaction and
one that you've heard of is hydrogenation,

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.270
in which a molecule of hydrogen, H2, is added
across the bond.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.300
To do this, a metal catalyst like platinum
is usually required to help break the H2 apart,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.759
because that bond is very strong.

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.159
But once that's done, the hydrogen atoms readily
attach to the hydrocarbon molecule,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.040
converting a double bond to a single bond.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.860
Other molecules can break down a double bond
as well.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.379
If a halogen, such as bromine, is added in the place of hydrogen, the reaction is called halogenation.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.759
Water molecule: hydration. Oxygen gas: oxygenation.
You get the idea.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.300
The point is that double or triple bonds can
be usually opened up fairly easily.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.490
Alkenes can be made into alkanes and alkynes
can become either alkenes or alkanes

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.219
depending on how many atoms are added.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.480
And those opened bonds can also provide connections
for carbon atoms to attach to each other, too,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.060
opening the door for polymerization, which
we should talk about soon enough.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.759
Now, using all these words we learned today, let's apply some to our society's ubiquitous fat lingo.

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.089
First, though, what is fat?

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.479
When three fatty acids, and we will talk about their structures more specifically in a later episode,

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.759
are bonded to a molecule of glycerol, that
is a triglyceride.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.129
That's the stuff that we're generally talking
about when we say "fat."

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:14.379
The fatty acid chains, they have long hydrocarbon chains, are what we're mostly concerned with here.

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.189
They can be alkanes or alkenes, sometimes,
even rarely, alkynes.

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.399
So, we've heard of saturated fats. What does
that mean? It means no double bonds.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:27.240
All of the carbon chains are alkanes and has
as many hydrogens as possible. It's saturated.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.659
That means that there are no unstable pi bonds,
so they tend to have longer shelf lives.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.200
They are also able to lay flat against each other, making them more likely to be solid at room temperature.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.400
The bad news is that they're kind of hard for your body to do chemistry with since they're so stable,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.120
so they often just stick around in your body,
clogging stuff up.

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:44.209
Now, what about hydrogenated oils?

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:46.989
Vegetable oils are generally poly-unsaturated
fats,

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.029
meaning that they have lots of double bonds,
or at least more than one.

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.329
They're much healthier for us than saturated
fats and they're also generally cheaper.

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:59.060
Since saturated fats are most likely made from animals, which are notoriously difficult to maintain.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.920
But they're also less stable and are usually liquid at room temperature, and thus, harder to spread on your toast.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.400
Food chemists use hydrogenation to saturate the unsaturated fat, making it spreadable and also stabilizing it.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.560
And, since it's made from vegetable oil instead
of animal product, it is much cheaper to create.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.020
Sometimes the oils are fully hydrogenated,
creating saturated alkanes.

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.349
And sometimes, they're just partially hydrogenated,

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:24.819
usually leaving just one double bond in the fatty acid chain, creating a mono-unsaturated fat.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.089
Now it's not just whether or not there are
double bonds,

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:31.200
the location of the double bonds also has an effect on what your body can do with the molecules,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.560
which leads me to omega-3s.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.000
Omega-3 refers to a specific location of the
double bond.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.780
3 carbons from the end, or omega of the fatty
acid chain.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.700
Your body is completely incapable of making this sort of fatty acid, and yet, it need them to survive.

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:48.610
So, you have to eat them.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.699
A final question: what can you tell me about
the dreaded trans fats?

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:55.330
Well we know that they're unsaturated alkenes

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.309
because saturated fats don't have double bonds,
and thus, can't have cis- and trans- isomers.

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:04.599
But we also know from every advertisement
about healthy food that probably isn't that

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:07.739
healthy ever, that trans fats are really bad!

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.220
So it's an unsaturated fat, but it's really bad for you, that doesn't really jive. What's going on?

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.700
Well, almost all natural, unsaturated fats are cis- fats, which our bodies are prepared for and know what to do with.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.160
Trans fats are created by partially hydrogenating
vegetable oil on a cheap path to tasty fat,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.280
without all the saturated fat on the dietary
label.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.400
However, these trans fats pretty much act exactly like saturated fats, except that since they're naturally very rare,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.740
our bodies don't have good systems to break
them down into healthy byproducts.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:42.260
So, as you can see, unsaturated fats went from the best kind of fat to the worst kind of fat with 1 little isomeric change.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.759
Your body can definitely tell the difference.
And now, so can you.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.940
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.779
If you paid attention, you learned that hydrocarbons
with double bonds are called alkenes

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:56.900
and those with triple bonds are called alkynes and that the naming rules are the same as for alkanes.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:02.340
You also learned a little bit about cis-trans isomerism and learned a few important reactions of alkenes and alkynes

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.660
such as hydrogenation, halogenation, and polymerization.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.140
And finally, you learned what all of those names of the different kinds of fats really mean.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.900
