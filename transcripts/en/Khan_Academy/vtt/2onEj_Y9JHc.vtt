00:00:00.993 --> 00:00:01.685
Minli: Okay.

00:00:01.685 --> 00:00:02.902
Sal: So I'm here with Minli.

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:05.014
What do you do here at the Kahn Academy?

00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:07.490
Minli: I'm the Lead of Strategic Initiatives at Kahn Academy.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.942
Sal: And what are some of these initiatives

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:11.328
that are strategic?

00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:13.782
Minli: The initiatives that are strategic include;

00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:15.470
number one, our summer camp, so we're running

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.140
a summer camp this year that is going to be

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.367
in Palo Alto, it's called The Discovery Lab,

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:22.410
that's one of the strategic initiatives.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.685
Sal: And why are we doing this?

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.795
Minli: Well, I think the big reason why is that

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.430
we're known for online education.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.797
We are known to do the work in the classroom

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:36.188
so that teachers can free up time to do projects.

00:00:36.188 --> 00:00:38.184
One of the constant feedbacks that we get

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:40.182
from teachers is that they don't know

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:42.762
what projects to do in the classroom

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:44.200
now that the time is freed up.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.097
One of the intents of the summer camp is

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:49.248
to identify what are the projects that are fun,

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.603
that are also educational and interesting;

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:53.755
not forced education, like truly interesting ...

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:54.510
Sal: Not paint by numbers ...

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.546
Minli: Not paint by numbers, and people actually

00:00:57.546 --> 00:01:00.955
find that they actuallylearn something from it.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:04.131
So identify what those projects are and feel that out online.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:05.827
Sal: So it's kind of a "discovery lab" for

00:01:05.827 --> 00:01:07.189
all involved, the kids will discover ...

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.354
Minli: Yes, and then we will discover.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:10.896
Sal: And then we'll discover what works,

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:12.767
what's not, what's an idea appropriate

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:13.849
for different ages and ...

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:14.463
Minli: Yeah.

00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:15.181
Sal: And things like that.

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:18.768
What kind of stuff are we all looking at to do?

00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:22.982
Minli: We are doing a variety of things.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.352
One big thing is that we're going to do

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.376
a lot of robotics activities with,

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:29.438
they go by [unintelligible], so they go about

00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:31.761
learning about the mechanical structures of robots,

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.439
learning about the sensors; how so you use sensors?

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.250
And then probably doing some big competition

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.619
like we did a couple years ago.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.520
Sal: Lego Sumo Wrestling.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.855
Minli: Lego Sumo Wrestling was ...

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:41.852
Sal: The kids, it's amazing what they did.

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:43.767
They did a lot more than I would have expected.

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:45.350
Minli: And it's the Olympics this year which ...

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.064
Sal: Oh, okay.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.355
Minli: Which is even better (laughs) so

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:49.439
we can make it very [unintelligible].

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.021
Robotics is a big piece.

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:53.241
The second big piece is all the Math and Music stuff

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.431
that [Vai] does, so Vai and I had gone to

00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:58.268
a classroom a couple months ago and we did

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:01.390
a lot of creating platonic sonnets,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.687
creating geometric shapes with students

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:05.890
and giving them the intuition behind the Math.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.843
Sal: Right, the tangible, especially 3-dimensional

00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:11.491
Mathematics and 3-dimensional Geometry,

00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.361
it's kind of hard to really get a tangible sense

00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:14.422
without it being tangible.

00:02:14.422 --> 00:02:18.314
Minli: Yeah, exactly. We talk about things like

00:02:18.314 --> 00:02:19.724
the triangle being the strongest shape;

00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:21.224
why is the triangle the strongest shape?

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.358
Let's put one together and let's put a square together,

00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:25.330
let's try to twist and turn it, and then you realize,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.805
"Oh, this is why a triangle is stronger."

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:27.557
Sal: Right, so they believe and also get

00:02:27.557 --> 00:02:28.761
kind of an intuition for it.

00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:30.471
And some of the other stuff like

00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:32.176
random games and simulations.

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:33.642
Minli: Yeah, exactly. I'm going to do lots of

00:02:33.642 --> 00:02:35.979
games and simulations from the secondary training markets

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.314
that you did and some sort of economics training

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:41.477
I'm trying to make up right now, so it'll be fun.

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:43.634
Sal: That's exciting.

00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:44.974
Minli: I would want to go to this camp.

00:02:44.974 --> 00:02:48.882
(laughing)

00:02:48.882 --> 00:02:49.911
So I interrupted you ...

00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:50.413
Minli: Yup.

00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:51.558
Sal: So camp is one thing.

00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:53.697
Minli: Camp is one thing, and the second thing is

00:02:53.697 --> 00:02:55.278
in Generalized International Strategy,

00:02:55.278 --> 00:02:57.276
so how do we work with international partners

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:59.448
or international schools who want to use Kahn Academy.

00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:01.965
Sal: So there are people outside of ...

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:02.956
So what's going on?

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:04.107
You just went on a recent trip.

00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:05.666
Minli: Yes, I went on a recent trip.

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:07.536
There are many things going on.

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:09.118
I think generally when people hear about

00:03:09.118 --> 00:03:11.126
Kahn Academy, they're excited, which is great for us,

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:14.038
so there's a lot of pull of wanting to use

00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:16.247
Kahn Academy in schools outside.

00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:18.370
Sometimes it's just a matter of getting people

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.953
up to speed or just saying,

00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:21.890
"Here's how you can do this really easy,"

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.119
and then just getting them started.

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.455
That's one thing, but then the other bigger

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:30.731
implementations that people are doing for example,

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:35.209
just last week I was in the state of Senora in Mexico.

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.290
They are giving out one laptop per child,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.411
a PC to each student, then they're also providing

00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:42.171
internet access.

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:43.234
Sal: Each student in the state of Senora?

00:03:43.234 --> 00:03:43.979
Minli: Each student in the state.

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.293
Sal: There's like 300,000 students or something.

00:03:45.293 --> 00:03:48.259
Minli: Yeah, so they're providing each student

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.779
with a computer and they're starting with 10,000 first,

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.442
and I saw it just last week,

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.491
each computer is labeled with the child's name

00:03:56.491 --> 00:04:00.695
and a serial number so they can track all the computers.

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:02.338
They're also providing internet access as a

00:04:02.338 --> 00:04:04.998
constitutional right; and on top of that,

00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:08.214
in their portal, they have put Kahn Academy content,

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.201
both in Spanish and in English, so that the

00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:13.168
students can access the content, so that's an example.

00:04:13.168 --> 00:04:16.728
Sal: So these aren't just urban students,

00:04:16.728 --> 00:04:18.756
the middle class, you saw kids ...

00:04:18.756 --> 00:04:21.063
Minli: We started off at a really indigenous location,

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:23.995
which was called [Beckham] and these are students,

00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:26.285
it's their first time using computers,

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:28.789
so they're going to have to learn computer

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.664
literacy and then show them some of the

00:04:30.664 --> 00:04:33.748
Kahn Academy content, they're intrigued by it.

00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:37.674
I think it's just a big change process from there.

00:04:37.674 --> 00:04:40.524
That's one ... Other organizations,

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:43.452
South Africa, there's a couple of organizations,

00:04:43.452 --> 00:04:46.702
they're doing the translations into the native language

00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:49.226
and they're doing an after school program

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:52.118
that's really interesting ... Doing offline implementation.

00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:53.534
There are a lot of exciting things going on

00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:56.355
on the international front ... Mostly volunteer-driven.

00:04:56.355 --> 00:05:03.620
Sal: Wow. How did you end up here?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.047
Minli: I was excited by the mission the first time

00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:11.782
I heard about Kahn Academy and my background is

00:05:11.782 --> 00:05:13.811
I spent a couple years in social welfare in

00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:16.508
the Singapore government really focused in

00:05:16.508 --> 00:05:17.381
on low-income families ...

00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:18.092
Sal: That's where you grew up, Singapore?

00:05:18.092 --> 00:05:19.612
Minli: Singapore is where I grew up.

00:05:19.612 --> 00:05:23.231
I was there for the first 20 years of my life.

00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:24.790
Sal: You also taught in Singapore.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.824
Minli: I did. I taught high school Math and

00:05:27.824 --> 00:05:30.876
I had about 200 something, almost 300 students.

00:05:30.876 --> 00:05:32.766
Sal: 300 students that you were teaching at ...

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:34.701
Minli: No, in separate classes during

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.061
the same amount of time.

00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:37.731
Sal: You taught high school Math in Singapore

00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:39.365
and also worked for the government.

00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:41.311
Minli: The government, with low income family policy,

00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:44.071
focus on education and child care.

00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:47.584
I always felt like I needed to give back in some way.

00:05:47.584 --> 00:05:50.199
After that, I went to McKinsey and Company and

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.282
I did some management consulting work.

00:05:52.282 --> 00:05:53.280
Sal: You were a hot shot consultant.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.617
Minli: I attempted to be, but after five plus years of that,

00:05:57.617 --> 00:05:59.198
I decided to revert back and this was

00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:02.155
a good place to merge the two experiences.

00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:03.734
Sal: What's it been like so far?

00:06:03.734 --> 00:06:05.624
Has it been what you expected?

00:06:05.624 --> 00:06:07.538
Is it different, better, worse?

00:06:07.538 --> 00:06:10.095
Minli: I keep telling everyone I know,

00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:11.204
which can be annoying sometimes,

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.000
but I tell them it's the best job I've ever had.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.870
I love this job.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.174
Sal: You say that even when I'm not in the room?

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:18.703
Minli: I say it, yes. I say that constantly.

00:06:18.703 --> 00:06:20.840
I say it on my Facebook page, I think my friends

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.866
might start getting annoyed about that, but

00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:24.812
I truly believe ...

00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:27.873
Sal: But why is that other than

00:06:27.873 --> 00:06:29.757
our very good vacation policy?

00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:33.289
(laughter)

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.615
Minli: I think it's the fact that it's

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:38.281
a good team of people who are truly passionate

00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:41.057
about making a change.

00:06:41.057 --> 00:06:44.371
I think the change that we're trying to make

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:46.907
is of such scale ... We're 25 people right now

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:50.172
and we're heading 4.5 million unique users a month.

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:53.188
That's huge scale and I get excited about

00:06:53.188 --> 00:06:55.907
the fact that the things I do will impact

00:06:55.907 --> 00:06:59.287
this group of students or actually not just students,

00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:01.228
people around the world who just want

00:07:01.228 --> 00:07:03.319
to learn something different.

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.964
Sal: What's your sense of, like the summer camp,

00:07:04.964 --> 00:07:07.263
this is going to affect, there were over

00:07:07.263 --> 00:07:08.602
a hundred students this summer, how does that

00:07:08.602 --> 00:07:10.029
affect the scale?

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.986
Minli: I think if we are very clear in our minds

00:07:12.986 --> 00:07:14.611
that yes, it is targeted towards the

00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:16.535
[unintelligible] group of students right now,

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:19.318
but the intention is that these learning things

00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:20.743
that we find from the summer camp will be

00:07:20.743 --> 00:07:22.182
scaled out on a website and therefore

00:07:22.182 --> 00:07:24.494
available to the millions of students.

00:07:24.494 --> 00:07:27.403
That's how we're scaling the findings

00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:28.570
from the summer camp.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.069
Sal: What's your sense, where do you want to

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:32.076
see all of this going, especially you were

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:33.259
a teacher in Singapore, a lot of people

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:35.027
hold up Singapore as kind of, it doesn't seem like

00:07:35.027 --> 00:07:37.657
it has a very good education system.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.153
What do you think was working there,

00:07:39.153 --> 00:07:40.300
what would you like to see more of,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.236
what do you think ...

00:07:41.236 --> 00:07:44.103
Minli: I think in general, just as a teacher

00:07:44.103 --> 00:07:46.295
whether you're in Singapore in a good education system,

00:07:46.295 --> 00:07:47.574
and I was teaching in a fairly good school,

00:07:47.574 --> 00:07:49.488
but even then you had levels of disparity,

00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:52.371
even within the classrooms and across the classrooms.

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.680
I always felt that when I went into the classroom,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.622
it was like you just give a big, sort of sigh

00:07:58.622 --> 00:08:01.008
and you go, "All right everybody! Follow me!"

00:08:01.008 --> 00:08:03.116
and you're like, "Yes! Come on everyone!

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:05.659
Let's learn Math together!"

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:09.218
It was hard, even in a really good school with

00:08:09.218 --> 00:08:11.574
very good students because you knew that

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.105
you were addressing the needs for that student,

00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:15.361
you knew that student was getting lost,

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:17.068
you knew that student was bored,

00:08:17.068 --> 00:08:18.896
but you were trying your best to do all of that

00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:20.319
and just perform in front of the class and

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:22.199
keep everyone entertained in the 15 minutes

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.599
that you got, right?

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:27.202
I think regardless of where the teacher is,

00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:30.849
many teachers have this issue that

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:32.612
they have to deal with.

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:35.734
I think Kahn Academy helps you do that quite a bit

00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:38.643
because you eliminate the fact that you need to

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:42.237
have to entertain the entire class in one way

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:44.356
and one way only, everyone gets to go

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:46.814
at their own pace and then you can track

00:08:46.814 --> 00:08:48.979
where everyone is so you can intermediate.

00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:51.816
Otherwise, it's hard to understand where it is

00:08:51.816 --> 00:08:53.799
that you really should focus in your time.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.068
Sal: Yeah, very cool.

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:55.821
Minli: Yeah.
