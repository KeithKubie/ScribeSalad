00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.650
At this point it's tempting to
be satisfied with the result.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.850
After all we've found a relatively
low order polynomial solution

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.430
for our problem.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.680
On the other hand the sort of flow
networks we're dealing with here

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.340
are very specialized.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.320
They have all unit capacities and
this bipartite structure.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.900
Our algorithm doesn't
exploit this at all.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.960
In the remainder of the lecture,
we'll look at the special structure more

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.030
closely, gain some additional
insights about bipartite matchings.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.190
And finally these will lead
us to a faster algorithm.
