00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
I like to think of myself as an

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830
I like to think of myself as an
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.559
I like to think of myself as an
uncertainty evangelist right like I'm

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569
uncertainty evangelist right like I'm
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.419
uncertainty evangelist right like I'm
gonna I'm gonna big like just shouting

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429
gonna I'm gonna big like just shouting
 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.370
gonna I'm gonna big like just shouting
it from the rooftops we should all be

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
it from the rooftops we should all be
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.650
it from the rooftops we should all be
embracing uncertainty and in that I

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
embracing uncertainty and in that I
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.180
embracing uncertainty and in that I
think that you know one of the most

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190
think that you know one of the most
 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.950
think that you know one of the most
common things that people are saying to

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
common things that people are saying to
 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.859
common things that people are saying to
me is isn't uncertainty a barrier to

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
me is isn't uncertainty a barrier to
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.140
me is isn't uncertainty a barrier to
barrier to success I think there's a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
barrier to success I think there's a
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.340
barrier to success I think there's a
couple of things I think that first of

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
couple of things I think that first of
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.560
couple of things I think that first of
all this idea you know I don't know or

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
all this idea you know I don't know or
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.720
all this idea you know I don't know or
I'm not sure or it could turn out a lot

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
I'm not sure or it could turn out a lot
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.099
I'm not sure or it could turn out a lot
of different ways or you know all the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
of different ways or you know all the
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.330
of different ways or you know all the
different ways we might express

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
different ways we might express
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.070
different ways we might express
uncertainty well I believe this things

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
uncertainty well I believe this things
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.990
uncertainty well I believe this things
to be true but I'm like 60% on it I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
to be true but I'm like 60% on it I
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.319
to be true but I'm like 60% on it I
think they were taught from the earliest

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
think they were taught from the earliest
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.780
think they were taught from the earliest
little like as we walk into you know

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
little like as we walk into you know
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.990
little like as we walk into you know
preschool that you know I'm not sure and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
preschool that you know I'm not sure and
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520
preschool that you know I'm not sure and
I don't know they're like strings of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
I don't know they're like strings of
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.619
I don't know they're like strings of
dirty words or something I mean last

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
dirty words or something I mean last
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.180
dirty words or something I mean last
time you put I don't know on a test what

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
time you put I don't know on a test what
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340
time you put I don't know on a test what
happened to you pretty sure you got

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
happened to you pretty sure you got
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.549
happened to you pretty sure you got
marked wrong but the thing is that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
marked wrong but the thing is that
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.130
marked wrong but the thing is that
that's really a shame certainly it's a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
that's really a shame certainly it's a
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319
that's really a shame certainly it's a
much more accurate representation of any

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
much more accurate representation of any
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970
much more accurate representation of any
kind of prediction of the future right

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
kind of prediction of the future right
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.260
kind of prediction of the future right
if I say to you well I think that we

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
if I say to you well I think that we
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.760
if I say to you well I think that we
should implement this business strategy

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
should implement this business strategy
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.609
should implement this business strategy
because here's how it's gonna turn out

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619
because here's how it's gonna turn out
 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.200
because here's how it's gonna turn out
well I hope that you're not saying I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
well I hope that you're not saying I
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570
well I hope that you're not saying I
know the foreshore it's gonna turn out

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
know the foreshore it's gonna turn out
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.039
know the foreshore it's gonna turn out
that way that's just not an accurate

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
that way that's just not an accurate
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.539
that way that's just not an accurate
representation in the world too many

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
representation in the world too many
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.550
representation in the world too many
things can intervene there's too much

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
things can intervene there's too much
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.810
things can intervene there's too much
luck involved in the way that things

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
luck involved in the way that things
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.999
luck involved in the way that things
turn out even if I know for sure what

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
turn out even if I know for sure what
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649
turn out even if I know for sure what
the mathematics are right even if I've

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
the mathematics are right even if I've
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.190
the mathematics are right even if I've
got a coin I've examined it I know it's

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
got a coin I've examined it I know it's
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.039
got a coin I've examined it I know it's
a fair coin with a heads and a tails so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
a fair coin with a heads and a tails so
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710
a fair coin with a heads and a tails so
I know it's gonna land heads or tails

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
I know it's gonna land heads or tails
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.800
I know it's gonna land heads or tails
50% of the time right I still don't know

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
50% of the time right I still don't know
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330
50% of the time right I still don't know
how it's gonna turn out on the next flip

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
how it's gonna turn out on the next flip
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.149
how it's gonna turn out on the next flip
so if you ask me if I flip this coin

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
so if you ask me if I flip this coin
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.819
so if you ask me if I flip this coin
what's it gonna land there's one sense

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
what's it gonna land there's one sense
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.170
what's it gonna land there's one sense
in which I can tell you something with

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
in which I can tell you something with
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.760
in which I can tell you something with
some certainty I can say well if I've

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
some certainty I can say well if I've
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.760
some certainty I can say well if I've
done my homework I can say well 50% of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
done my homework I can say well 50% of
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770
done my homework I can say well 50% of
the time it will land heads and if you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
the time it will land heads and if you
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.210
the time it will land heads and if you
say to me well no that's not what I want

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
say to me well no that's not what I want
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280
say to me well no that's not what I want
you to tell me what's it gonna land my

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
you to tell me what's it gonna land my
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.069
you to tell me what's it gonna land my
answer has to be I don't know right I

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
answer has to be I don't know right I
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.389
answer has to be I don't know right I
mean that how could I so a it's just

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399
mean that how could I so a it's just
 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.080
mean that how could I so a it's just
uncertainty as a more accurate

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090
uncertainty as a more accurate
 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.850
uncertainty as a more accurate
representation of the world and I'd like

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
representation of the world and I'd like
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.100
representation of the world and I'd like
to argue that the more accurate your

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
to argue that the more accurate your
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840
to argue that the more accurate your
representation in the world the better

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
representation in the world the better
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.910
representation in the world the better
your decisions are and the better you're

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
your decisions are and the better you're
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800
your decisions are and the better you're
gonna propel yourself to success so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
gonna propel yourself to success so
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.300
gonna propel yourself to success so
that's number one but we're taught that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
that's number one but we're taught that
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.249
that's number one but we're taught that
it's a bad thing I think the other

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
it's a bad thing I think the other
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170
it's a bad thing I think the other
problem is that I think that we really

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
problem is that I think that we really
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.450
problem is that I think that we really
confuse

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460
confuse
 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.600
confuse
confidence with certainty and there's a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
confidence with certainty and there's a
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.800
confidence with certainty and there's a
difference you know one of the things

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
difference you know one of the things
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.720
difference you know one of the things
that I used to say in poker when people

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
that I used to say in poker when people
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.310
that I used to say in poker when people
would ask me about it they'd say don't

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320
would ask me about it they'd say don't
 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.960
would ask me about it they'd say don't
you need to be like super confident to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
you need to be like super confident to
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.480
you need to be like super confident to
be a great poker player and I'd say well

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490
be a great poker player and I'd say well
 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.890
be a great poker player and I'd say well
it kind of depends on what you mean by

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
it kind of depends on what you mean by
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.950
it kind of depends on what you mean by
confidence right there's one thing which

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960
confidence right there's one thing which
 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.080
confidence right there's one thing which
would be I would sort of view with

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
would be I would sort of view with
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.820
would be I would sort of view with
hubris in the face of the game is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830
hubris in the face of the game is
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.620
hubris in the face of the game is
thinking that you know much more about

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630
thinking that you know much more about
 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.030
thinking that you know much more about
the game than you actually do because

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
the game than you actually do because
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.340
the game than you actually do because
the game is incredibly complicated the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350
the game is incredibly complicated the
 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.720
the game is incredibly complicated the
more that you learn about it the more

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
more that you learn about it the more
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.280
more that you learn about it the more
that you figure out that you don't know

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
that you figure out that you don't know
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.860
that you figure out that you don't know
very much about the game so sort of this

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
very much about the game so sort of this
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.360
very much about the game so sort of this
there's this expansion of your knowledge

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
there's this expansion of your knowledge
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.120
there's this expansion of your knowledge
of what you don't know as you go through

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130
of what you don't know as you go through
 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.890
of what you don't know as you go through
and how little you really know that's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
and how little you really know that's
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.900
and how little you really know that's
even as you're getting better at it it's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
even as you're getting better at it it's
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.580
even as you're getting better at it it's
sort of on you know your unpeeling it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
sort of on you know your unpeeling it
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.570
sort of on you know your unpeeling it
and there's just more and more layers

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580
and there's just more and more layers
 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.800
and there's just more and more layers
underneath it and so I really look at

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810
underneath it and so I really look at
 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.830
underneath it and so I really look at
the game of poker and I say gosh I

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840
the game of poker and I say gosh I
 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.180
the game of poker and I say gosh I
really don't know very much about this

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
really don't know very much about this
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.700
really don't know very much about this
I'm really unsure about the strategy I

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710
I'm really unsure about the strategy I
 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.110
I'm really unsure about the strategy I
really don't know how to solve this

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120
really don't know how to solve this

problem that's different being than
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.590
problem that's different being than
being confident in the face of your

being confident in the face of your
 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.690
being confident in the face of your
opponents so those are two very very

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
opponents so those are two very very
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.580
opponents so those are two very very
separate things and I think we conflate

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
separate things and I think we conflate
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.860
separate things and I think we conflate
the two so that what we think is that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870
the two so that what we think is that
 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.580
the two so that what we think is that
being confident is being certain and

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590
being confident is being certain and
 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.710
being confident is being certain and
here's the problem again it's not an

you so how do we get more information we

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240
you so how do we get more information we
 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.150
you so how do we get more information we
go and seek out the opinions of other

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160
go and seek out the opinions of other
 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.520
go and seek out the opinions of other
people but in order to do that a we have

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530
people but in order to do that a we have
 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.960
people but in order to do that a we have
to be willing to look for it which we

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970
to be willing to look for it which we
 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.190
to be willing to look for it which we
won't do if we already believe we're

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200
won't do if we already believe we're
 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.170
won't do if we already believe we're
certain what's the motivation to go look

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180
certain what's the motivation to go look
 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.460
certain what's the motivation to go look
for more information if you're certain

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470
for more information if you're certain
 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.390
for more information if you're certain
and we want to open the door to other

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400
and we want to open the door to other
 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.970
and we want to open the door to other
people to tell us what they know to get

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980
people to tell us what they know to get
 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.890
people to tell us what they know to get
their opinions when they have

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900
their opinions when they have
 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.670
their opinions when they have
information that is useful to us that

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680
information that is useful to us that
 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.290
information that is useful to us that
will really help us update a belief we

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300
will really help us update a belief we
 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.790
will really help us update a belief we
want them to be able to share it with us

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800
want them to be able to share it with us
 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.060
want them to be able to share it with us
so when people ask me is an uncertainty

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070
so when people ask me is an uncertainty
 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.810
so when people ask me is an uncertainty
a barrier to success I just turn it on

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820
a barrier to success I just turn it on
 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.520
a barrier to success I just turn it on
its head and I say well don't you think

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530
its head and I say well don't you think
 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.320
its head and I say well don't you think
certainty is don't you think that's the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330
certainty is don't you think that's the
 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.980
