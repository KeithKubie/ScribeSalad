[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:07.680
NIKO SCHROER: Hey, everybody,
and welcome to Engagement

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.770
is the New Black.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.520
I said, my name is Niko.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.500
I'm a BD Manager for
Google Play based out

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.320
of Berlin, looking after
Germany, Benelux markets,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.550
and so on.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.350
Later during this
presentation I will

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.849
be joined by the great Markus
Falk from the cool app Lifesum

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.890
to share some first hand
experience on the topic,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.220
as well.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.250
So probably when
you read this title,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150
and even now, you're like, why
is engagement the new black?

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.590
What's up with that title?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.290
So let me quickly give
you an introduction

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.780
to where we are coming from.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.460
Last year, at
Playtime in London,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.710
actually, my colleague
Matteo did a wonderful talk

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.770
on what app developers
can learn from games.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.340
I'm pretty sure a couple of
guys were here and saw that.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.970
Quick show of hands?

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.230
OK, that's a good 50%.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.010
Awesome.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.690
So that talk was
super well received

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.170
and as a follow up
to that, we actually

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.920
ran a second event which
was a workshop completely

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.659
on onboarding on
conversion, which

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.700
we ran, I think, in February
in our London office

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
with partners from the UK,
but also all over from Europe.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.880
Anybody that attended this
workshop in the audience?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.450
Cool.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.330
So one of the main things that
was discussed in this workshop

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.200
was-- one very obvious
one, that obviously you--

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.450
all you do on this
onboarding and conversion

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.490
is in order to get lifetime
value out performing

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.750
the cost per install.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.820
Right?

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.706
That's an obvious one.

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:41.580
And then when you looked
into lifetime value,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.730
and that's one thing that really
resonated with a lot of people,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.000
it really depends on
three things heavily.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.830
That is retention,
engagement, and monetization.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.650
I'm not going to go too much
into monetization because we

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.920
have a full session on that
just after this today that's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.527
going to talk all about this.

00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:03.610
But I really want to focus
on retention engagement

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.901
because it's such an important
driver to your business.

00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:09.030
And the question that came out
of the crowd outlined this.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.730
So therefore, for me, this
is really the new black.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.470
And it's really
interesting to see

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.480
how the conversation
I've been having

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.690
over the last couple of years
in this job has shifted from,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.870
"oh, I have many downloads,"
to "I have that many installs,"

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.980
to "oh, well really do this
to really engage your user."

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.410
So it's quite a key topic.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.720
Before we do that,
there was one thing

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.960
that's kind of the antagonist
of retention engagement.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.440
Can anybody guess what that is?

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.980
It's churn.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.720
Right?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.170
The users that are not engaged
and that are not retained

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.690
is the users that are churning.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.930
So I very quickly want
to take a deeper look

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.610
into what churn
actually means before we

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.410
move on into the
next session, where

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.030
I want to show some ways--
easy fixes-- on how to actually

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.090
engage and retain your users
before we get Marcus on stage

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.840
and share some of their
insights they have.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.036
So let's face it, churn really
happens to the best of us.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.704
It doesn't really matter.

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:15.120
I mean, it does matter, but
even if you built the greatest

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.920
product out there,
even if you're

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.490
one of the top 10 developers
on the Play Store-- most

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.730
successful-- you
would still lose

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.277
a good portion of your users.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.000
And I think that's natural.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.300
It's part of any business to
customer relationship, not only

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.088
the apps world, but in
basically any business.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.490
And there are some
common things that we see

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.890
in, actually, our
industry, why that is.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.670
So let's face them.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.630
Let's name them.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.520
What are some common
reasons for churn?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.603
And I would really appreciate
if you help me there

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:55.640
because there are many.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.210
Any ideas?

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.380
Just yell them out loud.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.524
AUDIENCE: The user didn't
understand what it does.

00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:04.440
NIKO SCHROER: Awesome.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.292
Yeah.

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:06.415
AUDIENCE: It's boring.

00:04:06.415 --> 00:04:07.290
NIKO SCHROER: Boring.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.450
Another one.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.230
So I tried to come up with
as many as I could find.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.810
Number one, usually, is
poor technical quality.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.750
And if you saw the lounge
presentation this morning,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.930
it was actually mentioned that
really low ratings are often

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.930
caused by technical stability.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.460
Number two was actually spot on.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.850
It's insufficient
value proposition.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.840
So the product is just not
there or it's not good enough.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.990
The third one is, maybe
the product is good enough

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.190
but you're not making
it clear to the user.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.953
So it's not-- they don't really
know how great your product is.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.920
Or you're just not fresh enough.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.010
The content is outdated.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.320
The functionality is outdated.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.986
You're not keeping
pace with the market.

00:04:53.237 --> 00:04:54.570
Or it's not personalized enough.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.160
It's too interchangeable, right?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.280
It's great, but others do
it as well and the user,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.470
they like to try new things.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.470
So they go to something
else and they don't know

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.590
why they should be coming back.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.214
And I think that's a classic.

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:08.880
You just overdo it
on push notifications

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.290
or general communication.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.720
That's a classic one as well.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.860
And many, many more that I
think cause problems and that

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.270
cause you guys headaches.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.520
And I know this from the
various conversations

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.660
I have with my partners and we
have as a team with partners.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.390
However, what I personally
really, really love

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.140
about this industry is that
you guys never stay with,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.200
oh, this is the problem.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.360
It's always about, oh,
wow, this is the problem

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.690
and it's also an opportunity.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.700
How can we actually
use these things

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.030
and turn them around
into something better?

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.870
And what I really love
about my job at Google Play

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.090
is that I work with so many
interesting and forward

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.780
thinking partners, and that
I actually have the chance

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.120
to see all these different
tactics and fixes

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.130
and so on they use in order
to retain and engage users.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.150
And what I want to do now is
share some of the knowledge

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.117
we have gained in that
topic back to you guys.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.890
So here's a list of about seven
common themes that I personally

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.980
think, and I learned from
various conversations

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.050
and meetings and also
preparing this topic,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.110
that you simply cannot ignore
if you want to retain and engage

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.670
your users.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.230
You will see these
slides more often,

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.270
so if you don't manage
to the photo just now,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.310
it'll come back.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.110
One short disclaimer on this.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.650
It's by no means
an exclusive list.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.004
There are many, many
ways or many things

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.170
that could be added to this.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.378
And if you really feel like
there's something missing

00:06:48.378 --> 00:06:50.510
or we should investigate
another bullet

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.972
or even if you think something
is not right on this list,

00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:56.180
I'm very, very much looking
forward to your feedback.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.340
And I encourage you,
just like everybody else,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.150
to have that conversation with
me, with anybody in the room,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.247
and keep the conversation going.

00:07:05.247 --> 00:07:06.830
What I'm going to
do now is, I'm going

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.790
to go through each of
them in a bit more detail.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.160
And I would invite you
to not only listen to me,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.130
but also to kind of actively
go through your product

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.520
and think about how you you're
dealing with different things.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.680
And you'll probably find that,
being leading developers,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.120
you're doing a great job
on many of them already.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.700
But first of all, there's
always room for improvement,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.140
no matter how good it is.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.300
And second of all,
also keep in mind

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.240
that, maybe you are very much
aware of all these things,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.610
but maybe within
your company that's

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.500
something you can
spread more and engage

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.502
more colleagues on this.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.990
So first things first.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.120
Let's talk about the importance
of having a good value

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.690
proposition.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.190
I know.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:52.689
I know.

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:55.670
It seems super,
super obvious and it

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.530
has been mentioned
through various talks

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.360
that I've seen today.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.610
But it's just really,
really important

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.440
to have to have
that crystal clear.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.670
Here are some things,
or some questions,

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.880
that I think you need to
have the right answers to.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.662
And again, it's not
necessarily only

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.120
you having the
right answers to it,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.630
but also make sure
these answers are

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:23.070
known across the various
teams and across the company.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.340
So first of all,
what is your USP?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.970
It could be many different
things, depending

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.920
on which vertical you're in.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.409
If you're a publisher and you
you publish news or stories,

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.159
then the quality of
the story could be one

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.725
of your selling propositions.

00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:40.100
If you're a fitness
app, it could

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.520
be that you motivate your users
very well to actually exercise

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.540
more, and so on.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.780
That, I think, is the
most important bit.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.490
But also keep in mind that
your users are usually not

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.120
one homogeneous group, but there
are different user cohorts.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.790
So there may well
be more than one USP

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.560
that is really important
for your business.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.760
The second one is, what does
engagement mean for you?

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.600
And as trivial as that
question sounds, really think

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.080
hardly about, what is it
that you want the user to do

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.020
that actually makes them fall
in love with your product

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.410
and come back and actually
start building this relationship

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.730
with you as a developer
or as a product offering?

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.480
And third one, it kind of goes
along with number one or two.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.490
What are the
corresponding KPI's?

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.027
Like whenever I have
conversations with partners--

00:09:31.027 --> 00:09:33.110
and I think that's probably
the same when you have

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.800
conversations among each other--
you compare a lot of KPI's.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.460
But it's not necessarily
that the same KPI's

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.790
are as relevant for
everybody in the room, right?

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.780
If you're, let's say,
a document storage

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.700
app that really helps me secure
all my important documents,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.790
then actually retaining
me over a year

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.055
and having me log in once a year
maybe a super important KPI.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.180
While if you build a social
app, on the other hand,

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.290
you want to look into sessions
per day that it generates.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.545
So be really aware of what
KPI's are important to you.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.650
Number two is, again, I
think a somewhat obvious one,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.660
but I want to give you
a certain angle to it.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.740
It's to fully utilize the
potential of the Android

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.990
platform.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.350
And in the talks this
morning, again, we

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.530
heard a lot from Mark and
from Ellie, and [INAUDIBLE],

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.654
and so on, how much
we are investing

00:10:29.654 --> 00:10:31.820
in making sure that the
platform grows and gives you

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.670
more and more opportunities.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.920
However, doing this is also
a great way, or a great tool,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.160
for engagement and retention.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.700
In one of many great
examples, WeVideo-- it's

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.230
actually a video editing app--
they changed their whole UX

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:56.630
to material design and were
able to increase user engagement

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:02.230
by 100% from doing that,
just because the experience

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.820
became so seamless and
understandable and great

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.860
for users.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.450
And it goes beyond that.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.110
Adopting stuff like Android
Auto, Android TV, or Android

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.900
Wear can also make
a huge difference

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.775
on how you engage your
users with your app.

00:11:18.775 --> 00:11:20.150
So another question
for you guys.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.780
Are there any golf
players in the audience?

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.200
Any golf players?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.460
There is one.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.370
This is-- ah, there
is another one.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.980
I thought this is Great Britain.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.820
It's a common sport.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.730
Anyways, if you are into golf,
you may actually know Hole 19.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.817
It's an app.

00:11:38.817 --> 00:11:41.150
I think it was also featured
in the opening video today.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.000
You saw, actually,
people playing golf,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.570
so you might be familiar
with it from that.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.980
It's an app that gives you
all the distances and GPS

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.040
data on golf courses.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.871
I think to have about
40,000 golf courses

00:11:52.871 --> 00:11:53.870
in the world mapped out.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.222
It lets you do digital
scorecards, track your scores,

00:11:56.222 --> 00:11:58.430
and then obviously share
them with your other golfing

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.440
buddies.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.710
They brought their app to
Google Wear and what they saw

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.130
is a 40% increase in
monthly active users,

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.020
with Android Wear
actually bringing

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.950
some of the most engaging
[INAUDIBLE] all of them.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.460
They actually go as far that
they tend to call themselves--

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.950
or they tend to call the
app a "wear first" app,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.266
and it makes a lot of sense.

00:12:20.266 --> 00:12:20.890
Think about it.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.200
You are on the golf course.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.460
You just hit a birdie or a
hole in one or whatever it is,

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.660
and you want to track it.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.890
It's much more convenient
to do it on your watch

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.160
and on your wrist, than
getting out your phone

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.370
and logging into the app.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:40.700
So another great way to
engage and retain your users.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.520
Moving on to the
third fix or tactic,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.460
and that's probably
my personal favorite,

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.250
making user onboarding great.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.890
And it also came out
of the Q&amp;A from Peak--

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.160
what is probably the
most important thing

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.350
for engaging users?

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.360
It's user onboarding.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.070
It's not only my
favorite topic, I also

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.530
have my favorite analogy for it.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.610
First time user onboarding
is like a first date.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.960
So basically, you get
all the excitement,

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.180
you get the full,
undivided attention,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.670
and you can ask all the
questions in the world

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.180
that you want to learn about
the preferences from the other,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.990
from your user or
from your date.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.460
You do all this with
only one goal in mind--

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.557
to get another date.

00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:28.640
And then hopefully another
date, and another date,

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.960
and turn this into a
long-lasting relationship.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.870
But with all that, we
also know-- oh, sorry.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.980
Too fast-- that it's tricky,
because there's also so

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.110
much room for it to go wrong.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.170
So what I want to try
to do on the next slide

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.120
is give you some very
simple guidelines

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.100
of things you should
keep in mind when

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.990
you build your onboarding.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.710
And again, go through your
onboarding along these points,

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.920
and see if you actually meet
the full amount of points

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.940
on all of these.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.990
So the first one is, it
should be fast and seamless.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.669
Nothing more
annoying if it really

00:14:07.669 --> 00:14:09.210
takes forever when
I just want to get

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.300
to the actual stuff in the app.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.960
The second, it
should be contextual

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.750
and it should be part of
the product experience.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.000
I think that is something that
I still see so many partners

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.130
not getting to a full capacity
or doing as good as they can.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.330
And I'll show you an
example of what I mean.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.840
And the third is asking
users for minimal user input

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.600
while, on the other hand,
gathering all the information

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.344
you need to actually
create great engagements.

00:14:39.344 --> 00:14:40.760
And I think that's
the tricky bit,

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.870
because it's always a very
fine line you're walking on.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.530
One fantastic example we see
and we have a feature before,

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.650
I think, is the
fitness app Freeletics.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.277
So Freeletics, when
you open it up,

00:14:56.277 --> 00:14:57.860
what I really like
about it, it really

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.920
immerses you in
the product world.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.870
You get to this
screenshot and you

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.330
think the training
has already started,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.700
even though you don't know
what's coming for you when

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.540
you actually train.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.240
I just want to say that.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.480
So they really immerse you
in their product experience

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.164
and they create it for
different user cohorts.

00:15:17.164 --> 00:15:18.830
Basically, you get
to the second screen,

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.990
you select if you are male
or female, and depending

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.380
on that, the tonality
and the screenshots

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.375
and the onboarding
really changes.

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:28.512
Oh, other way around.

00:15:28.512 --> 00:15:29.720
No, this used to be animated.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.730
So basically, if you're
a man, after this

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:38.027
the imagery goes into
that tonality, as well.

00:15:38.027 --> 00:15:39.860
Also what they have
done is, they integrated

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.780
with Google Smart Lock.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.920
So now, when I use a new device
and I log into Freeletics,

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.600
they automatically sign me in.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.610
So they basically remove
all the friction for me

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.460
to become a sign-in user and
get that user experience right

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.431
where it left off.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:01.700
A very quick run through of
what Google Smart Lock can do.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.150
From left to right, this is
the experience a new user has.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.990
The new user registers.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.360
They click to register.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.777
They select an email address.

00:16:09.777 --> 00:16:11.360
It could be any
address that they have

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.242
saved with Android or Chrome.

00:16:15.242 --> 00:16:17.450
Then Smart Lock fills in
the gaps-- obviously outside

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.410
of the password.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.120
The user gets to
choose it themselves.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.020
They're logged in.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.970
And then on the
last screen, they

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.290
can decide if they want to save
the passwords to Smart Lock.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.930
And actually,
across all the apps,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:35.900
we see, I think, 65% of users
actually saving their passwords

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.280
and then they're in that system.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.110
That makes it really
easy for them.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.484
We also have two
really cool case

00:16:43.484 --> 00:16:45.650
studies on that, which I'm
just going to talk about.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.733
They're not on this slide.

00:16:46.733 --> 00:16:49.250
But [INAUDIBLE] which
is outdoor activity app,

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.310
they did an A/B test where
they tested Google Smart

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.800
Lock a sign-in versus
another sign-in,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.460
and they had a 19% increase
in sign-up conversion

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.510
with Smart Lock.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.010
And the second one
is Zalando, which

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.290
is the shopping
app, that see 20%

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:08.990
of the current sign-in events
are automatic by Smart Lock.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.140
So if this is one
of your aims, and I

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.540
think most partners
do really push

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.480
for getting users
logged in, then this

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.727
is definitely something
to consider for you.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.295
As I said, onboarding is not
only important-- it's not only

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.170
my favorite topic, it's
also super important.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.040
So with all super important
things in your app,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.750
you should test, test,
and test again, right?

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.100
And iterate and test again.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.310
And another tool that I
want to show you for that

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:43.030
is Firebase Remote Config that
lets you run A/B experiments.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.710
It lets you custom control
key values within your app,

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.590
and the change-- everything
you change basically

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.820
goes live instantly.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.670
So if you are familiar with
the [INAUDIBLE] Firebase Suite,

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.620
that's another
handy tool to look

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.160
into to to actually optimize
the onboarding workflow.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.647
Also any other part in
your app, quite frankly.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:08.620
So quick recap before I
move into the next one.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.130
We're at number four now.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.440
The first one was having
a clear value proposition.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.610
Second one, leveraging
the full Android platform.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.280
Third one, make great
user onboarding.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.980
And number four is
actually about successfully

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.060
releasing new feature.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.640
And I call it the kind of
younger sister or younger

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.620
brother of user onboarding
because there are so

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.920
many similarities in
how to think about it.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.180
First of all, you remember from
the slide on reasons to churn

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.100
is, you've got to stay fresh.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.650
Right?

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.608
And you guys know this.

00:18:38.608 --> 00:18:40.460
You're leading developers
in your industry.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.070
You know there is somebody
coming for you, essentially,

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.910
and you've got to move
ahead of the curve.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.760
You've got to come
up with new features.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.840
If you are about
content, you constantly

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.100
need to push new
content in order

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.930
to stay relevant to users.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.270
So that's a very general
advice on that, which I think

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.520
most of you are familiar with.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.900
When you do introduce
new features or content,

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.470
what I think is a very
simple and systematic release

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:14.960
methodology to follow is
to first of all test it

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.570
with beta users-- that
was mentioned before--

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.640
to make sure that it actually
works on retention engagement

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.370
metrics.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.310
Secondly, again, ensure
technical stability.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.580
Thirdly, really show
users what's new,

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.010
and that's actually what
the screenshot here is for.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.750
Imagine you had never
seen this product

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.000
and you were introduced to
this and you could actually

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.730
navigate from here if
you're driving your car.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.490
There are some very easy
ways, with material design,

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.550
to make this visually very
simple and light weight,

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.910
but yet very clear to users when
they onboard to a new feature.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.160
And then, as a fourth
point, obviously analyze

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.639
the performance.

00:19:51.639 --> 00:19:53.180
Again, we have a
couple of tools that

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.330
are super useful for that
For point number one and two,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.220
beta groups and
prelaunch reports,

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.140
both were featured in
large this morning.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.681
I'm not going to go
into them, I just

00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:07.370
want to give it a big
fat plus one or plus

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.040
two, depending on how
you want to see it.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.080
On prelaunch reports,
actually keep in mind

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.520
that you need to opt in.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.270
So it's not going to
happen automatically.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.750
So you need to go
in the console,

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.600
opt in for it to be activated,
and then every single thing you

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.160
upload to alpha/beta
actually runs these checks.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.240
And then use cohort analysis
in Firebase Analytics

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.270
or in Google Analytics to
really check the performance

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.490
of new features.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.210
It's one thing that
you built something

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.070
new and fancy and
cool, but you really

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.840
want to make sure
that you actually

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.470
optimize against that goal
for retention or engagement

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.370
that you have.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:47.050
And as always, numbers are
best way to make a decision.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.940
Another point you may recall
from the list we showed

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.990
of reasons why users churn is
that your app-- or an app--

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.130
may be too interchangeable with
what t competitor is offering.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.770
One really cool
way to counter this

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.240
is to personalizing
the experience,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.530
so to make the
user feel at home.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.840
I think there are two
main way of doing this.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.250
Number one is
where you basically

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.810
give the user all
kinds of manual ways

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.900
to design the experience.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.840
You may like let them toggle
stuff in the home screen,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.400
switch stuff on and off, and
so on, and I think all of that

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.680
is great.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.080
Just what I think happens
quite a lot, or what we hear

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.760
happens quite a lot, that
really remains something

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.090
that mostly power
users do, and it's

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.670
really hard to get average
or the broad range of users

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.740
actually to do that.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.530
So another way to do this is by
actually doing personalization,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.890
by using business intelligence
to individualize the product

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:52.880
experience.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.370
And I will show you
what that means.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.500
A great example for this
that was shared with me,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.860
actually, was from hotels.com.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.270
They basically
anticipate user-- or they

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.330
use user behavior to
anticipate users' needs,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.340
and provide the
relevant experience

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.840
in the right moments.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.230
So what does that mean?

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.170
They try to map
various scenarios

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.300
for users coming into the app.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.950
One is onboarding.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.570
When it's about
onboarding, they try

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.910
to make it as convenient
as possible for the user

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.880
to actually go to sign-in.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.346
When a user actually
comes back to the app--

00:22:29.346 --> 00:22:31.470
so it's a returning user
that has searched before--

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.190
and they may show them something
that's relevant to their search

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.900
or where they were left off.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.550
And then another scenario could
be that somebody has actually

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.320
booked a hotel with
hotels.com, and on the day

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.940
of check-in or
check-out, they will

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.010
provide relevant
information, maybe

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.770
around where people
travel, or stuff around

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:49.910
the hotel and information.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.850
So they have different
scenarios where the user really

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.920
feels like this
is a personalized

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.910
experience to them.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.500
How they do that
is, first of all,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.300
by being aware of all of that
and actually catering for it,

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.450
but also by creating a
flexible content structure

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.320
that actually allows them to
move around content and modules

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.920
to react to this broad
range of scenarios.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.350
And then the third one, is that
they actually exhaustively map

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.170
the context, instead of content
or action the user was left in.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.878
So that when you leave
and you come back,

00:23:23.878 --> 00:23:28.386
you really feel like you're
continuing where you left off.

00:23:28.386 --> 00:23:29.760
So I think that's
a great example

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.930
of using data and a
sophisticated technical

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.790
approach to actually
provide personal user

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.410
experience for a broad range.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.560
Some of you may probably think
now, oh, you said easy fixes.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.700
This seems very complex.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.330
Yes.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.790
This is probably one of
the things that are not

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.170
that straightforward and easy
to set up, but once you have it,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.260
it's actually a very neat way
to do that personalization.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.510
So I think it's really worth
the effort of looking into that.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.399
The second last I want
to talk about is having

00:24:05.399 --> 00:24:06.940
a great communication
strategy and it

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.210
ties very much into the
personalization bit.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.460
So push notifications is
what I'm going to focus on,

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:18.760
and they have become somewhat
the standard on the platform

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.060
as an engagement tool,
and rightfully so.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.620
They work great if you
do a great job on them.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.870
However, there's
also a fine line

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.590
between using them to drive
engagement, on the one hand,

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.990
or to actually make users churn
because you're overdoing it

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.060
or they're not relevant
or whatever it may be.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.710
So again, some very
simple rules in order

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.530
to make the strategy successful.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.110
First, the push notification
needs to be relevant.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.580
So the context, the
language, the tonality

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.690
needs to be relevant
to the user.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.210
And be creative, be
true to your brand.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.280
Be creative.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.440
Speak to the customer
in a unique way.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.210
I think that's something that
I still see a lot of partners

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.824
not fully optimizing.

00:25:03.824 --> 00:25:05.240
Second, it needs
to be actionable.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.607
Is it an FYI?

00:25:06.607 --> 00:25:07.940
Is it actually a call to action?

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.400
Do you want me to do something?

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.885
If so, then make sure
that is deeplinked

00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:13.510
and that when I
actually click through,

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.250
I get to whatever
you talked about.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.060
Because if that's not happened,
then the user experience

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.290
is really burned, and
you're like, OK, where am I?

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.107
Why am I here?

00:25:21.107 --> 00:25:22.940
And you're probably not
going to do it again

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.550
or you're less likely to push
on opening the app again.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:32.020
Then third one is-- I want to
talk about timeliness first.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.840
Timeliness, the right
message at the right time.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.580
Again, it seems
very obvious, but I

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.829
think the London Olympics--
oh, not the London, sorry.

00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:41.390
The Rio Olympics were a
great example of that.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.860
A lot of the stuff happened
overnight for users in EMEA.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:50.240
So the question becomes, is
it that Usain Bolt won the 100

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:50.740
meters?

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.540
Or somebody broke
a world record?

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.640
Is that really more
relevant at 3:00

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.710
AM in the morning
on a Tuesday night?

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.000
Or should you be waiting
to push that message

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.020
at 7:00 AM in the morning when
you know your users get up

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.132
and actually check their news?

00:26:04.132 --> 00:26:05.590
So there are things
to keep in mind

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:08.330
and not only go, oh, this is a
great thing, I'll just push it

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.645
out, because it may lose
its effect on users.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.770
And then the fourth
point is personalization.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.740
You should segment users,
you should have your cohorts,

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:24.640
and then also proactively
let users opt out of stuff

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.890
and opt into other stuff.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.350
Especially the opt out part
seems counter-intuitive,

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.650
but let me give you one
great example where-- which

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.960
you see on the left, actually.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.660
This is a screenshot
of Aftenposten.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.460
It's one of the biggest
newspapers in the Nordics.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.070
And they basically--
a while ago, they

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.410
redid their whole onboarding,
and as part of that,

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.670
a new notification
management screen and they

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.380
saw some fantastic results.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.080
So basically, now
when you onboard,

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.652
users get to select to-- I
think this is pre-selected

00:26:54.652 --> 00:26:56.860
and then they get to opt
out, but they're proactively

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.980
asked to do so.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.060
So what they saw
is, first of all,

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.470
that I think over 50%
of the users actually

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.309
keep two of the three.

00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:09.850
So they take one off consciously
but they take the other ones

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.530
because they think
they're relevant.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.050
And then, overall, they saw
a decrease of uninstalls

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:18.220
by, I think, 9% over
60 days, which I think

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.100
is a strong argument
for the point I tried

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.100
to make earlier where too many
push notifications, or not

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.400
having a strategy, can be
really be something that leads

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.250
to churn, while it should be
really something that helps you

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.230
engage and retain users.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.196
And then also, another
interesting side effect,

00:27:34.196 --> 00:27:36.070
is that they really
learned about their users

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.370
and the preferences
of those users.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.830
And to my surprise,
apparently there

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.320
were less users
interested in sports

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.878
than in the other topics.

00:27:45.878 --> 00:27:48.086
For me, usually, that's
exactly the other way around.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.290
Again, just to
highlight one tool

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.120
that you can use
for that very well,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.520
is Firebase Cloud Messaging.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.400
It lets you target individual
devices, cohorts, and so on.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.070
Super reliable and
it's cross-platform.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.450
It doesn't only
work for Android,

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.910
so you can use it across
the platforms-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:13.250
and iOS, as well.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:19.630
Last but not least,
rewarding use engagement.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.250
Let's talk a bit about that.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:26.710
I think, very generally, this
should be something everybody

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.610
should be thinking about from
the perspective of making

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:34.540
it really desirable for
your users to become

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.000
an engaged user with you.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.280
And when they are
engaged user, really

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.380
reward them and show
you that you value that.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.810
Obviously it's a
topic, and this is

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.780
something I realized more than
ever when I started researching

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.790
it for this talk,
that you can go

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.270
really deep in when it comes to
gamification and the mechanics

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.920
around it and so on, right?

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.420
And there are many
great strategies,

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.970
and probably with a
lot of the gaming guys

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.790
here, they could go on
about this for length

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.280
and without any end.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.580
However, it can already start
with very simple rewards

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.870
mechanism.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.160
It's a broad range.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.070
It's a large spectrum
of stuff you can do.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:19.210
And what works for your app
really depends on your app,

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.870
on your industry, what
business model you have,

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.890
a free [INAUDIBLE], and so on.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.830
However, if you're not
doing anything at all,

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.490
and I think you
should, then you can

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.440
start with keeping
it very simple,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.640
thinking of something that adds
value to your users, and makes

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.890
sense and fits with
your overlap ecosystem.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:43.510
So a couple of good examples
are inviting power users

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:47.062
to early access to test
beta features and so on.

00:29:47.062 --> 00:29:48.520
Give them a special
preview, right?

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.952
It's a very simple one, but you
wouldn't believe how many users

00:29:51.952 --> 00:29:52.660
really love that.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.201
And I do it for a
lot of the products

00:29:54.201 --> 00:29:56.620
that I love, too, where I
proactively tell the developer,

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.350
please include me
in product testing

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.410
just because I love
the product so much.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.930
The second one are badges.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.860
How do I know that?

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.570
Because you guys all love it.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.690
Whenever it's about a badge on
Google Play, people go crazy.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:15.310
Top Developer Badge,
Editor's Choice, and so on.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.232
And usually the ones that
go most crazy are the devs.

00:30:18.232 --> 00:30:19.690
Maybe sometimes
the business people

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.310
we talk to, they're
like what's the impact?

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.720
What's that?

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.260
And they talk about
all these numbers,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.160
and then we talk about that.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.560
But then, when they get it,
they tell me, oh, my Android

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.550
developers freaked out.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.430
We're like best of that,
we're part of here.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.699
So really giving
these simple badges.

00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:34.240
Usually it doesn't
cost you anything,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.210
it just needs--
you need to come up

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.590
with a structure
on how to do it,

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.430
and you can really show
users how valued they are.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.350
And then you can do
stuff like offering app

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.110
exclusive discounts.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.060
Generally, the more
you can endeavor

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.400
individualize that, the better.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.510
But again, starting off
with a very broad range

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.660
and basically just
showing users that you

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.590
value that they are
there and go from there,

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.120
is a really good start.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.840
The bottom line
is, these engaged

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.000
users are your best customer
and they should be valued.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.266
Because who does not
like to be valued?

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.915
So here are the seven
fixes again in an overview.

00:31:11.915 --> 00:31:13.540
I think you had enough
from me for now.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.537
This was quite a lot
of input, I think.

00:31:16.537 --> 00:31:18.370
So it's time for some
first-hand experience,

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.536
and I would like to welcome
Markus Falk from Lifesum

00:31:20.536 --> 00:31:21.522
up on stage.

00:31:21.522 --> 00:31:26.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.490
MARKUS FALK: you, Niko.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:32.720
So now I feel very gamified
around the badges things.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.220
Cool.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.010
So I guess a lot of
you probably think

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.220
that I'm here to present
the secrets around the Holy

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.870
Grail of retention.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.940
If I happen to do
something like that,

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.490
please feel free to share
that with me because that

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.740
would be some fantastic
knowledge to have.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.550
But as Niko said, I'm Markus.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:56.920
I'm from Lifesum and I think
that retention and engagement

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:02.830
is probably the most interesting
topic because it's basically

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.750
tells you how good
is your product.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:08.200
I mean, if your users are coming
back, it's a good product.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.100
So that's the one metric that
should be above everyone else,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.950
I think.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.040
So we're just going to give you
a bit of an insight around how

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.100
we think around retention
at Lifesum and engagement.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.930
So starting off
with a little bit

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:26.380
about us, but also what
retention engagement

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.600
means to health in specific.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.980
Then a little bit of what we
track and why we track it.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.710
And then I have two
examples, one where we tested

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.920
and failed miserably and
the other one where we

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.960
tested and actually succeeded.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.820
It's nice that you can
set off this agenda,

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.060
because it looks like it's
a 50/50 split there, which

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.780
might not always be the case.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:52.490
And then I'm rounding
up with a few takeaways.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:54.490
So start with a bit about us.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.250
I think there are a few
things within health

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.510
that needs to be fixed.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:03.670
So today, health care is
actually a lot about sick care.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:07.050
You wait until you get sick
and then you get treated.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:08.740
But instead, it
should be that you

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.420
do a lot of stuff
with your lifestyle

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.550
before you actually get sick.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:16.300
I mean, the way you eat, how you
train, exercise, how you sleep,

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.552
stress levels, et cetera,
will affect your life.

00:33:18.552 --> 00:33:20.260
So that's basically
what we are here for.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.700
We are here to sort
of help you with that

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.490
But then when we talk about
engagement and retention

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:29.440
I think it's kind
of interesting when

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.840
it comes to health
because no one has really

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.970
sold it in a good way.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.170
And I don't think that's
all about just health apps.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.710
I think it's for the
health sector, in general.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:41.920
Let's take gyms for example.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.710
I think in the US
you have about 70%

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.540
of people that own a
gym subscription isn't

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.910
going to the gym.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.370
And you have-- when it comes
to medication or medical

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:54.950
and pharma-- about 50% of
people who are on medication

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.710
isn't taking them properly.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.690
So the challenge
is, how do you get

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:01.780
people to think it's
interesting and fun to take

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.130
care of themselves?

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:03.967
Which is hard.

00:34:03.967 --> 00:34:05.800
But of course, within
this sort of industry,

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.030
you can be either good or
you can be bad at this.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.530
And I think that Lifesum
is-- we're not the worst.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.730
We're definitely not
the best, either.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:16.780
But for us, it's definitely--
the number one company

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.130
goal is to work on retention.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.360
It's the stuff that we
talk about every day.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.790
It's definitely the key for us.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.190
So we haven't figured it
out, but we are trying

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.920
to do a lot of stuff around it.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.969
So a little bit about what
we track and why we track it.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:32.607
So we have a few
standard metrics

00:34:32.607 --> 00:34:33.940
that we follow on a daily basis.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.070
So we look at seven
day retention.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.600
We look at week five retention.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.670
And we look at
week 53 retentions.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.462
Of course we do deep dives,
et cetera, within those,

00:34:42.462 --> 00:34:44.170
but these are the ones
that are standard.

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.980
So what we noticed was that when
the users come into the Lifesum

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.073
app a lot of them
has actually decided

00:34:50.073 --> 00:34:52.239
that they want to change
something with their lines.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.488
They want to become healthier.

00:34:53.488 --> 00:34:56.469
So they're super engaged
in that very first moment

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.000
when they come into the app.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.910
But then what we've seen is
that they rapidly drop off

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.610
during the first seven days.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.810
So for us, the number
one metric to follow

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.720
has been the 7-day metric.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.310
But then, most
recently, we've started

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.070
to think a little bit
different around retention.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.834
That you shouldn't really treat
it the same way for all users

00:35:15.834 --> 00:35:17.500
because it's kind of
different depending

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.730
on what you want to achieve.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:20.980
So we looked at
the data and we see

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.050
that we have basically four
different types of users--

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.300
the monster, the focused, the
dieter, and the long term.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.000
I named them.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.230
So let's say the
dieter for example.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.650
In the US, the average American
goes on a diet about four times

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.610
a year, which is quite a lot.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.170
It's crazy, I know.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.920
And that diet will last from
anywhere between a few days

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.790
to a few weeks.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.620
So for us, then, it's important.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.010
So instead of trying to force
the dieters behavior to become

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:55.000
the monster, which is tracking
every day for several months,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.730
we should just recognize,
OK, this person is on a diet.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.740
We need to make the
app as good as possible

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.740
for them to come back
for the next diet.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.960
So that sort of
thinking, like OK,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.420
if we can put these people
in different buckets,

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.780
we should treat
them differently.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.730
So two examples.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.380
Let's start with a sad one.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.050
So we had this knowledge
about that users are very

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.770
motivated in their first visit.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.710
So we thought that
if we can get them

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:28.250
to invest a lot of time and
energy in the app at first,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.020
they will be coming back.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.460
So we basically created
this massive health test

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.570
of 41 questions.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:37.270
We brought in consultants,
nutritionists, et cetera.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.870
We built it into
the onboarding flow.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.440
We put it on the profile page.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.420
We prompted it several times.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.530
It was a massive project.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:48.797
It took us months to develop.

00:36:48.797 --> 00:36:51.380
And then when we release it, of
course, we were super excited.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.640
This is going to have a massive
impact on seven-day retention.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.710
And now everyone's just waiting
for the data and when it came,

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.250
it was the sound of
no hands clapping.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.290
Nothing happened.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:05.870
So of course, it
was a big failure.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.840
But then of course, with
failures, you usually

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.770
get some stuff out of it.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.340
For us it was, I
think, first we managed

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.170
to confirm that we have the
high initial motivation.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:19.270
So out of the people starting
the test, we had about 90%

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.770
completing all 41 questions.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.570
So within a few weeks, we had a
million of these test results,

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.831
and that data is
kind of valuable.

00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:29.830
I mean, first of all,
this info you can see, OK,

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.300
how many percent is a
vegetarian in London compared

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.920
to Stockholm, for example.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.770
But also referring to the
buckets that I talked about,

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:40.210
we can actually profile
users now based on this data.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.440
So it's something that
we're not doing yet

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.080
the way we should be
doing it, but it's

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.645
a really interesting source.

00:37:45.645 --> 00:37:49.190
But of course, from a retention
perspective, it wasn't good.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:52.010
And I think what we learned from
that is also what the guys have

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.770
been talking about before.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:56.830
You need to find
ways of testing stuff

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.763
before you put a lot
of effort into it.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:05.150
So we often did stuff
that was working out.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:09.340
So going back a few
months, we didn't really

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.905
have any sort of social
interaction in the app.

00:38:12.905 --> 00:38:15.280
And I think the reason for
that was that we didn't really

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.440
know what people wanted to
share, because when it comes

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.670
to your personal health,
especially around weight loss,

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.232
it's not that you want to
like-- you don't want to share

00:38:24.232 --> 00:38:25.190
everything on Facebook.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:27.020
Let's put it that way.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.730
So what we did here
is that we created

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:33.820
this very small, intimate
social feature, very simple,

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.570
and we ran a test in Sweden.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.350
So it's basically that you
could invite up to five friends

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.510
to become your sort of team.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.600
And within that team you could
basically push each other

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.190
and motivate each other, but
you could also remind people

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.310
if they were dropping off.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:52.940
So when we got that out, we
saw that people on social

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.690
actually had a 2x increase
in seven-day retention, which

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.540
was, of course, fantastic.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.729
But if you think about it, it's
like if you have five people,

00:39:02.729 --> 00:39:05.020
and three of them drop off,
and they have two more that

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.070
can keep reminding
them, that's always

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:10.190
going to be better than if
you have like five silos where

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.590
no one can talk.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.510
So from that perspective,
it was really good.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.650
What we had some issues with
there was the adoption rate.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.810
We didn't really got that
many users to be on social.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.790
So we popped a survey
for them who declined

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.250
and the reason
was still privacy.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.650
I don't want to share my data.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:33.730
So this is still a big challenge
for us to try to figure out,

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:38.270
but also massive potential.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:42.230
So yeah, wrapping
up a little bit.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:46.000
I mean, looking at your
own users' retention

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.790
is interesting.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:49.730
So not just treating
retention the same way

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.160
across different apps or
even across your own users

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.120
or try to find what
are your patterns.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.207
For us, it might be very
high initial motivation

00:39:57.207 --> 00:39:59.040
or that we have a lot
of dieters in the app,

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.540
but it might be
different for you.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.880
And then social is key.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:09.000
If you can get your own users
to help you with retention,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.251
it's always going to be good,
referring to the health test

00:40:14.251 --> 00:40:14.750
that we did.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.750
And I think that
everyone is saying this

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.610
but it needs to be said
over and over again,

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.500
is that you need to find
easy, quick ways of testing

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.020
your ideas before
you spend hundreds

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.080
and thousands on building them.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:28.690
Cool.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.803
So yeah, back to Niko to
sort of wrap it up a bit.

00:40:31.803 --> 00:40:32.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.923
NIKO SCHROER: Thank you, Markus.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.640
Yeah, so it's great to see
that a lot of the points

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.160
resonated with you, at least.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.370
That's a start.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.989
So very quickly-- I know
you guys are waiting

00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:48.030
for another coffee break.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.430
That's what I think is
happening after this.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:54.030
Before we do that, I want to go
back on the one summary slide.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.500
This is actually Dr. E. E
is obviously for engagement.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.980
And this is his checklist that
he uses to go through his apps.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.410
So I encourage you
to take this list.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:09.030
Take a screenshot or actually
take it later from YouTube,

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.370
and take it home with you.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.930
Go through it with
your teams and see

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.720
what are things you are doing.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.680
What other things
you are doing good?

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.910
What are the things
you are doing great?

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.493
And wherever you are
not great, really

00:41:20.493 --> 00:41:22.780
think about how you
can actually get there.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.830
So we hope this was
useful for you guys.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:27.360
Thank you very much.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.510
