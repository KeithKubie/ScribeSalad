00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.069
- Drugs and alcohol have
affected every area of my life.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.805
It's affected my relationship
with women

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:14.407
and my relationship with sex.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.408
Small aside--

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.743
I spent $1,500

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:20.079
to have a escort come over
one night,

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.480
and I couldn't get it up,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.750
so I just spend all night
holding her hand...

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.753
like it was the first date.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.455
I'm like, "Hey, if I pay extra,

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:32.425
can we do that animal-cracker
scene from 'Armageddon'?"

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.932
It's affected my relationship
with my family.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.533
Once I was naked

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.469
in my parents' living room
doing lines.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.372
Naked's the official uniform
of cocaine, by the way.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.608
That's like Superman's cape.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.144
And they came home early,

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.945
and the only thing
that I could think to say was,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.949
"Uh, uh, don't come in.
I'm masturbating."

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.952
You know your life's
in a sad place

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.287
if masturbation's
the safe option

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.789
with your parents.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.190
And then when they turned
their back,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.792
I took the rest of the cocaine,
put it in a bag,

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.961
and shoved it up my ass

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.464
so I could do the cocaine
in the basement

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.565
while they were asleep

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.800
before they got up
for work at 6:00 a.m.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.738
I did coke
the same way Gollum eats.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.809
The biggest area
of my life it's affected

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.479
are my relationships
with my friends,

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.747

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.081
When I was 20 years old,

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:31.650
I was actually a janitor
at a middle school,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.320
which at the time didn't fit.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.521

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.989

"Hey, if you kids want
to miss dodgeball,

But...

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.169
At the time, it didn't fit.
I was very clean...face.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.771
And my friend called me up,

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:56.176
and he said, "Hey, I got tickets
to the Gathering of the Vibes."

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.177
It's this jam-band festival
in Upstate New York.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:01.447
Yeah, I had a really--
I went there in high school.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.516
I had a really fun time there
in high school.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.684
Did a lot of drugs.
I met a chick.

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:07.353
It was fucking great, right?

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.021
And I'm 20.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.623
At this point,
I'm getting way more--

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.792
like, my fucked-up times
are getting way more dark,

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.194

'cause he got
a 12-pack of beer,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.164
and I bought, like, a handle
of Black Velvet whiskey.

We get in the car.

Like, it's not making
any sense.

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:13.920
And we get
to the Gathering of the Vibes,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.254
and at this--

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:17.089

has changed.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.624

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.426
it was, like, peace, love,
and understanding.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.095
Now there's,
like, one good vibe,

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:25.097
and all the other vibes are,

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:27.033
"I wonder how much ecstasy
I can get

And, like, we're in the car.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.273
We're arguing,
and then all of a sudden,

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.441
like, we're on line.

into this festival,

and I swear to God,

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:45.785
this old man walks in and sit--
He looked like--

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:49.555
Imagine if, like, Burt's Bees
had, like, a cousin,

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.457
but instead
of selling bee shit,

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.626
he just sold the milk
he squeezed

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.862
from possums, you know?

00:04:56.862 --> 00:05:00.299
[chuckles]
And he sits down,

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:01.968
and we look at him,
and he just goes,

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.870
"Don't mind me.
Passing through."

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.707
And he passes out
in the back...

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:10.309
like it was a bonus round
on "Oregon Trail."

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:12.144
But I'm such a drunk.

My friend
doesn't even notice that,

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.481
because I'm already fucking--

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.583
Like, I'm already yelling
at him.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.752
He's like, "Stop fucking
with the air conditioner."

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.487
And I'm like,
"Your mom's an air conditioner."

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.222
He's like,
"That doesn't make any sense.

Stevie Nicks' 'Landslide.'"

00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:27.526
I'm like, "It's a good song.
Go fuck yourself."

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:29.329
We're fighting back and forth.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.364
We're fighting so much
that in the middle of it,

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.834
the old guy just wakes up,
and he goes, "Okay."

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.002
And he leaves.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:40.840
Like, I was so annoying, I made
a hobo turn down shelter.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.341
That's how annoying I was.

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:44.010
He's like,
"I'd rather die in the cold

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.344
"than deal with this shit.

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:48.014
I'm going back to Hobo Island."

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.249
But we're fighting
more and more.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.351
You know, we're coming down
to the tent area.

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:54.187
He's like, "Fuck you, Dan."
I'm like, "Fuck you."

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.854
He's like,
"What's your problem?"

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:57.356
"Man, the Iraq War was wrong."

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.358
He's like,
"You're not making any sense."

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:02.395
I jump out of the car
as it's driving.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.530
Now this sounds, like,
very "Lethal Weapon"-y

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.731
and impressive,

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:08.868
but the car was only going
10 miles an hour.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.202
So it just looked like

00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:13.039
the most low-stakes
hostage situation ever.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.206
So he stops the car.

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:15.807
He runs after me, grabs me,

00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:18.477
and he goes,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:21.881
And I go, "Living, bro,"
and I punch him in the face

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.416
and run away.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.218
Like, there's happy drunk.
There's sad drunk.

00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:28.387
I was run-away drunk.

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.722
I don't remember much
of the night.

00:06:30.722 --> 00:06:32.224
What I do remember

00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:34.560
is I remember I had taken
two hits of acid,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.829
and I was nervous,
because I had drank so much,

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:40.065
that I was gonna pass out
and not experience the acid.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:43.169
So I bought a gram of cocaine

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.504
that I immediately did
to my dome.

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:48.407
And I remember I turned to
the guy who sold me the cocaine,

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:50.242
and I'm like,
"Oh, you want to talk now?"

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:52.411
And he goes, "I'm cool,"
and he walks away.

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:55.281
He's probably a doctor now.

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:56.782
And that's all I remember.

00:06:56.782 --> 00:07:00.586
I remember I pass out,
and then I woke up the next day,

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.422
and I was in my friend's trunk,
and the trunk was open.

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:05.123
And my friend is, like, sitting
in the corner.

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:08.260
Like, he's, like, sitting on one
of those, like, camp chairs,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.629
and he's smoking a cigarette,

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.264
and he's looking off
into the distance.

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:14.266
And it's just
that palpable feeling

00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:15.501
of "I fucked up," you know?

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.937
And I turn to him,
and I'm like...

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.172
[meekly]
"Hey, John.

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.274
[normal voice]
He goes, "What?"

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:24.276
I go, "I'm sorry."

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:27.280
And he goes,
"Sorry for what?"

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.282
"For punching you
in the face."

00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:31.617
And then he goes,

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.487
"The first time
or the second time?"

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:37.623
Apparently later in the night,
I punched him in the face again.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.625
So it wasn't a good scene.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.792
I walked away.

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:43.463
I found, like,
this little creek near the--

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.631
Not a creek, it was, like,
just kind of a ditch.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:49.301
And I started, like, puking,
'cause I was fucking hungover.

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:50.635
The whole thing was, like,

00:07:50.635 --> 00:07:54.306
the most white-trash
Ansel Adams photo ever.

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:57.142
And then this dude comes up
in back of me,

00:07:57.142 --> 00:07:59.344
and then I just hear, "Rico?"

00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:01.314
And I'm like, "No, no,"
and I start pu--

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.215
I'm, like, forcing myself
to puke.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:04.750
And he's like, "Rico?"

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.519
I'm like, "I'm not Rico.
I'm not Rico."

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:09.355
And then he goes,
"No, you're Rico."

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:10.822
I'm like,
"I'm fucking not Ri"--

00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:12.825
And then he takes out
his digital camera,

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.660
and he shows the pictures,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.097
and I had been partying
with that guy

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:19.331
the night before

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.200
and told him my name was Rico.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.668
[chuckles]

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.770
And, like, I'm like,
"I'm so sorry.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.339
He goes, "No, don't worry, man.
You were fucking hilarious.

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:28.774
"You told great stories.

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:32.545
"You helped my friend Mike
through a breakup.

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.681
You, like, played him this
Bob Dylan song that helped."

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.183
And then he goes,
"How's law school going?"

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:39.785
I told him I was going
to law school.

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:43.522
"Yeah, it's good.
It's good."

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:46.358
And then he goes, "Dude, dude,
come here. Come here."

00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:47.693
And then he, like, puts

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.362
a fucking clump of mushrooms
in my hand.

00:08:50.362 --> 00:08:51.797
And I look at it, and I'm like,

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:55.200
"Well, when
in Upstate New York..."

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.035
And I eat the mushrooms.

00:08:57.035 --> 00:08:58.704
Cut to, like, a half hour later.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:01.707
At this point, I'm, like,
starting to feel the body buzz,

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:05.544
and he goes, "Hey, dance for us
like you did last night."

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:07.146
And I'm like, "What?"

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:09.815
So I start dancing,
and they think it's hilarious,

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.717
but I think it's sexy,
'cause I'm tripping.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:15.721
Like, it looked like if Jabba
danced for Leia, you know?

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.391
It was, like, the opposite
of what it normally is, so...

00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:21.393
And then I start dancing
away from them,

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:22.728
but then they follow me,

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:25.898
and we're all dancing
in this line

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.299
through the festival.

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:30.002
And in the distance,
I see my friend John,

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:33.739
and he looks at us and goes,
"What the fuck, Dan?"

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.774
And then the guy
in back of me goes,

00:09:35.774 --> 00:09:39.011
"It's not Dan.
It's Rico."

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:41.813
And then he goes,
"It's fucking Dan!"

00:09:41.813 --> 00:09:44.583
He's like, "No, it's Rico!"

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:46.251
And then John's like,
"It's Dan."

00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:48.187
And then the guy reaches
into his pocket,

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:51.924
pulls out some more mushrooms,
goes up to my friend John,

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.592
puts it in his hand,

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.128
and my friend John looks
at the mushrooms.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.763
He goes, "You know...

00:09:57.763 --> 00:10:01.267
"you know,
Dan was rude, obnoxious,

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.937
"violent, and drunk
last night, but...

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:07.606
"this guy Rico, well...

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:09.141
he seems pretty cool."

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:12.044
And he ate the mushrooms,
and we all partied together.

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:14.780
It was--Two rehabs later,
I'm still dancing.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.282
Guys, thank you so much.
Have a good night.

00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:18.384
[cheers and applause]
