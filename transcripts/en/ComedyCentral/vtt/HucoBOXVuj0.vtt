- It's a lot of
garbage out there.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.684
I'm not just talkin' about
McDonald's wrappers and dead

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.087
hamsters, I'm talkin' about
douche bags and dirt bags.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.690
Lotta D's and bags behind 'em.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.227 align:start position:0% line:0%
If you want one guy to come
after them it's not the police.

Danny,

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.195 line:0%
or Griff,

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.330 line:0%
or Doc.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.731
We're the Defenders, okay?

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:34.634
(sleuthlike music)

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.310
Everything safe?

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.647
- No safe, but you
have permit to...

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:50.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We have permits,
rights, all that stuff.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:51.985
- You are security obviously...

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.219
- Right, right.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.956
Can I see your permits?

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:57.924
- Huh?

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.292
- Can I see your permits?

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.927
You have permits?

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:02.595
Can I talk to who's
ever on that line?

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.463
Feel safe today?

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.330
- Yeah.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.932

- [Woman] Hello?

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:07.600
- Alright.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.835
We're defending it.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:09.969
- Well I'm glad
you're here then.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.604 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You see the purple,
you feel safe.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.539
- Okay.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.307
- My definition of a Defender?

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:18.144 align:start size:97% position:3%
You live in peace until
it's time to not use peace.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.346
'Til it's time to use these.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:24.651
You know, not the gloves, my
hands underneath the gloves.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.585 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Security Guard]
How you doin'?

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.386
- [Griff] Security, right?

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.320
- [Security Guard] Yes.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.455
- [Griff] Security as well.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.856
Nice to meet you.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.024
- [Security Guard] Yes.

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.792
- I just wanna make sure

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.428
you're doin' the proper things
to make this building secure.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.863
- [Danny] That's right.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.765 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You got on a jacket, you're
wearin' identification,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.533
that is great.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
But what I would say,
Sir, is you wanna

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.204
have correct posture.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.872
Hands across,

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.740
a dead stare.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.575
No smiles.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.478
- What's his name?

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.545
- His name's Chef.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.713
- Chef.
- Chef.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.449
You see it?

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.417
- Nope.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.251
I found this lighter though.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.552
- That ain't good.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.753
You see it yet?

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.124
My partners in there,
he's lookin' for a cat.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.325
You haven't seen a cat have you?

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.459
- How's it goin'?

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.827
- [Griff] Cat?

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.195
Meow.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.029
- Meow.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.264
- Meow, meow.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:12.198
Meow, meow.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.466
Hello Kitty?

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.734
- Ahh.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:15.935
- Hello Kitty.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.605
(western music)

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.640
This is one bad dude.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.642
- I don't like that guy.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:26.146
(country music)

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.147
- What's happenin', Mama?

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.615
Alright.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.049
Ladies, I'm right here.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.451
I ain't goin' no where.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.385
It's free.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.220
You too, daddy, let's get goin'.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.556
Get them shades on, brother.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.927
Tooowee!

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:41.761
Aye!

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.230
Give me some toots!

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.633
(horn honking)

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.101
Now that is a damn shame.

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:51.571 align:start size:94% position:6%
Break dancin' catastrophe
if I ever seen one.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.073
I need to eat.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:56.042
Come on, one of you
get in my mouth.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.310
Oh!

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.511
Haha!

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.779
- [Men] Ooowee!

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.148
(laughter)

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:04.484
- [The Rebel] Alright, guys!

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.687
- It's only three
of us right now.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.356
We got a potential fourth in
Tucson, but he's gotta get

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.725 align:start size:84% position:16%
his stuff together and
pay for his jacket.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:13.693
- Ooo, nobody.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.728
Ooo, yeah I can see good.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.063
- Anybody in there,
nothin' suspicious?

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.898
- No, nobody.

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:19.732
- It's secure?

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:20.567
- Yeah, very secure.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.068
- Very good.

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:22.969
- The best part about bein'
a Defender is just to be able

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.571
to reach out to people.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.039
You can feel the warmth.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.241
And it's a beautiful feelin'
to have people connect with you

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.375
especially

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.610 align:start size:88% position:13%
being black and
walkin' up on somebody.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.744
It kinda...

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.514
It can be pretty
risky sometimes.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.117
- [Men In Green] Polska,
Polska, Polska, Polska.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.519
- Danny, what's that?

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.023 align:start position:0%
- [Men In Green] Polska,
Polska, Polska, Polska, Polska.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:47.260 align:start size:88% position:13%
Polska, Polska,

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.867 align:start position:0%
Polska, Polska, Polska,
Polska, Polska, Polska, Polska.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.035
Polska!

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.938 align:start size:88% position:13%
Polska, Polska,
Polska, Polska, Polska.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.346
- Is everyone in here safe?

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.181 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Men In Green]
Polska, Polska, Polska.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:09.182
- [Danny] Who are those guys?

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.484
- It's a Polish light bulb team.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.518
- They were quick.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:13.620
- They do good work.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.088
- We help dudes.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:18.791 align:start size:97% position:3%
We dudes that help other dudes
and we're community dudes.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.660
That's what we do as dudes.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.428
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.497
Coulda taken out an ankle there.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:27.300 align:start size:81% position:19%
People ask me what
a Defender is.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.336 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'd rather tell you
what a Defender is not.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:35.141 align:start size:97% position:3%
We're not cops, we're not
smokers, jokers or goofballs.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:39.312
We are not robots, we
are not 47 years old.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:41.948 align:start size:84% position:16%
We are not your
grandma's apple pie.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.117
But we're certainly
not Canadians 'cause

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.119
streets need watchin'.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.987
We're the Defenders.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.923
(sleuthlike music)

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:58.031
- Greetings video watcher.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:04.437 align:start size:94% position:6%
Go back and click on my
brother's feat of strength

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.773
