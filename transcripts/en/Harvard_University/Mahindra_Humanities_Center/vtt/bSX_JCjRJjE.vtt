00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.690
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.660
Oh, that was loud.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.100
Hi, I'm Claire Messud.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.120
Welcome to this evening's
panel, The Words to Say it,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.850
Teaching, Writing,
and Incarceration.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.640
And I will introduce you to
our three wonderful panelists.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.500
And then we might start
with a video clip.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.890
And then we'll start talking.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.130
So we have with us
today-- and I will then

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.560
explain a little about
how this panel came to be.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.906
We have the writer
Richard Price,

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.780
who's the acclaimed
author of numerous novels

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.980
and screenplays.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.430
His books include
Clockers, Lush Life,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.230
and most recently
under the pseudonym

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.090
Harry Brandt, The Whites.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.760
He's written many film and
television scripts, including

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.590
The Color of Money, Clockers,
The Wire, Freedomland,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.760
and the Emmy-nominated
HBO series,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.370
The Night Of, which
came out last year,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.400
and which we'll be talking
about this evening.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.490
And then Michelle Kuo
is next to Richard.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.130
She is the author of Reading
With Patrick, A Teacher,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.410
A Student, And A Life-Changing
Friendship, which

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.970
was published this summer.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.060
She currently teaches in the
history law and society program

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.800
at the American
University of Paris

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.920
on issues related to race,
punishment, immigration,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.970
and the law.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.520
And she's taught at San Quentin
through the Prison University

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.280
Project, the only college degree
granting program at a state

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.920
prison in California.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.060
Next to Michelle is Edison
Julio, a writer and prison

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.370
reform educator,
currently an urban scholar

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.250
in the Harvard School of
Education master's program.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.440
He's a creative writing
instructor at Rikers Island

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.330
Correctional Facility
and a longtime teacher

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.070
in the CASES High
School Equivalency

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.980
Program, teaching inmates
and former inmates

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.810
of Rikers Island Prison.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.270
CASES is the Center for
Alternative Sentencing

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.890
and Employment Services.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.650
He also holds an MFA in fiction
from Hunter College, Cuny.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.390
So and I'm Claire Messud.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.310
I'm a fiction writer.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.020
And well, you might wonder
what am I doing here.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.470
So I wanted to
organize this panel,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.260
as one hopefully among many
discussions about this issue.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.780
And the way I came to this
is somewhat idiosyncratic.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.460
Although two of the writers,
and if you count me,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.670
are academically affiliated,
this is emphatically

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.880
not an academic panel.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.420
It's a panel of teachers
and storytellers.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.660
And the way this
came about is that--

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.740
well, the title
comes from a memoir

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.770
by a French writer named
Marie Cardinal, who

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.780
wrote a memoir
about psychoanalysis

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.320
called The Words to Say
It, in which she basically

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.040
is writing a book about
trauma and about the need

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.010
to find words for
experiences in order

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.640
to be able to process
and ultimately, hopefully

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.230
be free of those experiences, or
to transcend those experiences,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.820
if not be free of them.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.460
And it seems to me
that in there are many,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.070
many ways to find
the words to say it,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.130
but that each of these
participants on the panel

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.770
has been engaged in
telling the stories

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.200
or helping inmates tell their
stories of their experiences.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.750
So I personally, first
in the trajectory

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.790
of how this panel came to
be, I last year watched

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.670
The Night Of when
the series was aired.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.850
And whatever I might
have anticipated,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.600
the series was something
else, and the series

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.870
proved to be the narrative
of a young man's journey

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.920
and transformation, a permanent
irrevocable transformation

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.950
at the hands of the
judicial system.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.250
It is also a sort of
murder mystery story.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.040
But that isn't actually--

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.800
it's many things.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.660
And I'm sure the
story, that the series

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.540
is many things to many people.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.170
But what my experience
of it as a viewer was,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.440
was the psychological
investigation

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.620
into the transformation
of one young man.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.980
And it was very powerful for me.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.470
And then last winter, I read
Michelle's memoir in gallies.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.940
And I had the good fortune
to work with Michelle when

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.430
she was in a fiction class
when she was in the law

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.990
school here some years ago.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.260
And, in fact, she began this
book in Darcy Frye's class.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.170
Darcy's here in the audience
and teaches nonfiction here

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.030
at the University.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.440
And Michelle will tell
her story better than I.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.440
But as my students from
last spring can attest,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.500
when I read the book, I came
in, and I talked a lot about it

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.180
to the students, and every
time verklempt, [LAUGHS] right?

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.410
Every time.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.680
I'm not going to tear up now.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.160
But it too is the story of a
young man's transformation,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:40.360
and your transformation
to, and perhaps

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.950
a more optimistic narrative
in a way than that

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.950
of Nasir Khan in The Night Of.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.060
But the stories
are not unrelated.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.080
And then in May--

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.740
so Eddie and I worked together
when Eddie was in the MFA

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.150
program at Hunter College.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.110
And Eddie is a very
wonderful fiction writer.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.020
But the way Eddie came into this
particular narrative for me,

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.880
is that last spring after
he was accepted, and awarded

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.570
this wonderful scholarship to
come here to the ed school,

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.590
Eddie organized a panel
at the ed school in--

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.260
was it after classes had ended?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.480
It was a panel in for
which Eddie brought

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.880
a number of your students
or former l and also

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.970
Hakeem Browder, who is
the brother of Caliph

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.660
Browder, whose story
some of you may know.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.120
But Eddie bill
will tell us more.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.187
And these young men
were talking to--

00:06:51.187 --> 00:06:53.020
I thought there would
be 1,000 people there.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.480
But that's why I know it
was after classes ended

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.188
because there were a
lot of people there,

00:06:57.188 --> 00:06:59.620
but there weren't
1,000 people there.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.740
And those young men
were telling the stories

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.820
of their experiences.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:13.180
And I was very powerfully struck
by some of the experiences

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.900
they articulated
had images for me.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.690
And the images that
those experiences had

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.750
were from Richard's series.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.950
And one of the things
that one young men spoke,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.590
or more than one
young man spoke about,

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:39.320
was that when you first crossed
the bridge to Rikers Island,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.520
what it feels like to be on that
bus, and to be full of fear,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.210
and also to understand that
you can't be yourself anymore,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.047
and that you have to put on--

00:07:52.047 --> 00:07:53.630
it's almost like
putting on a costume.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.260
You have to put on another
persona to move forward

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.450
into this unknown world.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.100
So I thought we might perhaps
start with a video clip

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.150
from The Night Of.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.054
I'm just going to move
because my head's--

00:08:10.054 --> 00:08:11.958
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:12.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.636
- 43563, Hightower.

00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:18.133
- That's what I expected, OK?

00:08:18.133 --> 00:08:23.123
- Mr. Hightower, we meet again.

00:08:23.123 --> 00:08:24.620
[BUZZER]

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.095
[SIRENS]

00:10:35.358 --> 00:10:36.356
- Let's go.

00:11:13.282 --> 00:11:16.276
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.690
- Homosexual?

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.920
- No.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.630
- On any meds?

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.940
- Ventolin for my asthma.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.330
- Anything else?

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.620
- No.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.436
You sure?

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:09.060
You're looking a
little walleyed there.

00:12:12.117 --> 00:12:12.700
- I'm nervous.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.990
- Suicidal ideations?

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.850
- Ideations?

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.660
- Are you thinking
about killing yourself?

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.130
- No.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:29.190
- You in fear for your life?

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.022
- Should I be?

00:12:31.022 --> 00:12:31.730
- You a civilian?

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.155
No gang affiliation?

00:12:38.155 --> 00:12:43.920
OK, well, in that
case, good luck to you.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.820
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:50.820 --> 00:13:01.180
So I thought that we might
start by you guys filling in

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.220
for us a little
bit, each of you,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:09.940
about how you became
involved with these stories

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.765
in this world.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.810
Richard, maybe you'd
like to tell us

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:25.380
first about how you came
to Nasir Khan's story.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.980
m there's two things how I
came to Nasir Khan's story,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.840
and how I came to Nasir Khan
as opposed to any one else.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.140
Nasir Khan is Pakistani.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.740
And the reason
why he's Pakistani

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.460
is because the original
in the BBC version,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.020
it was the son of a cab driver.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.990
And you're going to have
white cab drivers in London.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.600
You're not going to have
white cab drivers in New York.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.049
And so the first thing,
if the main character's

00:13:51.049 --> 00:13:52.590
going to be son of
a cab driver, he's

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.870
got to be South Asian, or
Middle Eastern, or West African,

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.340
or some kind of Arab.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:07.710
And my wife, who was working
on a book about Pakistan,

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.780
and had been to Pakistan
a number of times,

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.860
I went with her once to
Lahore and I left early.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.680
It's tough for me, honestly.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.780
But living with her, and
spending time with her friends,

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:28.840
I felt like of anywhere in
that world that I had any iota

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.630
of intimacy, or
not even intimacy,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.250
of face-to-face contact
with, it was going to be--

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.690
I wanted my driver
to be Pakistani.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.660
So you can blame my wife
for Riz Ahmed's success.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.550
Anyways, so how did
I get to his history?

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.140
My experience with
prisons is basically

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:00.340
when I started doing Clockers in
1992, which is about basically

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.710
the crack world of Jersey City.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.790
I started out with
police doing ride-alongs

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.850
with police, and
various agencies.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.090
I spent time with m m
of mid-level dealers

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.790
on the street,
low level dealers.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.470
And invariably,
that world is going

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.010
to take you to Hudson
County Correctional Center.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.030
That was my first prison.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.280
And I didn't do anything
there, but a company, the cops

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.970
to offload their collars
into the bullpen.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.870
But I did know that
the building was

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.210
built in something like 1898.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.980
It was that 900% capacity,
900%, which means

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.440
the gym was a sea of bunk beds.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.400
There was a floor
where people should

00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:01.530
have been in and in hospitals,
seriously needed meds.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.820
And it was like a
row of tiger cages.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.440
It was like the
valley of the damned.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.250
These people couldn't even
live with themselves, let alone

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.250
anybody else.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.700
And they were in
such the wrong place.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.070
That was my first impression.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.520
And that was '92?

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.250
No, that was more like '88, '89.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.120
And I was asked
to teach a writing

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.270
class, a one-off writing
class at Sing Sing.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.209
So I went up there and
I had some interactions

00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:34.750
with the people that were in
the writing class, some of which

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.720
wanted to write, but most of
which wanted something good

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.920
in their jacket to speed
up the likelihood of them

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.340
getting an early release.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.820
And that's just a fact.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.030
And then I went to
the Santa Rita Jail

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.850
in Oakland, which is like the
cradle of the Black Panthers

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.020
to teach another class there.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.570
And that was a story.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.710
And then I had a young
guy when I was teaching

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.410
in a rehab program writing.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.730
This kid was very talented.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.710
He was not a drug addict,
but was smart enough

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.750
to say he had a drug
problem so he could

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.849
get into alternative
sentencing as opposed

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:17.980
to winding up on a prison barge.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.560
And I had a mentorial
relationship.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.800
And he went to jail one or
two times again and again.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.980
And I would always
constantly go to visit him.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.800
Ironically, my next
experience in jail

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.670
will be visiting one of the
producers of The Deuce, which

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.630
is a David Simon HBO
series that's on TV now.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.580
He just wound up in jail.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.109
That's another story
for another time.

00:17:44.109 --> 00:17:46.400
But basically, what I'm trying
to say is my experience,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.580
my personal experience
of prison is much less

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.030
than my two fellow speakers.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.760
Basically, in and
out, in and out,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.750
and a 30-year
friendship with somebody

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.810
who has been in and
out, and in and out,

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.634
and was very candid in
talking to me about it.

00:18:07.634 --> 00:18:10.080
Thank you.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.650
Eddie, how did you
come to first teach

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:18.180
at Rikers, Riker's inmates?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.850
So before I answer
that question,

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.720
I'd like to ask everyone to
join me in a moment of silence

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.660
for those who've lost their
lives in prisons and those who

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.270
continue to be
ruined in prisons,

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.353
whether it's physically
or civically.

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:44.980
All right, so now to
answer your question,

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.610
how did I get
involved in the work?

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.425
When I was 10 years old--

00:18:48.425 --> 00:18:51.809
so I live in the Bronx,
New York, born and raised.

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:53.600
When I was 10 years
old, I had a friend who

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.200
used to come over to the house.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.680
He was much older than I was.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.960
He was maybe 17, 18.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.600
He was a good friend
of my brother's.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.890
And he was athletic.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.850
He was smart.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:12.670
He was the kind of guy that kids
that were 10 would look up to.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:17.220
And suddenly, he went
missing for some time.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.530
And I was just curious about
what had happened to him.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.450
And my brother was
hiding it from me.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.190
So was my mom.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.950
And then I had learned
he went to jail.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.784
And I was curious
about what jail was.

00:19:28.784 --> 00:19:30.950
I'm not sure how much I
knew about jail at the time,

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.590
but I know I didn't know much.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.870
And so I had asked a
teacher about jail.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.210
And the teacher
told me that that's

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:44.180
where all the bad people go,
as I imagine most teachers tell

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.440
their students.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.100
But it just didn't
make sense to me,

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.420
because he was just
such a nice guy.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.182
Again, he would buy us stuff,
he would take us to the store,

00:19:54.182 --> 00:19:54.890
he was just cool.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.440
We looked up to him, kind of.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.550
Some time after that, he got
out of jail, fast forward four

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.280
years, and he killed himself.

00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:10.300
And there was something
about the jail experience

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.400
that changed him forever.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.950
After he got out of jail, he
was just different physically,

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.180
mentally.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.170
He had just been-- jail wore
him down in every way possible.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.810
And then that was
the first moment

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.700
when I became curious
with the institution

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.770
and what it was doing
to people in privacy.

00:20:29.237 --> 00:20:30.820
And it's funny,
because this weekend I

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.944
went home to New York City.

00:20:31.944 --> 00:20:33.430
And my mom for
some reason thought

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.310
it would be a smart idea
to tell my nephew that I

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.470
work in prisons and jails.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.960
And so my nephew asked me.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.560
My nephew asked me why I
want to work in a prison.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.010
And he said that his teacher
had told him that that's

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.300
where all the bad people go.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.630
And I didn't answer
his question then,

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:59.210
and I still don't think I know
the answer to his question now.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.130
But yeah.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.370
So that's how I
started doing the work.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.041
How I got involved in Rikers,
a friend of mine's-- quick

00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:06.540
story--

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.260
Reginald Dwayne
Betts-- he's a poet.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.360
He's a great, great guy.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.700
He did 10 years in state prison.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.560
Now he's at Yale Law School.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.500
They had commissioned
him to teach the course.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.240
And he's kind of a big shot now.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.590
So he was like, I can't do it.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.805
I'm in DC doing big shot things.

00:21:22.805 --> 00:21:24.180
But he said, but
I know this kid.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:24.971
He's kind of smart.

00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:27.341
Maybe he can do it.

00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:27.840
And yeah.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.470
He called me.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.180
And I had already
been doing the work

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.740
for some time back
and forth doing

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.982
workshops at different
prisons, doing stuff at jails,

00:21:34.982 --> 00:21:35.940
and teaching full time.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.314
And so I took the
job, and that's

00:21:37.314 --> 00:21:39.780
how I ended up on Rikers.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:46.370
But so were you teaching
inmates or former inmates?

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.550
Were you teaching-- were you
working with the prison system

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.070
as it were from basically
right out of college

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.150
or even before then?

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.940
Yes, so even before then,
I was tutoring-- so I

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.584
was tutoring at a nonprofit.

00:21:57.584 --> 00:21:59.000
So at the nonprofit,
I was working

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.650
with justice-involved youth.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.759
So all of these kids had
either been to state detention

00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:06.050
and were returning and trying
to earn their high school

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.640
equivalency diploma, or
had dropped out of school,

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.870
or had been on Rikers Island.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.390
So I was tutoring in that
capacity and working.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.850
And then I went on to work
full time at a nonprofit doing

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:17.840
the same work.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.880
And then I started doing
in the prison stuff

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.962
and in the jail stuff.

00:22:20.962 --> 00:22:22.670
So for the last 10
years, basically, I've

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.740
been working with the same
nontraditional students.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.700
Thank you.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.310
And Michelle, would
you tell us your story?

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.090
I will.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.840
So I went here as an undergrad.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.720
And I went to Arkansas,
rural Arkansas,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.180
one of the poorest
counties in the country,

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.480
and like most people, I
I was very idealistic.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:50.060
And this is a sign of my
middle class upbringing.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.710
I never thought I would end
up teaching jail and teaching

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.329
in prison because I was
teaching in a school.

00:22:57.329 --> 00:22:59.870
It was an alternative school
for kids who had been kicked out

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.370
of other schools.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:06.970
And I have met this
student named Patrick, who

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.050
was 15 and in the eighth grade.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:14.420
And he was really bright, really
quiet, broke up other fights.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.925
And I was really crazy,
because I was 22,

00:23:16.925 --> 00:23:19.050
and I was like, oh, Patrick's
not coming to school.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.730
I'll just go to his house
and get him to come.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.040
And education policy
is very complex.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.000
But this actually worked.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
One person telling him
to come to school worked.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.800
And he started to
come to school.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.230
And he loved silent reading.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.660
Kids get a reputation
for being bad kids.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.400
But so many of them
were just thirsting

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.970
for a quiet, peaceful
place to read.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:44.829
At the end of these two years,
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:46.370
I'm thinking I'm
finally figuring out

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.244
how to do this thing.

00:23:47.244 --> 00:23:47.940
I want to stay.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.360
I'm going to stay for
a couple more years.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.450
And my parents come to visit.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.850
So I've been looking for
Asians in the audience

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.160
and racially profiling you.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.440
So if any of you know
Taiwanese immigrant parents,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.602
you know they're
not happy with me.

00:24:03.602 --> 00:24:06.649
They're like why are you here?

00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:08.190
Do you want to be
a teacher for life?

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.220
They are so afraid.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.110
I sanitized some
stuff in my book

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:17.510
and took out some of the more
crazy things they said and did.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.990
But they basically said you're
not our daughter if you stay.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.300
And in some way, it's a
relief when somebody just

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.090
decides for you if you're
not sure what you want to do.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.256
To be single in a rural
area is really hard.

00:24:29.256 --> 00:24:30.630
I'm always joking
with my friends

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.880
that we need to start a
dating service in single areas

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.940
because then more
people would stay.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.250
You just can't meet people.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.990
So I decided to
come to law school.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.400
And I've made promises
that I shouldn't have made.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.850
I've told Patrick
that I'll stay.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.420
I'll stay to see him
graduate from high school.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.750
Fast forward to my third
year of law school,

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.110
and a friend of
mine calls and says,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.660
you had Patrick as a
student, didn't you?

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.250
My first thought
is that Patrick has

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.450
died because there's such a
high mortality rate among youth.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.810
It just doesn't occur to me
that it's something else.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.750
And my friend told me that
Patrick had got into a fight

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.810
and killed someone.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.150
And I was totally devastated.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.820
And I didn't believe it.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.927
I was like really shocked.

00:25:17.927 --> 00:25:19.510
And now when I think
about it, I think

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.370
the shock is assigned to
my middle class upbringing,

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.260
because of course, the
most peaceful kids get

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:29.050
caught up and swallowed
up by poor neighborhoods.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.600
So at the end of
these three years,

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.660
I've decided to do the lowest of
the low in the social hierarchy

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.500
of law school.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.040
Legal aid, it's paid
less than, whatever.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.130
It's paid less than
public school teachers.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:46.060
And I think a lot of
the heart, the driving

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.900
engine of this book, was this
collapse of this idea of I

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.620
am a good person.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.930
I think it's something a lot
of liberal, progressive think.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.790
And I was like,
I'm doing legal aid

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.040
for undocumented immigrants.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.380
I'm a good person.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.760
But I just really felt like
my moral coherence fall

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.720
apart because I
wondered to myself,

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.710
if I had stayed in this rural
area, this place where people

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.860
of means leave both within
Arkansas and outsiders who

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.469
come, would this have happened?

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:13.510
I know it sounds like a
really arrogant question.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.730
But if you live in
a rural area, you

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.670
know that relationships
matter, that people

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.230
are connected to one another.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.000
And you know also
that all the studies

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.730
show that truants,
people who drop out

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.060
have the highest rate
of going into crime.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.890
So I went back to see Patrick
to help him with his case.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:41.270
He had been charged
for first degree murder

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.720
and he hadn't seen his public
defender who was overworked

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.070
with so many cases in Arkansas.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.920
We started to talk
about his case.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.470
I met with his public defender.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.480
I tried to figure out
what happened that night.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.210
And he didn't want to talk about
the legal defenses to his case.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.870
This is also what
struck me, because I

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.300
had a lot of ideas for
legal defenses for his case,

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.270
but he wanted to hold on
to his story of his guilt,

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.430
that that was what
gave his life meaning.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.470
He was deeply Christian.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.600
And so we had to talk
about something else.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.200
And that's when we started
to read and write together

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.740
every day.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.270
And I just started going back.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.180
And we were reading The Lion,
The Witch and The Wardrobe,

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.480
and Frederick
Douglass, and poetry.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.460
And something that I
really ask in the book

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.710
is how is reading together
different from reading alone?

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.500
When we were reading
Frederick Douglass,

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.020
I was thinking to myself
that I was giving him

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.090
this American, black
American icon who

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:44.820
could attract tens of thousands
of people to these speeches,

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.550
and that Patrick would be moved
or uplifted by this example.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.590
And that was wrong.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.650
That was the wrong
idea to think about it.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:28:04.250
Patrick was deeply moved
by scenes in which masters

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:08.240
give the slaves gin to prove
to them that they can't handle

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.900
freedom over the holidays.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.570
And when Patrick read that,
he couldn't keep reading.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.490
So there is a way in
which reading together

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:21.045
continually challenged
me, and it challenged him.

00:28:21.045 --> 00:28:23.280
And by the end of
his time together, he

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.500
was writing these
extraordinary letters

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.200
to his daughter about
things he was reading,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.324
things he was
imagining them doing.

00:28:30.324 --> 00:28:31.490
The story doesn't end there.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.560
That would be really
a more hopeful ending.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.921
After he gets out
of jail after--

00:28:36.921 --> 00:28:39.420
so we get the charge lowered
to manslaughter, which is good.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.380
It's three to 10 years.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.990
He gets out in three years.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.304
But he can't find a job.

00:28:44.304 --> 00:28:45.720
It's hard to find
a job in Helena.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.160
It's hard to find a job
with a criminal record.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.890
He has hundreds of thousands
of dollars of child support

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.590
debt that piles up in prison.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.840
And so you can't
open a bank account.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.062
And it was important for me.

00:29:00.062 --> 00:29:01.520
It took me a long
time to even feel

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.190
I had license to
write this story.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:08.360
But it's important to emphasize
that even though I feel

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.000
that I did change his
experience of incarceration,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.180
I couldn't change the
systemic effects that

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.580
control his outcomes.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.390
Yeah, so that's how I ended up
teaching in a rural county jail

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:24.747
in Arkansas, which had no
education program, no GED

00:29:24.747 --> 00:29:26.330
programs, no mental
health counselors,

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.547
no re-entry programs, and where
he was held for 16 months.

00:29:30.547 --> 00:29:32.630
I think that's what led
me to teach at San Quentin

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.570
Prison, which was the opposite
in terms of the resources

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.200
available.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.180
You had hundreds of
volunteers every day

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:43.436
pouring in from Cal State,
from Berkeley, from Stanford.

00:29:43.436 --> 00:29:44.810
And you felt like
you were really

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.970
part of this organized
team that was

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:52.610
offering an array of spiritual
programs, education programs.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:57.710
And that abyss in terms of
the resources offered really

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.300
made me think about,
well, how do we

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.430
get rural areas, these people.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.490
The community colleges
are an untapped resource.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.520
But yeah, that's
how I got involved.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.560
Thank you.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:16.950
One thing I think that
is a common thread

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.680
is the youth of inmates.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.270
And also-- and I remember Eddie,
it was something that came up.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.870
I may get the statistics
wrong, but I remember

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:31.370
in the discussion in the
spring that there are--

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.680
is it 9,000 inmates in--

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.950
In Rikers, 8,000
inmates in Rikers.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:43.740
89% of those inmates are
black and Latino men.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.240
Of those 89%, 85% have
not been found guilty

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.510
of any criminal wrongdoing.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:55.230
So they're just awaiting trial,
which is backed up years.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.910
But that's not where
the story ends.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:58.830
There's also a women's
jail on Rikers Island

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.940
that people never
talk about, Rosies.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.910
There's 600 women at that
prison, at that jail.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.820
I'm sorry.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.210
Of those 600 women, 82%
are black and Latino.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.520
Of that 82%, 75%
have been diagnosed

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.710
with a serious
mental health issue

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:23.310
versus 42% on the men's side.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.130
And where it all takes
a twisted turn is

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:31.770
that of those 600 women,
65% are the sole caregivers

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.340
of their children.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:37.400
And so those are the same
children that we ask, well, why

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.930
didn't you get into Harvard?

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.370
Why aren't you at Stanford?

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.520
Why aren't you at Yale?

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:48.400
65%, so that's good
old America for you.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.530
So one of the things that
the film, that The Night Of,

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.310
this transformation of
this young man, it's

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:02.200
only really telling up to
the time of his trial, right?

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.290
It ends virtually
when the trial ends.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:15.520
So the number of untried youth,
the transformation, when Eddie,

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.880
you talk about this
young friend of yours,

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.380
a friend of your youth
who came home transformed,

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.520
those are transformations
that are happening often

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:35.240
in the space of time before
there's ever any trial.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:43.510
And so I wonder what,
aside from raising

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:50.600
awareness of these facts,
what can, as storytellers--

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.090
Richard, you've put the story
on the television in such a way,

00:32:55.090 --> 00:33:01.590
on HBO in such a way that
people will watch it.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.330
You guys have both
been teachers.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:09.460
But how do we begin to address?

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.280
Is there is there a
way as storytellers

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.065
that we can begin to
address these issues?

00:33:17.725 --> 00:33:23.961
So there was a time when
I was leaving Rikers,

00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:25.960
and I was going home, and
I was writing fiction,

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.830
obviously, right?

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.510
My first aspiration
was to write a book.

00:33:31.444 --> 00:33:32.860
But as we all know,
folks of color

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.510
can't do what we want to do.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.550
We have inherited
the responsibility

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:41.120
to fight for everyone
else in our community.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.140
Anyways, going home and
trying to write fiction

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.440
felt weirdly
self-indulgent, right?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.940
It felt like, how am I
going from this place

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:53.830
where people are literally
killing each other,

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.550
and doing all these horrendous
things to live, to coming home

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:03.300
and imagining, and trying to
craft characters, and settings,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:03.800
and plot.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.948
And so it became a
competition for me between

00:34:07.948 --> 00:34:09.489
should I be writing
essay or should I

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:13.000
be writing fiction, which
in retrospect feels silly

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.090
because the book that brought me
to the work in the first place

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.830
was a work of fiction.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.756
It was Toni Morrison's,
The Bluest Eye.

00:34:22.756 --> 00:34:24.130
And so that just
goes to show you

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:27.130
how fiction or writing
can bring us to the work

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.190
and can help change some stuff.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.370
But to address it more
directly, the class

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:35.199
that I'm running on
Rikers now, if we're

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.860
talking about the transformation
and the performance,

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.139
is also a project that I'm
working on here at Harvard,

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:44.840
is this class that I call
Writing the Other Self.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.340
Right

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.859
And the idea is
that on Rikers, they

00:34:46.859 --> 00:34:48.484
have to put on this
performance, right?

00:34:48.484 --> 00:34:51.010
It's a posturing of sorts.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.620
So that's rarely ever
who they truly are,

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.989
but who they must
pretend to be if they

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.210
want to survive the place.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.340
And so what I'm asking
them to do in this class

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.710
is to re-imagine themselves
outside of the inflexibility

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.800
of how they see themselves
in the jail, right?

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.030
And so we start by giving
ourselves a new name, right?

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:17.690
And it's all part of
creating this new identity.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.680
And so a funny thing is,
I had a kid, Not a kid.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.520
He's an adult. He gave
himself a French name.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.834
And his name was Jean.

00:35:25.834 --> 00:35:27.250
And we laughed at
him for a while.

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.700
But then I thought, shit,
this is interesting.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.090
Wow, I'm wondering
where we can take this.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.920
And I had another student
who said to me in the class

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.730
that he was wondering if I
could bring in an acting coach.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.520
And I was asking, why do
you want an acting coach?

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.570
Am I not enough?

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:47.320
What's going on?

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:53.560
And what he said to
me was, well, I'm

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.140
interested in learning
new ways to walk,

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:03.800
new gestures, new voice
inflections, new tonalities.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:09.290
They were really trying to
recreate themselves entirely.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.310
Another part of the thing I
had them do is write scripts.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:20.520
So while I am proud of urban
culture, and the ways we speak,

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.740
and the vernacular,
it's also deeply

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.060
problematic in some ways.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.630
And I tell my
students all the time,

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:28.880
we can talk like that in here.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.200
But you're not going
to get a job that way,

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.790
which is a whole
different argument

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:34.914
for a whole different time.

00:36:34.914 --> 00:36:38.262
But anyways, so I have
them write new scripts.

00:36:38.262 --> 00:36:39.970
And so I have them
write these dialogues.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.636
And so I have to
pretend, pretend you're

00:36:41.636 --> 00:36:43.090
talking to your mom, right?

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.980
How would you speak to her?

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.550
What are some new
words you would use?

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.080
And the kid that
named himself Jean

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.790
was trying to learn French.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:55.720
And so this thing could stretch
out beyond anything that I ever

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.800
imagined it could be.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.070
But that's the idea, right?

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.780
We've been given
these conditions, Now

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:07.870
how can we recreate ourselves
so that we can be a multitude,

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:12.400
so that we can be both the
person we have to be sometimes,

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.990
But the person
that we might want

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:18.010
to be in privacy or
away from everyone else,

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.310
away from the disasters,
away from the violence.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.560
That's beautiful.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.090
It makes me think.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:31.690
Richard, how, just thinking
of the language, how did you,

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:37.000
you who are celebrated
for your dialogue

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.750
and for your ear for dialogue,
how did you find the language

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:47.140
for the prisoners in the film?

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.320
I just have them
talk like people.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.320
I don't know.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.240
it's not like how do you
talk in prison as opposed

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.600
to how do you talk
on Lennox Avenue.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.140
People have lives before
they go to prison.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:06.460
And that's the language
that they have.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.880
So it sounds like there's this--

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:13.510
I'm going to do an Esperanto
quote, you know, prisonanto.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.120
People in prison talk
just like people--

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.470
some are well
spoke, some aren't.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:27.730
Some people speak in such
high speed in crowd vernacular

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.650
that I feel like
I want subtitles.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.690
Some people, I wish
they would talk faster.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.620
It's like I say about cops.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.030
Cops are people.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.940
There's assholes,
there's saints--

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.860
it wasn't like this,
is Solomon's rings

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.530
where King Solomon had
this magic ring where

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.390
he can understand the
language of birds,

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.300
and bees, and animals.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.260
They're human beings.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.100
Of course.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.900
But I think one of
the things that is--

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:01.900
I suppose whatever
cabbie's son he'd been,

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.190
whatever family he'd come from,
your character who ended up

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:09.980
being Nasir Khan, we travel
with him into the prison.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.650
And he's never been before.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:15.120
And so he's learning
a whole new language.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.190
And yes, people--

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:21.220
He's learning how
to verbally posture,

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.000
because it's part of
the survival strategy.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.630
The tragedy of Kalief
Browder is multi-faced.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:38.260
But what a young man, when he
comes into prison, if you want

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:42.670
to survive so different
than concentration camps,

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:46.560
if you want to survive,
you have to develop

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.250
to willing yourself
to survive, which

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:54.370
means do anything, be
ruthless, be alert.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:40:00.490
And for those who can't
do that, you might die.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:05.560
For those who can, it's a
horrible surgery on yourself,

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.670
because either you have to tap
into something inside yourself,

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.520
that you'd never
want to tap, and then

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.810
it makes you question the
whole nature of yourself

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.040
as opposed to your
public persona,

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.750
and you've got to pump
that up to the surface,

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:26.260
or you've got to do
this from scratch.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:32.800
And at the end of The Night Of,
this Pakistani working class

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.650
kid who goes in, who's a
marketing student at Queens

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.560
College, he goes in there.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.920
And he's a lamb.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.480
And he comes out like half
wolf because he wanted to live.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.650
And the question is that when--

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.900
or the issue is, when
he goes to his trial,

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:59.780
and people see a swarthy
kid with stubble head,

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:05.200
with tattoos on his neck,
bulked up, that's who he had.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.360
That's who he had to become.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.130
But now that he's
become that person,

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.120
how do you tuck that person
away once you walk out.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.590
A lot of people say,
people in prison,

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.290
they feel like you
have two lives, one

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:24.000
before you go to prison, and one
after you come out of prison.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.570
And even if you strive and
make something of yourself,

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.180
this is your prison
post prison life.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.170
And it makes that kid
that you were a memory.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.960
And it is actually something
that we see him physically,

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.140
that transformation that
we watch him physically

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:44.723
going through.

00:41:44.723 --> 00:41:46.720
And he changes the
way he walks, right?

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.850
Well, it's like he's adapting.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:52.720
He's adapting until-- his
adapting is such that even

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.987
he doesn't know who he is.

00:41:53.987 --> 00:41:56.320
So in fact, at the end, you
don't even know if he did it

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.090
or not.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.190
But you can believe
looking at him--

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:01.925
a lot of people--

00:42:01.925 --> 00:42:03.300
I always thought
he didn't do it,

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.360
but a lot of people
reviewing the show

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.870
felt like, well,
look at the guy.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:12.790
He was a thug all along.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.560
And I just felt like, no.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.922
This is what he's
become to live.

00:42:18.922 --> 00:42:23.510
It doesn't mean-- well,
he was always this guy.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.920
Can I just say one quick thing?

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.470
So I used to mentor
Kalief Browder.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:29.840
And I remember one of the
very first conversations

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.265
we had after he got out of--

00:42:32.265 --> 00:42:33.265
after he was off Rikers.

00:42:36.114 --> 00:42:37.530
I would stay up
all night thinking

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.800
about what I wanted to ask him.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.700
And I asked him, now
that you're off Rikers,

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.750
what are you afraid of?

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.980
And he said to me, I'm
afraid that I'll never

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.720
be the person I was
before I got there.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.500
And then we all know
how that story ends.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.538
He commits suicide.

00:42:59.538 --> 00:43:02.340
But yeah.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.690
I'm wondering, Michelle, whether
the experience of Patrick,

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.719
whether it's different,
whether it's the same,

00:43:09.719 --> 00:43:11.760
or whether it's different
in certain ways because

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:17.610
of the circumstances,
the rural prison.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.220
I don't know if
this was something

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.650
you were aware of,
that that sort of need

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.400
for a persona for
survival in the jail--

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.750
what were his circumstances?

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.740
Was he in a private cell?

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.800
So he was in a rural
county jail where it's

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.544
really different from Rikers.

00:43:36.544 --> 00:43:38.460
He was transferred to a
place more like Rikers

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.750
after he took his
plea for manslaughter.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.140
The rural county jail
has no organization.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.790
It's cells without doors,
16 people in one place,

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.640
broken toilets everywhere.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.020
The jailer also worked
part time at McDonald's.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.630
I saw him there.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:01.110
Another jailer was notorious
for mixing up meds that he gave,

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:05.802
no oversight whatsoever,
really, really different.

00:44:05.802 --> 00:44:06.510
No budget, right?

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.410
No budget at all.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.300
And the state of Arkansas
shut down that jail

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.290
several years later.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.331
So if the state of Arkansas
is shutting you down,

00:44:12.331 --> 00:44:15.570
that's a really bad sign.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:21.150
And but everything
you're saying resonates.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.210
Patrick changed after jail.

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:26.440
He was a different person.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.660
You have to survive.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:36.570
And I think also,
in Nas is innocent,

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.320
50% of state prisoners
have violent offenses.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.830
And they're dealing with it.

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:46.496
They're traumatized
by it, traumatized

00:44:46.496 --> 00:44:47.370
by what they've done.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.660
And they don't have a
language to speak about it.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.270
James Foreman and great--

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.770
Locking Up Our
Own, a great book.

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.080
He talks about how
liberals have ceded

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.050
the territory of vile offenses
to conservatives because they

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.400
know it's a losing battle.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.770
We've been ceding
it for 20 years.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.510
We focused on
nonviolent offenses

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.730
because it's a winnable issue.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.350
It connects people.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.480
Even a conservative
would think that 20 years

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.550
is too much for a
mere drug possession.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:15.630
But we have violent offenses
that arise out of poverty.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.220
And we have to talk.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.160
We have to talk about them
and find ways for them

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.770
to feel that they're part
of a national discourse.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.950
Black Lives Matter is
incredibly inspiring to me,

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.350
but it is rescuing
black innocents.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:32.160
And Patrick's
story is about what

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.660
it feels like to be guilty.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.190
And no matter how
many times I try

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:38.940
to explain to Patrick, like
sociological circumstances,

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.925
contacts, if you have
been born a different zip

00:45:40.925 --> 00:45:43.300
code that would have happened,
he didn't want to hear it.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.030
He needed to have his guilt
to have a sense of meaning

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:49.470
and free will.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:52.300
So that's really powerful to me.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.900
That was part of his
dignity to feel guilty.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.530
So how do we break
that story gently?

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:03.060
It means telling more
stories of people

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.690
who want to make
sense of their crimes

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:13.440
and who have worthwhile lives
in spite of what they've done.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.110
I would say, just a small
note, the transformation

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.540
isn't only Nas's alone, right?

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.310
There's this idea that
when we lock someone up,

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:28.670
or we imprison someone, that
it is an individual experience

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:32.630
and they're the only ones
undergoing the transformation.

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:35.330
And really what happens is
in some abstract and physical

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.700
and real ways when
you lock someone up,

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.282
you lock up their community,
you lock up their family,

00:46:41.282 --> 00:46:42.365
you lock up their friends.

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:48.920
Just last month,
my two cousins had

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.970
to self-surrender to
the federal courts.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.980
And I feel like I'm in prison.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.410
I just can't speak
to them as much

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.396
as I used to speak
to them every day.

00:46:56.396 --> 00:46:57.520
And you see it in the show.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.490
His mother's ruined.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:03.860
You see kids on Rikers.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.820
His brother too.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.690
Yeah, his brother.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:12.130
You see kids on Rikers
walking through Magno meters.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:12.910
Yeah.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:13.410
Yeah.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.150
That was the most powerful
part of the show is to me,

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:22.660
the Pakistani parents, the
mother starting to doubt.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.150
And then once Nas lost
his mother's confidence,

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:30.920
it's like something in
him broke irrevocably.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.915
That was very powerful.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:40.470
The other thing, it's a
slightly different facet that

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:43.090
we're trying to
show with this show,

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:50.820
is [INAUDIBLE] had the
concept of the crab cage,

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.390
that where people,
if you put them--

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:58.500
take a bunch of crabs,
put them in a cage,

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.470
like a cylinder,
they'll reflexively,

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:05.160
when one starts to climb,
they'll reflexively--

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.680
another one will pull it down.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:14.020
And so you could say that's
a bad crab for what he did.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.675
He pulled that other crab down.

00:48:15.675 --> 00:48:17.370
But how about the crab cage?

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:21.480
How about the divisors
of the crab cage?

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:28.110
And there's a villain in The
Night Of that has no name

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:29.970
and has no face.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:34.155
And that's the personality
of the whole justice system.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.190
You get into the system.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:44.310
It's like there's a big cog
driven circular machine that's

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:48.480
caught the hem of your pants.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.090
And it slowly just
pulls you in--

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:52.260
nothing personal, buddy.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.910
I'm just a machine.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:57.530
And you come out,
and you masturbated.

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:59.130
And who do you blame?

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:00.360
Do you blame the judges?

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.890
Do you blame the cops?

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.470
Do you blame the prosecutors?

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:11.670
Do you blame the alpha dogs
in the survival environment?

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:14.640
It's just this thing
that has no face.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.980
And is inexorable.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:22.540
And on the other hand,
you need a system.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:28.750
But there's something-- if
you're trying to strike it,

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:29.680
where is it's face?

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.000
Where is its belly?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.670
Where is its heart?

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:39.190
You're just-- and it's
just a grinding machine.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:40.880
And everybody's a part of it.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.930
And everybody's doing their job.

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:48.420
And it's just too big for
any-- is it an evil judge?

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.490
Is it evil?

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:54.102
It's this thing.

00:49:54.102 --> 00:49:55.820
Eddie, did you want to--

00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:59.350
I think yes.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.650
I think the show is--

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.860
I think if you read this sort of
as a sociological text, what's

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.160
less important is what
happens, like the consequence

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.870
of the legal proceedings.

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:14.560
But I think one of the genius
things about oppression

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.764
is how--

00:50:15.764 --> 00:50:17.680
well, one of the worst
things about oppression

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.810
is how genius it is.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:22.360
The machine is just self
replenishing, right?

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.950
And I think what
the show is begging

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.220
us to do the entire time
is to look how it works,

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.480
like look at how this works.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.320
And there's a great scene in
the last episode, I think it is,

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.500
where Nas is like, I'm free.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.580
And he's just like,
all right, man.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.790
Yeah, like I have to
be on the next call.

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:41.447
I have someone
else have to save.

00:50:41.447 --> 00:50:42.280
I'll meet you there.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.850
And you just never get a
moment to relax because that is

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:47.470
the nature of the beast, right?

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:51.250
It's just day and night
swallowing people up,

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:54.010
swallowing people up
disproportionately

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:57.520
who look like me, all right?

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.820
Well, and maybe we could
show this second clip.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.650
And there are
issues that come up,

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:05.950
because one of the
things, one of the issues

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:08.440
that came up in the
discussion in the springtime

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.660
was about the entire community,
and that often the people who

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:16.840
are the guards or who
are working in the prison

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.440
come from the same
communities as the inmates.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:24.340
Well, that's how people in
prison in my experience, what

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.970
I've learned is that
the guy said, well, how

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.980
can this guy become a kingpin?

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.686
He's in prison.

00:51:30.686 --> 00:51:31.810
Everybody else has weapons.

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:33.400
He's a skinny guy.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.520
Well, he starts out--

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.680
he has pull in the
outside world, which

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.260
is probably the reason
why he's in there

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.210
because in an enterprise.

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:45.940
All these guys, they grew
up together, the guards.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:49.570
And everybody knows
where everybody lives.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:52.810
So guards will kowtow
to some of these guys

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:57.610
because they don't want
somebody to fuck up their wives

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:01.880
or show up at the
quinceanera with an uzi

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.960
at their 15-year-old
kid's party.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.260
So I mean--

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.561
That's the clip actually that--

00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:10.060
Yeah.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.070
That's the clip we're going to--

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:12.160
I just blew that one.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.153
No, you didn't.

00:52:13.153 --> 00:52:15.618
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:15.618 --> 00:52:17.590
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.548
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.542
- Have a seat.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:04.856
- That guard, Tito?

00:53:04.856 --> 00:53:07.420
His daughter's having a
quinceanera this weekend.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.075
That's her sweet 16, only 15.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.676
But the dude live
in Brownsville, man,

00:53:17.676 --> 00:53:21.316
as shitty a hood as they come.

00:53:21.316 --> 00:53:22.940
So I said, man, you
should be concerned

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.080
about the local thugs
crashing the thing,

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.967
getting high, fighting.

00:53:27.967 --> 00:53:30.300
The next thing you know,
somebody's squeezing off shots,

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.370
don't care who they hit.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.120
I said, I couldn't
guarantee that won't happen,

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.890
but I could make
a few phone calls,

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:42.600
see if I can help out with that.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.884
That's what that little
thank you is for.

00:53:46.884 --> 00:53:49.758
You see, us--

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.922
- Have a seat.

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:10.280
- That guard, Tito?

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.810
His daughter's having a

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:17.490
That's her sweet 16, only 15.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.106
But the dude lives
in Brownsville, man,

00:54:23.106 --> 00:54:26.736
as shitty a hood as they come.

00:54:26.736 --> 00:54:28.360
So I said, man, you
should be concerned

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.760
about the local thugs
crashing the thing,

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.292
getting high, fighting.

00:54:33.292 --> 00:54:34.750
The next thing you
know, somebody's

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:39.200
squeezing those shots,
don't care who they hit.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.570
I said, I couldn't
guarantee that won't happen,

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:44.280

a few phone calls,

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.020
see if I could
help out with that.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:52.240
That's what that little
thank you is for.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.660
You see, us and the guards,
we all from the same hood.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.950
Some of us even
grew up together.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.480
They know our families.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.630
We know theirs.

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:05.812
Family's everything, right?

00:55:05.812 --> 00:55:07.355
It is in a Muslim family.

00:55:10.025 --> 00:55:12.440
- Yeah.

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.578
- Let me tell you
something, man.

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:27.790
See those brothers you pray
with, the Nation of Islam?

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:30.480
They're not your friends.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.940
In fact, they hate your ass
because you're a natural born

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:36.660
Muslim, and they're just
phony jailhouse opportunists

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:39.286
looking for better food.

00:55:39.286 --> 00:55:42.190
Don't know the difference
between Cairo, Egypt, or Cairo,

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:44.444
Illinois.

00:55:44.444 --> 00:55:46.810
- I'm Pakistani, not Egyptian.

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:49.750
- Yeah, well my ancestors came
from Dahomey and not the Congo.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:52.266
Who gives a fuck, man?

00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:54.070
So you're a celebrity in here.

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.930
And I'm not talking
the good kind.

00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:00.290
Dude kills four
guys over some dope.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.690
OK.

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:04.970
But murder a girl?

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:06.451
Rape a girl?

00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:06.950
- I didn't.

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:08.630
- Doesn't matter.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:10.310
Makes no difference.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:14.200
See, there's a whole separate
judicial system in here,

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.960
and you've just been
judged and juried.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.113
And it didn't come
out good for you.

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:32.244
- Close your eyes.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.348
Close your eyes, I said.

00:56:56.817 --> 00:56:57.650
- Give me your hand.

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:03.399
Don't be afraid, Nasir.

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:20.924
- Feels good, right?

00:57:20.924 --> 00:57:21.908
Like silk?

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.056
- It's meat.

00:57:34.056 --> 00:57:35.440
- You wish.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.658
It's somebody's heart.

00:57:38.658 --> 00:57:43.920
[LAUGHS] Yeah, it's meat,
but the best kind, veal.

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.174
You people eat veal, right?

00:57:46.174 --> 00:57:47.830
- Sometimes.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:48.970
- But only blessed, right?

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:53.310
I respect that.

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.230
- Thank you.

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:58.470
- Listen to you,
all polite and shit.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:09.920
See, the reason
it feels like silk

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:15.650
is because on the day it's born,
they keep it in a dark crate,

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:19.270
so small, it can't
even turn around.

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:24.370
And it stays there, half blind
in the dark, drinking baby

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:26.418
formula, waiting to die.

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:47.240
- There are some bad people in
here, but I could protect you.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:52.950
Nasir, do you want
my protection,

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:55.080
or do you prefer
dead in the shower

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:59.170
with your brains bashed
in, guts on the floor?

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.510
It's up to you.

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:17.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:20.780
I just wanted to say one
thing about that scene

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:26.030
in the context of what
we're talking about, is

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:27.740
that scene was written.

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:32.900
That scene was
much more composed

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.710
and eloquent than in real life.

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:43.160
So what you were looking
at was fictional drama

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.980
to get across a certain point.

00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:50.450
But the goal of it was also
to fascinate and to entertain.

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:58.870
And I doubt there are many
scenes like that in real life.

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:06.930
And I just want to draw that
distinction between what

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:10.230
everybody is saying
and the artifice

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.440
of writing a television show.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.308
Hopefully, you're
getting an essence out.

01:00:16.308 --> 01:00:21.600
But I can't imagine that scene
going down your line by line

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.360
in prison, in real life.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.160
What fiction gives
you, well, fiction

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.330
is artificial by nature.

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:36.510
But it takes the chaos of
life in a certain environment,

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:38.130
say, prisons.

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:43.800
And it forces a shapeliness
on its delusion of reality.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.300
And in this way,
sometimes they say

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.230
fiction is more powerful
than nonfiction and reality

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:57.000
because it steers you to
comprehension in a way life is

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.790
too random to do.

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:00.870
Life is not neat.

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:02.530
That was neat, that scene.

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:04.630
I don't mean neat like fun.

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.020
I mean people were laughing.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.730
The actors were fantastic.

01:01:11.436 --> 01:01:15.680
But just fiction
sometimes nudges reality

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.180
into a recognizable
shape for a lesson.

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.550
I just wanted to say that.

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:25.670
The other thing I wanted to
say about that Harvard t-shirt

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:29.060
since we're here, the whole
point of the Harvard t-shirt

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:32.540
is that when he was
arrested, at the precinct,

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.820
his clothes were all
taken by the crime scene

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.840
unit for forensic processing.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:46.490
And they basically gave him the
bullpen equivalent of scrubs.

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.040
So he's walking
around, like an intern,

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.620
or a person whose clothes had
been completely taken away

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.700
from him.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:58.730
And one of the detectives
there, trying to seduce him

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:01.035
into speaking says here.

01:02:01.035 --> 01:02:05.450
And there's always this random
pile of clothes at a precinct.

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:07.930
And he gives him the
clothes, so when he goes in,

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:10.160
when he goes further,
he doesn't look

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.110
like he's just been stripped.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:16.310
And he ironically winds up with
a Harvard shirt The double down

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:17.090
ironic--

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:20.890
and I told this to one of the--

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:26.777
my friend who was in and out for
30 odd years out of 45 years.

01:02:26.777 --> 01:02:28.610
He said, well, here's
what's going to happen

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:30.370
with that Harvard shirt.

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:32.690
He's going to have to
take it off immediately.

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:35.440
It's a gang color.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.600
So I don't know if you're
Crips or Bloods out there,

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.400
but you're Harvards.

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:49.210
I think the question
of fiction and what

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:53.120
it can do both in telling--

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.100
imagining.

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:58.570
Eddie, your students, imagining
the stories of their lives,

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:01.640
and, Richard, you
imagining, say,

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.670
Nas's story, the possibilities
of fiction I think

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:09.440
are what I keep coming back to.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.920
And I wondered,
Michelle, whether, just

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.360
to make sure we have it out
there, because you might read

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.480
one of the things that
Michelle asked Patrick to do

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.070
was write letters
to his daughter.

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:23.060
And I wondered if you
might just share with us

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.940
the first one and the last one.

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.640
Oh, yes.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.600
I'd love to.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.631
Yeah, so I wrote
nonfiction, and I

01:03:31.631 --> 01:03:33.880
was really embarrassed at
the idea of writing a quote,

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.964
unquote "memoir."

01:03:34.964 --> 01:03:37.630
For the longest time when people
asked me what I was working on,

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.420
I'd be like, it's a
mixture of law and history

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:44.380
about the rural south because--

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:49.630
I don't know-- I think it's hard
to place yourself on the page,

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:56.380
and to own the difference
in equality between yourself

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.220
and another person.

01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:03.950
So here is the first letter
Patrick wrote to his daughter.

01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:08.380
His daughter's name is
Cheri, or cherished.

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.760
"Hey, Cheri, I know
I'm not in your life.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.580
It'd be my fault. It hurt
me I ain't there with you.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.940
Here, people be arguing about
nothing and trying my patience.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.520
Sitting here doing
nothing, but how messed up

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.080
I am thinking of you.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.010
Love, your daddy.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.260
And this is after he's
worked intensively

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.950
reading, and writing,
and being fully absorbed.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:34.730
He's reading in a concrete
stairway that has no light.

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:39.180
People steal his stuff, but
not his books or notebooks.

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.180
Whenever I leave books
of them, I'm always like,

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.471
are people going to take these?

01:04:42.471 --> 01:04:45.140
He's like, they're not
going to take this.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:49.400
And this is at the end
of our time together.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.370
"You and I are canoeing
down the Mississippi River.

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:54.410
There are so many
trees, bunched together

01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:56.220
in the water like bushes.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.310
The river is shadowy
in some places,

01:04:58.310 --> 01:05:03.080
but the light shines
through cracks of the trees.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.570
Near the bank, there's a great
blue heron standing still,

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:07.100
searching for fish.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.780
And as we are
passing, a silver carp

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.870
surfaces as if it is
jewelry in the water.

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:13.940
You say, Dad, look, a snake.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:14.600
I say, where?

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.640
And you say, no,
it's just a vine.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.170
We hear splashes.

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:20.270
The white light glitters
on the muddy water, which

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:22.600
you say looks like coffee.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.100
When we approach the thick
of cottonwoods and cypress,

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:28.100
we can hear birds.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.980
On some low branches hang
plenty of mulberries.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.340
You stretch your arm
straight out to grab some.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.600
They are white because
they are not ripe yet.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.810
But the edible ones
are bluish black.

01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:40.640
You see on it it
stains your shirt.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.520
As we roll away, I tell you
that whenever we are at home

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:47.120
and you take a nap, I think
of you as a sleeping berry.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.710
It's amazing to
see trees grow out

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.780
of the water in so
many different shapes.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.840
Some have a Y shape and
others are lying down.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.430
The willow trees
are so tall that you

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:57.155
can hear our necks
cracking while we

01:05:57.155 --> 01:05:59.000
are looking for the top.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.530
To the left, it's
a floating log.

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:02.870
And suddenly, I see it
has two turtles on it.

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:05.600
We watched the Turtles
until they jump off.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.280
You want to feel the
water too, so you

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.240
can put your foot outside
the canoe and into the river.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.750
I could see it dangling under
the surface like a little fish.

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:16.520
I'm sitting at the
bow with my hands

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.620
behind my head mesmerized.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.400
If the wind blows and
the tree leaves shake,

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.042
it sounds like rattling paper."

01:06:29.915 --> 01:06:33.110
When I have read
that to my students,

01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:35.360
I say if everybody
could write like that,

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.520
we wouldn't need a
writing class, right?

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.950
He's a beautiful writer.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.700
And I'm also struck
because, Eddie,

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:50.450
what you were saying about
with your students imagining,

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:54.440
imagining who they want to be,
who the other self would be.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:58.597
And I recall that Patrick
had not been canoeing.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:06:59.180
Is that right?

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.100
He had not been canoeing
on the Mississippi.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:01.600
No.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.840
He wanted lots of pictures,
pictures of Mississippi,

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.430
and Arkansas.

01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:10.760
There's a moment in
Clockers that I really

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.970
love where the kids are just
going through catalogs, just

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:15.830
to look at the pictures.

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:17.980
And that's how it was
whenever I brought

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.254
in anything with pictures
of Arkansas and Mississippi.

01:07:20.254 --> 01:07:22.670
And it's interesting when we
have an idea of a rural area.

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:25.100
We think people are really
connected to the land.

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.770
But they often aren't
because large multinational

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:31.055
corporations own thousands
of acres of land.

01:07:31.055 --> 01:07:34.090
So they aren't
connected in a way.

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:36.830
And there is no opportunity
to go on the river,

01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:40.982
and explore, to take swimming
lessons, or anything like that.

01:07:40.982 --> 01:07:42.440
I don't mean to
cut you off though.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.550
No, no, no.

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:47.530
I just wanted to say a thing
about the fiction stuff.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:51.480
So I was trying out the
writing the other self thing

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:55.530
with both inmates and with
folks that I was working

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.930
with outside of the gym, right?

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:00.675
So they had access
to worldly things.

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:08.120
It was interesting because I had
this one student who was really

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.330
enjoying the exercise, right?

01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:12.890
And so he had given
himself a new name.

01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:15.150
He had been spending time
with this new identity.

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:20.080
And then one day he came
to me and said, Eddie,

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:24.430
but I can't
fictionalize a felony.

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.250
And so then
suddenly, now there's

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:30.407
a whole new layer
to this problem.

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:32.490
And that's why it's hard
to think about it outside

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:37.200
of the person without
considering also

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.890
the system that is
invested just as much

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:45.390
in making sure that these
kids aren't doing well.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:48.600
And I had no answer for that,
because there is no answer,

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.359
because I've had students
who've gone on interviews

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:54.720
and haven't gotten
the jobs, or course,

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.310
for private organizations
because they had records.

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:03.600
But a thing I will say about
the fiction, the fiction

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.439
stuff, and some of the
possibilities of writing

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:13.590
the other self is that
it's like a thing that--

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:17.729
so Colum McCann was one of the
professors I had at the MFA.

01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:20.460
And Coolum McCann, whenever
we were workshopping a story,

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:24.720
would stop abruptly and ask,
would this character use make--

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.130
would this character
wear makeup,

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:28.319
or would this character travel?

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.359
If so, where would
this character travel?

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:32.010
And Colum was
never really asking

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:34.390
because it was important
for the narrative.

01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:36.569
Colum was only asking
because he wanted

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:39.689
to make sure that me, the
person writing the story,

01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:42.689
knew the character that
I was writing intimately.

01:09:42.689 --> 01:09:44.880
And so one of the things
I've had my students

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.910
do is give the person that
they're creating hobbies,

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:48.446
right?

01:09:48.446 --> 01:09:49.529
What would this person do?

01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:51.720
I want you to know
the person intimately.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.330
And I had one of my students
come back to me and said,

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:56.580
I went to the museum this week.

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.600
And this kid had never left
Brownsville in his entire life

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.350
maybe.

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:03.390
That is, for many of us--

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.280
I'm from the same
place they are--

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.530
that is the extent of our
world sometimes, unfortunately,

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:11.670
unfortunately in some ways.

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.410
It's a beautiful place.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:15.510
But yeah, so he had
went to the museum.

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:18.900
And so I'm curious about what
happens, as you fictionalize

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.730
this new identity,
when you inhabit

01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:24.390
this space or the person,
and get to know the person,

01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:26.520
and spend more time
with the person,

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.070
and do things that
person would do.

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:30.240
So I see how it works.

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.550
And then I see how
it doesn't work.

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:37.420
Yeah.

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.900
Yeah.

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:42.380
Well, there are lots of things
swirling in my head right now.

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:48.077
And as you say, you can't
fictionalize a felon,

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.910
one of the things that's
swirling in my head

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:54.500
is that I believe in France
with the Napoleonic Code.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.430
Once you've purged your
crime, it cannot be mentioned.

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:01.820
And that is a very
different approach, right?

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:02.990
You have purged your crime.

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:06.350
It's literally seen
as it's expunging.

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:09.020
And it's gone.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.740
And how different it is here,
and that the narrative is not

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:18.620
one that actually allows
for rehabilitation, really.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.460
It doesn't.

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.320
In this summer--
so another thing.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.900
This summer I revisited
the Albert Camus,

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.910
and I read The Stranger,
which is really good,

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.770
but for other reasons.

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:33.770
And one of the things
that happens in that book,

01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:35.390
there's an interesting
thing where

01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:39.320
the narrator or the
protagonist is--

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.660
so he spent some time in jail.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:46.320
And one of his hobbies
becomes to imagine himself

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.750
on the beach, or imagine
himself outside of the place.

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:54.210
But what you find happens after
some time in jail or in prison

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:57.210
is that he becomes
so deeply affected,

01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:59.640
that the only thing he
can imagine are like--

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.240
or he can't even imagine
anymore, that the only thing he

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.130
can think of are
activities that he

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:08.810
was doing within the
boundaries of the actual jail.

01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:13.020
And I've had students tell
me on Rikers or at prisons

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.430
I don't have an imagination.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.260
I've asked students in
prisons or on Rikers,

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.100
what do you want to be
when you get out of here?

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.960
What are some of
your aspirations?

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.150
And I hope there's not
a plumber in the crowd.

01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:34.050
But what I've recognized,
I'm going to say,

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:39.230
is that like most of them have
lost that capacity to dream,

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:39.980
right?

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:41.490
I want to be a plumber.

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.865
Yeah, maybe I'll be
a security guard,

01:12:43.865 --> 01:12:47.190
or maybe I'll be a technician
or something like that.

01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:52.340
And it's just like, what happens
to the imagination in jail?

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.140
And this is not
happenstance, right?

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.970
This isn't a coincidence.

01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:59.470
This is a pattern that I've
recognized in this place.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:00.270
Yeah, so--

01:13:03.455 --> 01:13:04.580
Is that something, Richard?

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:09.580
Do you think that when you--
maybe you don't imagine further

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:10.520
for your character.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:16.030
But if you do, do you imagine
that his sense of the possible

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:19.010
is curtailed by his experience?

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:20.650
Permanently curtailed?

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:24.580
He comes out where he
might have seen mountains.

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:28.870
Now he sees plains.

01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:36.160
And I think he's so
conditioned to fight or flight,

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:45.240
and outsmarting someone
in order to survive,

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.200
or his manipulation has become--

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.770
he's been manipulated
by his environment

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:56.880
into thinking of constant
manipulation as a way of life.

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:05.610
He can't get the prison
smell off his brain.

01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:11.430
And it's kind of corny,
but I always remember,

01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:18.190
I think when sometimes fantasy
is on scale with the reality,

01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:25.170
which is to say if your becomes
like a just vicious phone

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:30.810
booth, crowded phone booth,
your fantasy is not someday

01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:31.810
I'll fly an airplane.

01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:37.440
Your fantasy is maybe
if I move this way,

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.740
I'll have another
free pocket of air,

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:41.910
because this is your world.

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:50.490
I remember, in one of
the Sholem Aleichwm,

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:55.350
Gimple the Fool, who was a pure
soul, finally goes to heaven.

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:58.800
But he's been very
poor his entire life.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:07.080
He's done nothing but
pogroms and deprivation.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.560
But because he's such a simple
soul, he gets to heaven.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.710
And God asks him when he
comes to heaven, Gimple,

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.780
welcome to heaven.

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:20.200
The angels, the angels
are at your disposal.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.510
You can have anything you want.

01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:25.300
You can live the life
you always dreamed of.

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:29.360
And Gimple says
anything I want, can I

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.780
have a hot cup of tea every day?

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.980
It's just you're like this.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.370
So your fantasies within
this, how to get up one--

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:43.520
so a guy like--

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.870
a guy like Nasir, maybe
he'll bounce back,

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:55.870
or maybe he'll just have that
predatory manipulative survival

01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:58.340
head, and it'll get him
into greater trouble.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:01.865
Number one, the last thing
you see, he's a junkie.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.430
And but it's open.

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:06.930
He's young.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:07.980
It's openended.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.330
So who's to say?

01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:11.280
That's why they
call them serials.

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:18.110
Maybe it's a good time to
ask if there are questions

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:19.790
from the audience,
if there's anybody

01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:21.200
who'd like to ask a question.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:21.699
Sir?

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:28.867
So religion has come up a
number of times in this panel.

01:16:28.867 --> 01:16:29.450
And I see it--

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:30.770
Do I have a microphone?

01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:31.970
There is here.

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:32.470
Thank you.

01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:37.230
Hello?

01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:38.230
Is this on?

01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:40.820
No, maybe it was on.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.680
Can you hear me?

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.730
So religion plays a double-edged
role I think in society.

01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:50.810
And we've seen it come up a
number of times in this panel.

01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:53.570
It provides a liberating
spiritual cultural cultivation

01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:57.020
for some, and it
oppresses others.

01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:01.610
At the same time, Christian
theology and language

01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:04.070
has historically
played a huge role

01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:08.060
in the production of this
punishment enterprise

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.500
that we live with in
our society today.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:14.465
So it's a double fold question.

01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:23.000
So it is what role do
you see from the outside?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.470
What ethical and
moral role do you

01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:28.190
see academics,
writers, activists,

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:30.470
religious practitioners,
politicians, et cetera

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:33.710
in challenging society,
especially linguistically,

01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:37.190
because that's come up a
number of times as well

01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:40.100
to restructure our systems
and reframe the response?

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.610
That's where all the
bad or evil people go.

01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:46.340
And what role do you
all see religion playing

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.010
within the confines of
the punishment facilities?

01:17:51.970 --> 01:17:55.188
Who would like to tackle one of
those questions, [INAUDIBLE]??

01:17:55.188 --> 01:17:57.140
Oh, you're fine.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.827
I've been thinking
about this, actually.

01:17:58.827 --> 01:18:01.160
I've been thinking about your
question, the second part,

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.940
because I've been thinking about
parts I left out of the book

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:09.460
and why I unconsciously
left them out.

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:14.000
So I had a question when
I was in Mississippi

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.380
talking about the book
and a white woman.

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.200
Heard the story.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.870
She's lived in the
delta all her life.

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:21.980
She knows the delta.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.370
She said, is Patrick
grateful to you?

01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:26.660
I felt so uncomfortable.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.140
And everybody who wasn't
from the delta was like, uh,

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:30.740
grateful?

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:35.690
He's the one who's been
born in the wrong zip code,

01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:39.340
and struggled, and want to the
worst schools in the country.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.500
I am just a small speck
in this large picture

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.750
of systemic inequality, right?

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:46.540
That's how I've been
trained to think

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.670
at a progressive institution.

01:18:50.670 --> 01:18:51.770
So I started to say this.

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.230
And then I just heard
this lecturing tone.

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:54.920
It's like, she's the
one who lives here.

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.570
She knows what the
delta [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:56.570 --> 01:19:02.085
She's seen the out migration
of all the bright kids.

01:19:02.085 --> 01:19:02.960
So then I just like--

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.200
I was like, well,
what is the question?

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:04.960
The question was,
was he grateful?

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.630
Yeah, he was intensely grateful.

01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:08.720
He's a Christian man.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.490
Gratitude is the
most holy virtue.

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:11.840
He was extremely thankful.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.940
He called me an
angel all the time.

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:16.000
I always was like, no.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.580
I try to explain to
him I didn't agree.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.970
But I took that out of the book
because it's so uncomfortable.

01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:24.980
I didn't take out all
of his Christianity,

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.800
but I didn't want to
be seen as a savior.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.830
I didn't want him to
be seen as unrealized

01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:33.950
in terms of understanding
his inequality.

01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:37.610
We have a secular
narrative that somebody

01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:39.650
who believes that has
false consciousness.

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.150
You know that he
doesn't really know

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:43.700
how oppressed he is, that I
knew that there would be--

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:45.770
my editor took out this letter.

01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:48.122
He said thank you,
[INAUDIBLE] call me an angel.

01:19:48.122 --> 01:19:48.830
It's interesting.

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:52.040
It's a question about the writer
intuiting what the readers will

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.326
tolerate and what they won't.

01:19:54.326 --> 01:19:55.700
And it's powerful
to think about.

01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:59.540
The reader would tolerate that
a bright African-American man

01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.320
would end up in jail within
three years of dropping out

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.090
at 15.

01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:06.560
And they would tolerate this
history of white supremacy.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.960
But they wouldn't
tolerate belief

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.130
in angels, which
reflects his world, where

01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:14.360
he's very close to the dead.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:18.530
His mother passed away
soon after he got out.

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:19.999
So it's interesting.

01:20:19.999 --> 01:20:22.040
It's a really important
question because religion

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.620
is so important to
a lot of prisoners.

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.660
When I taught at San
Quentin, my husband

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:28.520
is a religious
historian, started

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.960
teaching about the Bible.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.800
And the students didn't
want to read book of Job

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.230
as an angry god.

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:36.320
They didn't want it.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.400
One student walked out.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.550
And it was like my
first lesson of you

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:43.340
have to understand where
students are coming from.

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.610
You can't take away their faith.

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:49.380
You have to understand
where it comes from.

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:51.372
So I'm glad you asked.

01:20:51.372 --> 01:20:52.580
I'm still working through it.

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.560
I'd love any help answering.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.320
Steve.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.242
So I'm still-- so real quick,
so other folks can ask.

01:20:58.242 --> 01:21:00.200
I'm still working through
that question myself.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.240
But what I will say is this.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:06.350
And this is something I've
been thinking about a lot.

01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:08.780
We often think about the
perpetrators of the crime

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.290
and what they deserve.

01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:13.700
But the problem is, I've
known so many of the perps,

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.010
but I've also known the victims.

01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:18.050
And so when we're
thinking about justice,

01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:19.850
when we're thinking
about mercy, when we're

01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:22.070
thinking about
Christianity, I think

01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:24.580
everyone deserves a fair shake.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:29.240
And so it's hard now to try
to play the judge, right?

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.120
What does this person deserve?

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.570
He killed someone's son, right?

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:38.210
He killed someone's cousin.

01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:41.300
He killed someone's
older brother.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:42.770
And I think the direction--

01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:45.770
I think, so you take
out the emotion.

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:48.410
The smart direction
to move in is,

01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:53.080
because I've also seen this
side of it, there's just no--

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.380
it makes no sense
then to take someone

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.210
who committed such
a crime and then

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:00.850
put them in a
prison for 25 years

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:03.730
because then everyone
loses, right?

01:22:03.730 --> 01:22:07.780
And so I think that if we want
to think about it sort of--

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:11.370
if we want to think about
what works for the community

01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:13.810
and what works for
society, then that I feel

01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:16.970
might be the smartest
direction to think in.

01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:21.010
But the Christian question is
a tough one and a tricky one

01:22:21.010 --> 01:22:24.560
because there's a few different
ways, a few different things

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.060
to consider.

01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:29.620
It may or may not
be in response.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.760
But I'm just thinking.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.150
I remember going to a
friend's son's bar mitzvah

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:36.990
where he was speaking about--

01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:41.960
the text that he was speaking
about was from Genesis.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.610
It was Adam and Eve, and
the snake, and the apple.

01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:49.840
And it was not--

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.300
I was raised a fairly
passive Christian.

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.700
But it was not
original sin, right?

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:59.860
In Talmudic study,
right in Judaism,

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:02.560
that moment in
the Garden of Eden

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.800
is the necessary
growing into adulthood

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:09.760
and self-consciousness
of humanity, right?

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.530
It's not it's not
a terrible failure.

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:13.730
It's the beginning.

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:15.780
And I was so struck by it.

01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.870
This was many years ago.

01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:20.080
But I was so struck by it
because it had never occurred

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.850
to me to think of
it any other way.

01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:26.070
And I think one of the
things that underlies,

01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:30.880
is part of your
question, is there

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:36.040
some way in which we as a
culture could profitably

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.100
examine our underlying
narratives that have determined

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.890
everything and continue
to determine everything

01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:45.060
going forward, and just
thinking in terms of say that

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:49.180
a French notion that
you can purge a crime

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.640
and then begin again,
as opposed to one

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:55.120
that you are falling into a
state of sin, which is always

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.600
awaiting you, and that from
which you can never emerge.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.464
Those are very different ways
of understanding the world.

01:24:02.464 --> 01:24:05.698
I don't know.

01:24:05.698 --> 01:24:07.950
Yes, ma'am?

01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:08.970
A microphone comes.

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:15.420
It was very
interesting to hear all

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:20.470
of you ruminating or pondering
on this theme of suffering.

01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:25.440
So what struck me throughout
the whole panel discussion,

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.910
or this lecture, I was hearing
about in the back of my head,

01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:34.140
the problem of the immigrants,
and the suffering that

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.870
an immigrant-- this is
a very common theme--

01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:38.370
everyone goes through.

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:41.160
And all kinds of suffering,
I was thinking of partition,

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.830
I was talking Holocaust,
I was thinking

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.520
of all kinds of suffering.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.580
And so what is the difference?

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:51.270
I know there is a difference
that you folks wanted

01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:53.970
to bring it in your discussion.

01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:57.810
And listening to this,
and also all the victims

01:24:57.810 --> 01:25:00.810
of British
colonization, there is

01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:05.407
a book by a very [INAUDIBLE]
Indian philosopher

01:25:05.407 --> 01:25:05.990
Sri Aurobindo.

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:08.400
The book is called
Tales of Prison Life.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:13.530
And the jail cell that
was depicted in this film

01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:15.080
reminded me of that.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.529
So anyway, going back,
also, I was thinking--

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:18.945
May I ask, do you
have a question?

01:25:18.945 --> 01:25:19.620
Yes.

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.600
The question is,
where do you draw

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.550
the line between the suffering
and the lack of which

01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:28.650
causes the lack of imagination?

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:32.820
And how do you
transcend that, because

01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:37.350
like the John who made
up his French name,

01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:39.720
and they are imagining.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.730
And you also mentioned
more reasons.

01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:43.470
I was thinking of Beloved.

01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:44.800
So there is--

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.150
I hear at the same
time this concern

01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:49.630
for the lack of imagination.

01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:54.120
They forget to imagine,
and big things.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.260
And also but some
people do still

01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:00.390
try to construct
their own world.

01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:07.930
So where is that boundary, or
how do they overlap or cross

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:10.875
the boundary?

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:13.690
Does somebody want
to answer that?

01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:17.110
But how do you--

01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:19.110
I'm not sure I
understand the question.

01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.880
Yeah.

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.380
I'm sorry.

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:21.160
I'm not trying to dodge you.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.660
I'm just not sure I understand.

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:26.468
The question is how do
you cross the boundary

01:26:26.468 --> 01:26:29.500
between lack of imagination?

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:35.200
Because by suffering too
much, they forget to dream.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:41.860
But at the same time, they have
this also the inner tendency

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:44.450
to overcome the suffering.

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.950
So--

01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:48.710
So I think that this--

01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:50.140
so all right.

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:53.110
So I would say this, all right?

01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:55.720
There is a way where it
impacts certain inmates

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:59.590
and their imagination
suffers, right?

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:02.890
And then they're incapable
of imagining sometimes.

01:27:02.890 --> 01:27:05.500
But I would say that
some of the greatest

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.770
innovation I have ever
seen in my entire life

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:11.080
has been in jail.

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.140
I have watched my
inmates make alcohol

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:17.170
from sleeping pills and water.

01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:20.650
I have watched my inmates
build small contraptions

01:27:20.650 --> 01:27:25.570
to find ways to lock out
after the CO locked them in.

01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:27.824
My inmates found a way
to clean the toilet bowl.

01:27:27.824 --> 01:27:29.490
So they got the meat,
and kept it there.

01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:33.130
It was like a
makeshift refrigerator.

01:27:33.130 --> 01:27:35.470
My inmates, they
wanted to smoke, right?

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:38.350
So what they did was they took
the lead from the pencils.

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:41.740
And they found out that if you
attach it to the battery end,

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.050
you can spark a fire.

01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:45.700
And so it's never
been a question

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.640
about academic aptitude
or imagination.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.390
I think these are the
most brilliant folks.

01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:56.020
But what happens is that
not everyone can persist.

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:59.890
Not everyone can go on that way.

01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:04.150
And then just some people, some
people give into that pressure.

01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:07.690
So if I think you're
asking the question I'm

01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:11.370
thinking you're asking,
it's very individual,

01:28:11.370 --> 01:28:13.850
like case by case, right?

01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:16.180
I know people who have
done 15 years in jail

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:18.700
and have done eight years
in solitary confinement,

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:22.560
and I know someone who did three
years in solitary confinement

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.580
and took his own life.

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:27.590
It affects everyone
very, very differently.

01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:30.040
And then some leave
and can't imagine.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:32.590
But then some leave
propelled, right?

01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:34.660
And some leave ready
to imagine in ways

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:37.480
that they've never imagined.

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.580
Some people say to me
jail was the best thing

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:43.330
that ever happened in my life.

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:46.300
But some people
say jail killed me.

01:28:49.330 --> 01:28:50.910
Maybe one last question.

01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:51.776
Yes, ma'am?

01:28:51.776 --> 01:28:52.275
OK.

01:28:52.275 --> 01:28:55.010
Eddie, thanks a lot
for your presentation.

01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:58.080
I think you are raising
a lot of issues.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:58.610
Sorry.

01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:59.150
Another thank you.

01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:01.150
[INAUDIBLE],, thanks a
lot for your presentation

01:29:01.150 --> 01:29:02.060
and all of you.

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.980
But, Eddie,
specifically, I thought

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:07.490
you were raising some
interesting tensions that

01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:10.890
exist among the panelists
around the question of writing,

01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:15.340
but also thinking from
particular positionalitites.

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.000
And one of the
things that I thought

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.620
that you were
bringing up a lot was

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:22.400
that notion of the guilt that--

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.845
was it you that was
talking about the guilt?

01:29:24.845 --> 01:29:25.970
Michelle spoke [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:26.595
Yeah, Michelle.

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:28.490
OK, and I wanted to
connect it to this.

01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:32.540
So this notion of the built
where Patrick is constantly

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:34.730
feeling that, and in
a way, constrained

01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:38.640
within a certain kind
of effective economy

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.550
that has been
already constructed

01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:42.900
for particular people
more than others.

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.970
So I wanted to conjunct this too
because Michelle was bringing

01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:51.560
yup the white sensibility, what
it means to be a middle class

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.250
person working with people.

01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:55.550
But that is bringing
from the vantage point

01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:59.060
of being black, and recognizing
that the majority are

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.930
black and Latino people.

01:30:00.930 --> 01:30:03.770
So maybe speak a little
bit to that tension.

01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:07.760
And how do you rapture these
dominant, effective economies

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.995
that really log in particular
populations more than others.

01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:20.020
Does one of you
want to start there?

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:22.750
Sure.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:27.260
So the question is more about
the tensions between perhaps

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:31.190
mine speaking for more of
an outsider standpoint and--

01:30:31.190 --> 01:30:32.164
[INAUDIBLE]

01:30:37.034 --> 01:30:44.095
But Eddie was putting himself
in in a very different way

01:30:44.095 --> 01:30:46.662
that you were, the positionality
and [INAUDIBLE] structure.

01:30:46.662 --> 01:30:49.775
So speaking to that
a little bit more,

01:30:49.775 --> 01:30:53.880
because I think it speaks to the
tensions in terms of writing,

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.740
since we talk
about writing here,

01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:58.845
but also in terms of how
do you really rapture

01:30:58.845 --> 01:31:01.118
this dominant
[INAUDIBLE] economies

01:31:01.118 --> 01:31:03.740
from different positionalities.

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:06.890
Yeah, it's really hard.

01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:10.670
When I went to
Arkansas, look, anybody

01:31:10.670 --> 01:31:13.160
know how many
Asian-Americans or Asians are

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.450
in Phillips County, Arkansas?

01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:17.215
One, me.

01:31:17.215 --> 01:31:20.570
OK, no there were the Chinese
guys who own the restaurant.

01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:21.440
I would go say hi.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.398
But they're from China.

01:31:22.398 --> 01:31:24.530
My parents are from Taiwan.

01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:26.314
So I was definitely an outsider.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:27.230
There was no question.

01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:28.150
People would stare.

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.540
I was very conspicuous.

01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:32.170
My kids, to get under my
nerves, would be like,

01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:33.680
are you related to Jackie Chan?

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:38.120
And I'd be like, no,
I'm actually not.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.620
Being a [INAUDIBLE] was really--

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:41.870
it's fine.

01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:44.290
I don't take whatever
microaggressions.

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:45.610
I don't care.

01:31:45.610 --> 01:31:48.640
In a rural area, I'm the one
who has the resources to leave.

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.280
Immigrants don't go to
rural areas to get jobs.

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:54.170
So I didn't take it
personally at all.

01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:56.842
So I was definitely
outsider, but sometimes I

01:31:56.842 --> 01:31:59.300
get upset when people were
like, why don't you just go back

01:31:59.300 --> 01:31:59.900
to where you're from?

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:00.650
Where am I from?

01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:02.480
I'm from a place where I was
also an outsider in Kalamazoo,

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.230
Michigan.

01:32:03.230 --> 01:32:07.610
And my parents never taught me
anything about townies history

01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:09.874
because they grew up in
an authoritarian regime

01:32:09.874 --> 01:32:12.040
where they couldn't learn
about their own histories.

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.150
Taiwan has been colonized
for four centuries.

01:32:14.150 --> 01:32:20.270
So it's confusing
because I'm constantly

01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:22.670
aware of that power dynamic.

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:25.280
I would rather there be
African-American educators

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.730
in schools and in prisons.

01:32:26.730 --> 01:32:28.310
But I wouldn't force
them to do that.

01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:29.990
They should go do
whatever they want to do.

01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.865
You know what I want?

01:32:30.865 --> 01:32:34.160
More Asian-Americans
to participate,

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.620
to feel solidarity,
to put themselves

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:39.620
at risk, to own the pain,
because, like you said,

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.390
we're all part of this complex.

01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:45.350
So it was hard for me to
write because I understood.

01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:47.020
I tried to understand
positionality.

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:48.400
I wanted to be honest about it.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.540
I didn't hide from it.

01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:52.860
I had a Post-it
note on my computer

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:55.490
that said stop
hiding, because I was

01:32:55.490 --> 01:33:00.050
hiding beneath the outrage of
this history that is grotesque.

01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:04.400
But you have to put
yourself on the page.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.290
You have to put the
inequality on the page

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:07.961
and work through it.

01:33:07.961 --> 01:33:08.460
The one--

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:08.740
Yeah.

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:08.990
I'm sorry.

01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.490
Go for it.

01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:10.610
Yeah.

01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:13.760
So positionality is something
I think about a lot.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:17.270
I think the biggest credit,
the reason I've been most--

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:21.190
I think the reason I've been
successful in the classroom

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:25.960
with these specific students
is because I believe very, very

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.540
firmly that it is not
only enough to reflect

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:31.714
the physical likeness of the
students, or in other words,

01:33:31.714 --> 01:33:33.880
just because a black person
walks into the classroom

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:38.200
doesn't mean by virtue of that
you're going to learn from me.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.810
But it means so much more
to reflect the likeness

01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:42.615
of their character, right?

01:33:42.615 --> 01:33:44.740
Because when they have
someone in the classroom who

01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:48.340
has tattoos, who gestures the
way they gesture, who speaks

01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.260
the same language
that they speak,

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:53.710
it becomes the meeting
place between aspiration

01:33:53.710 --> 01:33:56.510
and what's practical, Or
in other words, they think,

01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:58.990
oh, Eddie's doing this,
and Eddie's like me.

01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:00.850
So maybe that means I can do it.

01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:01.750
You get it?

01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:04.449
And so that's the
biggest credit.

01:34:04.449 --> 01:34:06.490
The problem is not everybody
could pull that off.

01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:07.030
But--

01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:10.320
[LAUGHING]

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.287
[INAUDIBLE]

01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:20.901
This may be a good moment
to end our discussion.

01:34:20.901 --> 01:34:21.400
[APPLAUSE]

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.150
I want to thank Richard Price,
Michelle Kuo, and Edyson Julio.

01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:27.300
[INAUDIBLE]
