00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.720
Hello. I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course
Government &amp; Politics, and today I'm gonna

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.000
take a deep dive into political science theory
and try to figure out why interest groups form.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.199
So grab your snorkel, no, this is a
deep dive, grab your scuba gear.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.619
I know, I know, you're probably thinking that
interest groups form to influence the government

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.589
with their piles and piles of cash, so the
way they form is by amassing piles of cash,

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.490
and then, well, who really cares once they
have all that cash? Maybe that's true, but

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.080
why we have some interests that get together
in organized to influence policy and others

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.680
that don't is an interest-ing question.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.680
[Theme Music]

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.400
So as you remember pluralist theory proposes
that every group with a particular interest

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.390
should be able to form an organization that
will pursue policies to further that interest.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.380
So if I like birds, which clearly I don't,
I should be able to join up with other bird

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.559
fanciers to work with the government, so that
it protects birds' wildlife habitats. I hate

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.250
this analogy. And in fact there are a number
of interest groups out there that can do this,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.710
including the Sierra Club and the World Wildlife
Foundation.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
I respect those clubs. I don't hate all eagles,
just that eagle. But this doesn't mean that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.180
everyone with an interest can form a group.
Like, I like video games, I'm not going to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.020
go form a group about it. Why doesn't every
interest form a group? Well political scientists

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.620
would cite collective action problems.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.840
These are the problems that occur because
people should work together, but don't.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.550
The classic example is building a road that
many people could use but no one individual

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.750
could build on their own because, you know,
building a road is hard.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.790
Although there are obviously some situations
where people can coordinate to get things

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.180
done without any government intervention,
most of the time if you want to accomplish

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.290
big things like the Hoover Dam or building
the highway systems, you need some sort of

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.180
government action to make sure it gets done.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.400
And usually it gets done when the government
collects taxes from everybody to build the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.700
road. Now some people may use the road a lot;
more than their taxes paid for, and some may not

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.700
use it at all, but the government collects taxes to pay for
it all the same because otherwise it wouldn't get built.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.280
One special type of collective action problem
is called free riding. This is when people

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.110
who stand to get a big benefit from a project
either don't pay a big enough share, or they

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.410
don't pay at all because they know that the
project is so important that it will get done

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.570
whether they contribute or not. Then they
will get the full benefit of the project - say

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.280
a pothole free road - without paying a dime.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.200
Get it? Free ride? (Singing) Come on a take
a free ride".

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.920
This becomes a problem when other people,
not wanting anyone to get a free ride, also

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.450
refuse to contribute to the project and, you
guessed it, it doesn't get done.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.299
'The free rider problem is worse in larger
groups and this partly explains why some interests

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.329
are better represented in American politics.'

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.329
Because large groups are more anonymous, it's
easier to free ride; there are lots of other

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.260
people who probably care more than a single
individual and, knowing this, the single individual

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.049
rationally chooses to free ride.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.719
Also, the larger the group, the easier it
is for an individual to claim that their efforts

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.829
don't matter which is a smaller version of
the voter paradox. Finally, with a large number

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.370
of members, it's much harder for a group to
enforce it's rules against slackers, who don't

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.379
pull their weight young man! Or woman - young
person!

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.749
What this means in practice is that smaller
groups are more successful in forming and

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.510
pushing their agenda, this is why producers
are more successful at forming interest groups

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.959
than consumers, and why business owners are
usually more successful then workers.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.019
Now, many people will say that in the US labor
is well represented through unions, but over

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.650
the last forty years at least union membership
and the dues that come with it are shrinking

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.239
and unions are less able to get legislation
passed.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.200
So how do large groups solve the collective
action problem and actually coordinate to

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.620
get things done? According to political scientist
Mancur Olson they do this by providing selective

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.260
benefits to their members. In other words
they build membership by providing perks.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.859
These can be material things like special
services or discounts on things like insurance,

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.180
or smaller things like baseball caps or bumper
stickers.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.889
One of the largest organized interest groups
in the US, the American Association of Retired

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.170
Persons, or AARP provides a number of material
benefits to their members including discounts

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.139
on a number of useful products and services.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.319
AARP also provides many of the second type
of benefits, informational benefits. Interest

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.319
groups can inform their members of policies
that may affect them, and can provide guidance

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.480
about what to do in order to influence these
policies.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.120
The third type of benefits are called solidary,
and they refer to friendship and comradery

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.799
that can come from being a member of a group.
Ah, that's my favorite benefit.

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.349
Solidary benefits also include networking
opportunities, and networking probably has

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.829
a lot to do with why people join professional
groups. Gotta do the schmoozin'.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.379
The final type of benefit that can help build
interest groups is called the purposive benefit.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.810
This is a feeling that by being a member of
a group, you're helping to make a difference.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.810
Purposive benefits partially explain why so
many people joined up with groups during the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.629
civil rights movements, it certainly wasn't
for the SNCC keychains.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.150
Another way that interest groups can be formed
is by political entrepreneurs. These are specific

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.470
individuals who make extraordinary efforts
to bring people together for the purpose of

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.800
changing policy. Often political entrepreneurs
are politicians who recognize the latent potential

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.700
of groups that haven't yet organized. When
successful, they benefit electorally.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.380
One of the most famous examples in American politics
was Claude Pepper who realized there were a lot of

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.620
older Americans in Florida and that if he became their
champion and organized them, they would vote for him.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.140
Even more well known than Pepper, was salt
(Chuckles). No, Robert Wagner, whose sponsorship

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.610
of the National Labor Relations Act was so
important that it's often still called the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.630
Wagner Act. This helped create political power for labor
unions, and unions helped keep Wagner in Washington.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.610
I guess we also have to talk about the elephant,
or if you're a Democrat, the donkey in the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.000
room; lobbying. Lobbying is an attempt to
influence policy by persuading a government

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.510
policy making official. As we say when we
talked about iron triangles, this can be done

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.960
by providing officials with information that
they can use. But most people still think

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.710
of it as providing campaign contributions
in return for favorable policy outcome.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.940
There's no real evidence of this quid pro
quo bargaining, probably because it's really

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.630
close to bribery and therefore doesn't happen
that much. But it has happened in the past

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.440
and this idea is pretty powerful, especially
if you think all politicians are corrupt.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.760
But there is more to lobbying than this, especially
in the eyes of political scientists, who like

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.380
to divide lobbying into insider and outsider
strategies. Insider strategies include directly

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.260
trying to persuade elected officials, and
also using the courts. Actual direct lobbying

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.050
of congressmen has become more difficult over
the years.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.170
Congress has passed laws that have limited
the ability to deduct lobbying expenses from

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.110
taxes, and restricted how much lobbyists can
pay for official's travel expenses. This has

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.480
cut down a lot on the famous political junkets which
often looked like a vacation paid for by lobbyists.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.080
Congress has also passed laws limiting the
gifts that lobbyists can give to officials

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.620
which now have a value of no more than fifty dollars.
So no free Apple Watch for you congressman, sorry.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.420
You could probably get Grand Theft
Auto V at this point though.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.810
While it's mostly elite groups that are able
to lobby congressmen, executive department

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.370
heads or even the President directly, other
groups have been more successful using the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.270
courts as an insider strategy. One way to
do this is through direct lawsuits like the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.060
one that led to the Brown vs Board of Education
decision. Another way is by finding plaintiffs

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.920
and funding their lawsuits, the old "find and
fund," they call it. No one calls it that.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.060
A third thing that interest groups can do
is file amicus curiae, or "friend of the court"

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.860
briefs to get their legal ideas into Supreme
Court decisions.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.140
Groups on both sides of the political spectrum
pursue all these avenues, but environmental

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.420
and civil rights groups are known for going
after the courts. In particular the courts

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.000
are often the focus of minority groups, since they're the
ones least likely to be successful in electoral politics.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.680
The other types of lobbying strategies are
called outsider strategies, let's explain

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.670
that in an animated way by going to
the Thought Bubble.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.320
Outsider strategies are those that involve
interest groups mobilizing the public. Sometimes

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.580
these strategies are called grassroots lobbying.
Mobilizing public opinion is sometimes called

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.860
"going public", but this is very confusing
because it's the same term used to describe

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.500
the President's making direct appeals to public
opinion. And also it happens when a company

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.890
floats it's stock on an exchange for the first
time.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.050
When interest groups go public the main things
they do are organize advertising campaigns,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.700
organize protests and engage in grassroots
efforts to get their membership to lobby officials.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.680
Advertising campaigns are expensive, so you
don't see a lot of advertising on behalf of

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.140
things like poverty relief. The best know
recent example of an interest group sponsored

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.790
advertising campaign was the Harry and Louise
campaign, sponsored by healthcare groups and

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.650
doctors that was designed to stymie President
Clinton's attempts at healthcare reform.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.350
Interest groups organize protests to get the
attention of politicians and the media, and

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.390
protests can be effective as we saw during
the civil rights movement. Protests can also

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.830
help to form interest groups, like the Occupy
movement during the height of the financial

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.240
crisis after 2008. Some protests, such as
labor strikes, can impose costs on business

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.420
owners, and push them to lobby office holders
more directly.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.800
Grassroots lobbying occurs when an organized
group encourages its membership to contact

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.810
elected officials, often through letter writing,
emails or telephone calls. This is becoming

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.950
increasingly prominent because of the new
rules that limit traditional lobbying, and

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.700
because technology makes it so easy for groups
to reach large numbers of people, and to get

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.710
them to respond directly to elected officials.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.490
But beware, sometimes technology makes it
easy for well financed groups to give the

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.950
appearance of being a large-scale grassroots
organization, when they really aren't. These

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.760
bogus attempts at grassroots organizing have
been called astroturf lobbying, and one of

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.800
the few examples where political scientists have
demonstrated  their superiority at naming things.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.040
Thanks Thought Bubble. So interest groups are all
about changing policies, and they pursue both insider

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.040
and outsider strategies to influence policy makers.
I hope that we've given you a balanced view

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.060
of interest groups, one that's not so cynical
about the way they function in our politics.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.810
