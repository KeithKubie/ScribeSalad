So we have a pop quiz
for you guys kind of.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.730
Pop quiz slash fun
facts how about that?

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.980
Okay, so in the Library of
Congress we have millions

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.490
of things okay, we have
millions and millions of items

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.240
and of course we have books.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.730
So do you know what
other items we might have

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.030
in the library's collections?

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.330
Yeah.

[ Inaudible ]

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.530
Fossils, I think we do yeah.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.470
Yeah, we have all kinds
of photographs and artwork

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.910
and prints and everything.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.210

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.950
We have so many old
items from way back when.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.860
You saw the museum
part, that's awesome.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.600
Yeah.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.810
Journals, yeah absolutely.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.880
We also have maps, 5 million
maps in fact and a total

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.360
of about 167 million
of things of all kinds.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
We even have flutes, we
have a ton of flutes,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.520
we have real expensive violins,
Stradivarius violins and cellos.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.030
So we have all kinds of stuff
and we're going to show you some

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.310
of it as we talk
to some scientists

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.640
to celebrate women
in science today.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.560
So I am really happy
to introduce you guys

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.740
to two scientists and
the first one is going

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.690
to speak first Dr.
Svetlana Kotliarova.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.600
She got her PhD in human
genetics from Tokyo University

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.950
and now she is a scientific
review officer at NIH.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.150
Have you guys heard
of NIH before?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.220
It stands for National
Institutes of Health.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.220
And she'll tell you a little
bit more about what kind

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.980
of work she does there and
how she got where she is now

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.430
and what kind of work
she's doing there.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.510
So how about we welcome Dr. K.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.290
[ Applause ]

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.590
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Thank you very much

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.590
for inviting me today and thank
you Sasha for introduction.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.960
So it's a great honor to be here

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.820
and to speak with
you, our future.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.420
So and I hope that I will
infuse some excitement

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.800
into you about science.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.870
So everyone has science class?

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.170
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.470
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Yeah.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.240
So you like science?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.210
That's great, that's great,
so half of the job is done.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:12.780
Actually I forgot I wanted to
start with saying good morning.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.940
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
[Foreign language].

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.230
This is good morning in Russian.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.390
And as you already figured
out I came from Russia.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.620
So I was born in the Ural
Mountains in the like kind

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.910
of central or closer to
Moscow side of Russia.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:51.540
And everyone heard about
Moscow, but maybe not so much

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.220
about Russia so I show you
something about my hometown.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:04.370
So the city of Ufa is in the
mountains, Ural Mountains

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.000
and we have a lot
of nice nature,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.950
a lot of nice pictures you
can take there if you ever go.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.790
And this inspired
me to learn more

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.640
about living things,
about life science.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.880
And this is a monument very
famous, it's the national hero

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.840
of Bashkir people,
so Ufa is capital

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.080
of Bashkir Republic
inside of Russia.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.080
And Bashkir about 30%
people who live there.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.080
And they have their
special national clothing.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.020
And this is how it
maybe looks now snow,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.320
there is still snow there.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.430
So these are some
pictures from my childhood.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.610
So this is our very modest

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.450
and old apartment building,
this is where I grew.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:25.000
And this is my baby sister and
maybe you figure this is me.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.230
So how old are you guys?

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.530
&gt;&gt; Twelve.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.880
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Twelve, this is about me,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.270
this is me at your age.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.690
So and this is I'm
wearing one of my dresses,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.420
I have two dresses, one
was [inaudible] to wash

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.330
and another I was wearing.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.510
And this is my school, I
liked school very much.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.540
I went there to meet my
friends and grade teachers

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.730
who inspired me and who
teach me all the good things

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.080
that I can use in my life.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.240
And I'm thankful for everyone
who taught me all of this.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.900
And this is me helping my mom
after school drying clothes.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.970
So we didn't have a dryer,
so actually it's not,

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.970
it wasn't a cultural
thing in Russia

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.480
and maybe now some
people will have it.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.230
And we always just
dry them outside.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:33.490
So why I'm telling you all
this because regardless

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.020
of your background
where you were born

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.070
if you have your dream
you'll follow your dream

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.160
and you will do something that
you couldn't even imagine.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.670
So for example my parents
were very much insisting

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.280
on good education, they were
born before the World War II

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.560
and they didn't have higher
education, but they wanted

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.550
for their kids to have it.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.350
And they put us into school

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.210
with special emphasis
on English language.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.630
But Russia was very close
country, I never saw any

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.350
of my relatives or friends
going out to other countries

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.490
and I was asking myself
why I'm learning English.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.690
But then standing in front

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.790
of you today I would say
my parents were right,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.260
so they were enforcing
something on me

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.520
that I maybe didn't understand

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.120
but it helped me
through my life.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.880
So I suggest that you
listen to your parents.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:55.710
So I have a lot of
inspiration from my friends

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.250
and teachers and support.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.820
This is what you seek when you
are going to pursue your dream.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:15.920
And so from Ufa having
interest in science and more

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.790
in life sciences I
went to Novosibirsk,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.620
it's in Siberia maybe you've
heard it's very cold there

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.730
but it can be also very warm, it
can be 100 degrees in summer so

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.240
but it's dry, it
feels different.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.900
So I was studying there biology,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.550
molecular biology
and biochemistry.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:47.420
And then it happened so I met
my husband Dr. Yuri Kotliarov

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.740
during my university years.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:58.190
And together with him we went
to University of Tokyo in Japan

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:03.890
to study further and
to get our PhD degrees.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.050
And I worked in the
Brain Science Institute

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.280
and I will show you
some brain cells later.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.010
And when we were in Japan we had
a chance to go to a conference

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:21.340
to the United States and we were
so impressed by the scientists

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.430
and by the opportunities
that are in this country

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:35.070
for the research and we decided
to work in the United States.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:44.970
So we moved and it was almost
like around the world journey.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:50.720
So I'm talking that
I'm scientist,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.110
but what is really science?

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.680
Can you guys say
something or write?

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.640
&gt;&gt; I think science is something
that you can't explain,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.430
but then later on
you can explain it.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.730
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.540
To explain unexplained
that's very good.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:15.710
&gt;&gt; I think science is when
you like have questions

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.300
about the world and
things that you find

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.240
and then some stuff is
never answered or things

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.250
that are very questionable.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.710
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
That's very good.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.860
&gt;&gt; I think science is something
like a group of different things

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.780
that have something to
do with like you wanted

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.820
to study what was it again?

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Molecular biology, biochemistry.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.640
&gt;&gt; Yes and you could,
it's also like astronomy.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.060
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Yes, that's right.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.280
&gt;&gt; And.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.060
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
That's all great answers.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.590
Science is the way we learn
about the unknown things

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:06.090
in the world and it also
includes all the knowledge

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.380
gained through centuries
and generations --

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.490
from generation to generation.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.860
And scientists are
using different tools.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.560
So here you see a
couple of tools already,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.520
so anymore tools
that, so what kind

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.200
of tools do you think
scientists use,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.740
just give me a couple examples?

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.540
Yes please.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.240
How did you know I'm going
to speak about microscope,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.570
so you guessed it right?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.960
Yes.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.340
Telescopes all right.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.010
So what are microscopes used
for to see what kind of things?

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.310

Yes, yes to measure exact
and to mix things right.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.310
So and what do scientists
do, how does science work?

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.870
So what does it start
from, like what?

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.170
Yes.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.470
[ Inaudible ]

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.900
Question or hypothesis exactly.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.690
And then we do what to
test the hypothesis?

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:44.990
&gt;&gt; Experiments.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Experiments.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.740
And then we get something
results.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:54.400
Exactly. And then we
have to explain it,

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.820
is it the result we expected
or is it something unexpected.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.670
Then what do we do?

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.670
So a very important thing
is to get the resources

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.190
to do all the experiments,
so you need funding

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:13.240
and we will talk about
funding a little bit later.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.200
And before you start your
experiment do you want to know

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.740
if this idea occurred to someone

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.690
and someone already
resolved this?

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.290
Do you want to invent
a new wheel or you want

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.290
to use the invented wheel and
build the new more bigger?

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:34.760
So you go to get more
information right

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.100
and now we have all
the resources,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.900
we have the computer internet,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.880
we can check some ideas
and find information.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.490
Where else we go to get
information about ideas

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.260
that you want to pursue?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.560
Yes.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.860
&gt;&gt; The library.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.160
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Of course

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.150
and that's why we
are here right.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.110
And we talked about the
tools and [inaudible]

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.660
from the first try that we are
talking about the microscope.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:13.270
So when does microscope,

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.110
when did people start
thinking about microscope?

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.800
Someone is thinking and sitting

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.280
and saying oh I will
invent a microscope.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:29.280
No, so actually there
was no glass at first

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.610
and glass was invented
and then they saw

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.570
like if they put some glass
on some object they see

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.680
that it is become bigger.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.170
And this was happening like
in the first century romans

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.740
noticed that.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:52.850
And then one scientist
or some guy

00:14:52.850 --> 00:15:03.080
in Italy made the first
magnification eyeglass just

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:10.960
for one eye to help
people to see.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:21.650
And after that two Dutch
spectacle makers made the first

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.980
microscope which was a tube,
which was like consisted

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.240
of three tubes that you
have to retract them.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:37.170
And the first microscope
that was used

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:43.300
for many things was invented
again by a Dutcher draper

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.720
and scientist Anton
van Leeuwenhoek.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.280
So probably you heard
his name because this is

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.010
when the real microscopy
started and he was the first

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:03.820
to see tiny creatures
under the microscope.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:11.250
And in 1665, Robert Hooke,
an English scientist,

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.460
published his micrographia.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:19.690
The things that he observed
under the microscope

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.480
and we will talk about
this in a second.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.680
So as you can see, there are
Romans, Italians, Dutch people,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:32.930
English scientists and
centuries So in time

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.600
and space the microscope
invention was continuing,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.150
so this is how science works.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:45.970
It is and now it is
more like teamwork,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:54.480
people can move using planes
and helicopters you name it

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.530
to different areas to
do research together.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:04.660
And if you choose to be a
scientist you could be also

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.510
traveling a lot and.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:15.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:20.280
Excavation or archeologists
yes, yes.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.820
So and as we spoke
about Robert Hooke,

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:34.970
the Library of Congress has his
micrographia, so his drawing

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.570
that he made looking
into the microscope.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:44.810
And this website actually
is a great resource both

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:50.470
for the students and for the
teachers to get acquainted

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:58.080
to know more about different
pieces, different information,

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.160
different information

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.420
on scientific discoveries,
and so on.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:12.840
And this is the micrographia
that Robert Hooke made.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.910
So what did he draw, what did
he look at the microscope?

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:22.430
He look at the cork,
cork, cork on the trees,

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.510
the cork like on the oak.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:33.780
And he found some structures
he called them pores or cells

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:39.070
and he called them cells because
he was thinking when looking

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.820
at them that they reminded
him cells of a monastery

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:48.250
where monks lived, like
tiny cells in a monastery.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.710
And guess what?

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.370
He was the first person
whose named themselves,

00:18:54.370 --> 00:19:01.820
since then this units of
life are called cells.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.900
Actually he was seeing
the dead cells

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.660
and the walls of the cells.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.380
And this is how cork cells
look under modern microscope,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.670
so he could draw very nicely.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:22.660
And this is the living cells
of onion under microscope.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.710
Maybe you will do or
already did this experiment

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.600
in your school looking
at onions.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.460
And this is the first
microscope that was like a tube

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.160
and Robert Hooke draw his
micrographia using this

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.550
microscope which he invented too

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.560
and this is how modern
microscope looks

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.430
which you are familiar with.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:55.690
And these are some of my
data that were published

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:03.090
about the brain tumor, so when
I did the brain cancer studies.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.400
So as you can see, the shape
of the cells is in green

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.040
because there is protein
that is in the cell membrane

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.180
which is called [inaudible]
and the nucleus

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:18.120
which is stained in blue.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:25.090
So now I want to
tell you a little bit

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.010
where scientists work.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:33.430
So it could be an academic
institution or university,

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.170
industry and government.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.020
And I work in the
government organization,

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.940
which is called National
Institutes of Health.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.820
This is one of the biggest
research institutions

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.750
in the world and it's
right here in Bethesda.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.500
So it's just close to you
and you can be part of it

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.680
and we'll talk about this later.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:02.200
So there are many achievements
that were done at NIH,

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:09.640
National Institutes of
Health, everyone calls it NIH.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.400
And for example,
discovery of fluoride

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:19.100
to prevent the tooth decay
or eradication of Ebola

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.960
as you heard recently.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:30.240
And human genome was
also sequenced at NIH.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.610
So there are 27 institutes
and scientific centers at NIH

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.710
and I work in the Center
for Scientific Review

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.720
and what does it mean?

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.740
We will know in a minute.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:50.260
So what do you think
about scientific review?

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:57.860
So we were talking about
experiments, hypothesis

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.840
and what do we do
with the results,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:08.580
and where does scientific
peer review have place.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.400
So there are five
options for you

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.410
to guess what is scientific
review, what is NIH peer review?

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:23.970
So but I warn you this
is a tricky question so.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:33.820
So who is for, do
you have any ideas?

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.700
What is the idea?

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.000
&gt;&gt; Two.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova: Two,

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.170
scientists meet together
to discuss science.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.200
&gt;&gt; None of them [inaudible].

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Three,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.970
scientists review
scientific application

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.520
from other scientists.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.560
Yeah, that's peer-to-peer
very good.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.000
But two was also correct
and one is correct

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.480
because scientists
write application

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.630
about their idea and
submit it to NIH.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:11.220
Also, when scientists meet
they evaluate the application,

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.060
how interesting it is,
how it will improve,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.270
how it will advance
science further.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.830
And they will give it a
score, so four is correct too.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:27.980
And NIH is make sure that
this process is all fair

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.020
and only experts
review the applications.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:37.570
And everything is done without
bias and in a timely manner.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:43.760
So going back to this schema,
so we were talking about funding

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.440
and that we will
talk about it later.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:52.120
So and this is where the peer
review comes into the picture.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:57.390
How to distribute the funding,
government funding for research.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:03.220
So peer review makes sure
that the most advanced

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:08.470
and important scientific
questions will be examined

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.190
and this important
knowledge will be available

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:20.260
for the whole population to
advance health of the population

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.710
and the eradicate the disease.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.190
And we need to make sure

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:33.080
that the best science
will be promoted.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:43.570
So I suggest that you experience
how peer review works just now

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.570
by doing this small game.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.440
So we have three proposals

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.100
that were submitted
from some scientists.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.510
And the first proposal
is smoking,

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.880
is about smoking
and lung cancer.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.480
So the scientists want to know
how the cigarette smoking causes

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.670
lung cancer and what
chemicals are responsible

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.630
for damaging biological
molecules.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.590
So now you need to look at your
badge that you have and see

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:22.250
if any one of you has expertise

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.750
to be a reviewer for
this application.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:34.190
They will study chemicals
and biological molecules.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:39.610
So any molecular
biologists we have

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.020
or any chemists,
what do you have?

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.630
Molecular biology?

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.390
Okay come here.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.090
Any lung cancer specialists?

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.670
All right we have.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.170
&gt;&gt; At the back.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.920
&gt;&gt; One on the back.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.530
Yeah, come here.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:05.710
So and any chemists, chemistry
or general cancer research?

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:12.320
We still have to have the third
person for this number one,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.460
any lung cancer, chemists,
molecular biologists

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.510
or cancer, general cancer?

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.140
[ Inaudible ]

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.540
You, what do you have?

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.840
&gt;&gt; Cancer research.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Okay come here.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.440
&gt;&gt; Cancer great.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Yeah.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.400
And we have proposal number two
about toothpaste and cavities.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.170
So the questions
that they will study,

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.110
which of the three chemicals is
the best to protect your teeth?

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:46.570
Is it sugar, is it -- it sounds
sweet right, it sounds good?

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.490
Baking soda or fluoride?

00:26:49.490 --> 00:27:01.220
So we need some oral hygienists,
some dentists, dentist.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.240
&gt;&gt; I am dentistry so.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.790
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Dentistry perfect.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.090
Oral hygiene come here.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:13.400
And now again, some
chemical expertise,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.730
we are talking about chemicals.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.880
No, no chemists?

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.210
Everyone is bacteria.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.590
So this is one that's for you.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:29.370
So someone need to
pretend to be chemist,

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.970
so you want to be chemist?

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.600
Okay, all right.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.820
And now the third proposal,

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.860
how do bacteria protect
themselves from viruses?

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.830
Do they synthesize
special molecules

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.800
that help them to do so?

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.010
So we have bacteriologists,
virologists right.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:05.090
So now we have all these
three different topics

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:09.970
and we have, so okay.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.820
These stickers, so I give
everyone a sticker and please

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:25.920
if you think that the
topic is important give it

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.390
three stickers.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:31.220
If you think oh it
would be good to know

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.020
but I'm not very excited
give it two stickers.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.930
And if you think maybe
better not to do this type

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.430
of study give it
one sticker okay.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.600
And I have three boards
for each of the proposals,

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.510
so put your stickers
on each one of them.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:29:00.490
So okay. So we start from you
and I give you the stickers.

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:06.190
So there we go and to you.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.520
And then you need
to put your board,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.910
to give your board
to the next person.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:19.600
All right we have 27 likes
for bacteria and viruses,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:28.800
24 for smoking and cancer, so
what do we have for toothpaste?

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:34.160
Less enthusiasm for toothpaste,
so I guess everyone figured it

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.100
out already that
sugar not so good.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:46.100
All right so this
is just an example,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:52.140
just a game to give you an
idea how peer review works,

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:56.360
like scientists from
different areas

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.900
of science will gather
together and decide

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.260
which is the most
exciting project

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:08.790
and which will be
beneficial to our nation.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:13.010
So about importance
of basis science.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.040
As you know there
is basic science

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.980
and applied or clinical science.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.880
And you can easily figure out
what clinical science means,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.190
it's just immediately
applicable to patients.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:36.850
But basic science is science
that will answer many questions

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.290
that are unknown, many
questions about the disease

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.270
that are not known,
maybe for those diseases

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.660
without cure such as cancer.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.200
We need to gather
a lot of knowledge

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.880
which probably will not
be immediately introduced

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.610
into clinic but will be
helpful in developing

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.630
such cure in the future.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:03.630
And basic science important
you appreciate it very much

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.930
and I'm very happy.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.570
So let's talk about this
viruses and bacteria.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:17.480
So would you say maybe to cure
diabetes would be more important

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.980
than to know how bacteria
protect themselves

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.660
about the viruses?

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.850
It happened that National
Institutes of Health

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.930
and National Science
Foundation funded the bacteria

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.080
and viruses research.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.360
And what they find that
bacteria will protect themselves

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.950
against viruses by
getting pieces of DNA.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:51.770
And they found that human
DNA can be also cut,

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.970
like piece of the
human DNA you can cut.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:09.690
For example with the gene that
has coding for insulin protein

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:14.020
and then you put it
into bacterial DNA.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:19.790
So now you have the bacterial
DNA which have human gene

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.650
and it will synthesize
human protein

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.270
and then they purify protein
and give it to patient.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:32.840
So this is how basic
science can lead to cure.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.310
So you can be part of NIH too
and there are several programs

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.530
that are available for
high school students

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.700
and for university students.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:54.730
And there are also a lot of
resources, maybe Sasha can email

00:32:54.730 --> 00:33:03.160
to your teacher these resources
and you can investigate them

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.330
when you are doing
some projects.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.630
And there is a lot

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.110
of interesting information
about science.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:13.660
And if you are interested,
if you have questions,

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:21.740
if you are patient, anyone with
these qualities can scientists.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.490
And of course you read
books, you go to the library,

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.080
don't forget Library
of Congress.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:34.290
And you can do science camp,
you can do a lot of activities

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.570
and go to earn your degree.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:43.200
And there are some professions
in biomedical research

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.060
or in biomedical science that
do not require advanced degree.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:54.180
So for example environmental
field technicians, sonographers

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.110
or veterinary technicians,
nurse,

00:33:56.110 --> 00:34:04.470
and if you are interested doing
forensic science for example.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:09.690
So you still have to have
education to do these things

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:14.350
that you are interested
and you can choose

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:21.230
to pursue your academic career
by going to a PhD studies

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:25.590
and have your own lab and
ask your own questions,

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.520
apply for NIH for funding,
and do your research

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.070
that you would love to do.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:37.160
So just do not let
your imagination

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:42.460
to give you boundaries,
so dream big

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:48.940
and follow your dreams
so to be a scientist.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.550
That's the end of
my presentation

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.310
and now Dr. Yuri
will excite you.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:03.140
And we will have questions
maybe later together right.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.440
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Thank
you very much.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:11.710
So our next scientist and Yuri
Kotliarov is the other half

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.850
of the scientific
dynamic duo and he'll talk

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.990
to you a little bit about the
kinds of work that he does

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.930
with scientific data,
what happens

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.570
after you get the
results of the experiments

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.160
and the questions
that you are asking.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.130
So he also went to
Tokyo University,

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.440
got a PhD in engineering
and now also works

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.900
at the National Institutes
of Health in the Center

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.280
for Human Immunology,
he's a staff scientist

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.690
so science is a daily thing.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.190
Looking at a whole bunch
of things and figuring

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.550
out how everything
fits together.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.000
So tell us a little bit
more about your work.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.720
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: Okay,
hello good morning again to you.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.020
So just as question
I want to ask you,

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.500
what do you think the most
common tools now in science

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.630
as it was for centuries,
like what scientists used

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:04.850
to generate hypothesis, thinking

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.450
about the nature,
what is the tools?

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:13.280
So Svetlana before talked with
you about some scientific tools.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.440
So but what do you
think, any ideas,

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.040
like very simple tools every
scientist used for centuries?

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.340
Yes.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.640
&gt;&gt; Magnifying [inaudible].

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
Magnifying glasses,

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:28.770
but yeah it was developed
just maybe a few,

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.180
maybe a hundred years
ago, something like this.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.920
Something was simpler
what scientists are using.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.220
&gt;&gt; Water.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: Water
okay, but not everyone maybe.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:39.970
Yeah.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.520
[ Inaudible ]

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:48.150
Exactly paper and pencil
you have to write your ideas

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.620
and you kind of recording
your findings right.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.530
So in last years things
change, what do we use now?

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:01.290
So we also use pen, paper
and pencils and papers,

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:02.640
so what do we use now?

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.940
&gt;&gt; Technology.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.240
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
Technology,

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.540
what kind of technology?

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.840
&gt;&gt; Internet.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
Internet yes, but before?

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.440
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.290
Just let's say computers
right more general

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:16.930
and machines it help us
to store like large amount

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.730
of data and do the analysis.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:22.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.360
Which machine?

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.660
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.740
Computers yeah.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.800
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] write
it down first.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.720
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: So again
Svetlana recently described you

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:38.160
that scientists who discovered
microscopes they just draw the

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.600
pictures they saw
under the microscope.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:48.420
And many thought in hypothesis
was built about the pictures.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:53.850
So what current technology is
recording is very complicated,

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.280
it's also images that converted
to the data on the computer

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.490
and it's a large amount of data.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.520
Maybe I can just show you.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:09.980
So this is one of technologies,
it's a little bit old.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:17.880
We use these called
DNA or MicroArrays.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.110
You know all what is DNA and
how it looks like, what is it,

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.620
did you study in
your science class?

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.960
Does this look like this?

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.010
Yeah, like a [inaudible]
molecule

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:35.420
that can pass the information
about you from generation

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.130
to generation, why is
we look your mom and dad

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.240
and why we different from
animal, from bacteria.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:48.350
Because every living thing
they have DNA in their cells.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.630
So this technology has, it's
actually a very tiny chip,

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:58.410
it's about like one
and a little bit more

00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:59.960
[inaudible] centimeters.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:06.550
And they have small
pieces of DNA attached

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.350
to like every micron
of this array

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.470
and the DNA is very
different and it's light

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:19.370
when it finds similar
DNA in your sample.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:23.370
So we analyze like a lot of
thousands of such images,

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:24.670
it's very complicated.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.700
It's written by laser
and basically

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:34.280
when the laser finds the light
it means these genes also

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:39.640
present in your sample,
the samples can be cells

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.080
or something from your
blood, from mouse,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.700
animals, bacteria and so on.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:51.300
So the data takes a lot of space

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.030
and this requires computer
to do the analysis.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.840
For example, we can compare
cancer patients some sample,

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.120
like blood sample
from cancer patient

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.040
with a healthy patient
just normal and see

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.040
which genes are different.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.360
Maybe if some genes express more
it means the gene's response

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.770
in cancer patients the gene
responsible for the cancer

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:18.410
or if some genes we find less

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.400
in cancer patients maybe
this gene is important

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.110
to protect healthy
people from cancer.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:28.500
So but the -- yes?

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.110
&gt;&gt; How is cancer formed?

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.640
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: This
is a complicated question,

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.420
this is actually under a
very large study now how the

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.720
cancer form.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:44.380
The problem is that the
different cancer is very

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.250
different, from one patient
-- if you compare one patient

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.540
and another patient
even with the same type

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:54.170
of cancer let's say
lung cancer the nature

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.260
of cancer might be
very different.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.250
Some maybe smoked a
lot and got the cancer,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:03.140
another one maybe lived
in different environment

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:12.500
or had some genomic
predisposition,

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.000
some mutations in their cells.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.400
So it's a very difficult
question and it's.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:27.510
&gt;&gt; Are you saying
that if someone

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.590
from different [inaudible],
from different areas?

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.840
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
Yeah, the are some -- yeah.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Can I answer?

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.440
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
Yeah, you can answer.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.600
So cancer is although they are
all different as Yuri said,

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.840
so there are common
features of all cancers

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:56.430
that something happens in the
DNA, in our genetic information

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.990
that make the cells to
divide uncontrollably,

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.760
so it cannot stop dividing.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:07.140
That's why the tumor is
formed, so it's growing.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.960
That is the main feature which
is common to many cancers.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:18.100
So is that what your question,
how the cancer is formed?

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.760
But exactly the mechanism
can be different

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.620
for all different
types of cancer.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.320
And there are a lot of.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
And even for example

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:32.180
if there is brain cancer there
is multiple different types

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.580
of brain cancer.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:38.440
And it's different how people
survive, some survive longer,

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.720
some survive less,
some people respond

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:46.470
to some treatment
and survive longer.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.740
But other people do not
respond and it's very important

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.980
to know what is the
right treatment

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.960
for some patients
and for another.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.510
Maybe you heard about
some program

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:02.760
like precision medicine
initiative when scientist wants

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:07.680
to really analyze like
sequence of DNA in your cells

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.510
and know more about you
and to find better cure.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:20.190
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:27.370
Yes, the earlier the cancer
is detected the easier

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:31.060
to treat it usually.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.390
But it depends on the
aggressiveness of cancer

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:40.920
and sometimes it's very hard to
find the cancer at early stage

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.280
because the cells are
very small you know

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.380
and cancer cells they're hiding,
it's very tough and it's one

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:53.160
of the direction
of cancer science

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.580
to detect cancer
at the early stage.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.420
So but I don't have much time,
I want to have some fun with you

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.960
about the data analysis
in general.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.030
So I show you this slide just to
have an idea that we're dealing

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.890
with some large images
that converted

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.870
to the data on the computer.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.670
So but I want to talk
something different

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.240
and maybe you won't notice
it's related to science.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.960
So in the Library of Congress
there is a very large database

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.120
of old newspapers.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.720
The newspapers was scanned

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.570
with optical character
recognition technology,

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.080
have you heard about it?

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.330
Basically you can convert
the image to the text,

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:42.880
you could right,
it's called OCR.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.930
So the Library of Congress
had this large database

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:55.190
of newspapers from you see
18th century to 20th century,

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:58.680
all the -- so many newspapers

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.420
and all the text
is recognizable.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:07.590
The computer like you're reading
the news in the computer.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:11.290
So and so this project
[inaudible]

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:17.640
in America provides very
good access to this data

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:23.470
and you can do some very
fun research I would say.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:29.230
And I can just go with
you and just do them,

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:34.170
very small analysis
with the tool I'm using.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:38.290
So you all like animals,
dogs and cats,

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:41.500
anyone have dogs or
cats [inaudible]?

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.450
So who is the dog people?

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:45.880
Wow me too.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.580
And who are cats people?

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.880
You have both right?

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.200
Very good.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.310
So let's ask which from 18th
century right we have all these

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:01.670
papers and how many
papers mention dogs

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.590
and how many papers
mention cats?

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:09.840
So what people will prefer
to talk about in newspaper.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.140
Yes.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.020
Okay yeah, we can see.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.760
So this actually,
so my thought based

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.940
on there is some data
exploration like this

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:29.630
in the Library of Congress
blog, I get the idea from there

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.870
but applied it on the
tool what I am using.

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:37.320
Okay so I will show
you my screen here.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.870
Okay so this called,
environment called RStudio

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:49.070
and I'm using R language,
just one letter R. So I get,

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:54.760
this is the link, it's a coding
yes, this is like how we --

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.360
so I am doing the data
analysis in my daily job

00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.840
and this is basically coding.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:05.560
So this is my code, this is
where all the output show me

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.680
and this is where you will see
some pictures and variables.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.330
Any of you study
some kind of coding?

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:12.680
You did good.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.740
What language have you used?

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:19.250
&gt;&gt; I don't use we coding
to make video games.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.550
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
What, oh I see.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.880
Oh probably like
what's the name?

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.610
Yes.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.390
Okay, okay.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:36.420
So this code, this
language is very used

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.920
in the science of data analysis.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.980
So I read this URL in
the code, get some data.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.320
I hope internet works well.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.620
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:58.170
So you can see I am reading like
some, I'm getting some papers

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.450
from Arizona and you can see

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:10.950
that there is 300,000
papers just from this state.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:19.780
So let's go to dogs, so
we can -- for example.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:26.720
So I am doing the
request for like dogs

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.270
and just it will
take a long time

00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:33.820
to analyze the whole,
the database.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:39.320
So I've taken only
just 20 pages.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:46.960
And it returns me to dog
mentioned just in 20 pages,

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.840
it's not newspaper pages
but it's pages the Library

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.140
of Congress gives you.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:49:02.370
And you can see it it's around 2
million records about the dogs.

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:04.670
So.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.630
So here I get information
for both cats and dogs,

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:22.090
so you can see it goes through
all the 20 pages of information.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:26.060
And it's getting what
state the data from

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.500
and how many mentioning
of dogs and cats.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.640
Okay 20 it's done, this actually
will take a long time for it

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.690
to analyze the whole database.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.990
So some preparation.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.840
Okay and now we have a plot.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.590
So and can you see it?

00:49:54.590 --> 00:50:04.170
So this show by state and make
it a little bit smaller okay.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:10.760
So the red one is
cats, the blue is dogs,

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.330
so this show how many
mentions from the newspaper

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.230
from each state, in
the United States

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:19.090
and again from 18th century.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:24.280
Again, the more, you can see
for example [inaudible] it looks

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.790
like dogs more than cats.

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:34.520
Here we have the District
of Columbia cats win.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:39.590
So some of them like New York
is a dog state, Kentucky,

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:45.190
California, but other they're
pretty much cats as well.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:51.290
So if you do a little
bit more plotting.

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:56.590
So I calculated like who
is the winner basically,

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:59.790
the ratio of number of dogs

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:04.120
in newspaper divided
by number of cats.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.590
So these green are
the dog winners states

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:10.800
and see Kentucky is on the top.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:14.410
So basically, more
dogs than cats,

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:18.270
three times more mention
of dogs in Kentucky.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:23.720
This is tied, this
is the same Virginia,

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.730
South Dakota and Georgia.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:31.860
And Arizona, Montana, Indiana
they looks like cats more.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:36.900
Okay you all like
Star Wars, right?

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:40.680
Did you watch last night, no?

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:45.510
Anyway, there is a database
about all the characters

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:50.310
from the Star Wars in all
the movies, made movies.

00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:54.220
So about the physical
characteristics, I don't know

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.870
who compiled them but there is

00:51:55.870 --> 00:52:01.190
like a whole website
describing who is who.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:08.850
And this website basically has
the easy access to all the data,

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:13.960
for example different planets,
people, vehicles, spaceship,

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.870
which people using which
vehicle, and so on.

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:21.030
And which films they
are and so on.

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:24.750
This is the data how it look
like, so name of the person,

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:29.580
you can see Darth Vader here
and Skywalker, even droids,

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.820
C-3PO and these just
the first part,

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.640
there is 88 characters total

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.900
in this database
[inaudible] attributes.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.710
So again disclaimer, last movie
now is The Force Awakens no

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.010
[inaudible] yet.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:48.950
And you can see there is the
hair and mass and hair color,

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:53.060
eye color and gender
and where they are from,

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.440
what the species and so on.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.140
So I just thought it
will be some kind of fun

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:04.900
to do data analysis of
this database just quickly.

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:14.040
So I already collected the
data, so I'll just read them,

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.340
[inaudible] libraries.

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:22.500
So this gives me some ideas
about what species are

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:27.010
in the movie, so there
is 37 humans, 5 droids,

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:31.130
and then others just so
many species in the galaxy

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:35.770
that are very few
representative of each.

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:41.080
Yes and this movie is mostly
about humans you know.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:48.480
Let's -- so they
have mass and height

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:56.140
and I thought let's plot
them again each other.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:00.800
So here is some points,
so here is the mass

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.070
so how heavy they are
and this is height.

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:07.370
So again, we see the.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:17.980
So this row everyone that
has both mass and height.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.920
So you can see they're
kind of on the line

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:26.640
so they're heavier the character
the higher they are or opposite.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.130
There is one exception
here, so he's very heavy

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:38.380
and not very high, any ideas who
can be, who knows the movies?

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:44.930
There is the Java the Hut
remember this fat guy, bad guy?

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:50.920
So for this I only
leave human and droids.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.340
So let me label them.

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:57.660
So this is the BB8
very small droid

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.650
and then the top we have
Darth Vader, very high

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:05.430
and then all the other humans

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:09.700
with another droid
like killer droids.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.610
And then basically all
the humans [inaudible]

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:15.620
and there is a line
and some exceptions.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:21.180
So you know idea about the
body mass index how they,

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:27.350
how doctors kind of assess how
health you are based on mass

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:31.780
and height or if like your
BMI is basically mass divided

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.800
by square of your
height, sorry height?

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:45.680
So I can calculate the
BMI for these characters.

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:53.480
Okay so this is coloring
male, it's okay.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:56:02.350
So this is, so again here

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:05.560
with the green one
is our healthy zone,

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:10.690
you can see this is between like
20 and 25 really healthy BMI.

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:16.690
And you see all the humans
are pretty good shape.

00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:17.990
Let me label them also.

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:19.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
How about Chewbacca?

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:20.590
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
I haven't labeled him.

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:25.020
Actually he was there, but
he's not human he was excluded.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.320
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Okay.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: A beast.

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.580
So see Darth Vader a
little bit overweight,

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:36.370
but he probably has a
lot of metal in the body.

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:38.930
Some few people are overweight

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:47.310
and these I remember the
Luke's step-father right,

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:48.610
a little bit overweighted
[phonetic].

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:57.150
And one of the pilot called,
with nickname [inaudible].

00:56:57.150 --> 00:57:04.810
So all the females here,
except one Captain Phasma

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:09.610
from the Force Awakens,
it's a very large woman.

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:13.740
And you know this is the wartime
they all like very fit to fight

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.740
and also, it's Hollywood actors,

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.960
you know they're
supposed to be healthy.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:26.240
So, okay so I want to finalize,
we don't have much time,

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.270
I have some other
very fun datasets.

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:36.730
But I want you to have an
idea that it's very easy

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:42.450
to use computer and with just a
few lines of code you can look

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:45.460
from the different
prospects on your data

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:49.960
and kind of get an idea.

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:55.410
And generate some hypothesis
for fun experiments.

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:58.860
Thank you very much
guys for listening.

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:02.040
[ Applause ]

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.920
Yeah, if you have questions.

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you do
research, you analyze data?

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: I analyze
data, but not this of course.

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:12.050
&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:13.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: This is
just for fun in my free time.

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:14.650
&gt;&gt; Right, so what type of data,

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:18.100
so you're only analyzing
immunology data

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.010
or are you analyzing
all the different data

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:21.380
that comes into your office?

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
Analyzing different data

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.980
which related to immunology.

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.280
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
This can be some

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:27.880
like autoimmune diseases,

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.180
it can be for example we
published a large paper

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.630
about the flu vaccination.

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:31.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:34.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: How
people respond to flu vaccine,

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.180
but we see that it
depends on some cells

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:42.480
in your body some people
respond higher than others.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.780
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:45.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
And we find some cells

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.570
that actually they stay there,

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:53.550
the amount of those cells just
before the vaccination can --

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:56.210
is responsible for whether
you will have response or not.

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:57.510
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:58.810
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:02.220
So and it's very different
how young people responds

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.810
versus old people, they are
very different immune system

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:08.830
and we're still trying
to understand what's the

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:11.360
like big difference between
young and old people.

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
You did cancer.

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
So we study.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
You did cancer too.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.870
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
That's right we did.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.430
&gt;&gt; Do you all ever
get to work together?

00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:22.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: We used
to work together for eight years

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.990
in the cancer lab on
the brain cancers.

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:27.780
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
I'm whispering

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:31.710
that you did cancer analysis
too in terms of data.

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:34.470
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: Yes, we
working on the and now you know

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:42.180
in the cancer research
immunotherapy is very promising

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:47.710
to prepare the cell that
is specific for a patient

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.980
that will help him
to fight the cancer

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.920
and then attack the
cancer cells and kill them.

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.400
So this is very promising
research and also in immunology

00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.000
in general there is
many, many open questions

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.300
that we're trying to answer.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.780
Basically my job is
to help scientists

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:12.160
to understand the data and to
generate some new hypothesis,

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.000
how to explain what
we see in the data.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.990
Do you have any questions guys?

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:25.790
So basically this is using the
tools that now almost everyone,

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:28.840
many, many people have
computers in their home.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
This is a free tool yeah.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.130
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: And this
tool I'm using is actually free,

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.670
it's opensource.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:40.570
&gt;&gt; Would you rather use
the computer or like pencil

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:45.120
and paper like because say if
like all the power went out and.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
Of course yes.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.720
&gt;&gt; And the data will be erased.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
Of course.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.100
Yeah, I prefer to use the
computer when it's available

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:56.470
but we should be ready of course
and just don't lose [inaudible]

01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:01.890
to write and draw
with pen and pencils.

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:04.100
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: We actually
have a whole bunch of research

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.720
in the Library of Congress
collection, digital collections

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.700
of Thomas Jefferson writing
down data with paper and pencil

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.460
and he was trying to figure out,
not necessarily even figuring

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.470
out just recording data
about the weather every day

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:20.570
and he would write
down just everything

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:22.150
that he saw around him.

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:24.880
And then you can see
all that data online

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.940
and you could also
plug it into a computer

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.240
and analyze what Thomas
Jefferson was looking

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.540
at every day so.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.840
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
That's interesting.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.060
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: He was a
writer, inventor, scientist,

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:37.950
library enthusiast, everything.

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:39.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov:
But I can say

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:42.790
that you saw the optical
character recognition

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:45.660
from the newspapers when
the font is very fixed

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.510
and we know how the
letters look like,

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:51.750
but when you have the
handwriting and you want

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:53.050
to [inaudible] computer

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:56.380
to analyze what's written
it's a very hard task.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.440
Different people have different
you know writing styles

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.110
and sometimes you
even cannot read

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:04.300
and you want computer
to be able to read.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.020
But there is a technology
like some deep learning

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:11.470
and [inaudible] networks
that have helped with these

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:14.910
and now the research is
ongoing in this area.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.920
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: [Inaudible]
asked your question,

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.780
anyone else?

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.360
&gt;&gt; Dr. Yuri Kotliarov: Okay.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Okay.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:35.640
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: All right
well how about another round

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.350
of applause for our scientists?

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:40.710
Thank you very much.

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:42.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova:
Thank you.

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.850
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: I hope you
guys enjoyed the presentation

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:46.390
and make sure to check out
the digital resources we have

01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:49.820
about all these founding
fathers who recorded their data

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.780
and the original scientists.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:54.800
And there are so many
sources out there,

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.140
if you like you can find a lot

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.080
of really interesting
data and explore.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.340
If you have a question
you're already a scientist

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.550
and just keep exploring
your curiosity okay.

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:07.990
All right guys, thank
you so much.

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:10.790
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:13.970
of Congress, visit us@LOC.gov.
