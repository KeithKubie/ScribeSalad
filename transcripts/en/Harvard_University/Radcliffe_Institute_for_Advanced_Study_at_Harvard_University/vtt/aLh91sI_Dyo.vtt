00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.493
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.680
- I'd like to introduce
now our second panel.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.680
We will begin our second panel.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.300
And this is Harvard and Slavery.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.030
Annette Gordon-Reed will be
the moderator for that panel.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.580
Annette Gordon-Reed is the
Charles Warren Professor

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.400
of American Legal History
at Harvard Law School

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.960
and Professor of
History at Harvard.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.070
And she won the 2009 Pulitzer
Prize and many, many prizes

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.180
for her book The
Hemingses of Monticello.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.925
Annette.

00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:47.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.590
- Thank you very much.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.673
It's wonderful to be here.

00:00:55.673 --> 00:00:59.880
Also, I'd like to say that I
was for five years the Carol K.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.190
Pforzheimer Radcliffe professor.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.000
The term ended last year.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.170
And I had to come back to
Earth, into the real world,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.250
and actually do some work.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.920
So, I'm very, very
happy to be here

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.990
under the auspices of Radcliffe.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.910
I'm going to introduce
our panelists,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.300
distinguished panelists, in
order of their presentation.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.660
Sven Beckert is the Laird Bell
Professor of History at Harvard

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.900
University and an author of the
much-acclaimed book on slavery

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.500
and capitalism, Empire of
Cotton:A Global History.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.050
Sven has been
interested in slavery

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.630
at Harvard for a number of
years and did a research project

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.050
with students called the
Harvard Research Project,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.430
Slavery Project.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.470
Then, we will have
Alexandra Rahman,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.600
who was a student of Sven's,
who did her thesis on slavery

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.480
and was involved in the Harvard
and Slavery Research Project.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.230
Dan Coquillette, who
is from Boston College

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.900
and is also now the
Charles Warren Visiting

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.210
Professor of American Legal
History at the law school,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.500
Harvard Law School.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.510
Among other things,
Dan is a specialist

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.450
on the royal family,
whose contribution

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.430
was the seed money for the
creation of the Harvard Law

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.380
School.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.479
And finally, we'll
have Julian Bonder,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.230
an award-winning architect
who is active contributor

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.920
to international debates on
slavery, memory, architecture,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920
and art and
representation, and will

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.520
talk to us about
architecture and memory

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.870
at the end of the presentation.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.300
So, to give you
some ground rules,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.570
each presenter will speak
for about 15 minutes.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.510
We will then take
a time afterwards

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.760
to have a conversation
among ourselves,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.920
but we really want to get
questions from you all.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.980
You know from the beginning
that you write your questions.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.190
I will take questions from
all of the various audiences,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.184
here, in the overflow room.

00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:49.600
If you're on Twitter or social
media, write your questions

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.940
and I'll try to get
those in as well.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.277
So, that's the order of the day.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:54.360
So, we'll start with Sven.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.590
- Thank you so much, Annette.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.350
It's great to be here.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.440
Good afternoon.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.750
I'm delighted that so many of
you decided to come out here

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.370
today to join us.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.270
And I'm especially delighted
at the enormous response

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.610
that this conference
has generated,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.260
which I think very much speaks
to the urgency of the issues

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.540
that we're debating
here, and perhaps

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.380
also is a hopeful sign that
we are able to confront

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.870
our histories in new ways.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.570
When we've shown
ability and willingness

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.150
to face the darkest
moments of our history,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.240
I become more hopeful about
our future, a future that

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.160
needs to rest on a full
and truthful accounting

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.340
of our past.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.070
I'm personally very much moved
by the turnout here today

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.940
and by the interest that
you all have been taking

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.330
in these matters, not least
because the engagement

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.570
with this history
here at Harvard

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.290
began as a decisively
low-key affair.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.890
10 years ago, in 2007, I
sat in a small seminar room

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.800
in the Yard with
a very small group

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.150
of undergraduate students,
exactly four of them,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.620
who had signed up for a seminar
taught by a professor who

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.650
did not know more about
the topic of the course

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.080
than they did.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.310
I had been inspired to offer
that Harvard and Slavery

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.340
seminar by President Ruth
Simmons's path-breaking work

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.410
at Brown University.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.320
And I was also inspired
by my upbringing

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.750
in Germany, which had taught
me that almost anywhere

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.620
some dark history lurks.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.130
It was these students
that the work

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.430
to excavate with-- it was these
students who began the work

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.280
to excavate the historical
connections between Harvard

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.390
and slavery.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.510
And in a very real
sense, it is they

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.480
who have enabled us
to meet here today.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.520
And I very much want
to thank them again

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.170
for all of their
work, and some of them

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.370
are here right now, so--

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.250
In the past few
hours, we have heard

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.340
moving testimony about
the legacy of slavery

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.530
at American universities.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.940
We've heard about colleges
buying and selling

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.540
enslaved workers,
about students bringing

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.170
their enslaved servants
to their campuses,

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.580
about presidents,
faculties, alumni

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.060
and donors of these
institutions as slaveholders,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.910
about how enslaved
construction workers built

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.240
the physical infrastructure
of various universities,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.510
and how the huge stream of
money derived from the slave

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.020
economy infused institutions
of higher learning

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.390
and enabled them,
among other things,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.510
to train an elite that
legitimated notions

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.150
of racial difference
and enslavement

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.190
and enforced the institutions
that had enabled them.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.110
A little more than
260 years ago,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.740
it was three Harvard
University-trained judges

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.040
who convicted Phyllis, an
enslaved worker accused

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.330
of killing her master, to be
burned at the stake just a few

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.410
hundred yards away from where
we are meeting right now.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.320
This story and many
others are moving,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.400
and they are disturbing.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.330
We can see that some
of our most esteemed

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.060
educational
institutions are also

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.080
the product of some of the most
horrific violence that has ever

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.680
descended upon any
group of people.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.770
Yes, we did know that much
of the wealth of the American

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.560
South had been
built upon slavery,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.040
that its roads, its canals,
its plantations, and its cities

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.680
were the result of the
exploitation of millions

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.190
of African-Americans.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.980
But today at this
conference, we learned

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.730
that the centers of higher
learning, of debate,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.590
of the great
humanistic traditions

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.130
of the Western world, of
our cherished enlightenment

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:21.410
traditions, were also built at
least partly upon the violence

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.980
of the slave trader, the
Middle Passage, the auction

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.470
block, and the whip.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.150
We are rightly disturbed
by these histories,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.720
but if we sit back and think
about the broader context,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.480
we should not be too
surprised that slavery

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.020
was central to the institutions
of higher education

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.490
as they emerged
in North America.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.740
After all, for
several centuries,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.410
North America was part of the
great belt of slave plantation

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.770
economies that stretched
from South America

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.990
through the
Caribbean all the way

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.180
to the borders of New Jersey.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.910
Yet here in Boston,
and here at Harvard,

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.600
the story of slavery that has
been told for all too long

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.070
is different.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.680
New England is hailed
in the national memory

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.460
as a place of freedom, a place
where religious dissenters

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.520
settled on the stony
soils of New England

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.310
to create a new world
of liberty and freedom.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.730
And thus, if we look at the
history of the institutions

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.960
of higher learning, including
the history of Harvard,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.870
we have taught this
history, and they

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.360
have taught these
histories about themselves,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.260
as exactly this story, as
a story of the expansion

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.460
of human freedom.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.039
Or at least they have
done so until recently.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.010
When I first embarked
upon the project

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.890
of trying to understand
the historical relationship

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.250
between Harvard University
and slavery with my students,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.350
the literature on the
history of Harvard

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.320
was almost silent on
the question of slavery.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.620
And when the students began to
uncover a different history,

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.480
they and others who listened
to them were surprised.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.510
Yet in retrospect, it seems
that the only thing that

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.230
should surprise us
was our surprise

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.430
and that it took us so long
for us to allow ourselves to be

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.980
surprised by that history.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.340
After all, a whole range
of studies, many of them

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.910
quite old, had argued
for the continental reach

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.800
and the importance of slavery.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.280
People such as Eric Williams and
WEB Du Bois and Ronald Bailey,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.410
among many others,
had powerfully

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.650
argued for the nationwide or
even global reach of slavery.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.000
And it would have been unlikely
that the oldest university

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.370
in North America
would not in some ways

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.690
be also involved in that
story of slavery as well.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.440
In dusty archival records,
countless published volumes

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.980
in the libraries, and by careful
study of Harvard's oldest

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.220
buildings and neighboring
colonial graveyards, students

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.850
uncovered many links
between Harvard and slavery.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.130
They chronicled how
Harvard presidents

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:11.310
brought enslaved workers to
live with them on campus.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.940
They analyzed how significant
gifts to the university

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.690
were drawn from the
exploitation of slave labor.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.980
They found evidence for some
of Harvard's endowment invested

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.450
in merchant voyages related
to the slave economy.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.970
They showed how
Harvard's administration

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.910
favored the suppression
of public debates

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.750
on [? slavering, ?] fearing a
backlash from the local Boston

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.400
elite.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.190
Harvard-trained judges
condemned an enslaved woman,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.325
as we just heard, to be burned
on the stake just a few hundred

00:10:44.325 --> 00:10:46.840
yards away from here.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.820
The students charted how
the sons of Southern slave

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.310
owners who returned
after college

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.670
to a lifetime of violent
mastery over their workers

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.510
mingled on campus with the
sons of the Northern elites,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.940
forging networks that
often lasted a lifetime.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.510
The students traced the
history of Antiguan planter

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.630
who became a major funder
of the Harvard Law School.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.430
More generally,
the students show

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.000
how the deep immersion of
Boston's merchant community

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.690
with the plantation
economy of the Caribbean,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.380
yielded resources
for the university.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.770
They analyzed how Harvard
acquired one of Cuba's largest

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.060
sugar plantations, a plantation
whose owner, Ed Atkins,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.380
provided resources for
the university to draw on.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.180
And these resources were
derived from the labor

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.760
of his enslaved workers.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.710
And students were
also able to show

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.300
how the development of some of
the most viciously racist ideas

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.290
were spearheaded by the
members of the Harvard faculty.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.840
Indeed, what the
students found was

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.150
that Harvard's
connection to slavery

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.970
extended beyond the
abolition of slavery

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.790
in Massachusetts in
the 1780s, and it even

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.510
extended beyond the abolition
of slavery in the United States

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.950
in 1865.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.770
In the process of
doing this research

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.190
students have made
a larger point.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.010
They have shown that
the history of slavery

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.850
is the history of the
nation as a whole.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.980
Even in acknowledging
the crimes of slavery,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.460
we have all too often settled
into a seemingly comfortable

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.870
fiction that slavery was a
regional institution, confined

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.380
by the 19th century to the
states of the American South,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.840
with Northerners
principally involved

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.610
with slavery by bringing
about its abolition.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.430
Slavery, in fact, appears
as limited in scope,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:51.470
an unfortunate detour on the
nation's march to modernity,

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.950
and certainly not as one of the
engines of America's economy.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.680
But as the students
have shown, slavery

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.090
was not a regional institution
or a regional problem.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.290
Slavery was everywhere, in
the merchant houses of Boston,

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.070
the banks of New York, the
factories of Rhode Island,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.830
and the universities
throughout New England.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.880
Such recognition of the
continent-spanning importance

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.440
of slavery, in turn, also gives
a much greater appreciation

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.530
for those Americans who had
the courage and the resolve

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.770
to stand up against
slavery, among them

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.800
members of the
Harvard community,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.750
and for those
Americans who would

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.120
die in battle
during the Civil War

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.120
to bring about emancipation,
among them also

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.550
members of the
Harvard community.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.490
Recognizing the
power of slavery,

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.160
including the power
of slavery at Harvard,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.290
does put into much
sharper relief

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.520
the courage and dedication
of those, black and white,

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.700
who fought against slavery.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.480
They stood against some of
the most powerful interests

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.635
of their own times.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.480
As historians and as
members of this community,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.390
our first commitment
is to uncovering

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.550
the historical truth.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.150
Part of that truth is
the deep entanglement

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.440
of this institution with
slavery and also with some

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.770
of the racism, exploitation,
and repression that

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:35.650
descended upon
African-Americans after slavery.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.860
This history is inscribed
in this institution,

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.620
and it is also inscribed
in the nation as a whole.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.280
The economic,
cultural, ideological,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.310
and political legacy of
slavery and its aftermath

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.600
is with us today.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.660
It is not just history.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.920
It is our present.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.460
Slavery is our present.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.490
As members of this
university and as members

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.070
of our national
community, we need

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.440
to confront these histories.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.220
We cannot successfully move
forward as a university,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.420
as a nation, or as citizens
without acknowledging this

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.320
history and making it
important to the understanding

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.580
of our present.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.920
And to be meaningful,
that acknowledgement

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.310
will have to have economic
and political consequences.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.060
It cannot be purely
symbolic or rhetorical.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.887
Thank you.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:33.366
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.140
- Hello, everyone, and
thank you so much again

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.940
for the introductions.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.560
My presentation
today has two parts.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.530
First, I will quickly
introduce myself

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.920
and my association with the
Harvard and Slavery Project.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.470
And second, I will take
you through an example

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.900
of some scholarship on
Harvard and slavery,

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.810
which is the findings of
my senior thesis, entitled

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:13.040
Plantation University:
Harvard Scientists at Soledad

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.916
Plantation--

00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:16.040
I'm sorry, Harvard Scientists
at Soledad Plantation

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.010
and Cuba's Transition from
Slavery to Free Labor,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.930
1880 to 1920.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.392
And as my presentation
will go on,

00:16:22.392 --> 00:16:24.350
and looking at this thesis
several years later,

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.920
I realize 1920 is actually not
a great time to cut this off.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.720
The connection actually
extends much further than that.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.100
So, to start, my
name is Alexa Rahman,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.600
and I'm currently
a doctoral student

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.310
at Harvard Business
School, studying

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.610
accounting, management, and
corporate accountability.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.280
I got involved in this field
when I took Professor Beckert's

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.710
Harvard and Slavery
research seminar when

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.310
I was a freshman at
Harvard College in 2009.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.980
I was interested in
this class because I

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.300
had heard of
historians discovering

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.060
other links between
slavery and universities

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.800
at our peer schools like Brown.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.310
And I was curious to see if
we at Harvard had similar ties

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.510
to the history of slavery that
we simply didn't know about.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.670
My research focused
on a research facility

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.490
that Harvard maintained on
a sugar plantation named

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.170
Soledad in Cuba in the late
1800s to the mid 1900s.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.230
That facility, called the
Harvard Botanic Station,

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.880
was created by the
two figures that you

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.760
can see here on this slide.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.630
Edwin Atkins, to the left, was
a prominent Boston businessman,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.300
West Indian sugar
merchant, and slave owner,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.520
who purchased Soledad
Plantation in 1884.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.970
Oakes Ames, to the right, was
a Harvard professor of botany.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.190
In the aftermath of Cuban
slave emancipation in 1886,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.010
Atkins wished to apply the
latest scientific knowledge

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.220
in agricultural engineering
to boost production

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.350
at Soledad Plantation.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.560
In 1899, he collaborated
with Professor Ames

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.530
to develop the Harvard
Botanic Station at Soledad

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.140
to conduct research on sugarcane
to support his business.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.920
This relationship, I
argue in my thesis,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.770
would forge a profitable
but problematic link

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.900
between the history of
Harvard and the history

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.620
of Caribbean slavery.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.230
My thesis makes
three main arguments.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.330
First, it contends
that by accepting gifts

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.060
from Edwin Atkins in
the early 20th century,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.180
Harvard used wealth and land
accumulated by slave labor

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.340
as scholarly resources.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.950
This follows from evidence
that Atkins's family wealth

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.340
was dependent on the West
Indian slave economy.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.890
Second, it argues that
the social and business

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.760
ties between Atkins
and Harvard personnel

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.160
resulted in significant
financial donations

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.420
to the institution, which drew
on the Atkins family fortune.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.220
Lastly, and perhaps
most important,

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.580
it asserts that Edwin Atkins's
construction of the Harvard

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.510
Botanic Station at Soledad
provided a significant gift

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.430
to the university's
academic assets.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.660
I'll begin by just
providing a short background

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.660
on the sources of Edwin Atkins's
personal wealth, which he later

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.450
used to finance
Harvard researchers.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.240
During the 19th century,
the Atkins family,

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.210
based in Belmont,
Massachusetts, rose to riches

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.790
by trading goods
manufactured by slaves,

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.090
mainly sugar and molasses,
in the West Indies.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.610
When Edwin Atkins took
over the family business,

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.800
he assumed ownership
of the Soledad sugar

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:32.300
plantation, a 900-acre refinery
with approximately 177 slaves.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.510
Cuban slave
emancipation in 1886,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.760
as I mentioned
previously, coincided

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.470
with a period of
major innovations

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.620
in industrial production
technology, which also included

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.060
agricultural engineering.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.720
Other innovations, such as
steam powered refineries,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.090
rail transport, and
cable communication all

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.490
transformed the sugar
production business

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.560
just as the country
was beginning to shift

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.600
from slave labor to free labor.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.350
Atkins, eager to keep
up with his competitors,

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.200
invested heavily in new
production technologies

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.720
and approached Harvard
professor Ames precisely

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.520
to help his business
successfully

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.730
navigate this transition
from slave production

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.454
to mechanized production.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.900
Drawing on his Cuban
fortune, Atkins

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.800
made significant donations
of cash, scholarships,

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.900
and academic resources to
Harvard from 1899 to 1925,

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.690
enabling students and
professors to conduct research

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.870
on improving the quality
and yield of tropical plants

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.640
such as sugarcane.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:42.150
His largest single donation,
which was $17,119 in 1919,

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.490
was to establish the
Atkins Fund for Tropical

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.710
Research in Economic Botany.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.080
This gift would be worth a
little over half a million

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.630
dollars today.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.660
Physical research spaces like
the Harvard Botanic Station

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.120
helped transport
intellectual power

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.940
from the halls of academia
and apply it directly

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.280
to issues on the plantation.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.710
Ames and Atkins's
partnership culminated

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.730
in 1925, when they constructed
the official Harvard

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.810
House, a boarding house with
bedrooms and a laboratory space

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.140
for Harvard students to conduct
research at the plantation

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.360
under the management
of the university.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.420
And what you see here is an
image from the inside of one

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.740
of those labs in 1930
on the plantation.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.820
In recognition of Atkins's
long and profitable patronage,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.440
Harvard president
Charles Elliott

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.110
even awarded Atkins
an honorary degree

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:39.660
at the 1903 commencement.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.880
So, although slavery
ended in 1886,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.600
the physical, cultural, and
ideological legacy of slavery

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.580
remained palpable
to Harvard scholars

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.580
as they continued to
conduct research at Soledad.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.610
To emphasize this point I've
included a quote from a letter

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.610
that Professor Ames wrote on
one of his research visits

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.460
to the plantation.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.160
He writes, "The slave
bell on the plantation

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.970
rang out one single,
musical, but dull note.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.970
And I really felt that
all the cruelty of slavery

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.900
was summoned in
that one bell tone.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.520
My subsequent
thoughts were perhaps

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.670
similar to those of some
compassionate creature, who

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.010
suddenly awakened
in days gone by,

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.490
to the atrocities of holding
in bondage one's fellow man,

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.560
and driving him to
and from his work

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.080
by the note of a
doleful bell, aided

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.750
by this stinging lash,
which injures one far

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.750
deeper than steel or bronze."

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.490
And I should add this isn't--

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.280
I didn't include the rest
of the letter on the slide,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.590
but it's interesting
that he doesn't actually

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.860
go on to address that
this is a problem.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.760
He goes on to talk about how
this is a issue that people

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.030
must have faced a long
time ago and isn't

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.740
antiquity fascinating.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.800
This was written like about 20
years after the end of slavery.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.650
And he was working
for the slave-owner

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.445
who perpetrated these crimes.

00:23:01.445 --> 00:23:02.320
So, just interesting.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.960
I know we had talked
earlier about people back

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.330
then maybe didn't realize
it was a bad thing.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.960
This is an example of someone
recognizing it and willfully

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.240
ignoring it.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.980
So, despite these
mixed feelings,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.265
apparently, about
working at Soledad,

00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:19.960
Ames visited his
facilities in Cuba often,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.770
bringing back data to supplement
his science classes at Harvard.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.360
Students and
instructors continued

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.640
to use the site for
decades to come,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.370
leaving behind a trail
of photographs, sketches,

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.200
and Crimson articles documenting
their time at the plantation.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.910
The university maintained
control of the research

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.610
facilities until
travel became difficult

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.940
during the communist
Cuban revolution.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.140
And the last director
of the Harvard station

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:50.320
left the island in 1961.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.540
So, to summarize,
my thesis argued

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.170
that Atkins's donations of
funds and academic resources

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.770
sprang from wealth and lands
directly dependent on profits

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.930
from trading West
Indian slave products

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.870
and eventually owning
Soledad Plantation.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:08.080
Harvard benefited from
the Atkins's fortune

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.170
by accepting financial
and educational gifts,

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.940
in operating Ames's
very own Harvard Botanic

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.100
Station for over half a century
on the very grounds of Soledad

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.810
Plantation.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.020
The images on this slide
illustrate Harvard professors

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.950
harvesting papayas on
the station in 1924,

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.920
as well as an image of a
sign bearing Harvard's name

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.610
that was found at the
plantation in 2005.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.710
In conclusion, I
believe these findings

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.470
demonstrate the importance
of investigating connections

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.540
between Harvard and slavery.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.780
I hope that this research will
allow us to better understand

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.210
and recognize how the
history of slavery

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.760
has contributed to the
development of our school's

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.260
vast educational resources,
which we still enjoy today.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:54.760
Thank you.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.211
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:20.889 --> 00:25:24.620
- Well, I'm Dan
Coquillette and I'm the--

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.000
along with my distinguished
colleague, Bruce Kimball,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.360
co-director of the Harvard
Law School History Project

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.730
and co-author of a new book,
On the Battlefield of Merit,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:41.560
which is the first of two
volumes, a new critical history

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.680
of Harvard Law School.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.240
I just tell you those two
volumes-- those are not books

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.560
that you can't put down.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.340
Those are books
you can't pick up.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.380
But otherwise, perfect
gift for your uncle Ralph.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.880
I mean--

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:02.560
The Harvard Law School History
Project sounds very fancy.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.870
But in fact, it's
right along the lines

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:09.460
of what Sven and
Alexandra have been doing.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.150
We're a group of volunteers.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.780
We did get some grant
funding upfront,

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.397
but we're not official.

00:26:15.397 --> 00:26:16.730
We're people that work together.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.542
We meet every month.

00:26:18.542 --> 00:26:22.810
It consists of PhDs,
JDs, and particularly,

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.330
students working with
us and specialist

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:31.150
librarians to undertake a whole
series of research initiatives.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:35.680
We've done 100 oral histories,
not just of faculty, but also

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.470
staff, and also of
students and alumni.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.390
And so, this is a--

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:44.560
we believe that thanks to this
project, Harvard Law School

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.950
is one of the best documented
of all institutions of higher

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.730
learning in the United States.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:54.460
Now you may ask, well,
why is that important?

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.120
I have to be very sensitive
here and not arrogant.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.880
We have neighbors to the
south in New Haven that

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.070
are overly sensitive
about their law school,

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.630
and even though it's
younger and much smaller.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:12.190
And-- but the truth
is, for good or bad,

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:16.420
Harvard Law School is the
most powerful law school,

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.710
historically, in America.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.210
And it remains-- just count
the Supreme Court justices--

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.892
it remains the most powerful.

00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:25.100
That wasn't arrogant, was it?

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.150
No, just facts, just facts.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.090
Now, we knew that On
the Battlefield of Merit

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.340
was going to be controversial.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.960
I mean, we knew.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.700
And the things that
we were prepared for

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.460
was, first, the research
on the Civil War.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.930
Harvard Law School was
next only to West Point

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.370
the leading source of military
officers for the Confederacy--

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:55.570
13 major generals, 60 colonels
of Southern regiments.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.610
Almost as many Harvard
Law School students

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:02.110
died fighting for slavery as
died fighting against slavery.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.240
And that was because
during the entire period

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.540
of the 1840s and
1850s, Joseph Story,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.640
Simon Greenleaf recruited--

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.890
to make a national law
school by recruiting

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.390
in Georgia, Atlanta and--

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:17.680
in Atlanta and in
Savannah and Charleston.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.750
So, we knew about that.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.090
We also knew that
Christopher Columbus

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.910
Langdell and his disciples
were fervently anti-feminist.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:32.500
We knew that they had
instilled a gender apartheid

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.670
system at the school
which lasted until 1950.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.730
No women were admitted at
Harvard Law School until 1950.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.330
I've talked to many
in the first class.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.780
No women on the
faculty until 1971.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.210
Now, I've talked to all of them.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.950
So, this is-- there's
plenty of controversy there.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.830
But what really got
the students excited,

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:03.220
and in retrospect, I
should've seen this coming, is

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.400
the establishment of Harvard
Law School as a foundation

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.437
based on slavery.

00:29:08.437 --> 00:29:09.520
There's no doubt about it.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.970
We knew, we knew early
on that Isaac Royall--

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:17.950
this is a portrayal of him
at age 24 with his wife

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.130
and sister-in-law
and daughters--

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.110
he was a slave owner.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.100
We knew he had 20,
24 slaves in Medford.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.840
What we did not know was
that Royall's fortune

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.190
was based on the Antiguan
sugar plantations.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.880
The cruelty of those
plantations was beyond belief.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.250
He owned 180 slaves with
his father on Antigua

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.570
in the Popes Head region.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.550
Sugar slavery was very cruel.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.000
They issued the slaves
knives, the enslaved people

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.320
knives every morning.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.020
They had numbers
on them because you

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.520
had to turn the
knives in every night.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.260
And they were razor sharp.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.240
A single nick without
antibiotic and death

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.610
was almost inevitable.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.460
The casualty rate
on these plantations

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:17.230
was extremely, extremely high.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.310
The only reason
why Harvard School

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.830
is going to have
its bicentennial,

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.820
and it's going to be the oldest
school, law school in America,

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:33.360
is because the fortune that
Royall made in Antiguan sugar

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.700
was left in a bequest
in 1788 to Harvard

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.190
to establish a law professor.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.040
The Royall Professorship
is one of the oldest

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.390
chairs at Harvard.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.310
It's occupied right now
with great distinction

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.280
by Janet Halley, who
in her inauguration

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.730
gave tribute to the slaves
on which the chair is based.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.960
But, you know it's--

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.560
as we got into
this, it got worse.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.690
There was a major slave revolt
on the Royall plantation.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.820
The revolt was
under a leadership

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.595
of a man, very brave
man, named King Court.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.920
Unfortunately for them,
it was betrayed just

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.350
at the last moment.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:27.120
There are only 27
white men on the island

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.770
capable carrying gun.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.540
One was Isaac Royall.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.440
There were 364 slaves.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.200
But they-- white
men had the guns.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.800
The uprising was betrayed,
it was suppressed,

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:49.470
and as a result, 77 enslaved
people were burned at the stake

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.440
by Royall and his friends.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.600
They also-- the six leaders--

00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:00.670
were drawn and quartered, and
King Court was gibbeted alive.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.080
So, this gentleman
here, who founded

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.310
the Harvard Law School's
chair, which became

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.920
the center of the new school--

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.360
as his, one of his
descendants said,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.890
I know he was a slave owner.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.980
I hope he was a
nice slave owner.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.850
And he wasn't a
nice slave owner.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:21.210
This was a brutal slave owner.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.260
Here's his house in Medford.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.220
It's right, you know, 20
minutes drive from here.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.560
Now that's the slave block.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.520
The reason why he
came to Medford

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.140
was because of fear
of yellow fever,

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.480
but also fear of
another slave revolt.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.390
He brought about
20 slaves with him.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.380
They lived in this block.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.680
You can-- some of us
have already been there.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.350
You can visit it.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.140
But this was his
household slaves.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.170
You don't get a sense
of the industry,

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.910
the cruelty of the
industrial slavery

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.550
by looking at these quarters.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:00.420
It was what was
going on in Antigua,

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.350
which was continuing to
support his family, that

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:08.430
was really, really brutal.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.380
He fled to England
on the outbreak

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.130
of the American Revolution,
the Battle of Lexington.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.600
Left his family in Medford.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.710
He ran immediately to Halifax.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:23.780
And when I introduce
the students coming in,

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.340
I show them the portrait
we've just seen.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:33.920
I say, you know, brutal
slave owner, trader, coward.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.620
Other than that, a perfect
role model for you.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.720
Well, in 1936, Abbott
Lawrence Lowell,

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.410
who was an anglophile
of the first order,

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.340
decided that Oxford colleges
all had coats of arms,

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.160
so therefore residence
houses and schools at Harvard

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.280
all ought to have
coats of arms, too.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.410
And so, for the
[INAUDIBLE] he decreed

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.510
coats of arms for everybody.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.750
And that included
Radcliffe, but it also

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.220
included the law school.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.500
And the genius who was
assigned the law school

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.679
decided that the
right coat of arms

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:17.420
should be Isaac
Royall's coat of arms.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.150
So, there is a book
plate of Isaac Royall.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.290
Isaac Royall of Antigua.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.300
You see the three wheat sheaves.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.060
And there is the coat of
arms of Harvard Law School

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.570
until last year.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.449
They're identical.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:33.560
Well, anyway, the students who
had worked on this research

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.340
project persuaded other
students to read the book.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.090
And before anybody
knew it, they were in--

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.639
they had organized
Students for Inclusion.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:46.760
Their motto was
Royall must fall.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.270
And they took over
the major lounge

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.820
at the new Caspersen
Student Center,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.699
declared it the
Belinda Lounge, which

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:58.610
is after the slave,
one of Royall's slaves,

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.560
and occupied it.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.690
So, they were in
absolute seriousness.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:11.960
And a committee was formed under
the chairmanship of Bruce Mann.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.320
And that committee, after
a lot of deliberation,

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.500
decided to recommend to the
president and corporation

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.500
that the shield be revoked.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.190
Now, that decision came with a--

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.680
what I think's one of
the most eloquent pieces

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.670
of writing I've ever seen.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:34.670
And it's by our moderator,
Annette Gordon-Reed.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:40.445
And in that, she
warned that you,

00:35:40.445 --> 00:35:42.320
by just eliminating
a symbol, you

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.890
don't eliminate the
truth of the past.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.280
And also worried that this
would cut the school off

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.099
from the debt it
owes to Antigua.

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:52.640
By the way, this is
what the students

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:58.670
thought of the Royall
coat of arms, right?

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.360
That's their view of it.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.050
Well, anyway, here I
am, down on Antigua.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.440
That's the Betty's Hope.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:13.550
You see the great mills for
breaking up the sugarcane.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:18.290
I was down there talking
to leaders in the Antiguan

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.750
community, educational
leaders and the head

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.060
of their national government,
and their secretary

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.820
of education.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:30.410
And I was talking
about the consciousness

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.530
of the island and its connection
with Harvard Law School.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.110
First of all, it turns
out that the curriculum

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.710
in the high schools all
mention Isaac Royall

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:44.640
and mention the slave revolt.
So, every high school student

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.850
learns this story.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.100
And secondly, that
they're absolutely

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.710
mindful of the connection
between the island

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.890
and this university.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.900
At one point when
talking to Michele Henry,

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.130
the president of
the National Museum,

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.960
I really was just overcome.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.760
I mean, they had
showed me some things

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.330
which they just don't normally
show tourists, of course, which

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:13.490
is the holding pens for the
slaves, that have survived,

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:17.570
and the dungeons where they
hung slaves by their wrists

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.960
and which are back
in the jungle.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.800
And I was overcome.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.430
And I thought, I said,
well, I'm so sorry.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:29.990
I'm so sorry that I represent
here and have benefited

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:34.940
from an institution that
has exploited and enslaved

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.880
people of this island.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.780
I'm just sorry.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.160
And, you know, she turned to
me, Michele Henry, and she said,

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.040
you know, don't be sorry.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.320
Don't be sorry.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.680
We Antiguans are proud
to have had some role

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.350
in the founding of
an institution that

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:57.260
would graduate Barack Obama.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.890
Now that is generousness.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:01.890
Here you are.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.510
There's the poster.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.280
They're selling Obama t-shirts
everywhere on the island.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.180
Now my point is
just a simple one,

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.520
which is Annette
Gordon-Reed's dissent stands

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.640
for a very important truth.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.300
You don't just go around
erasing this and that

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.120
and pretend things
didn't happen.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.390
You know, there are pros
and cons about the shield

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.180
controversy, but one thing--

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.420
we must not forget that
Harvard Law School is linked

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.180
with slavery, that Harvard
Law School owes great debt

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.690
to the enslaved
people of Antigua,

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.740
and that it's part of
this great university

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:44.930
that it is so great that it can
recognize in itself the truth.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:46.160
Veritas.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.030
Thank you very much.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.481
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.750
- So, thank you so much
for the invitation.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.470
I'm very honored and it's
a pleasure to be here.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.080
Thanks the Radcliffe, and
thanks, President Faust,

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.930
for the invitation.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:10.300
I want to tell you that this
talk is related to Harvard

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.950
but may not be
related to Harvard.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.820
And I'd like to see how we all
come to terms with the fact

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.880
that I'm not a historian.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.790
I have to come to terms with
that, you know, somehow.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.800
But there will be
lots of images.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.150
I will not describe them.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.745
So, there's a lecture or kind
of a concept in the images,

00:39:27.745 --> 00:39:29.620
and there's a concept
in the words that I do.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.244
And I would like to
invite you to think

00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:33.520
about your own memories
when you think,

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.030
and when you look at this work.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.080
This originated when I
was a student at Harvard,

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.267
kind of the notion of
architecture and memory.

00:39:40.267 --> 00:39:42.100
I was very interested
in that as a research,

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.360
my own personal research.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.340
And that kind of continued.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.650
So, as an architect
and a teacher,

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.430
I've been investigating through
design and design pedagogy

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.650
the relations between
space and memory,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.020
between architecture and memory.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.620
I'm interested in the notion
that memory is an action.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.760
Memory is not an object.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.740
Memory is a verb, not a noun.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.980
As an action, to remember is
to be present, is to say here

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:06.910
we are.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:10.210
To be present in our complex
present as academics,

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.230
as architects, as
historians, as intellectuals,

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.080
as public intellectuals,
demands a louder and fearless

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.550
truth-speaking and
truth-seeking about our past

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:24.520
and also about ongoing
plights against humanity,

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.300
such as human trafficking,
genocides, present-day slavery,

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.220
and incarceration, as well.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.370
So, few words have
been so ubiquitous

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:35.590
in contemporary culture
as the word memory,

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.770
impacting historiography,
psychoanalysis, visual arts,

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:43.400
performing arts, poetry, media,
landscapes, architecture,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.650
public space.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.600
So, as a result,
architects and artists

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.850
find themselves playing
an important role

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.490
in what we could call public
discourses about history

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.950
and memory.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.620
Architecture is inherently
a practical and public art.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.930
It is a practical art
insofar the purpose

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.085
is the driving force, why a
work is called into being.

00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:02.710
[PHONE RINGING]

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.611
I hope it's not mine.

00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:05.495
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:07.830
No, it's not mine.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.270
OK, thank you.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.680
So, let me recap.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.130
So, it's a practical
art insofar that purpose

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.010
is the driving force, why a
work is called into being.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.830
It is a public art in that
the presence of the work

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.780
constructs the space
for public appearance,

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.110
in the terms that Hannah
Ardendt described it,

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.330
the space for public appearance.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.880
So, historically, the
architectural [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.730
to create a theater for
action and of memory.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.630
And we can think that landscapes
and buildings, while framing--

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:39.120
becoming catalysts for
the process of memory,

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.220
serve to frame human experience.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.910
It is in the face of
catastrophes, historic traumas,

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:49.060
and human injustices that the
architects and public artists

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:53.070
public roles become increasingly
complex, problematic,

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.050
and, we only hope, necessary.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.160
We only hope.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.249
So, how do we position
ourselves when

00:41:58.249 --> 00:41:59.790
working with these
kinds of projects,

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:04.200
both as teachers, as
architects, as students?

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:04.950
Think of this.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.730
The word memorial--
it's historic role

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.400
is to preserve a
memory of the past

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.494
and provide conditions for
new responses in the present.

00:42:12.494 --> 00:42:14.160
This is one of the
maps that my students

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.280
do dealing with
Rhode Island slavery.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.550
So, think about this point.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:25.060
When we say, this is the
public space of the city,

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.910
we usually mean unofficial
monumental space, which,

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.470
using Walter
Benjamin's words, is

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:32.950
reserved for the celebration
of the history of the victors.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.284
Memorials and historic
landmarks usually

00:42:35.284 --> 00:42:36.700
celebrate that
memory of those who

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.180
have succeeded at the expense
of the forgotten memory of those

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.580
who have not.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.790
It forgets the nameless
and the vanquished.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:49.610
According to Hannah
Arendt, political equality

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.720
means visibility.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.600
Conversely, political
inequality and invisibility

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.019
go hand in hand.

00:42:55.019 --> 00:42:57.560
So when we think of institutions
of slavery and its legacies,

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.900
we should look at them
through the lenses of special

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.470
practices-- segregation,
migration, invisibility,

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.370
you know, feels--

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.200
you can think all
of the words that we

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.806
have used are related to
forms of spatial practice.

00:43:10.806 --> 00:43:11.930
But let's think about this.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:14.060
Democracy, as Claude
Lefort tells us,

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.980
is based on uncertainty
and legitimized

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.310
by the declaration of rights,
that is, the right to declare.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:22.670
Democratic public spaces based
on contestation, on debate,

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.560
on the appearance of others--

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.740
those others, who as an
enigma of a face that resists

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.160
possession, cannot be fully
known and can never be reduced

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.390
to content, as Emmanuel Levinas
philosopher would have said.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:37.970
So, I think to a large extent,
the success of democracy

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.440
and of public space can be
measured in its capacity

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.610
to encourage and assist in
the process of disruption

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.584
of that history of the victors.

00:43:45.584 --> 00:43:46.250
We can see this.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.882
Hopefully we'll do something.

00:43:49.882 --> 00:43:52.340
But I'm interested in thinking
about these kinds of notions

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.590
of public space in relation
to campuses, in relation

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.230
to speech.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.930
The National Museum
just opened in DC

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:02.030
means much more than a building.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.780
Our project in Nantes is more
than a riverfront landscape.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.040
There are significant
reinscriptions,

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.210
you know, of history and
memory in public life.

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:15.710
These projects are witnesses
to our actions in the present.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.290
Our actions in the present.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.750
So, philosophers
like Giorgio Agamben

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.450
have theorized the precision
of the witness in--

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.450
as the basis of an ethical
political relation insofar

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.120
as the witness answers to
the suffering of others

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.087
without usurping the
place of the other.

00:44:31.087 --> 00:44:33.670
That these were the history that
we were talking about before.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.100
Again, the witness answers
to the suffering of others

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.860
without usurping the
place of the other.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.080
So, there's a limit
to representation,

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.740
both in writing and
history and in speaking.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:49.190
So, witnessing is a way
of seeing and listening

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.890
that requires an acceptance
of vulnerability.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.920
It requires a renunciation
of the will to mastery.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.530
For us, trauma--
theories, [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.710
argues, to bear witness
to the truth of suffering

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:03.470
of a traumatic event is to
bear witness to that event's

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.660
incomprehensibility.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.450
This poses problems for
forms of representation,

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:11.630
teaching, writing, and creating
that attempts to respond

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.460
to the suffering of others.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.370
Perhaps we can only
breathe your name.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:17.692
Breathe your name.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:25.400
So, aesthetics should be
at the service of ethics.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.800
This is the attitude that I
try to bring to my teaching,

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.460
to my projects, and to our
collaborative work with artist

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:34.970
and professor here at GSD, and
involves an approach of art,

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:36.970
architecture and
landscape as mediums

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:40.670
that are capable of shedding
limited set of truth and values

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:44.210
in a space that is located
between question, publics,

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.590
and practices.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:48.850
Questions, publics,
and practices.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.366
So, when we dealt with
slavery in Rhode Island,

00:45:51.366 --> 00:45:52.990
the history of slavery
in Rhode Island,

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.690
with a series of design
studios that are geared,

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.930
as a pedagogical approach,
geared to create conditions

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:01.360
for students to encounter
stories that they cannot

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:01.990
fathom.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.600
And I want to think Jim Campbell
for all his fantastic work

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.560
and his help in setting
up these discussions.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.870
But these are an attempt
to construct and understand

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:15.250
history in our present and
think of a field of [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.080
called cultural sustainability.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.020
Think about how we deal
with present conditions.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.761
So, students worked
with mapping,

00:46:21.761 --> 00:46:23.510
students worked with
[? coast, ?] students

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.530
did memory boxes,
worked on texts,

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.180
created images like this one.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.270
This is Linden Place, the DeWolf
family mansion in Bristol,

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.430
Rhode Island and a montage
of Carl Walker's work.

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:38.350
But let's remember,
as Jim Campbell also

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:41.800
mentioned many times, 55% of
the mill workers in Rhode Island

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.210
by 1830 were children.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:44.890
So, we have to think about that.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.390
So, how do we think
about projects

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:48.400
dealing with the coast
of Rhode Island for today

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.700
and for tomorrow?

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.080
This is one of the concepts.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.090
These are exercises.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.310
I'll just go very
quickly on this.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:56.020
But the point that
I'm trying to make

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.080
is that students can
become cultural activists.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.510
And interdisciplinary work
is what matters in my mind.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:06.460
So, let me go quickly
to a couple of minutes

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:10.770
on the project for the Memorial
to the Abolition in Nantes

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.870
that we designed
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:17.860
And let's remind us that,
basically, today, slavery still

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.340
exists and does so globally,
despite the fact that it's now

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.080
globally illegal.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.440
And it's a question that
we have to ask ourselves.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.660
And this question
needs a reinforcement

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.660
in the consciousness and
emotional comprehension

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:36.100
of all of us and new
generations, as well.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.670
So [INAUDIBLE],
mayor, prime minister,

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:44.960
and our kind of direct sponsor,
let's say, of this project

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.010
wrote, "By building the memorial
on the banks of the Loire

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.890
in the heart of a city, at
the point from which the slave

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:53.860
trading [INAUDIBLE]
departed, we recalled

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.680
that the fact that the struggle
for freedom and dignity

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.100
for all human beings is a
fundamental cause inextricably

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.900
linked to our vision of society.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.050
The memorial hopes
to become a living

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:08.364
place for collective commitment
to the memory of the past

00:48:08.364 --> 00:48:10.780
and to continue our struggle
for recognition and promotion

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.800
of human rights."

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.130
This is a key point in
public space, in public life,

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:16.400
in public speech.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.550
How do we deal with our present?

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.170
So, the city has
created this kind

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:24.890
of [INAUDIBLE] that connects
the museum to the memorial.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:28.580
And you can see kind of an
aerial view of the site.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.260
And I'll show you, just to
give you a sense of scale,

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.000
this is Radcliffe,
and this is Harvard.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.100
Can you see the map?

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.080
Just quickly, this is
Radcliffe Quad, where we are,

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.070
and this is Massachusetts Hall.

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:42.650
This is the scale
of the memorial,

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:44.150
just to give you
a sense of scale.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:47.360
The relation is basically
the same distance, twice,

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.940
because you walk it
up above and below.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.850
So, the concept here
is that the city itself

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:55.250
has turned its architecture
and official public space

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:58.590
into a grand reinscription,
and I would say disruptive

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.490
in narrative intervention.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.590
They not only accepted this,
but embraced this concept,

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.990
that this space, beyond
its symbolic purpose,

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:07.580
it's useful to
commemorate the event

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.680
and to think about the present.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.150
So, we excavated.

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:13.122
We have found an
underground space.

00:49:13.122 --> 00:49:14.830
And we transformed
that underground space

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.000
on the coast of a river,
and we transform it

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.150
into a place for people to
come and read and to think.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:25.060
So, the project celebrates
the great rupture of abolition

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.170
with the thrust of a
great slanted plate, which

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.780
emerges through the
city and cuts the soil.

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:37.230
About five centuries of struggle
are inscribed in this glass.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:41.300
We also inscribed, kind of as
a form of an urban archive,

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.820
the names of 2000
expeditions from Nantes,

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.020
that departed from Nantes.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.184
And you see people looking
at them and walking,

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.350
and you see beautiful names.

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:49.860
You can see La Therese.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.110
There's a ship called L'Amour.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.960
Can you believe that?

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.220
The Three Marys.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.690
Another Love, you know.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:59.030
And they are all
navires negriers.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:03.560
So, I want to invite you
to think about the notion

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.120
that when we walk, we think.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.740
When we walk, we evoke.

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.420
And this is part of what we do.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.760
The stones themselves matter.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.680
And the place itself only can be
done if we really pay not only

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.290
respect and homage to the
people who suffered this story,

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.123
but actually we pay
homage to the people who

00:50:20.123 --> 00:50:22.790
made this possible, the
builders, the people who

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:25.970
put their hands and their
knowledge into making

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.440
our buildings possible.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.850
This is, to me,
what matters when

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.620
we do buildings, when we do
architecture anywhere we do it.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.260
How do we engage with others?

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.630
And that's an ethical dimension.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:39.080
So, cutting the concrete, going
underground and transforming

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.840
this, which is kind of
flooding with the water

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.540
daily, into a place
that can be inhabited,

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.230
creating a dam underground,
a complex structure.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:49.530
This space is about 150
meters below ground.

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:51.950
That's a football field
and a half length.

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:54.360
You know, and you see how
it goes and how it moves,

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:54.860
and you're--

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.260
I'm just getting
close to the finish.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.750
So, you see how this
glass transforms

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:00.760
the ground of a city.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.660
And very significant moments
of opening of the memorial.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.290
And I want to pay significant
homage to Madame [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.590
who's here and will
speak later, for her work

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:12.106
not only to support the
memorial and her speech

00:51:12.106 --> 00:51:13.730
at the opening of
the memorial, but her

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:16.550
work specifically
to bring justice,

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:20.270
to bring the law that is under
your name to the public eye

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.040
in France and in the world.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.791
So, that law is inscribed
in the memorial,

00:51:23.791 --> 00:51:25.498
or a good portion of
the law is inscribed

00:51:25.498 --> 00:51:28.490
in the memorial in a space that
looks at the Palace of Justice.

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:29.750
So, we have people visiting.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.740
We have people reading.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.500
We have people
inhabiting a space that

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.100
relates to the water,
a water that perhaps

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:39.260
is the only witness, somehow,
to the story, a water that

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.170
filters, a water that comes down
through the glass, a water that

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:45.240
marks words, words like freedom.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.340
And you see people coming.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.610
You see groups and schools
reading and writing

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:51.290
and thinking and discussing.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:53.660
And yes, these are my two kids.

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.426
And, basically-- and we have
Martin Luther King that is also

00:51:56.426 --> 00:51:58.550
inscribed there, and you
see emotion that happened,

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.520
and you see also revolt. A
moment two years ago when

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.300
Angela Davis was
visiting the memorial

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.530
as a kind of a
day of remembrance

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:08.270
of the abolition of slavery.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:12.980
So, I'm going to finish with
just one word, which is this--

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.380
When we did this project,
we didn't know the outcome.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.850
I mean, we knew
that space matters.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.516
And space and memory
are totally connected.

00:52:20.516 --> 00:52:21.890
So, when you look
at the memorial

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:24.890
from the Palace of Justice,
you see a line, horizontal line

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:26.270
on the ground of the city.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:28.670
But when you go to the
memorial, you see justice.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:31.790
You imagine justice, or perhaps
justice that needs to be done.

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:34.490
There's no inscription that
says, think about justice.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.830
But you do that, because we
can kind of construct it,

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.350
that relation, that dialogue.

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.400
And that dialogue
happens in space.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.950
And that dialogue happens
when I saw this woman visibly

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.497
emotional looking
at the memorial

00:52:44.497 --> 00:52:45.580
and visiting the memorial.

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.470
And I heard footsteps running.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:50.410
And I heard-- and I saw her son.

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:51.830
And I saw this embrace.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:55.990
And I want to close by saying,
using Levinas's citation

00:52:55.990 --> 00:53:00.350
of Dostoyevsky, who
also was interestingly

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:03.050
connected to James Baldwin's
understanding of memory,

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.560
as far as I read.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:09.580
So, Dostoevsky says all of us
are responsible of everything,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:13.877
of everyone before everyone,
and myself more than others.

00:53:13.877 --> 00:53:14.710
Thank you very much.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:18.049
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:29.870
- OK, this is a time for us to
ask one another any questions

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:32.400
that we may have about the
presentation or discuss it--

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.770
discuss amongst ourselves.

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:38.080
Anyone have anything,
or do we want to go?

00:53:41.165 --> 00:53:41.790
Yes, we can go.

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:44.523
Well, I just-- if you'd--
no questions of ourselves?

00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:48.790
Questions from the audience.

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:49.900
We're supposed to--
they're supposed

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:50.900
to be bringing us cards.

00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.870
Sure.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:00.840
What is the response?

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.270
Do you have any--

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:08.160
Julian, did you have any
opposition to the Nantes--

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.530
I mean, what was the order,
what was the nature of it,

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.600
and what was the strength of it?

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.550
And how did it come
from, If there was anyone

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:17.480
who objects to this idea?

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.400
- Well, there was strong
opposition, you know,

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.080
and if it was not for
the support of the mayor,

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.957
Jean-Marc Ayrault, this project
would have not been built.

00:54:25.957 --> 00:54:26.790
- What did they say?

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:28.035
I mean, what exactly--

00:54:28.035 --> 00:54:31.035
- Well, they said we don't want
the city to feel the guilt,

00:54:31.035 --> 00:54:33.730
you know, of its own
history, being the largest,

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.830
premier slave trading
port in France,

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:40.680
that basically grew
economically through the trade--

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.410
sugar that came to Nantes.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.470
So, one of the things was kind
of public guilt. You know, what

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.390
do we do with public guilt?

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:51.690
And the argument that was made
was more like recognition.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.090
And the mayor was extremely
supportive of that.

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:54.969
That's one thing.

00:54:54.969 --> 00:54:57.510
Second thing is that there was
a history before the memorial,

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.480
which was the Les Anneaux de
la Memoire, a very significant

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.680
exhibition that happened in 1992
that had about half a million

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.640
people visiting the Chateau
de Nantes, the duc de

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.240
Bretagne, basically to
visit and to understand

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.500
the history of its own city.

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.874
So, it seems to
me that there are

00:55:14.874 --> 00:55:18.210
some aspects of the
story that were extremely

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.300
important in the public eye.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.490
The people who did not
want this to happen

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.430
came from either
families or more,

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:29.100
I would say, right-wing
kind of areas

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:35.700
of the people in the city,
but once the memorial opened,

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.080
it was embraced.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.660
Once the memorial opened, it
was embraced by the people

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:40.260
and visited.

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:43.080
And everybody brings family
to visit the memorial,

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.770
and they see this as a unique
project, both in the city

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.370
and in France.

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.340
And I think-- I'm
personally very

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:54.180
moved to have been simply
be able to visualize this,

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:58.110
to visualize this project and to
inhabit that space that nobody

00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:00.852
has ever seen
before we opened it.

00:56:00.852 --> 00:56:03.060
It is a space that was
excavated that no one has ever

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.660
seen before, because it was just
simply residue of construction

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.060
of the ports.

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.760
- Dan, for the
people in Antigua,

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.320
have you heard any response
to them about the shield?

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.200
Or do you-- can
you sort of predict

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.480
what they might say about it?

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:28.490
- Well, they are
aware of the decision.

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:34.160
And they have copy of the
opinion and of your dissent.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.150
So, this is-- these
are people who

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:41.990
are really keeping track here.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:46.070
There's no question that they're
not interested in reparation

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:47.250
or anything like that.

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:49.010
That's not what interests them.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:52.340
What interests them
is some recognition

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:55.790
by this great
university that they--

00:56:55.790 --> 00:57:00.060
that we owe them a
debt, an historic debt.

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.870
And there are many possible
ways-- they don't have enough--

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:04.245
when I was down
there, there were

00:57:04.245 --> 00:57:07.710
lines to use laptop
computers in the library.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.590
There are not enough computers.

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:11.570
There's also not
enough fresh water.

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:14.870
And they're having problems
with their justice system.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.350
So, I mean, there are so many
things we could do to help.

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:22.210
- I think I should
probably say what

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:26.885
happened with the dissent,
what my rationale was.

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:33.200
You know, this whole question--

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.030
a lot of it comes
from, I mean, I

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:38.510
think the Royall must
fall was influenced

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:41.780
by the movement at Oxford
about Oriel College,

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.630
Rhodes must fall.

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:47.540
There was a statue of Cecil
Rhodes on top of Oriel College,

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:49.580
that I've been into
a number of times

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.960
and never knew he was up there.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.180
He was up pretty high.

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:56.000
And the thinking was
that this was an affront.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.120
And there was a student
movement on those lines.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.880
On our committee, we were
talking about the best way

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.030
to proceed.

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.900
And it's not that
I think that it

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.940
would be a matter
of erasing history

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:11.420
just by moving the shield.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.100
The idea I had was that--

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.380
and I talked in the dissent
about the difference

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.260
between a representation
of a person who

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.280
can't be reconstituted, someone
like Cecil Rhodes or John

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.790
Calhoun, a flag like
the Confederate flag

00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:30.890
that has a history and a past
and is so imbued with a spirit

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:34.790
that you can't, to
my mind, do away

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:37.400
with what that meant in
terms of the Confederacy

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.770
or what it meant in
its modern incarnation

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:43.490
with people taking it and using
it to oppose civil rights,

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:46.160
and when it's hauled out
and why it's hauled out.

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.460
That's-- it's not like that.

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.870
Three bushels of
wheat are symbols.

00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:53.480
When my husband and I
were here as students,

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.800
we had no idea what it meant.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.170
I thought, well, OK,
sheaves of wheat.

00:58:57.170 --> 00:59:00.440
Fertility, knowledge,
what is this?

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.940
We really didn't know.

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:08.180
And we had wheat pennies, but
wheat is a symbol of abundance

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:08.850
and so forth.

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:11.210
So, we sort of think, abundance
of wisdom or something--

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:12.020
you give it a name.

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:13.970
So, it could mean anything.

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:16.970
And it struck me that
since we were having

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:23.190
our centennial, what we could
do would be to have a ceremony

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:27.930
and reconstitute the law
school and the sheaves of wheat

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:31.200
to be in honor of
the people whose

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:37.040
labor gave Isaac Royall the
money to build the law school.

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:42.140
It's the power of law, what
we do is transformative.

00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:43.930
We could make the
symbol about whatever

00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:45.670
we want it to be about.

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:49.810
And my fear-- and to
have that powerful symbol

00:59:49.810 --> 00:59:53.890
there go across the world every
time Harvard Law School went

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.890
anywhere, I thought
would be powerful,

00:59:56.890 --> 01:00:01.240
that the people on the Royall
plantation would be remembered.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.700
And they would be remembered
in a way that would be living

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.930
and would go forward.

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:09.370
It's nice to have a
display in the law

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.960
school and the
special collections

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.290
and talk about it amongst
ourselves when students come.

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:16.030
But it would be
different to have

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.860
Harvard Law School linked--

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:22.450
Harvard Law School that under,
I think, the modern ages

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:26.647
of Harvard Law School when the
shield was actually used more--

01:00:26.647 --> 01:00:28.105
Harvard has a
tradition, law school

01:00:28.105 --> 01:00:30.310
has a tradition
of public service.

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:32.830
Many people were
involved in civil rights.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.470
That legacy could be
linked to the old legacy

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:37.150
to make something new.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:39.949
We're not bound by
the past in that way.

01:00:39.949 --> 01:00:40.990
So, that was my thinking.

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:44.020
It's not from any love or
respect of Isaac Royall,

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.990
but the Royall plantation was
not about Isaac Royall, to me.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:49.180
The Royall plantation was
about the enslaved people

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.500
who lived there.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.630
And that is the story.

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:54.340
And we could make
the story what we

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.250
wanted it to be rather
than being hostage

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:58.780
to Isaac Royall and his family.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.700
So, that was my thinking.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.290
Ceremony, reconstitute it, we
go forward with a different--

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:09.100
perhaps add the word, you
know, justice, for justice

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.700
to the shield and make
that association complete.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.830
So, that's what my thinking was.

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:18.805
It was not out of
isn't Royall great.

01:01:18.805 --> 01:01:20.080
- Can I just--

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.786
I just wanted to
add a few things.

01:01:21.786 --> 01:01:23.410
I mean, for one, I
think what is really

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:26.050
important is that
whatever we do,

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:28.570
that we don't take
the steps that we're

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:33.880
taking as a kind of an effort
to end the conversation

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:38.050
or to end our engagement
with this history,

01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:40.240
but really that we
commit ourselves

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.600
to a continued conversation
of this history

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.620
and a continued confrontation
with this history.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.130
And I think the worst
thing we could do

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:52.512
is kind of to cleanse our
institutions from this history

01:01:52.512 --> 01:01:54.220
and then to say, oh,
we took care of that

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.220
and now we don't have to
worry about it anymore.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.780
No, I think we need to
continue to engage with this.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.144
And then I thought,
maybe the experience

01:02:01.144 --> 01:02:02.560
of the city of
Nantes in some ways

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.760
is actually quite
relevant to our situation

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.810
here because, obviously, Nantes
is not a city that was, itself,

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.210
the site of mass enslavement.

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:15.160
It is not a city that
was characterized

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.500
by slave plantations.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.790
And it is a city in
which, presumably,

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:21.290
though I don't know
that for a fact,

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:23.290
but in which presumably
many people don't really

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:26.830
know anymore that it had
this very significant link

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:30.490
to the slave trade and
to Caribbean slavery.

01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:34.000
And that is, I think, quite
similar to the situation

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.980
we're facing here at Harvard.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.160
And so it would actually be
quite interesting to learn,

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.860
for us to learn from
the Nantes experience

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:47.090
to see how you can memorialize
this history on the one hand,

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:51.160
but also how you can encourage
a continued conversation

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.560
on that history and how
you, as Julian mentioned,

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.800
how you can persuade people
who are reluctant to engage

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.010
in this debate to eventually
persuade them to actually,

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:02.860
to engage these kinds of issues.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.930
I think there is a
lesson in it for us,

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:07.030
though I don't know exactly
what that lesson is.

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:08.860
- Well, one of the things that's
happening at the law school

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.860
now, we're going to be
encouraging people to do,

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.520
that since we have the royal
plantation, not very far, is--

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.800
and Janet Halley is doing this,
encouraging people to visit.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.390
I've been there.

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.210
And they do a great
interpretation,

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:26.200
very illuminating interpretation
about slavery in New England

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.730
and the lives of
the people there.

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:29.290
Maybe have our--
well, obviously,

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:31.360
have our students go there.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.070
I would like, as part
of what I thought

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:36.160
would go on after a perhaps
reconstituted shield

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.170
and re-dedication,
we would be, we

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:41.470
would have more of a connection
to the people in Antigua.

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:45.640
Maybe students, some connection
there to keep the thing going

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.490
instead of just letting it go.

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.760
But that-- any kind of
experiences from other places

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.217
should help inform us.

01:03:54.217 --> 01:03:55.300
Here's a question for you.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.330
Professor Beckert, thank
you for your presentation

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:01.090
and ongoing commitment to
justice for enslaved Africans'

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:02.320
descendants.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.630
You said the solution must
be economic and not just

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:06.460
rhetorical or symbolic.

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:10.690
Do you support reparations
to specific organizations

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:15.130
who build African
self-determination?

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:17.470
I'm sorry for putting
you on the spot.

01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:20.020
- OK, no, no, no,
that's just fair

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.790
because I ended my talk
exactly on this notion.

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:24.670
And honestly, that was
very much the subject

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:27.220
of our conversations
this morning.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:32.440
And yes, as I said, I think
it is important to acknowledge

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.220
this history.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.340
It is important to know
what that history is.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.170
And we have made some
progress in this process.

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:44.530
But I think we also need
to very much keep in mind

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:47.050
what was being said today.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:53.410
This is a history that is
about massive violence.

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:56.170
This is a history of racism.

01:04:56.170 --> 01:05:00.910
And this is also a history
of massive dispossession,

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:03.750
as was also mentioned
earlier today.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:07.870
And all of the violence, the
racism, and the dispossession

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.940
has--

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:11.890
it's not just of relevance
to understanding the past,

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:13.390
but it's also very
much of relevance

01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:15.820
to understanding the present.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.330
And in that way, I think
there is a material

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:22.560
dimension to this issue.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:28.570
And there is a need for
institutions, or perhaps

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.730
nations, who have greatly
benefited from exploitation,

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.880
racism, enslavement, and
dispossession-- there

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:43.000
is a responsibility to
address these past injustices,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.350
and also address them
in material terms.

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:50.020
What this exactly looks
like, I can't tell.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:54.550
But I think the importance
is to acknowledge this

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:58.330
and then to have a
conversation among a community,

01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:00.490
for example, a
university community,

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:05.950
to see what the proper steps
are that should be taken.

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:08.950
- Julian, and I
thought this myself,

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:15.800
what would a memorial to
slavery at Harvard look like?

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.010
And how do you
garner your support?

01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:18.631
- And how?

01:06:18.631 --> 01:06:19.130
Sorry?

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:21.617
- How do you garner
your support?

01:06:21.617 --> 01:06:23.075
The first one,
what-- if you were--

01:06:23.075 --> 01:06:25.400
what would a memorial
at slavery look--

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.520
at Harvard look like?

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:34.400
- I think it's a question
that I cannot answer,

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.530
because in order to conceive or
think through such an endeavor

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:43.530
once requires time
to think about it.

01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:47.060
And, to me, it's
not that I'm trying

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:51.720
to sort of short-change or sort
of shy away from the response,

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.860
is actually that there
may be other ways

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.270
in which one can think of this.

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:59.930
I am personally more
interested in the word memory

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.450
than in the word memorial
even though we have built it.

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:06.170
I mean to say that how we
think about memory, relation

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:08.290
to the past, but
memory is remembering.

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.050
You know, James Baldwin's
unfinished book,

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:15.010
Remembering This House, the
notion of remembering a house.

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:17.360
So, then the question
that I ask myself is,

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:24.480
if I can follow up with that, is
once we think of this history,

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:28.170
we somehow shed light over
a portion of a history.

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:29.590
You know, imagine a lamp.

01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:31.950
You don't shed light
over the totality

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.750
of the history of slavery.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:36.360
So, some aspects we can see.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.310
Some aspects we cannot see.

01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:42.450
But what we can see,
we cannot unsee.

01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:44.430
And this is an important
aspect of the question

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:46.380
of the lamp of memory.

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:50.190
And the question I ask myself
is once we see something,

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:54.480
it continues to be with us, so
how do we allow that what we

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.320
see to interrupt our
present, meaning how can

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.120
we hear the voices of
those who are not present?

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.020
How can we see these
faces that we see here?

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:10.920
But how can we understand that
the retrospective projection

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.560
of meaning is very complex.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.810
So, for me, one of the biggest
questions I ask myself,

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:18.720
and perhaps it's a question
for the university, perhaps,

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.479
is how do we deal with
our present conditions?

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:25.229
How do we invite our students'
interdisciplinary work

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:28.100
to consider the present?

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.870
Be that mass incarceration,
be that sex trafficking,

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:33.479
or human trafficking
today, which are

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:35.765
enormous and quite significant.

01:08:35.765 --> 01:08:37.890
So, if there was a kind of
a memorial I would think

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:41.279
of more like an institution
that is an ongoing project that

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:45.750
never finish, never finishes,
because perhaps to repair--

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:47.470
and I'm just going
to use a Hebrew word.

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:48.979
Tikkun is to repair.

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:51.294
Tikkun olam is to
repair the world.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.710
And perhaps we are
all here trying

01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:56.460
to do our best to
repair what we can.

01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.090
And to me, that's something that
I would like to think about,

01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:02.439
perhaps the university
could engage with.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:05.580
It's a conversation first.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.200
- Dan this was one
to you, but I might

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.359
be able to answer
part of this as well.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.760
To what extent do you
think the legacy of slavery

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.330
at HLS affected curriculum
or sustained the development

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:18.672
of legal thought at HLS?

01:09:18.672 --> 01:09:19.755
- That's a great question.

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:28.020
Basically, what happened
before the Civil War

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:31.859
is question of memory, with
the Confederate leaders

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:34.470
and the Union leaders
remembering being

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.910
taught very different things.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.220
The Confederate-- one of
the Confederate leaders

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.029
was held here in Castle Island
and wrote an irate letter

01:09:45.029 --> 01:09:47.160
to his law professor,
Emory Washburn,

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.000
saying that he didn't understand
why Emory isn't supporting him,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.760
because he, after all, was
fighting for the state's rights

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.180
that Emory Washburn taught
him in the classroom

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.060
at Harvard Law School.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:03.460
Washburn sent him a book,
by the way, to read.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:09.450
But in all seriousness, one of
the things that the Civil War

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:12.720
episode at Harvard
Law School shows

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.390
is that there was an effort,
a very deliberate effort,

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:18.090
by Charles Warren, and I know
you're the Charles Warren

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:20.700
Professor and I'm the Charles
Warren Visiting Professor,

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.800
but the first history
of Harvard Law School

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.280
was a three-volume
history, only one century,

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.230
written by Charles Warren.

01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:31.050
Charles Warren essentially
took the Civil War out

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:32.760
of the history of the school.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.760
And he did it very deliberately,
because at that point

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.790
the school was reaching
out to its Southern alumni

01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:41.520
and bringing in the former
Confederate officers who

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.710
survived and the former
Confederate leaders.

01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:46.920
There were 27 in Jefferson
Davis's government.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.340
They were now becoming leaders
of the anti-Reconstruction.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.890
They were becoming mayors
of Atlanta, governors

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:55.590
of South Carolina, and they
were being welcomed back

01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:58.620
into the fold at
Harvard Law School.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.500
Now, to do that,
you need to redefine

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.420
what the Civil War is about.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.160
And one of the
things that we have

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.990
been able to ascertain
through the letters

01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:09.510
and notes of the
students is that everyone

01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:11.850
thought that the war
was about slavery when

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.560
the war was being fought.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.360
So, it was slavery that
drove the Union students

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.030
to volunteer.

01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:20.430
It was slavery that was the--

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:23.610
that caused the fights that
went into Harvard Square.

01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:27.570
They emptied the classroom
fighting each other.

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.100
It was slavery.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.250
Suddenly, it-- after
the war is over,

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.930
it becomes convenient
to redefine

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.690
the war about something else.

01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:40.020
States' rights, theories of
constitutionality, you know,

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:42.720
now we've resolved
it, so we can move on.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.790
And let's forget
about segregation.

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.860
Let's forget about racism.

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.540
And I'm afraid that
one of the, on my mind,

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.990
one of the worst chapters
of the history of the school

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:57.240
was the 20 years under Langdell,
when Langdell essentially

01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.321
wrote out racism
and civil rights

01:12:00.321 --> 01:12:01.737
from the curriculum
of the school.

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:06.920
- Here's a question for
both of us, I guess.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:12.488
What are the next steps at the
law school beyond the new seal?

01:12:12.488 --> 01:12:12.988
Well.

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:18.350
OK.

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.860
All right.

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.610
I'm the moderator.

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:20.894
I'm not supposed to--

01:12:20.894 --> 01:12:21.878
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.900
Well, there's still a
lot of student interest

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:31.850
in bringing about a more
inclusive curriculum, as they

01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:32.990
describe it.

01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:37.130
There are discussions
about that, discussions

01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:41.450
about a diversity of
professors, in terms of the way

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:43.550
they teach the
kinds of subjects,

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:47.420
bringing race more
into discussions.

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.480
Very often, in a
contracts case or just

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.120
to make an example of civil
procedure or other things,

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:55.604
there's a surface,
what the issues are--

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:57.020
there are surface
issues involved,

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.210
but there are
racial aspects of it

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:01.835
that student would like to
be brought into the mix.

01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:03.710
It's sort of difficult.
There's some thinking

01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:06.682
it's difficult to talk
about race in classes.

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.390
Some people are
uncomfortable doing that.

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:12.950
I teach criminal procedure,
which, race, obviously,

01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:15.110
is all-- is shot throughout
the Fourth Amendment

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:17.300
jurisprudence, and
actual jurisprudence,

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.970
but the actual
practice of policing.

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:23.510
So, it isn't-- it's not a
difficult thing in my subject

01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:24.260
area.

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:27.510
But there's much more
talk about pedagogy,

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:29.426
how to raise these
kinds of issues.

01:13:29.426 --> 01:13:30.800
There's a lot of
things going on.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.870
I think the shield controversy
sort of came and went,

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:39.460
but the continuing discussion
about transformation of law

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:43.680
school is very much there.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.260
Do you have any
thoughts about, any more

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.060
about what you're seeing?

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.580
- Well I agree with all
of what you just said.

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:54.250
I mean, the students
yearn for context.

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:56.130
They-- it's one thing--

01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:57.960
what we have gotten
from Langdell

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.290
is a formal curriculum that's
still remarkably the same

01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:04.260
as it was in the 1880s.

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.270
You know?

01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:09.840
And the legal formalism
stripped context

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.840
from the life of the law.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.840
And I think the students
yearn to have it brought back.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.120
And many of our colleagues
are working hard

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.090
on this, this issue to make the
legal doctrines contextualized.

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:26.700
I also think that the
representation on the faculty

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.160
is important.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.870
We're approaching 20%
Asian-American enrollment.

01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:33.760
At the moment, there's only one
tenured Asian-American faculty

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.410
out of 91 or 92.

01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:41.160
And I think that the
students want a faculty

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.660
that they can identify with,
that are their role models.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:50.910
And that involves gender, but
involves ethnicity and race

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:51.684
as well.

01:14:51.684 --> 01:14:52.350
- I mean, it's--

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:54.120
I will say one
word for formalism.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.860
I mean, part of
the answer to that

01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:00.840
is that there's a concern
on the pushback on sort

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.890
of changing curriculum or
doing things too differently is

01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:10.920
that there's a benefit, at
least first year, to focusing

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:18.240
on analysis, focusing on law,
understanding law as it exists.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.450
And certainly context is always
going to be important there,

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.010
but you don't want--

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:25.080
I mean, I'm channeling
other people.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.480
You do not want a
strictly politics

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.930
class, where people get to
talk about current events

01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:31.440
or whatever.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.750
And it's-- that's the
fear, that you go too far.

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.250
And so, what we're
trying to do has

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.530
been to balance the
sort of, the case

01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:45.720
method and the Socratic
method to accommodate

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.840
new understandings and different
perspectives on things.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.270
And a lot of people
want to do it.

01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:52.890
We have faculty
workshops talking

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:56.840
about how to teach difficult
courses, State v. Man,

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.790
a very famous court
case involving slavery.

01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:04.740
How do we talk about
these kinds of things?

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:07.934
And cautionary notes
about it's difficult,

01:16:07.934 --> 01:16:09.600
because there might
be some students who

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.474
are upset about that.

01:16:10.474 --> 01:16:12.150
There is no-- the
difficulty is there's

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:16.180
no one viewpoint about
all of these things.

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:20.940
One of the critiques
of this notion

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:24.060
of my idea of having the
shield as something that

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:26.550
is sort of a living symbol
is that some people don't

01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:29.490
want to be reminded of that.

01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:32.859
And why should African-Americans
be reminded of that?

01:16:32.859 --> 01:16:34.650
And I have a different
perspective on that,

01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:37.590
but there is no one viewpoint.

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:39.090
And you have to
consider all of them

01:16:39.090 --> 01:16:40.920
and try to come to
some sort of balance.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.800
So, it's going to be--
it's an interesting time.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:49.050
I mean, it's challenging, but
that's what we're here for,

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:50.420
to solve problems.

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:51.930
That's what the law
school is about.

01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:54.210
And I think we're going
to rise to that challenge.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:58.240
Did you say, have something--
oh, Alexandra, if you may.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.030
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:01.529
- I just wanted to make a quick
comment, just from a student

01:17:01.529 --> 01:17:02.160
perspective.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.620
I'm now a student at Harvard
for the second time in my life

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:08.100
and consider myself
very lucky to be one.

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:10.560
But I do think there is a
desire from students, as well,

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.792
to have kind of like a
mission-driven education.

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:17.250
Like you go to
Harvard, and there's

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:21.350
this emphasis on how do
you use your education

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:23.532
to be good, to better society.

01:17:23.532 --> 01:17:24.990
And I think sometimes
when you move

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:27.060
from the college to the
professional schools,

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.690
that mission-driven sense
gets a little bit lost.

01:17:30.690 --> 01:17:33.390
And so maybe one
practical way would

01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:36.720
be in our professional
schools to kind of emphasize

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.490
that there is--

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:41.030
our professional schools are
also mission driven, right?

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:42.690
Like being at the
business school,

01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:46.540
you should have a sense of
going out there and bettering--

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:49.300
using your education
to better society.

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.080
So maybe that's another actual--

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.100
- Yeah, I would say
for the law school,

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.050
from the time I was
there, its public service

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:56.790
has been at the heart of it.

01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:59.190
We have time for
one more comment.

01:17:59.190 --> 01:18:02.970
- Can I make one quick
comment on this issue?

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:06.300
When you asked me about
what would the memorial look

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.956
like, you know, I was a bit
caught off guard, but the--

01:18:08.956 --> 01:18:10.080
- You thought of something.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:10.630
- Yeah.

01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:11.130
It's good.

01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:12.090
I appreciate that.

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:15.570
But the concept that I'd like
to share with you is this.

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:20.190
I just took a cursory
research at the Harvard series

01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:22.169
of schools in
terms of their work

01:18:22.169 --> 01:18:24.210
that they are doing with
questions of present day

01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:25.230
slavery.

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:28.190
And there are many
initiatives happening today,

01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:30.900
at the school of health,
at the Kennedy School

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.000
of Government, the
Harvard Law Review,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.850
you know, and you
can keep going.

01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:38.079
And this is happening,
as well, in the world.

01:18:38.079 --> 01:18:39.620
There are many
initiatives happening.

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.090
So, one, going to the
question of mission-driven,

01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:47.030
would it be possible to conceive
that this institution may help

01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:51.290
frame a new 21st-century
abolitionism movement,

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:52.990
or abolitionist movement?

01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:54.890
Help contribute to that?

01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:56.340
What would it look like?

01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:57.710
I have no idea.

01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:58.490
Why?

01:18:58.490 --> 01:19:01.460
Well, there are a lot of
people today in conditions

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.740
that are illegal, but
they are still slavery.

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.880
So, the question to me
is not only the past.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.590
Yes, the past, of course--

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:11.790
we need to keep working at it.

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:13.870
But how do we deal with
our present conditions?

01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:17.110
And that will help
better society today,

01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:18.487
just as an offer.

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:19.820
- That's a great note to end on.

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.290
Thank you very much Thank you.

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:23.090
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:26.440
