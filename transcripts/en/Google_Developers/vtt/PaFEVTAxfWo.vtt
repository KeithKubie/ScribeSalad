00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.280
ERIC KOLEDA: Hello, and welcome
to "Google Apps

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.970
Unscripted." My name's
Eric Koleda.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.910
DAN LAZIN: And I'm Dan Lazin.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.450
ERIC KOLEDA: And we are from
the Google Apps Script

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.700
Developer Relations team here
with another edition of our

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.370
show, where we are unscripted.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.630
And we basically just cover
recent news and events in the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.100
Google Apps Script world, show
you some cool stuff you might

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.170
not have known about, and then
answer questions live from the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.780
audience via Google Hangout.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.580
So if you are watching us live
on YouTube, if you head over

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.130
to the googledevelopers
.google.com/live page, you can

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.940
see a link at the top that
says Join the Hangout.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.243
Come on in, ask some
questions, and

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:13.240
we'll have a good time.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.530
All right.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.770
So we've got some news
to cover first,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.460
before we get to questions.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.510
One of the big things is just
yesterday me and Dan pushed

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.670
the giant red button to launch
some new documentation, or a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.010
refresh of our documentation.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.010
So you can find our
documentation, as always, on

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.147
developers.googl

00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:32.710
e.com/apps-script, Apps Script.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.550
And if you could take a look
here at the screen, you'll see

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.880
that there's a lot of changes
that have come through in this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.040
recent documentation change.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.020
So one of the big ones is our
homepage got completely

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.405
redesigned.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:48.150
Dan here did a great job
of the design work.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.210
And you can see that it's
much more inviting.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.910
But separate from just being
a better-looking design, it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.200
really helps people get to the
content they need faster,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.660
right, Dan?

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.940
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.010
I think there actually will
probably be some people who

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.370
are watching us in the future
on this page right now,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.780
because you scroll down to the
bottom of the page there,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.990
you'll see one of the things
we brought in is recent

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.800
release notes and a playlist
of all of our "Apps Script

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.790
Google Developers Live" app.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.100
So it's just like this one.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.480
So it's possible that we are
inside this page right now,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.190
sort of very meta, pointing
over at the release notes,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.390
pointing out the new design.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.820
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.620
So this is great.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.520
DAN LAZIN: It's blowing
my mind.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.990
ERIC KOLEDA: Getting the video
there, getting the release

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.000
notes, that really helps you get
some information upfront.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.340
But I also really love these
buttons that jump right into

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.360
quickstarts and tutorials.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.540
A lot of people come to our
documentation and they want to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.170
just get started.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.870
They don't want to spend a lot
of time reading a book.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.980
They want to start coding
right away.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.040
They want to do something
interesting.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.150
And I feel like these four
little buttons you got here

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.910
really help direct users
in that direction.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.190
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.430
And I think we allow for a lot
of different ways for people

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.320
to get engaged with
Apps Script.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.420
For one, as we talked about,
there's the videos

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.380
right on the page.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.280
There's a sort of sense that
Apps Script is a continually

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.300
developing product, by the
frequently updated release

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.920
notes there.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.430
We've got these quickstart
tutorials that Eric was

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.660
talking about and some more
intermediate tutorials that

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.090
experienced developers will be
quite comfortable jumping into

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.060
straight away.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.610
And then for people who really
just want to start coding and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.580
get used to the autocomplete and
sort of see what kinds of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.090
methods they can drill down to
within each of our sort of

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.310
primary classes, that Start
Scripting button right at the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.030
top of the page just pops open
the script editor and--

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.570
ERIC KOLEDA: Away you go.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.400
DAN LAZIN: --away you go.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.990
ERIC KOLEDA: That's great.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.410
Some people, even the tutorial,
they're like, ah,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.090
get out of my way.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.300
They just want to start typing
code as fast as possible.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.675
We give people that option
right there.

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:35.930
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.380
And I think one of the other
great things, if you take a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.210
look at the sidebar off to the
left, the sort of main

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.680
navigation, we've reorganized
this.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.930
It's got all the same content
as before, well, with an

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.840
exception that we'll talk about
in a moment, but it

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.470
organizes them in a way that I
think sort of represents the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.860
progression that people take
through learning Apps Script.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.910
We start out with some
quickstart guides, get into

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.340
some of those intermediate
tutorials.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.590
And then once you feel like
you've sort of found your

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.820
feet, if you start reading this
Guide section, you'll

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.830
find deeper information on each
of the major services,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.360
best practices, that
kind of thing.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.720
And then once you're really
flying and you just want the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.340
reference day-to-day, that
Reference section breaks out

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.790
our major services into three
categories, allows you to look

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.730
up all of the just straight
API documentation, and get

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.380
straight to coding.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.630
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.540
That's something new here is
that before we kind of had all

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.130
of our services for the
most part lumped

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.400
into one big category.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.230
The list was long.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.670
It was hard to know
what did what.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.940
Now this first section of Google
Apps Services, these

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.350
are kind of like your core
powerhouse services.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.890
These are the things that allow
you to deeply integrate

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.660
with Google Apps, pull data
out, put data in.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.816
Those are really kind of like
why you come to Google Apps

00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:42.380
Script a lot of times.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.910
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.150
ERIC KOLEDA: And then these
other guys, here Advanced

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.990
Services, these are some
services that have a kind of a

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.930
different way that we integrate
with, a little bit

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.410
more for advanced users.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.310
And then Script Services, these
are all the tools you

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.760
need to build scripts, not the
end goal, but the tools.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.950
So I really like that new
structure as well.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.540
And while we're talking about
reference documentation, we

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.690
also as part of this launch did
a complete overhaul of the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.640
generated reference
documentation that we have.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.630
DAN LAZIN: This is the least
flashy change here, but

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.960
probably the single most
important thing.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.140
I mean, you'll look at this
front page from time to time,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.920
but you'll be looking at
this stuff constantly.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.340
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.140
That's true.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.310
You know, I spend most of my
time, even as an experienced

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.560
Apps Script user, constantly
referring back to these docs.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.840
What is parameters?

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.360
What do they mean?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.580
What do they do?

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.860
And so we've done
some changes.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.610
One is that the actual
documentation that we're

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.240
presenting to you
is different.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.080
We've gone through, added a lot
of new samples, clarified

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.190
some language, put in
some limitations.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.740
So it's really a bit more
robust and complete.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.990
And the second thing is we did
a little organization change

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.790
to the left nav here
as well, deeper in.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.420
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.390
Now you'll see what we call sort
of the entry point, like

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.070
the class that you use to
access the rest of the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.190
service, is always the very
first thing in the category.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.180
There are a few services that
have multiple entry points,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.580
but anyway, they're always
sort of right to the top.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.130
So you know that when you're
going to use Maps, you're

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.250
going to start with this
Maps link at the top.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.710
Then below that, you get the
subclasses of Maps that allow

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.560
you to access the different
Maps objects and all the

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.420
methods that belong to
them are kind of

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.540
contained within them.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.400
And then the sort of lesser
children, the cousins maybe,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.980
are classed as interfaces
or enums

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.840
below the Classes section.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.190
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.770
So it's kind of organized top to
bottom in kind of like what

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.720
things are you most likely
to refer to, right?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.240
You're probably going to really
want to refer to the

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.530
Maps top level a lot, then maybe
the classes to get some

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.980
information.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.910
And then enums and interfaces
less often you're going to

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.550
want to go down there
and poke around.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.780
So it's really a good way to
kind of once again take what

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.900
is often a very large bit of
documentation that we have and

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.780
make it a bit easier
to digest.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.950
DAN LAZIN: Apologies to those
people who for the first few

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.110
days are going to be a little
bit concerned or confused

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.860
about where to find things
they used to find.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.430
We know that changes are
always disruptive.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.900
But we think in the long term
this will provide a better

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.120
experience for you, certainly
a better experience for new

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.160
users, and really help grow the

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.390
Google Apps Script community.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.120
ERIC KOLEDA: That's great.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.590
I'm really excited about
these changes.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.660
And I hope everybody else is
enjoying them as much.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.410
So let's talk about some other
things that have happened

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.310
since the last "Apps
Unscripted." So a little bit

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.410
of other news is you might have
seen a blog post that

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.160
went out on the Google
Developers blog in general,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.355
but also on our own blog about
how we're retiring a few Apps

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:20.790
Script components.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.940
So there's going to be a few
small pieces of the UI

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.050
service, UI app, as it's
sometimes known, a few little

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.200
pieces that either never worked
correctly or that just

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.670
have better replacements.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.880
Those are being kind
of deprecated and

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.120
then eventually sunset.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.540
And I guess the bigger news
of it is the GUI builder.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.730
If you haven't used it before,
it was kind of the drag and

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.080
drop way to build
user interfaces.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.290
It wasn't quite complete.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.470
It didn't have all
the widgets.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.560
And we just thought that it
wasn't really servicing as

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.150
important a need, and we just
have better ways to build UIs

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.500
now, especially with the
launch of HTML service.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.036
So go to our blog.

00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:00.050
You can check out this blog
post for more information.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.540
And there's a Sunsets page in
our documentation that talks

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.020
about when these will go away.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.540
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.200
Basically, you've got six months
from a few weeks ago,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.520
so mid-September is when these
guys are getting turned off.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.920
Depending on which component
we're talking about, they'll

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.670
either cease to function
entirely in September or still

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.510
remain accessible to existing
scripts but not be accessible

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.700
to new scripts.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.810
So make sure you take a look at
that and see if there's any

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.600
transition you have to do
for your existing guys.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.000
ERIC KOLEDA: That's great.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.140
And just to be clear, because
we have had a little bit of

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.799
confusion, UI app, the UI
service as a whole, is not

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.684
going anywhere.

00:08:34.684 --> 00:08:35.039
DAN LAZIN: That's right.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.590
ERIC KOLEDA: A few small parts
that were kind of sitting in

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.919
the corner unused, those
are being cleaned away.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.780
But the whole of it
is staying there.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.610
Feel free to continue
to use UI app.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.530
We sometimes recommend people
to look to HTML service if

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.800
you've never really
given it a shot.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.990
We think it has some
nice benefits.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.860
But UI app will remain,
so rest assured.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.170
Another bit of news, we had
another blog post about--

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.580
"Hack to School" was
the name of it.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.420
So this was great.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.520
One of our colleagues, Arun,
who you've probably seen on

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.270
these programs that we've done
many times, he helped

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.080
participate in an event
here in the New

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.950
York City area that--

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:09.722
DAN LAZIN: I don't know if
we call New Jersey the

00:09:09.722 --> 00:09:10.940
New York City area.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.190
ERIC KOLEDA: The metro area.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.130
It invited both coders and
teachers to come together to

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.200
create solutions
for education.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.710
So teachers and administrators
have a lot of problems that

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.660
they deal with.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.510
It's a very complex working
environment.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.300
And they, a lot of times,
utilize Google Apps to kind of

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.890
handle this, spreadsheets
and pass data around.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.730
And it's really quite useful.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.070
But with Google Apps Script,
they can get a little bit

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.410
further and make these systems
that they build

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.830
that much more powerful.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.830
And so this was a really great
event where they got people

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.160
together, made it a competition,
and I think came

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.240
up with some good results.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.590
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.130
It's really amazing how widely
the education community has

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.930
embraced Apps Script.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.490
It's I think an accident
on our part.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.930
It's not like Apps Script
is really tailored

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.020
for that use case.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.140
I think we often think of our
main users being like

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.060
businesses, enterprise,
kind of workflow guys.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:14.790
But in some ways education users
have that constraint

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.860
even magnified, because you
get really very different

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.230
classes of users between the
sort of administrator,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.845
teacher, and the students
you're delegating to.

00:10:21.845 --> 00:10:22.650
And it's really interesting.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.485
And I mean, there's also the
fact that we're free.

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:24.800
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.640
Being free always helps.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.620
DAN LAZIN: Always helps
in education, yeah.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.590
ERIC KOLEDA: So check
out that blog post.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.150
There's some really cool stuff
that they came up with.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.130
And if you're interested in
hacking for education, I'm

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.640
sure they could use
more volunteers.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.185
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:36.980
ERIC KOLEDA: So reach
out there.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.280
Well, now we've got through
some of the news.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.740
Let's jump into release notes,
which is our last

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.180
little bit of news.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.660
As you know, we put out release
notes for every little

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.450
Apps Script release.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.640
These releases kind of roll
out in the background.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.800
There's no big version
numbers.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.210
You don't actually see
them happening.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.490
DAN LAZIN: We'd be a very,
very high version

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.270
number if we did.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.310
ERIC KOLEDA: We would.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.120
But when the releases do come
out, we create documentation

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.310
around what changed.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.260
And I think since our last
"Google Apps Unscripted,"

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.415
there hasn't been a terrible
amount of change.

00:11:01.415 --> 00:11:03.490
As you can see, on the 18th we
did make a small change to the

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.980
UI where the action Publish to
Gallery is now called Submit

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.830
to Gallery.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.350
So we have a script gallery that
allows people to take a

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.730
spreadsheet script and stick
it in a place where other

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.460
people can download it
and use it, kind

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.070
of a sharing mechanism.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.010
We just wanted to make sure
people didn't confuse that

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.670
with publish as a web app,
since that's kind of a

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.850
completely different flow.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.060
So that was one small
change we made.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.210
And then more recently,
we did a couple bug

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.670
fixes you can see here.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.260
One of the ones of interest is
range.mergeAcross and merge

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.050
and mergeVertically.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.220
There's different ways to merge
cells in a spreadsheet.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.340
And we had these three methods
and they didn't quite work

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.230
quite right.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.635
I think they kind of overlapped
in behavior.

00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:45.180
It's all sorted out now,
though, right?

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.890
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.110
I've tested it.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.642
It's just like you'd expect.

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:50.580
It's one of those things.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.170
You get a release note, it's
like this now works correctly.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.870
What more is there to say?

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.190
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, that's
what it's meant for.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.080
So yeah, those are some
of the release notes.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.330
That's about it as
far as news goes.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.290
So we're really interested in
seeing if anybody in the

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.510
Hangout has any questions.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.430
Let's jump in.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.450
Do we have any Hangout
participants with

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.850
questions for us?

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.770
DAN LAZIN: Hey, look.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.020
Our friends.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.350
Do we have any--

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.660
volume?

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.820
HARRY: I've got one question.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.070
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:16.790
Hi.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:17.100
HARRY: Hello.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.510
My name is Harry [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.330
from the Netherlands.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:19.470
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.810
Hi, Harry.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:21.350
HARRY: Hi.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.970
A while ago I wanted to
share a spreadsheet

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.780
script via the gallery.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.570
But I noted it was only possible
with a personal

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.356
account, and not just a
Google Apps account.

00:12:34.356 --> 00:12:37.300
Is that still the case,
or has it changed?

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.670
ERIC KOLEDA: Yes.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.140
I believe that still
is the case.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.780
I think it's a limitation
that they didn't---

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.420
I don't know if it's across
the board or if it's a

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.450
domain-specific setting.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.810
But I guess there was some
concern that you may write a

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.750
script that is internal
information and that you

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.460
accidentally share it to the
public without realizing it,

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.610
and how that could be
somewhat damaging.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.260
So I think it's kind of a safety
mechanism that you

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.520
cannot submit to the
gallery from one

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.480
of your domain accounts.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.930
DAN LAZIN: You've discovered
the workaround, thankfully,

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.301
all on your own.

00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:09.680
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.170
So we do have some people who
when they want to share a

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.530
script will do it from a
separate personal account.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.293
And that's probably the best
thing you can do right now.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.231
DAN LAZIN: Thanks for
the question, Harry.

00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:24.694
Any other questions live
via the Hangout?

00:13:24.694 --> 00:13:25.450
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.000
I am trying to share.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.630
I have an issue that I want to
separate my user interface

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.170
from the back end, or the
service I think you'd

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.530
probably call it.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:48.130
And I'm looking at using content
service and JSONP.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.710
I've got to the point where
you get a terrible warning

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:58.110
saying if you do this you're
going to expose yourself to

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.560
spoofing attacks and
things like that.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.590
I understand that.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.275
I wonder, there are obviously
ways to get

00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:08.590
better protection here.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.860
And I wondered whether
you have a general

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.905
guide to doing that.

00:14:13.905 --> 00:14:14.340
ERIC KOLEDA: Gotcha.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.050
Yeah.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.040
I think I saw your question
pop up in

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.930
the Moderator before.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:19.680
Yeah.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.170
As he was mentioning, we have
a warning in our content

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.090
service documentation about
how when you use a JSONP

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.080
service, or set up content
service to act as a JSONP

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.340
service, there's a little
bit of danger in

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.440
that you are taking--

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.910
if you publish a script to run
as you, and now you're making

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.950
it accessible via just a
JavaScript include, you're

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.760
potentially allowing other
people to access your data,

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.210
because that script, there's
no authentication mechanism

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.890
built into the content service
and being able to ask people

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:50.480
to authenticate.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.810
So because of that, if you open
it up publicly so anybody

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.940
can use it, then someone else
could look at your web page

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.990
code, take that same bit of
script, and then all of a

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.600
sudden access your data
on their own web page.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.160
So there is a little
bit danger there.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.870
There is no, right now, way to
do it in an authenticated way.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.120
We don't have quite the
mechanism set up for that.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.190
So using the content service
which JSONP, it's possible.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.270
But I would say--

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.090
DAN LAZIN: You want to be
careful essentially what type

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.310
of data you expose to it.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.550
Certain types of things you're
going to be OK with.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.620
Others not so much.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.760
It's really the sort of thing
where the developer wants to

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.120
make a sanity check against
what kinds of

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.020
data they're exposing.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.520
ERIC KOLEDA: Right.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.060
Does that help?

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.970
Are there other questions
around that?

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.930
MALE SPEAKER: Not really.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.165
You do provide the
authentication if you run as--

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.070
if you're looking at it
running within the

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.320
domain, if you like.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.990
What I was looking for was
something that would actually

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:04.500
support a secondary
authentication, like your

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:11.345
standard mechanism
with two-phase--

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:15.550
you know, getting an SMS
message, for instance, when

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.870
you log on.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.150
If you did that at the
application level and stored

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:28.300
that as a cookie, that
would provide that

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.470
anti-spoofing mechanism.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.050
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.530
I mean, there are probably some
things that we could do

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.940
on the product side to make this
kind of more robust and

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.670
better meet your needs.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.690
I don't think that's
anywhere--

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.580
you're not going to see
that in the near term.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.330
If there's something that you
can code up that you think

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.970
will help with your
authentication and security

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.170
issues, that's fine.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.380
But as far as like a product
feature, I don't think you're

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.470
going to see that in
the near term.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.120
So I would say feel
free to use JSONP

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.140
for certain use cases.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.440
But I think maybe for others,
a different integration

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.518
mechanism might be a better
way to go about.

00:17:04.518 --> 00:17:05.349
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.550
What would that be?

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.300
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, it
kind of depends.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.490
You mentioned wanting
to separate your UI

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.290
from your back end.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.349
I mean, we're working on
improving our HTML service

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.339
documentation.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.460
We have different people on our
team working on creating

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.900
some new samples.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.250
And if you've used the HTML
service, it actually has a

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.260
really nice library built into
it, so that when you're in the

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.745
front end of your application,
the HTML, JavaScript, that's

00:17:29.745 --> 00:17:33.360
running client side, you can
call google.script.run and it

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.900
does an RPC call back to
the back end, does some

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.470
processing, gets the result.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.620
And then you can display
it via jQuery

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.430
or some other library.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.720
So I find the separation there
is actually really nice, where

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.860
the HTML service page that you
serve to the user is really

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.770
kind of just mostly focused on
the UI and handling the data.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.310
And then your back end GS file
Apps Script code is focused

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:01.220
purely on doing some
processing.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.590
DAN LAZIN: And you can sort
of strictly control what

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:09.880
functions are accessible to
google.script.run and that

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.900
code will only run while you're
on script.google.com.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.420
It's a really nice sandboxing
that takes care of

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.700
most of it for you.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:17.955
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:18:17.955 --> 00:18:20.640
So I would say you can
use JSONP as a tool.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.510
But as more of a solution, I
think HTML service is probably

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.964
there as a better solution.

00:18:25.964 --> 00:18:26.770
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.650
ERIC KOLEDA: Great.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.005
Other questions live before we
jump into the Moderator?

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:34.960
DAN LAZIN: Sounds like a no.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.336
ERIC KOLEDA: All right.

00:18:35.336 --> 00:18:36.090
That's a no.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.980
Let's keep going on the
Moderator, then.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.720
So we have some questions
here on the Moderator.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.210
I'll take a look.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.220
So one of the first ones here
is short term rate limits on

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.760
JDBC calls.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.650
And is there a difference if
you're using our regular JDBC

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.830
connector versus the
CloudSQL connector.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.140
And can we increase them?

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:59.530
So if you go to the URL
script.google.com/dashboard,

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.980
this is where we will display,
first of all, whether we have

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.570
any sort of outages that we know
about, but also a lot of

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.390
our quotas.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.460
So the only restriction I could
find on JDBC are these

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.990
two here, which is how many
connections you can make on a

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.480
per-day basis.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.080
Now there also are--

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.700
see, there's like some
shorter term limits.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.580
I think it's like one connection
per second.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.850
So if you open a connection,
you can do a lot of work

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.360
within that connection and I
don't think you're going to

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.900
run into any problems there.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.400
But it does seem like you want
to not open lots and lots of

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:28.840
connections.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.560
So open a connection, get one
field, close it, open another

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.240
connection, get one field,
close it, right?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.290
If you keep it open, I think
you probably won't run into

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.360
the one-second limit.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.910
And I'd also be surprised if
you ran into 10,000 a day.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.940
So take a look at
those limits.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.960
If for whatever reason you have
a use case that's really

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.070
important and one of these
numbers is holding you up,

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.500
file something in our
Issue Tracker.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.580
And we can take a look and
see if we can change it.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.950
But for the most part, I think
those are probably in line.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.310
And if you just don't
open too many

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.830
connections, you'll be OK.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.110
So the next one we have here,
that's the JSONP that we

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.880
already talked about.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.522
Let's talk about the HTML
service, then, from Anatoly.

00:20:08.522 --> 00:20:10.830
I don't know if I
said that right.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.520
So that's a lot of questions
packed into one here.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.110
We're asking about keyboard
events, disabling the

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.200
right-click, opening up new
windows, setting the fixed

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.450
element position.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.760
There's probably a lot of
different answers, because

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.370
there's a lot of different
questions.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.670
One of the things about HTML
service, I guess just to set

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.960
the board, is that you are using
kind of like for the

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.180
most part standard HTML,
JavaScript, and CSS.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.140
The only limitation is that we
kind of put a little layer in

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.810
between what you write and what
the user gets for safety.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.580
So you'll notice that your web
apps served off of HTML

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.056
service serve off of
script.google.com.

00:20:49.056 --> 00:20:53.010
Google.com, that little part of
the URL has a lot of power.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.300
And so we need to be extra
careful that we don't let

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.750
things through that
can be damaging.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.830
So we use a sanitization engine
called Caja, that we've

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.300
talked about before on this
program, that will go in and

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.520
make sure that what you're doing
isn't dangerous, that

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.500
you're not accessing anything
you shouldn't access, you're

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.950
not breaking out of places you
shouldn't break out of.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.680
So that engine today does create
some weird limitations.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.080
I know, Dan, you've looked a
lot into the Caja world.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.650
And there's definitely
some things that

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.030
today you can't do.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.590
I know there's stuff
about setting code

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.160
directly in your HTML.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.180
I think they usually
want it not

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.820
attached to the HTML element.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.890
So there are some limitations.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.690
And we're working better right
now-- we actually have a

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.760
project underway that should
make this a lot easier.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.390
And hopefully I'll be able
to show you that soon.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.780
But for the meantime, for the
most part the way you would do

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.940
something in Apps Script HTML
service is the way you would

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.240
do it in any HTML.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.390
DAN LAZIN: Really the rule of
thumb right now is try to do

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.870
it in the normal way.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.550
If it doesn't work in the
normal way, occasionally

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.630
there's a workaround.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.790
For the most part, if it doesn't
work that's because

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:56.540
Caja's getting in the way.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.950
If you sort of pop open your
browser's inspection panel and

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.840
see if you've got any console
log warnings or see if you can

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.190
see how Caja has rewritten your
page, you might be able

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.830
to find the source of the bug
and work around that.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.610
But a lot of the times, really
the advice is try to do it in

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.320
the normal way.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.550
If it doesn't work, it might not
work for now until we get

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.360
these improvements to the way
that Caja and HTML service

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.870
integrate that Eric's
talking about.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.050
And more news on that for
you hopefully soon.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.580
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.050
And the thing is, why you run
into these problems with Caja

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.050
is that Caja is very strict.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.740
There's the JavaScript
specification, the ECMA

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.400
specification, and it
goes by the book.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.260
And it turns out that a lot of
browsers are really loose.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.085
They'll allow pretty much
anything through as long as

00:22:44.085 --> 00:22:45.580
it's close.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.090
And so because of that, some
code that may have worked in a

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.460
browser and that someone posted
on Stack Overflow or

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.820
some other forum that says,
here's a solution, that may

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.100
not work by the strict rules
of the specification.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.530
And so a lot of times you'll be
running into that problem,

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.440
where we're just being more
strict on code than a browser

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.920
normally would be.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.900
HARRY: Can I ask a question
related to that?

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.530
ERIC KOLEDA: Sure.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.850
HARRY: Until now, I've mainly
used the UI app, but the HTML

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.860
service looks quite promising.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.230
But I understood it's
using HTML4.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:19.762
Can we also use it with HTML5
and Bootstrap, for example?

00:23:19.762 --> 00:23:20.230
ERIC KOLEDA: Yes.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:21.560
Bootstrap is a popular
request.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.760
DAN LAZIN: It can use certain
elements of HTML5.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.730
I believe if you actually take
a look at the page that's

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.120
served, it is actually
technically an HTML5 doc type.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.670
We sort of describe it as
HTML4-like today, because

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.450
although serving an HTML5 page
removes a lot of the APIs that

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.480
are available exclusively in
HTML5, your web workers and

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.760
local storage, that kind of
thing, but for the most part

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:56.675
your HTML5 elements should be
available and accessible and

00:23:56.675 --> 00:24:01.110
they should work as you would
expect them to work in HTML5.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:05.560
So for example, I think you can
use the canvas element,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.250
which is an HTML5 thing.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.810
It's been around in HTML
service for a while.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.450
To be honest, one of the
problems with using HTML

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.740
service these days is the
documentation is a little bit

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.210
disorganized.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.590
We have a new version of that.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.560
It's almost ready to go.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.790
And if you've got a project
where you think HTML service

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.510
would be really good right now,
we all learned it from

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.810
the existing documentation
but it was a bit of pain.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:27.820
You can do that.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.020
But if you can wait a few weeks,
if it's just a sort of

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.770
experimental project where
you're waiting, then maybe we

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:39.190
can get you some new, cleaner
documentation soon.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.540
HARRY: I'm curious to give
it a try before that.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.460
DAN LAZIN: Yeah.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.170
It's all there.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.100
All the information is there.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.650
It's just you'll be jumping
around a bit, that's all.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.330
HARRY: Yeah.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.650
Good.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:48.980
ERIC KOLEDA: And for Bootstrap
in particular, I know people

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.665
have been asking for it.

00:24:50.665 --> 00:24:52.880
And we're going to make a
stronger effort in the future

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.910
to kind of take these high
profile, critical libraries

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:01.356
and setups and make sure that
they work, because it seems

00:25:01.356 --> 00:25:03.090
like a lot of people, they want

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:03.870
Bootstrap from the beginning.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.080
They don't want to have
to fiddle around.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.845
DAN LAZIN: JQuery, for example,
is very popular with

00:25:07.845 --> 00:25:09.210
HTML service.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.930
It's extensively tested.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.800
We ensure that both jQuery
and jQuery UI work

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.210
right out of the box.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.360
If you take a look, there's
actually some canonical links

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.660
for jQuery and jQuery UI that
are listed in our HTML service

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.602
documentation that'll speed
up your app a bit.

00:25:26.602 --> 00:25:27.050
ERIC KOLEDA: Great.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:27.480
HARRY: Thank you.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.490
ERIC KOLEDA: No problem.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:34.420
Any other live questions while
we're here in the Hangout?

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.300
DAN LAZIN: Back to
the Moderator.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:35.830
ERIC KOLEDA: All right.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.740
Off we go.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.180
Feel free to chime in later.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.000
So the next one here we have is,
"Is it possible to use the

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.120
and-and and or-or--" or just
ampersand-ampersand and

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.650
pipe-pipe "operators
as 'and' and 'or'

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.750
in Google Apps Script?

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.720
I've tried to do it and I can't
make it work nor find

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.200
the documentation."

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.260
Well, you can.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:56.310
So Google Apps Script at its
core is just JavaScript.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.880
DAN LAZIN: And JavaScript at its
core is just ECMAScript.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.275
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:25:58.275 --> 00:25:58.670
Exactly.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:25:59.210
DAN LAZIN: It goes
all the way down.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.240
ERIC KOLEDA: All the way down.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.845
And so yes, because JavaScript
supports these, they work in

00:26:02.845 --> 00:26:03.980
Apps Script.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.380
Unfortunately, I don't know
why you were having

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.120
problems with it.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.090
But do some more testing.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.610
Try it out.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.250
Sometimes when I'm testing
things I'll actually try to

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.530
run the code in my
browser first.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.100
So like Google Chrome, the
browser, has a great little

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.840
console where you can
type in JavaScript

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.700
code and see it run.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.160
It's a really fast way to kind
of like see whether or not a

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.660
piece of code runs.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.790
And so try some stuff
out there.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.580
But yeah, in general anything
that's part of JavaScript or

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.460
ECMAScript should
work just fine.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.960
Great.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.690
Last one.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.180
I've got a couple more here.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.970
"Are there any plans to allow
set page-level permissions for

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.220
Sites?" Page-level
permissions--

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:41.325
ah.

00:26:41.325 --> 00:26:41.430
Yes.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.280
I think there is a feature
request for this

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.430
in our Issue Tracker.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.910
The feature is that Google
Sites you can either set

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.770
permissions on the whole site
or you can enable per-page

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.380
permissions.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.060
And currently in Apps Script we
don't expose those per-page

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.270
permission settings.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.040
But I understand that they are
popular, so I think there's an

00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.770
open issue for that.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:00.390
DAN LAZIN: Request we can
pass on to the team.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.150
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.590
And so if you lodge your
interest there, that will help

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.050
us better prioritize it.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.210
DAN LAZIN: One thing that we say
almost every time in "Apps

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.410
Unscripted" here is when you've
got a feature request,

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.290
please file it in our
Issue Tracker.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.520
And if you see an existing
feature request that you think

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.560
would be really useful for you,
make sure to add a little

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.800
star next to it.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.200
That's really what we use
as our priority list for

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.020
community-requested feature
development.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.430
If you look back in the release
notes a couple weeks,

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.130
there was one week we had a
spate of new features that we

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.270
added that were pretty much
all community requests.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.280
Someone on the team finished up
a little project they were

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.730
working on and got really
excited to address some of

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.340
those pending things.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.270
So we have a lot of users.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.580
We can't address everybody's
requests.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.060
We just don't have enough
engineering time and the

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.670
product would grow to be sort
of unwieldally large.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.010
That's not a word.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.180
But we do take a look at
everything that comes in and

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.220
prioritize them based on the
community votes they get.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.640
So get out there and tell
us what you want.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.090
ERIC KOLEDA: Sounds great.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.630
Yeah.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.310
It's good for you.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.520
It's good for us.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.320
Everybody wins.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.770
DAN LAZIN: One of the funny
things about Apps Script, I

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.630
always say, is that we're always
really surprised at the

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.490
things that people are doing
with it, for example, the

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.010
popularity of Apps Script
in education.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:15.450
And the things that we find
people are doing from looking

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:19.650
at Stack Overflow or our Issue
Tracker sometimes diverge from

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.510
what we thought people would
use features for.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.360
And the only way we can
learn about those is

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.966
for you to tell us.

00:28:26.966 --> 00:28:27.422
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:28.790
That's a good point.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:29.010
All right.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:29.810
So we're just about
out of time.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.240
Let's address one more question
here that has some

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.060
votes, which is someone saying,
"I'm terribly--" it

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:34.810
just popped up.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:35.770
And I lost it.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.340
"I'm terribly disappointed
by the decision to

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.660
discontinue UI Builder.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.950
Do you have any plans to replace
it with a drag and

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.110
drop UI builder for
HTML service?

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.120
There are some good ones out
there, but something that

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.320
integrates with Google
Apps Script

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.120
would be good." Yeah.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.740
I mean, I've actually heard
some other people already

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.100
request this, kind of.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.320
And I think we're going to start
testing out whether some

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.160
of those ones will work
with HTML service.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.590
I think in general, it might
lead to a solution where we'll

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.820
recommend or ask you to use
another drag and drop HTML

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.120
service and then bring that
into Google Apps Script.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.170
It may not be just built into
the UI as it was before.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.830
But we're trying to make more
and more HTML service behave

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.080
like normal HTML.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.810
So if you can find a tool that
works in normal HTML, we want

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.790
to support that.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.720
And I think that could be
another great way to kind of

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.830
get some of the same features
of GUI Builder but now using

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.580
HTML service, if we can find a
popular one, ensure that it

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.686
works, and make sure that our
HTML service just behaves like

00:29:29.686 --> 00:29:29.940
normal HTML.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.221
DAN LAZIN: That would
be great.

00:29:31.221 --> 00:29:31.650
ERIC KOLEDA: All right.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:32.320
Well, that's about it.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.370
That's all the time we have
for this episode of "Apps

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.040
Unscripted." Thanks everyone
who joined us

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.390
live and asked questions.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.070
Thanks for watching us
live on YouTube.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.650
And this recording will be
available shortly for anyone

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:42.490
who missed it.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.690
Dan, thanks for joining us.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.220
DAN LAZIN: Thank you
for having me.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:46.750
Thanks, everybody.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.630
ERIC KOLEDA: And we'll
see you next time.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.940
Good bye.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.230
DAN LAZIN: Good talking
to you.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:30:22.372
