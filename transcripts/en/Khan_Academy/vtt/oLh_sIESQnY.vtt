00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.760
Let's see if we can
add 9.087 to 15.31.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.770
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.040
and try to do it on your own.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.050
So I'm assuming you have
tried to do it on your own.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.880
And now let's see how we
could actually tackle this.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.890
Now, one thing I want to
point out, some of you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.431
all might have seen
these numbers all

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:24.710
lined up and immediately want
to say, hey, 7 plus 1 is 8,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.790
and 8 plus 3 is 11, carry
the 1, et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.654
And if you did that, you
would be making a mistake.

00:00:31.654 --> 00:00:33.070
Because, you see,
right over here,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.950
these decimals aren't lined up.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.110
Here, if you did that, you would
be adding the 7 thousandths

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.310
to 1 hundredths.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.800
You would be adding
0 tenths to 5 ones.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.630
You would be adding 9 to 1
tens, or essentially, this

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.780
is a 10 right over here.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.840
So the places would
be all mixed up.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.920
So what you need to do is to
actually align the decimals

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.660
so that your place
values are aligned.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.050
So what you want to do is
you want to align things up.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.610
So we could write 9.087.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.380
And then we want to
align the decimal.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.570
So let's align the decimal.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.500
This is what has to match up.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.750
And this is going to be 15.31.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.000
And this should hopefully
make sense to you as well.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.145
This is 9 point something
plus 15 point something

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:22.450
so it's going to be--
If you add 9 to 15,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.410
it will be 24 point something,
give or take a little bit.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.340
And you see that here.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.220
Here you have a 9 plus the 15.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.690
So you have lined up the
appropriate place values.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.530
And now we are ready to add.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190
It's a good idea to start
with the smallest place value,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.270
so if you have any extra
at a certain place,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.080
you can bring something
into the next place value.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.590
So here you say 7 plus--
well, this is 7 thousandths.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.350
It's in the thousandths place.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.260
And you might want to-- you
say, well, what do I add it to?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.870
There are no thousandths
right over here.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.300
And you're right.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.341
There are no thousandths.

00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:55.600
So we could literally
write 0 thousandths.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.000
So 7 thousandths plus 0
thousandths is 7 thousandths.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.570
8 hundredths plus 1
hundredth is 9 hundredths.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.759
0 plus 0 tenths plus
3 tenths is 3 tenths.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.400
We got our decimal.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.660
Then you have 9 ones
plus 5 ones is 14 ones.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.080
Well, 14 ones is the same
thing as 4 ones and 1 ten.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.540
So we'll carry that
1 right over there.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.740
This is just 1 ten plus
4 ones, which is 14.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.960
And so then finally, you have
1 ten plus another ten is 2.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.220
So we get 24.397.
