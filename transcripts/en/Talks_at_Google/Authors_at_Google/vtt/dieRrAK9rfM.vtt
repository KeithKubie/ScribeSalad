[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.950
JOHN: Welcome to Google.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.600
CARY ELWES: Thank you.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.700
Thank you for having me.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.199
JOHN: Yeah.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.554
So the movie was
released 27 years ago.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:21.220
CARY ELWES: Yes.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.150
JOHN: But I just spent
the entire last week

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.385
quoting this all through
work with my colleagues

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:26.010
and everything.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.299
Like, I'm literally quoting
it, and then 20 feet away

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:29.590
someone else starts quoting it.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.506
CARY ELWES: Right.

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:32.256
JOHN: And so, I mean,
it was a huge movie,

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:33.839
and it just got
bigger over the years.

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.310
So this book is amazing,
especially for me as a fan,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.290
because reading
it, you learn more

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.480
about the characters,
the situations, even

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.585
untold stories, and
just fall in love

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:46.794
with the movie all over
again, but in greater detail.

00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:47.710
CARY ELWES: Thank you.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.660
JOHN: So it's amazing.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.040
But tell us first
off, what inspired

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.480
you to write about
your experience

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.860
on "The Princess Bride?"

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.110
CARY ELWES: Well, myself
and the rest of the cast

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.090
always get asked, was it as
much fun to make as it looked?

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.860
And I always tell
people, it was more fun.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.500
So I wanted to write a
love letter-- to the film,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.080
to the filmmakers--
because it was

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.210
such a joyous journey for me.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.830
And so I thought,
I'd better write it

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.801
before my memory starts
to fail me, you know?

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.300
And so, yeah.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.670
So it's a love letter.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.170
Yeah.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.750
JOHN: Awesome.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.250
Awesome.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.930
And it all started,
in your book you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.660
say it all started with a
note that read "Important."

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.180
CARY ELWES: That's right.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.550
JOHN: Right.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.210
So can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.835
CARY ELWES: OK.

00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:38.650
Well, I was filming a little
independent film in Berlin

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.240
at the time.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.720
It was a Finnish-German-British
co-production,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.390
which should tell
you how much money we

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.390
needed to make the film.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.280
And it was about the
time of Chernobyl,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.460
which was a terrible
nuclear disaster that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.889
happened in Russia in 1986.

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:57.930
And I'll never forget it.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.430
We were filming
outside of Helsinki.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060
We had a German
production manager,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.269
and he called a crew meeting.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:04.726
And he said,
[GERMAN ACCENT] I have

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:06.600
some good news,
and some bad news.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.372
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.120
And so we were all
listening very intently.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.960
And he goes,
[GERMAN ACCENT] there's

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.840
been a bit of an accident.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.510
And we were thinking, what?

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.660
The catering truck
broke down or something?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.470
And he said, [GERMAN ACCENT]
there's been a bit of a spill.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.042
But the good news is
it's 800 miles away,

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:31.000
und the wind is blowing
in the other direction.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.658
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.370
And the bad news is that
we've heard from the farmers

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.220
that some of the
cows may be affected,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.720
so you might not
want to put milk

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.780
in your coffee for the
next couple of weeks.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.520
So, you know, today,
the production probably

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.030
would have been shut
down for safety purposes.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.440
But back then-- luckily no was
injured or affected by it--

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.390
but we continued shooting.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.340
And I went back to Berlin, and
I got a call from my agent.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.630
And the note did
say "Important."

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.360
So I called her
back and she said,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.190
Rob Reiner and his
producing partner

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.430
Andy Scheinman would like
to fly to Berlin to meet

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.900
with you to talk to you
about "The Princess Bride."

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.940
Now, I had read the book when
I was 13, and I loved it.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.494
So I knew that a lot of people
had tried to make the film.

00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:28.410
So I was very excited.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.750
I knew Rob Reiner.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.094
I knew him from
"All in the Family."

00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:35.010
And of course a little
film that he did called

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.290
"This is Spinal Tap."

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.205
Yeah.

00:03:38.205 --> 00:03:40.330
And so I didn't know what
I was more excited about,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.290
the idea of Meathead or
Marty Dibergi showing up.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.610
So I was very excited.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.015
And they came to my hotel suite,
and they were just fantastic.

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:54.450
I was so overjoyed to meet them.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.560
And I ended up doing a
Fat Albert impersonation.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.376
I don't know how that came up.

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:03.520
I was so nervous.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.830
I ended up trying
to make-- I thought,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.397
I'll make the director laugh.

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:08.980
I'll try and impress
him with how much

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.320
I know about
American pop culture.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.270
And for some reason
I blurted out

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.177
a Fat Albert impression,
which is rotten.

00:04:16.177 --> 00:04:17.260
You don't want to hear it.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.579
It's dreadful.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.339
JOHN: I was going to say, you
don't want to do it again?

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.170
CARY ELWES: You really
want to hear it?

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.977
JOHN: I kind of do.

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:22.666
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:24.290
CARY ELWES: This
won't play on YouTube.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.738
I just went-- hey, hey, hey!

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:31.530
Like that.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.172
And that did get a
laugh out of Rob.

00:04:35.172 --> 00:04:35.880
I thought, great.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.760
I'm in good shape.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.700
That's a good start.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.880
JOHN: And you were pretty
young at the time, right?

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.754
CARY ELWES: I was 23.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.490
And then he pulled out
a script out of his bag,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.015
and he said, you
know, I just want

00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:49.150
to hear you say a few lines.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.130
So I thought, oh, boy.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.290
Here we go.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.020
And I read the scene.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.160
I read the scene
where Westley explains

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.990
to Buttercup in the fire swamp
how he became the Dread Pirate

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.120
Roberts.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.100
And I only got through
a couple of lines

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.486
and Rob held up his hand,
he goes, that's enough.

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:05.360
I thought, that's it.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.680
It's done.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.702
It was a nice meeting
while it lasted.

00:05:08.702 --> 00:05:10.410
So much for the Fat
Albert impersonation.

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:15.415
And he said, you
know, we're meeting

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:18.890
a couple of other
actors, and we'll see.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.870
We'll let you know.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.453
And usually, as an actor, when
you hear that, you're thinking,

00:05:22.453 --> 00:05:23.910
well, that's it.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.800
Right?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.600
But fortunately for me, about
four days later my agent

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.320
called back and she said,
are you sitting down?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.460
I went, what?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.730
She goes, yeah.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.190
I went, no way.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.130
And she said, yeah.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.360
They like you for the part.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.060
And I couldn't believe it.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.800
So I said to her, you can go
ahead and forge my signature

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.251
on the contract, because
you better do it quickly

00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:47.500
before they change their mind.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.999
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.291
You know, so yeah.

00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:49.790
Yeah.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.664
JOHN: That's awesome.

00:05:50.664 --> 00:05:52.290
That's awesome.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.530
Now, in this movie, and
with all your movies,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.444
you're known for your
amount of preparation.

00:05:56.444 --> 00:05:58.860
Like, you spend a lot trying
to get ready for these movie,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.820
right?

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.612
And so I just watched
the movie again,

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.070
and I noticed that
this is actually

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.660
a pretty physically
demanding movie.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.074
The sword fighting scene
alone is really impressive.

00:06:08.074 --> 00:06:08.990
CARY ELWES: Thank you.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.870
JOHN: And you refer to
yourself in the book

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.607
as not much of an
athlete, though?

00:06:12.607 --> 00:06:13.440
That's not my words.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.100
That's what you said.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.540
CARY ELWES: Yes.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.332
Those are my words.

00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:17.456
JOHN: And so, I mean, tell
us about the preparation

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:18.230
for this movie.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.140
CARY ELWES: Well, yeah.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.990
I love preparing for roles.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.650
I do.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.060
I really do.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.930
I think that's half
the fun, actually.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.250
For me it's like a continued
education, you know?

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.470
I've had a very
blessed career, really.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.680
A lot of it, all of it,
really, due to this film.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.640
And so, you know, I get
to study NASCAR driving,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.510
or when I'm playing
an astronaut,

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.760
I get to study how a command
module works or a LEM,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.070
or something like that.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.460
And for me, it's so
exciting, the preparation,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.450
because I get to
learn about things

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.860
I never would normally have
the chance to learn about.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.700
Of course, these are the
days before Google, folks.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.370
You know?

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.150
This was the days when I
had to go to the library

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.840
to look stuff up,
early in my career.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.330
But now, thanks to
your company, it's

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.660
made the work of
actors a lot easier.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.080
Because you have so much
information at your fingertips

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.120
nowadays.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.310
And so that's wonderful.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.080
Yes.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.110
For the sword fighting.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.950
I am not much of an athlete.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.420
I wasn't growing up.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.510
And I had very little-- in fact,
little or no fencing training

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.675
before the movie started.

00:07:28.675 --> 00:07:31.050
I had gone to acting school,
and they teach you, sort of,

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.210
very basic stuff, but I
didn't remember any of it.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.730
And so one of the
things Rob Reiner

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.556
said to Mandy and
myself and Chris Guest

00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:42.930
at the beginning
of the movie, he

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.075
said, I don't want stunt
guys, or stand-ins,

00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:49.050
or doubles for the
sword fighting scene.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.980
I want you guys.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.660
It was a bit
daunting, because it's

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.160
described as the greatest
sword fight in modern times.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.360
OK.

00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:00.250
And Mandy was like, yeah.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.570
Sure.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.070
Great.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.770
You know?

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.630
So I was standing next to him,
I'm going, yeah, fine, sure.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.140
That sounds great.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.400
But fortunately for us, he
hired two of the greatest sword

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.760
masters available in
England at the time.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.280
One of them was
Bob Anderson, who

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.440
was an Olympic fencer for
Great Britain in the 1950s,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.950
and the other was Peter Diamond.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.610
And they had both incredible
resumes, these guys.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.690
They'd worked with Errol Flynn,
and with Burt Lancaster--

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:33.010
and in fact, Bob Anderson did
all the light saber sequences

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.549
for the "Star Wars" movie.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.980
And Peter Diamond helped
choreograph them with him.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.370
And also, Peter was the
Tusken Raider on Tatooine

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.410
for you Wikipedias out there.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.760
Sorry to mention
the other company.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.170
But anyway, so we got the
very best of the best.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.640
And they were
amazing, these guys.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.540
And I'll never forget
the first meeting

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.730
we had with Bob Anderson.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.560
And he said, guys,
I won't lie to you.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.300
We don't think we
have enough time

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.030
to make you proficient
right-handed.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.340
Forget left-handed.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.800
So we've asked the producers to
move the sword fight sequence

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.430
to the very end of the film.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.920
And we've got a lot
of work ahead of us.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.960
So they worked us hard.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.130
We worked eight hours a day
before we started shooting.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.990
And then once we
started shooting,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.040
these guys were off
camera the whole time.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.740
So when Rob yelled
cut, they would just

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.800
grab us, Mandy and I, or
Chris, and go and work

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.160
on the sequence.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.230
And we had to learn each
other's parts as well.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.850
Because they said, we
don't want any accidents

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.590
on the film, and the
best way to avoid

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.260
that is if you guys learn
each other's parts as well.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.060
So we had double the workload.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.946
So while the rest the cast
was sitting around and having

00:09:52.946 --> 00:09:55.700
a good time and
hanging out on the set,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.060
Mandy, myself, and Chris were
out there practicing all day.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.740
So it was definitely
rigorous, but we got into it

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.390
and it was fun.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.850
JOHN: Did you do the scene where
you roll down the mountain?

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.640
CARY ELWES: No, that
was a stunt double.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:05.880
JOHN: OK.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.650
CARY ELWES: Thank goodness.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.940
Yes.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.440
Yes.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.914
JOHN: Could have been tough.

00:10:10.914 --> 00:10:13.080
So one character, when we're
talking about the movie

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.190
characters, that
really also captured

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.960
everyone's hearts
was Andre the Giant.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.970
CARY ELWES: Yes, Andre.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.429
JOHN: Tell us about
the first time

00:10:20.429 --> 00:10:22.720
you met him, and your first
scene with him in the film.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.720
CARY ELWES: OK.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.890
Well, Andre was really
a beautiful guy.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.170
And he always had a
smile on his face.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.232
He really was a gentle giant.

00:10:31.232 --> 00:10:32.940
He would give you the
shirt off his back.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.523
There would be enough
for five people.

00:10:34.523 --> 00:10:35.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.410
But he would give
it to you willingly.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.750
And he was just adorable.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.710
He was just-- just a sweet man.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.430
And yeah, my first day shooting
with him was quite eventful.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.770
I had to shoot the
scene where we're

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:54.990
on the parapet of Florin Castle
after Miracle Max's cabin.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.960
And I'm mostly
dead, and I come to.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.487
And I think Fezzik has a
line where he goes something

00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:04.820
to the effect of-- and I'm
sure someone could correct me

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.532
if I'm wrong-- but
something to the effect of,

00:11:07.532 --> 00:11:09.740
I wonder how long it'll take
before the miracle takes

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.010
effect.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:16.530
And Montoya says, your
guess is as good as mine.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.014
And then I come to, and
I say, I'll fight you

00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:21.680
both together, I'll
beat you both apart.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.960
Something like that.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.900
And Andre's line
was, [DEEP VOICE] I

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.000
guess not very long.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.790
Like that, right?

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.810
Well, he didn't get
to the word "long"

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.255
before he emitted one of
the most ginormous farts--

00:11:35.255 --> 00:11:37.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.770
--any of us had
ever experienced.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.310
And I got to tell you, we've
all experienced giant farts

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.360
in our lives, you know?

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.730
I'm sure we've all
pointed the finger.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:52.900
But this was a giant's
fart, the sonic resonance

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.130
of which was just
truly magnificent.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.460
I can't even tell you.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.240
And we all grabbed the set.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.280
A lot of us thought it was an
earthquake going on, you know?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.350
And I looked over
at Andre, and he

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.040
had-- besides-- I
told you he already

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.980
had this wonderful
smile-- now he

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.665
had a smile of blessed relief.

00:12:10.665 --> 00:12:12.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:12.304 --> 00:12:14.330
It was just like that.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.082
And for some reason he had steam
coming out the top of his head.

00:12:18.082 --> 00:12:19.960
And it was such a
weird combination

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.450
between this fart
that was going--

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.230
it lasted about 15 seconds.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.920
It was a long time.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.950
The fart, the steam,
the whole thing.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.390
I just couldn't look at him.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.390
I looked over at the
sound man, and he

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.060
had taken off his head set.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.360
It was like that.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.340
And what's so
funny in England is

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.952
that when someone passes
gas, they're all so polite.

00:12:41.952 --> 00:12:43.410
They're all, sort
of, looking away.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.820
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.390
Like that, you know?

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.730
It's not like in America
where it's like, dude?

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.664
Was that you?

00:12:49.664 --> 00:12:52.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.190
And you could hear a pin drop
after this titanic fart ended.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.860
And Rob was the first
one to break the silence.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.080
He said, hey Andre.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.970
You OK?

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.694
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:07.814 --> 00:13:08.730
And I'll never forget.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.771
Andre didn't miss a beat.

00:13:09.771 --> 00:13:11.755
He goes, [DEEP VOICE]
I am now, boss.

00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:14.119
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:15.535
And it just bought
the house down.

00:13:15.535 --> 00:13:17.690
I mean, it was just incredible.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:18.190
Yeah.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.945
First day with Andre.

00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:20.510
Yeah.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.550
JOHN: He called
everyone boss, right?

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.050
CARY ELWES: Everyone
boss, which was

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.430
hilarious for a guy who's
7 foot 5", you know?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.710
But he was just a sweetheart.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.626
He really, really was.

00:13:28.626 --> 00:13:30.920
I miss him to this day.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.487
JOHN: And you talk about, also,
that, you know, no accidents.

00:13:33.487 --> 00:13:35.820
You had prepared really hard
for no accidents to happen,

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.444
but some did happen on set.

00:13:37.444 --> 00:13:38.110
CARY ELWES: Yes.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.810
JOHN: And one in
particular was egged on

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.630
by Mr. Andre the Giant.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.700
CARY ELWES: Yes.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.250
Well, Andre couldn't
get around very easily

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.420
while we were on location.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.910
We were filming in an area
called the Peak District, which

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.140
was very well named.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.662
I'm sure you can Google
it if you don't know it.

00:13:55.662 --> 00:13:58.916
And it's very beautiful.

00:13:58.916 --> 00:14:02.260
And Rob wanted to shoot on the
top of a lot of these hills,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.840
so he could get the full
effect of the vista.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.080
And Andre couldn't fit in
any car, let alone the van

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.860
that took the cast and
crew up to the set.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.980
So the production manager came
up to him and said, Andre,

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.170
how do you get around
at home on your farm?

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.920
And Andre said, [DEEP VOICE]
I drive an ATV, boss.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.300
Now, finding an ATV,
an all-terrain vehicle,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.972
in England, in
1986, was definitely

00:14:25.972 --> 00:14:27.680
a challenge, I think,
for the production.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.190
But I think we
found the only one.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.669
And again, you can Google it.

00:14:33.669 --> 00:14:34.960
There's a picture of him on it.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.650
It's wonderful.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.400
It's a three-wheeler--
a little red thing.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.152
It looks like a
tricycle under him.

00:14:39.152 --> 00:14:40.170
It's marvelous.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.860
And you've never seen
a giant move so fast.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.900
I mean, he was zooming
around in this thing.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.370
He loved it.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.059
And he would zoom
up to me on it.

00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:49.100
He would come up and go--

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.140
[MOTOR]

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.910
[DEEP VOICE] Hey
boss, you like my toy?

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:52.942 --> 00:14:54.560
I go, Andre, it's very nice.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.110
It looks like a lot of fun.
[DEEP VOICE] It is fun,

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.609
you know?

00:14:56.609 --> 00:14:57.730
You want to try it?

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.320
I go, no, Andre,
I don't think so.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:02.820
[MOTOR]

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.150
And he'd fly off again.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.487
Second day.

00:15:07.487 --> 00:15:08.361
[MOTOR]

00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:10.260
[DEEP VOICE] Hey boss.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.320
You like my toy?

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.230
I'm like, yes, Andre.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.075
I've told you.

00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:14.575
It's lovely.

00:15:14.575 --> 00:15:15.595
It's wonderful.

00:15:15.595 --> 00:15:18.530
[DEEP VOICE] You want to try it?

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.850
No, thank you.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.560
That's marvelous.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.420
I enjoy watching you on it.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.770
And this went on for a few days.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.310
And on the fourth
day, he rode up to me

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:34.390
and he goes, [DEEP VOICE]
Boss, this toy is so much fun.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.700
You should try it.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.586
I go, Andre, really.

00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:38.590
He goes, [DEEP VOICE]
you know you want to.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.378
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.750
So finally-- it was the point
where my hubris exceeded

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.020
my aptitude-- I went,
OK, fine, Andre.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.320
Sure.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.286
And his bodyguard--
his bodyguard.

00:15:50.286 --> 00:15:51.410
Like he needed a bodyguard.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.960
This guy had the
easiest job on the set.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.900
His bodyguard came
up to me and goes,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.800
[ENGLISH ACCENT] it's
very easy, governor.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.500
Yeah, it's just like my bike.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.560
Clutch right here.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.670
Brakes there.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.272
On off switch.

00:16:03.272 --> 00:16:03.980
Bob's your uncle.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.914
JOHN: You do a great
English accent.

00:16:09.914 --> 00:16:10.830
CARY ELWES: Thank you.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.518
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.920
Thank you for that.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.940
It was the best
training I've ever

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.030
had for an all-terrain vehicle.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.205
And I got on this thing,
and I put it in into gear,

00:16:25.205 --> 00:16:27.120
and I lurched forward.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.320
And I didn't get more than
two feet and I went over rock.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.897
And I caught my left big
toe between the clutch pedal

00:16:33.897 --> 00:16:34.980
and the rock and it just--

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:35.270
[SNAP]

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.230
--snapped like that.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.570
And I went, oh, great.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.250
Great.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.990
Great.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.630
I should not have
gotten on this thing.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.442
Why?

00:16:43.442 --> 00:16:44.660
Why, why, why?

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.020
I was terrified at this
point, because I'm sweating,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.230
and I've got to shoot the scene
where I roll down the hill.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.400
Not me, but that scene
with-- thank goodness,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.980
not rolling down myself.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.030
But the scene with Buttercup on
the top, where I confront her

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.460
about marrying Humperdinck.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.915
And the crew come running
up and I'll never forget it.

00:17:03.915 --> 00:17:05.750
The set nurse came over.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.520
She was so sweet.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.867
She goes, [ENGLISH ACCENT]
what happened?

00:17:08.867 --> 00:17:09.450
What happened?

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:10.890
I said, well-- I
was trying to act

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.316
like I was the Black Knight
in "Monty Python and the Holy

00:17:13.316 --> 00:17:13.430
Grail."

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:13.880
And I go, oh, it's nothing.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.421
It's nothing.

00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:15.359
It's just a scratch.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.199
It's nothing.

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:17.170
Just a flesh wound.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:17.711
It's nothing.

00:17:17.711 --> 00:17:19.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:19.462 --> 00:17:21.920
And she touched my boot and
she goes, [ENGLISH ACCENT] does

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.670
that hurt?

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.120
I went, no, not much.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:25.765
No, it's fine.

00:17:25.765 --> 00:17:26.560
It's fine.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.060
And she goes,
[ENGLISH ACCENT] we'll

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.220
need to take the boot off.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.011
I went, sure, sure.

00:17:30.011 --> 00:17:30.560
Go ahead.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.320
And it was agony taking
this thing off, right?

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.095
And there was my
big toe, all swollen

00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:37.280
and pointing in the wrong
direction and everything,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.028
and she goes, [ENGLISH ACCENT]
I think it's broken.

00:17:40.028 --> 00:17:42.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.472
And I said, no, no, it's not.

00:17:45.472 --> 00:17:47.180
It's just probably
sprained or something.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.650
She goes, [ENGLISH ACCENT] no.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.730
It's broken.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.830
So now I'm really nervous.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.160
I'm thinking, what can I do?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.410
I go, is there anything
you can do to help me?

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.930
She goes, [ENGLISH ACCENT]
well, usually,

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.367
when you break something,
you go to the hospital.

00:18:01.367 --> 00:18:02.950
I go, no, we don't
have time for that.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.515
I've got to shoot this scene.

00:18:05.515 --> 00:18:08.150
Is there anything
you can do for me?

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.435
And she said,
[ENGLISH ACCENT] well,

00:18:10.435 --> 00:18:13.090
I suppose I could make
a makeshift splint.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:13.800
I said, great.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.300
Great.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:14.800
Do that.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.840
Do that.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.625
And I think she grabbed a
couple of twigs or something

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:22.330
and made a makeshift
splint right there.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.910
And I was terrified of telling
Rob, because I thought,

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.820
he'll probably send me home.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.490
He'll probably
replace me, because I

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.550
hadn't shot the sword
fight scene yet.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.960
And so I was-- like a twit,
I was telling everyone,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.690
don't tell Rob.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.790
I'll explain it to him.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.050
And don't worry.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.680
I can make it through it.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.940
And that's so crazy,
because on a film set,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.100
everyone's got a
walkie-talkie, you know?

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.750
And so I get in the van
to go up to the set,

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.310
and it was the
longest, slowest ride

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.270
I've ever taken in my life.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.985
I think I overheard
the set nurse tell

00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:56.490
the AD in the back of
the van, [ENGLISH ACCENT]

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.060
I think he fell on
his head as well.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.310
We get to the set and
I hop out, and then

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.680
put all my weight on that
foot and walk up to Rob

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.100
like nothing's happened, right?

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.414
And I'll never forget.

00:19:13.414 --> 00:19:15.330
Rob was there and he was
scratching his beard,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.330
and he goes, hey, Cary.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.250
How you doing?

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.990
I go, I'm fine, Rob.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.365
How are you?

00:19:23.365 --> 00:19:26.205
And he goes, I'm good.

00:19:26.205 --> 00:19:27.663
How you doing?

00:19:27.663 --> 00:19:30.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.500
And I just broke down.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.250
I said, Rob, I'm so sorry.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.136
I'm so sorry.

00:19:34.136 --> 00:19:35.010
I should've told you.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.100
I was scared you'd let me go.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.370
I was fooling around on Andre's
ATV, and he goes, I know.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.600
Somebody came over the
walkie-talkie and said,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.870
you're gonna see Cary
can't walk too good.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.614
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:48.614 --> 00:19:50.280
I said, I'm so sorry, Rob.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:50.850
Really.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.640
He goes, don't worry about it.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.060
I'm not going to send you home.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.670
We'll work around
it if we have to.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.760
And he was such a mensch
about it, and he was so sweet.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.350
And luckily, the sword fight
wasn't until almost a month

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.540
away, so I had a bit
of time for it to heal.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.480
It was a bit tender
for some of the scenes.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.604
There's no question, if
you look at the film again,

00:20:13.604 --> 00:20:17.350
you'll see I have a bit
of a light step in some

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.000
of the sequences.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.840
But, yeah.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.950
We worked around it.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.680
And Peter Diamond,
who was training me,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.850
said, well, what we're
going to do, obviously,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.770
you don't get a break.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.920
We're going to work
on your arm movements

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.970
and focus less on
your foot work.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.645
So in fact, it helped me become
a better left-handed sword

00:20:37.645 --> 00:20:40.340
fighter in a strange
way, because I

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.792
was forced to really
focus on that.

00:20:45.792 --> 00:20:47.500
So it was a strange
blessing in disguise,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.890
although I wouldn't recommend it
if you're training for fencing.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:51.654
But yeah.

00:20:51.654 --> 00:20:52.420
Yeah.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.730
JOHN: That's amazing.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.800
You mentioned the scene with
Buttercup, Robin Wright.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.400
And we were talking.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.427
She was the last person
casted for the film.

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:02.010
Is that right?

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.801
CARY ELWES: I know.

00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:05.224
Which is incredible,
when you think about it.

00:21:05.224 --> 00:21:07.640
I think we were about two weeks
before starting the shoot,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.264
and we still didn't
have our Buttercup.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.100
And I think it was Bill Goldman
who met with her in New York,

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.950
and she read for him.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:25.140
And he called Rob in
London, and said, get her.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.610
Get her right now.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:27.941
She's it.

00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:30.190
We're never going to find a
better Buttercup than her.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.180
And of course he was right.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:31.975
She's brilliant.

00:21:31.975 --> 00:21:34.210
And we were lucky to
get her, because she

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.940
was on a soap opera
called "Santa Barbara,"

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.400
and we had to
negotiate with them

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.740
to let her out of her contract.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.185
And she was brilliant
in the part.

00:21:45.185 --> 00:21:46.890
I mean, she's amazing.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.284
You can't think of anyone
else playing Buttercup now.

00:21:49.284 --> 00:21:51.450
JOHN: Well, tell us about
your first scene with her,

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.430
first time meeting her.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.888
CARY ELWES: First
time meeting her,

00:21:53.888 --> 00:21:56.120
I was walking around
Shepperton Studios, where

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.580
we shot the film, with Rob.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.620
He was showing me the sets.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.050
And we were walking back
to the production office,

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.840
and I said to Rob, so have
we found Buttercup yet?

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.670
We're getting pretty
close, you know?

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.800
And he said, oh, man, have
we found the Buttercup.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.225
She's perfect.

00:22:12.225 --> 00:22:12.850
It's this girl.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.894
Her name's Robin Wright.

00:22:14.894 --> 00:22:15.810
You ever heard of her?

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:16.520
I go, no.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.280
He goes, she does a
daytime soap opera,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.450
but don't let that fool you.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.890
She's amazing.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.160
And boy, you're
going to be so happy.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.370
She's the Buttercup.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.500
And right as he said that,
Robin walked up the steps

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.690
and he goes, Cary,
there's Robin Wright.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.980
She's Buttercup, the girl you're
going to fall in love with.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.204
And I went-- and
Robin was so funny.

00:22:39.204 --> 00:22:40.370
She's like, oh, Rob, please.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.870
Like that.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:41.794
You know?

00:22:41.794 --> 00:22:43.370
And he nudged me.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.890
He goes, eh?

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.390
Eh?

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.670
What'd I tell you?

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:46.630
Eh?

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.430
Like that.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:49.790
He was so funny.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.810
And she's so funny, Robin.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.930
She has a wonderful
sense of humor.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.080
And she has a
British stepfather,

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.860
so she had a perfect
English accent, too.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.290
And she had the hardest
role, actually, really.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.560
Because she had to
play the straight man,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.310
or the straight woman,
in the whole story.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.020
She's, as Buttercup, she's
the victim in the story.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.750
She gets kidnapped, and she
has to marry Humperdinck,

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.590
and she loses her love.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.065
And she played it note perfect.

00:23:16.065 --> 00:23:18.040
I mean, she was just fantastic.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.720
And of course now, everyone
knows how fantastic she is.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.526
I mean, I'm sure you guys
have watched "House of Cards."

00:23:23.526 --> 00:23:24.650
She's incredible, you know?

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.200
We were lucky to get her.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.040
JOHN: Yeah.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.420
So now, you say
that-- in your book,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.370
you say that most of the cast
still gets a lot of people

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.570
asking them, coming up in
public and saying, do this line,

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.960
or say this, or do
something funny, right?

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.290
So tell me about your most
awkward or funniest thing

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.460
someone's ever done.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.780
Like, we have a
Westley-- or, sorry.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.540
We have a costume
going on right here--

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.790
Dread Pirate Roberts going on.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.140
CARY ELWES: Awesome.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.550
JOHN: But I'm sure
this isn't the most.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.220
CARY ELWES: That's fantastic.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:53.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.600
You're a very brave man, sir.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:58.440
Is it warm in that?

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.434
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:59.434 --> 00:24:00.428
A bit, right?

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.370
Yeah, I've met some incredible
fans over the years.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.790
I've met whole families,
who've-- you know,

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.380
some have named their
kids after the characters,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.150
and people have gotten
married, of course,

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.601
had the whole ceremony,
and serving peanuts,

00:24:18.601 --> 00:24:20.600
and shown me their
photographs of their wedding.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.580
And, you know, incredible.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.570
But I think the strangest
and funniest fan I ever met

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:31.826
was a young lady who came up
to me, and she lifted her hair,

00:24:31.826 --> 00:24:34.200
and she turned around and
showed me the back of her neck.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.759
And she had "As
you wish" tattooed

00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:37.800
in beautiful calligraphy.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.460
Very nice.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.910
And I said, oh, that's nice.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.400
You know.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.036
And she goes, "It'd be even
nicer if you signed it."

00:24:46.036 --> 00:24:48.600
And she handed me a Sharpie.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.270
And I said, you want
me to sign your neck?

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.192
And she goes, yeah.

00:24:53.192 --> 00:24:54.900
I go, what are you
going to do with that?

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.150
She goes, I'm going
to have it tattooed.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.590
And I went, well, I
don't know about that.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.919
I don't want to get a letter
from your dad, you know?

00:25:05.919 --> 00:25:07.460
And her mom was
standing right there,

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.210
and she goes, no, no, no, no.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.520
Do it.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.020
Do it.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:15.940
So somewhere in
the world, there's

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.982
a young lady walking around
with my name tattooed

00:25:17.982 --> 00:25:18.981
on the back of her neck.

00:25:18.981 --> 00:25:19.854
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.854 --> 00:25:21.682
God bless her.

00:25:21.682 --> 00:25:23.700
JOHN: That's awesome.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.050
And so, in the book
as well, it contains

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.740
a lot of extra
side notes, right?

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.990
And this is really
an amazing insight,

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.259
because you got the whole
cast on board with this.

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:33.050
CARY ELWES: I know.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.550
I'm very blessed, really.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.179
I can't take full
credit for this book.

00:25:37.179 --> 00:25:38.970
Not only did I co-write
it with Joe Layden,

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.550
but the whole cast, Rob,
Norman Lear, Bill Goldman,

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.400
they all jumped on board
to be a part of it.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.960
So I'm very blessed.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.810
JOHN: So tell me, what is the
most amazing thing you found

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.070
out from talking with the
cast, directors, writers.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.910
Like, what are some insights
that you found, really,

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.159
that you didn't even know yet?

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.790
CARY ELWES: Well, I
didn't know at the time

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.740
why Wally Shawn was so nervous
when I was shooting with him.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.240
Because I remember
shooting-- I only

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.980
had one scene with the guy, the
battle of wits scene, right?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.910
And I had a very
easy day that day,

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.240
because all I did was sit there
and go, mm-hmm, ah-- like that.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.360
And I think I say, like,
then we're at an impasse,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.194
or whatever.

00:26:23.194 --> 00:26:24.860
JOHN: Did you bring
your iocaine powder?

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.650
CARY ELWES: I did not.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.000
No, why?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.400
I'm sure you have
some, don't you?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.900
JOHN: Yes.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.850
CARY ELWES: Yeah.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.540
JOHN: One of those glasses.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.460
CARY ELWES: Oh, good.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:37.264 --> 00:26:39.700
AUDIENCE: In all of them.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.690
CARY ELWES: Very good.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.555
Yeah, so-- but he had
reams of dialogue,

00:26:45.555 --> 00:26:47.990
this guy-- his
first day shooting,

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.550
and he had all this
dialogue to do,

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.800
and it was very hard dialogue.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.370
It was great dialogue.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:57.350
I mean, it was stuff like
Socrates, Aristotle, you know?

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.291
Morons.

00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:58.790
Great stuff.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.380
Great stuff.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.780
But he was sweating.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.180
And I thought,
that's so strange.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.470
Here's Wallace Shawn,
arguably the smartest guy

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:12.390
in the room wherever he
is, Fulbright scholar,

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.580
lectures at Oxford
and Cambridge.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.115
Why is he sweating over
this little thing, you know?

00:27:19.115 --> 00:27:20.740
I knew him from "My
Dinner with Andre,"

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.240
and if you've seen
that film, wonderful.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.590
And I never understood it.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.810
But I just thought, OK.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.143
It's not particularly hot
that day, but he was sweating.

00:27:29.143 --> 00:27:33.310
I thought, well, that certainly
made me feel more at ease.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.560
I'm thinking, if Wally's
sweating, I've got it easy,

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.710
you know?

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.340
And I found out later,
when I wrote the book,

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.260
that he said his
agent had told him

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.010
that he wasn't the first
choice for Vizzini.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.530
That in fact the
producers wanted

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.820
Danny DeVito instead of him.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.420
So Wally said he was haunted
by the ghost of Danny DeVito--

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.125
--through the entire shoot.

00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:01.760
And he said, any
time he did a scene,

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.970
he kept thinking how
Danny DeVito would do it.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.930
Which is crazy, because
it's inconceivable, right?

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.490
That anyone else could
play that role, right?

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.710
And I think he even said to
Rob, he goes, [MIMICKING]

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.600
why'd you cast me in this film?

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.490
I'm not even Sicilian.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.594
I'm a Jew from New York.

00:28:18.594 --> 00:28:20.890
And Rob said, but I love
the way you're doing it.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.205
You're perfect.

00:28:22.205 --> 00:28:23.580
But he was convinced
he was going

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.330
to be sent-- he was
convinced he was going

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.760
to be sent home and replaced
by Danny, which is so crazy.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.460
But anyway, needless
to say, I don't

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.170
think he's with
that agent anymore.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.490
But he was wonderful.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.990
Absolutely wonderful.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.962
JOHN: So when the film
released initially,

00:28:39.962 --> 00:28:41.670
you write that everyone
kind of went back

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.211
to their lives pretty
quickly, right?

00:28:43.211 --> 00:28:44.600
Just a normal routine.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.400
CARY ELWES: Right.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.860
JOHN: Tell us about
why the movie took off.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.690
Because it wasn't
very initial, right?

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:50.925
Kind of had a process.

00:28:50.925 --> 00:28:52.800
CARY ELWES: Well,
interestingly enough, John,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:58.190
when the film came out, it
wasn't as big of a box office

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:59.850
success as we had hoped.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.550
And that was partly
due to the fact

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.900
that the marketing department
had their work cut out

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.962
for them.

00:29:08.962 --> 00:29:10.670
They didn't know how
to sell the picture.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.030
Was it a comedy?

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.080
Was it a fairy tale?

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.090
Was it a kid's movie?

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.160
Was it an adult movie?

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.240
Was it an action film?

00:29:19.566 --> 00:29:20.940
So they went with
this one sheet.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.380
It's a beautiful one sheet.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.560
It's sort of a Maxfield
Parrish type thing,

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.500
with a picture of Peter
Falk reading to Fred Savage.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.420
And so that kind of made people
think it was a kid's movie.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.470
And we opened the same
week as a little film

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.860
called "Fatal Attraction,"
which just swept the box office.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.770
So we were a little
saddened by that.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:48.480
The film, it did modestly
well, but it kind of went away.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.830
So we all, as you say, we all
tried to get on with our lives

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.080
and put it behind us.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.280
And it wasn't until
about 10 years later

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.570
that the VHS market
started taking off.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.610
And that's when folks started
renting it, and then buying

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.170
it, and then giving it as gifts
to their family and friends.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:15.040
And I still meet people who
still have their VHS copy

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.160
that they want me to sign.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.040
It's incredible.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.270
And I'll never forget.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.110
I was in Manhattan.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.650
I was at a restaurant, ordering
a hamburger or something.

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.330
And the waitress said, how
do you want that cooked?

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.900
And I said, medium rare.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.860
And she goes, as you wish.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:36.560
I said, excuse me?

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.265
And she goes, you know.

00:30:40.265 --> 00:30:42.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.770
Like that, right?

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.330
And she winked at
me and walked away.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.420
And I thought,
that's so bizarre.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.070
I've never had anyone say
those three words to me before.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:56.600
And so this film that had been
mostly dead for almost a decade

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.970
suddenly came back to life.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:58.850
It was extraordinary.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.260
And so it was a wonderful,
wonderful thing.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.840
I call it the gift
that keeps on giving,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.990
because now it's bigger than
we'd ever hoped it would be.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.310
Yeah.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.440
JOHN: Well, it's timeless.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.147
I mean, I'm definitely going
to be showing this to my kids.

00:31:15.147 --> 00:31:16.480
My wife is actually from Mexico.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.710
She just saw it
for the first time.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.640
And she was like,
this is amazing.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.556
CARY ELWES: Oh, great.

00:31:19.556 --> 00:31:21.890
JOHN: And I mean, it's
amazing, the film.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.702
And right now, what
we're going to do

00:31:23.702 --> 00:31:25.660
is actually take some
questions from the crowd.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.894
CARY ELWES: Great.

00:31:26.894 --> 00:31:29.310
MALE SPEAKER: Now, these have
been submitted from Googlers

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.880
across our various offices.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.950
I'm going to kick it off with
one from Miriam, to start.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:38.850
She says, though we all know
and love you dearly as Westley,

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.080
you've portrayed many
different types of characters

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.650
throughout your career.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.270
Which has been your favorites?

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.100
PS, love you, and
the bards, too.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.220
CARY ELWES: Oh, wow.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.201
Thank you.

00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:54.210
Well, this is definitely
my most cherished role.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.800
And that's really why I wrote
the book, because it gave me

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.515
the career I have today, and
the wonderful life I have.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.840
And it was such a joyous
journey that I went on.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.590
And that's why I wanted
to write the book.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:13.820
So this was definitely
the most fun I ever had.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.305
And there's been
other movies that I've

00:32:16.305 --> 00:32:18.780
done that have been
fun, but nothing quite

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.532
like this one, really.

00:32:20.532 --> 00:32:22.659
Yeah.

00:32:22.659 --> 00:32:24.950
MALE SPEAKER: And Vincent
also wanted to talk about one

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.700
of your other iconic roles.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.180
Can you please tell us
more about your experiences

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.120
as Robin Hood versus Westley?

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.781
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:33.781 --> 00:32:35.780
What could Robin Hood
have learned from Westley?

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.410
CARY ELWES: OK.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.615
Well, it was actually
thanks to "Princess Bride"

00:32:40.615 --> 00:32:44.920
that I got cast as Robin Hood,
because Mel Brooks had seen it,

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.260
and obviously Mel and
Carl are great friends.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:54.400
And Rob grew up around Mel.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.040
And I'll never forget, I got a
call at home from Mel Brooks.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.985
And I picked up the
phone and he goes,

00:33:00.985 --> 00:33:02.550
[MIMICKING] hello,
it's Mel Brooks.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.420
I went, yeah right.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.127
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:07.127 --> 00:33:08.960
I thought someone was
playing a trick on me,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.839
and I hung up on him.

00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:12.880
And the phone rang again.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.129
I picked it up and he goes,
[MIMICKING] don't hang up.

00:33:15.129 --> 00:33:15.840
Don't hang up.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.520
It's really me.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.070
So it was amazing, amazing.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.790
Because I grew up with Mel
Brooks, like a lot of people.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.210
I'd seen all of his movies.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.690
And it was a real thrill for
me to get to work with him.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.780
And that was a lot of
fun to work on, a lot.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.650
A really joyous
experience as well.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.020
Yeah.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.320
Yeah.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:39.930
Great fun.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.140
JOHN: Who's a better fighter?

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.610
"Robin Hood: Men in
Tights" or the pirate?

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.780
[LAUGHS]

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.280
CARY ELWES: You
mean, who would win?

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:47.779
JOHN: Yeah?

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:49.156
Who'd win a battle?

00:33:49.156 --> 00:33:50.305
Who'd win a battle, right?

00:33:50.305 --> 00:33:51.680
I think we all
want to know that.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.270
CARY ELWES: Oh, John.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:58.457
The old hypothetical
fictional characters question.

00:33:58.457 --> 00:33:59.290
JOHN: Next question.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:33:59.675
CARY ELWES: I don't know.

00:33:59.675 --> 00:34:00.330
I mean, yeah.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.020
I don't know.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.780
I can't answer that.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.310
MALE SPEAKER: And we have
one more here as well.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.520
So were there any anecdotes that
did not make it into the book

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.600
that you wish
there was room for,

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.989
as the editing
process marches on?

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.940
CARY ELWES: No, I think
I covered it all, really.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:21.251 --> 00:34:23.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.400
Pretty much.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.834
That was a question
I got from my editor

00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:31.880
when I was nearing the end.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.479
Yeah, no, I covered it all.

00:34:33.479 --> 00:34:34.270
I was very fortune.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:38.710
I didn't keep a diary or a
journal while we were shooting.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.960
And so I was a little
nervous after I hung up

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.520
with the publishers at
Touchstone-- Simon &amp; Schuster.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.675
Because I turned to
my wife and I said,

00:34:46.675 --> 00:34:49.440
OK, they want me
to write however

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.540
number of pages and stuff.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.980
And I thought, I don't
know what I'm going to do,

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.820
because I have maybe four or
five stories or something.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.870
But I can't remember
every day of shooting.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.519
And I went and had lunch
with Norman Lear, who

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:04.935
produced the film,
and responsible

00:35:04.935 --> 00:35:07.790
for "All in the Family,"
and "Jeffersons,"

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.190
and "Maude," and all
those wonderful shows.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.715
And Norman was fantastic.

00:35:11.715 --> 00:35:13.927
He said, don't worry, Cary.

00:35:13.927 --> 00:35:15.010
I'm going to help you out.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.462
I'm going to give you the
call sheets from the movie.

00:35:17.462 --> 00:35:19.670
And the call sheets, for
those of you who don't know,

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.985
is a work order that you get
as an actor or on the crew,

00:35:22.985 --> 00:35:26.420
and it tells you what your
call time is the next day,

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.640
and what scenes you have
to shoot, and all of that.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.550
And he said, when you get
those, you're going to see them

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.622
and you're going to
remember where you were.

00:35:33.622 --> 00:35:36.280
And that'll help
jog your memory.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.010
And a few days later, he sent
me this beautiful bound file

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.012
of all the call sheets.

00:35:43.012 --> 00:35:43.720
And he was right.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.490
I opened the first one
and I looked at it,

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.530
and I was right back
there-- after 27 years.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.130
It was wonderful.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.930
So thank you to Norman, because
without him, certainly I

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.800
wouldn't be in the movie, and
I wouldn't be here sharing

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.170
this book with you.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.050
JOHN: Yeah.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:01.370
Wow.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.000
MALE SPEAKER: We also had
a question from Todd Gage.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.420
Going back to the epic
sword fighting scene,

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.740
can you tell us more about
the mechanics of the sword

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.160
flying up in the
air and catching it?

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.243
Like, did that take a lot
of practice to pull off?

00:36:13.243 --> 00:36:14.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:14.072 --> 00:36:17.895
Was it specifically in your
training, or how did that go?

00:36:17.895 --> 00:36:18.520
CARY ELWES: OK.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.780
The sword in the air
is actually Mandy.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.232
He catches the sword, I think.

00:36:24.232 --> 00:36:24.940
Isn't that right?

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.856
JOHN: Well, there's one
where you do the flip.

00:36:26.856 --> 00:36:29.374
CARY ELWES: The flip
is a guy we brought in.

00:36:29.374 --> 00:36:30.540
OK, so here's what happened.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.792
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:31.792 --> 00:36:32.744
Yeah.

00:36:32.744 --> 00:36:34.172
No, that was me.

00:36:34.172 --> 00:36:36.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.810
Here's what happened.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.890
When Bob Anderson and
Peter Diamond first

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.840
showed the sword
fight to Rob, they

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.770
did it at what's known
as half-speed, right?

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:53.170
And it timed out at, like,
almost three minutes.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:57.540
And by the time Mandy and I-- by
the time we finished rehearsing

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.820
it, we got it up to-- we'd
learned it really well.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.350
We showed it to Rob.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.530
And it was really fast.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.110
I mean, we were really moving.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:08.780
And so it timed out
at about a minute.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:13.370
And after we were done, we were
panting and covered in sweat.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.550
We walked up to Rob.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.800
We're like, what do you think?

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.550
And he was scratching his beard
again, and he goes, that's it?

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.560
And we said, what do
you mean, that's it?

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.670
We've been working on
this for months, you know?

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.310
He goes, guys, I built
this beautiful set for you.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.160
I mean, look at it.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.410
The Cliffs of Insanity.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:34.116
I mean, you're here,
and you're going

00:37:34.116 --> 00:37:35.240
to be in here for a minute?

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.160
We need longer than
that, you know?

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.440
So we went back to
the drawing board,

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.890
and we added another two
minutes to the fight.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.280
We had the whole thing on
the tower and the acrobat,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.780
we brought in this
wonderful gymnast

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:51.020
who came in and did that for us.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.510
And so we went back and looked
at every single sword fight

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.370
movie that we could
lay our hands on.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.766
"Scaramouche" was
one of the best ones.

00:37:59.766 --> 00:38:01.390
If you haven't seen
it, it's wonderful.

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.330
Stewart Granger, Mel Ferrer.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:08.982
"Sea Hawk," "Black Pirate,"
"Robin Hood," everything we

00:38:08.982 --> 00:38:09.940
could lay our hands on.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.805
And we just studied it, studied
every single sword fight

00:38:12.805 --> 00:38:13.920
scene we could.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.040
And we came back and
added another two minutes.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.337
So that's what we did.

00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:17.837
Yeah.

00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:19.060
JOHN: Wow.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:19.730
OK, great.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.359
Well, thank you
so much for coming

00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:23.150
to Google, and a massive
round of applause.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.066
CARY ELWES: Thank you.

00:38:24.066 --> 00:38:25.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.650
Thank you.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:28.550
Thank you so much.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:34.250
Thank you.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.000
