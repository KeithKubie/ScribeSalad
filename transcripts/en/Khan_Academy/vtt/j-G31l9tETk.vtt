00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.360
All right, we left
off at number 11.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.740
This is a pretty straightforward
triangle.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.330
So I can draw it in my messy
style, without the line tool.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.530
We have A, B, C.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.020
This is 3, 4, and 6.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.990
Each angle of triangle ABC has
the same measure as an angle

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.650
in triangle XYZ, which
has not been shown.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.060
Well, we should draw
that, though.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.290
It has the same angle.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.040
I have a feeling that this is
a similar triangle X, Y, Z.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.470
XYZ.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.420
If the length of one side of
XYZ is 24-- so we just know

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.820
some random side here is 24.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.970
it could be this one.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.230
Maybe, I don't know.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.780
If the length of one side is
24, what is the possible

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.420
perimeter of XYZ?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.950
What is one possible
perimeter?

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.580
This probably has three correct
answers, which is fun,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.790
because in some ways, increases
your probability of

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.080
getting this right.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.030
But when you know that two
triangles have all the same

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.450
angles, you immediately know
that it is a similar triangle.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.280
Which means that they look the
same, they're just of a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.070
different scale.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.890
And you should watch the similar
triangle video that I

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.840
made in the geometry
play list, if this

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.150
makes no sense to you.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.370
Because this will make no sense
if you haven't heard the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.480
term before.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.630
But, since these are similar
triangles, the ratios of the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.820
corresponding sides are
going to be the same.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.380
They're letting us pick which
side has a length of 24.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.630
So let's say that the side that
corresponds to side 3 is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.480
of length of 24, right?

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.340
We don't know that this is
definitely the case, but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.430
they're letting us pick.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.170
So I'm going to say that
X Y corresponds to A B.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.400
So if this side is 24, then this
side is going to be 4/3

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.440
of this side, right?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.050
Hopefully, you remember similar
triangles, that the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.070
ratios of the sides
are the same.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.570
So if 3 is to 4, as 24 is to--
Well, to go from 3 to 24, we

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.610
multiply by 8.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.920
So to go from 4 to this,
we multiply by 8.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.380
So 32.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.470
And to go from 6 to this,
we multiply by 8.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.440
48.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.070
So this is a possible
combination of sides for a

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.850
similar triangle to
triangle ABC.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.720
And we can just add these up.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.970
So 24 plus 32 is 56.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.160
Plus 48.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.480
6 plus 8 is 14.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.230
104.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.950
Just bubble type that in, 104.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.180
This could have been 24.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.440
If this is 24, that means
we're multiplying

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.030
by 6 to get to 24.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.850
So this would be 18.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.030
This would be 36.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.540
You could add all of
those up together.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.940
And you would have gotten
another answer.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.760
And that would have
been correct.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.350
And similarly, you could
have made this side 24.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.440
If this side was 24, then that
means we're multiplying

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.980
every side by 4.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.130
So this would have been 12, and
this would have been 16.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.950
And you could have
added those up.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.000
And that would have been the
other, the third possible,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.050
correct answer for
this problem.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.750
Exciting.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.000
Let's move on.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.830
The sum of five consecutive
integers is a thousand.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.780
Number 12.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.680
If five consecutive integers
is a thousand, what is the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.350
value of the greatest
of these integers?

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.220
So they're consecutive
integers.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.140
So there are five of them.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.830
So we want to know the greatest
of these integers.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.180
So let's say x is the greatest.
And so the second

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.960
greatest is going
to be x minus 1.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.760
The third greatest
is x minus 2.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.540
The fourth greatest
is x minus 3.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.960
And then the fifth greatest
is x minus 4, right?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.340
These are five integers and
they're consecutive.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.080
And this is the largest,
right?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.920
And we're going to take
the sum of them.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.670
This is a tip.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.120
If they were asking for the
smallest number, I would have

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.370
started with x.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.313
And I would have gone, x
plus one, x plus 2, x

00:04:20.313 --> 00:04:21.209
plus 3, like that.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.075
Because then x would have
been my smallest number.

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.200
But they said x is the largest.
We want to solve for

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.790
x, so the greatest of
these integers.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.770
So that's why I subtracted.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.390
If we add all these
up, we have 5 x's.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.650
So that's 5x minus 1
minus 2 is minus 3.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.990
Minus 3 is minus 6.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.800
Minus 4 is minus 10.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.130
5x minus 10.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.450
They say that the
sum is 1,000.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.390
And this is a fairly simple
algebra equation.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.040
5x is equal to-- add
10 to both sides.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.880
1,010, which is also 10 in
binary, if you are a geek.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.840
Divide both sides by 5. x
is equal to 205, right?

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.770
No, I can't divide by 5.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.480
202, right?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.590
x is equal to 202.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.860
There you go.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.070
Not too bad.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.120
All right.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.610
Number 13.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.200
And I'm going to switch colors,
because pale yellow is

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.990
getting monotonous.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.420
I'll switch to something
bold like blood red.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.810
No, that's tacky.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.430
Number 13.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.530
The figure above shows
y equals g of x.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.470
So let me draw that, because I
don't want to confuse you just

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.100
saying a lot of random crap.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.350
You see what the graph looks
like, although you should have

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.870
it turned to the same page.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.310
OK.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.560
I draw it like that.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.360
No, I don't have to draw
that far down.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.130
Like that.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.000
And it looks something
like this.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.412
Let me draw it in a
different color.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:14.300
The line itself-- something
goes from here,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.550
goes up like this.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.050
Then, it kind of comes
back down like here.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.640
Then it kind of bounces.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.400
It goes back up like this.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.440
And then they tell us that this
line, right here, is y is

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.000
equal to g of x.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.130
It's going to be a functions
problem.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.810
I can tell you already.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.840
So you should watch the function
videos or do the

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.410
function modules on
Khan Academy.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.560
So the figure above shows the
graph y equals g of x.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:53.880
If the function h is defined by,
h of x is equal to g of 2x

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.840
plus 2, they want to know
what h of 1 is equal to.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.110
Well, with functions,
they're putting a 1

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.000
into this black box.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.920
So wherever we see the x,
we put a 1 in, right?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:15.350
So h of 1 is equal to-- let's
just use this definition-- g

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.830
of 2 times x.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.830
Well, in this case, x is 1.
g of 2 times 1 plus 2.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.900
So that equals g of 3 plus 2.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.510
Now, we have to figure
out what g of 3 is.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.240
And if you look at this graph--
and in the book it's

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.700
more obvious.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:42.100
There's 1, 2, and then it hits
0 right at 3, right?

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.050
So g of 3, when x is equal to
3, g of 3 is right here.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.660
That's 0.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.910
g of 3 is 0.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.700
We're just left with a 2.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.040
h of 1 is 2.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.810
That's all.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.960
Amazing.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.210
All right, next problem.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.420
Number 14.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:19.700
Exactly 4 actors try out
for 4 parts in a play.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.070
If each actor can perform any
1 part, and no one will

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.380
perform more than 1 part, how
many different assignments of

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.640
actors are possible?

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.059
Well, let's just say you're just
randomly doing it, right?

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.590
So let's put up the actors.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.710
You take the first guy, right?

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.720
And you say, well, I
can put him in any

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.150
1 of 4 roles, right?

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.940
For the first guy, I could
put him in any

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.700
1 of 4 roles, right?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.936
And then the second guy-- I
shouldn't assume they're all

00:08:49.936 --> 00:08:54.180
men-- and the second actor,
or woman, or actress.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.080
1 role has been taken
already, right?

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.030
There were 4 roles.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.370
This first person took it.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.000
So now, there's only 3
roles left, right?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.640
There's 3 possibilities.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.380
There's 1 of 3 possibilities
for that

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.530
second person, correct?

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.700
OK, so the third person-- how
many possibilities does he or

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.770
she have left?

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.470
Well, 2 of the roles have
been taken already.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.870
So there's only 2 possibilities
for that person.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.400
And then the last person
to be picked has only

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.210
1 role left, right?

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.240
So the combinations are
literally just 4 times 3

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.040
times 2 times 1.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.600
So that's 12 times 2.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.810
That's 24 combinations or
assignments of roles.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.415
And I actually haven't made a
probability, and combinations,

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:39.060
and permutations video yet.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.420
I will.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.460
And once I do, watch that
if this problem seemed

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.530
confusing to you.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.130
But hopefully, it makes a little
bit of intuitive sense.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.690
I'll see you in the
next video.
