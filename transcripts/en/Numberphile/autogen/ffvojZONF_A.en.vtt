20 years ago one of the most incredible
goals in history it was a free-kick that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310
goals in history it was a free-kick that
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.950
goals in history it was a free-kick that
didn't seem like it was very dangerous

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
didn't seem like it was very dangerous
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840
didn't seem like it was very dangerous
you know he needs to take a shot from

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
you know he needs to take a shot from
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.400
you know he needs to take a shot from
really really far away and he had this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
really really far away and he had this
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140
really really far away and he had this
incredible ability with free kicks we

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
incredible ability with free kicks we
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.970
incredible ability with free kicks we
went like it was just going way out of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
went like it was just going way out of
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980
went like it was just going way out of
bounds and then occurred the last moment

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
bounds and then occurred the last moment
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.440
bounds and then occurred the last moment
and and went inside players can usually

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
and and went inside players can usually
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330
and and went inside players can usually
do this with the inside of the foot but

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
do this with the inside of the foot but
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.799
do this with the inside of the foot but
to do it with the outside of the foot

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
to do it with the outside of the foot
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.690
to do it with the outside of the foot
and have it curled that much is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
and have it curled that much is
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.040
and have it curled that much is
something that I had never seen and I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
something that I had never seen and I
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.990
something that I had never seen and I
don't think anybody else had before yeah

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000
don't think anybody else had before yeah
 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.810
don't think anybody else had before yeah
we're gonna have to see later I was

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
we're gonna have to see later I was
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.819
we're gonna have to see later I was
looking at all footage and they were all

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
looking at all footage and they were all
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.250
looking at all footage and they were all
this article celebrating the goal and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260
this article celebrating the goal and
 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.049
this article celebrating the goal and
and I was noticing a discrepancy these

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
and I was noticing a discrepancy these
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240
and I was noticing a discrepancy these
articles didn't agree on how far he was

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
articles didn't agree on how far he was
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490
articles didn't agree on how far he was
from the goal so some articles talked

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
from the goal so some articles talked
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770
from the goal so some articles talked
about how he was 35 meters away others

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
about how he was 35 meters away others
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479
about how he was 35 meters away others
talked about how he was 35 yards away

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
talked about how he was 35 yards away
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280
talked about how he was 35 yards away
that's not the same thing and then you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
that's not the same thing and then you
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.830
that's not the same thing and then you
got me thinking how do we figure out how

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
got me thinking how do we figure out how
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870
got me thinking how do we figure out how
you know nowadays we watch these games

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
you know nowadays we watch these games
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.130
you know nowadays we watch these games
and they automatically tell us how far

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
and they automatically tell us how far
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.719
and they automatically tell us how far
the ball is but but how do we figure

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
the ball is but but how do we figure
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789
the ball is but but how do we figure
that out and I found that it's a lot

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
that out and I found that it's a lot
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.620
that out and I found that it's a lot
harder than I thought and so I wanted to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
harder than I thought and so I wanted to
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.030
harder than I thought and so I wanted to
talk to you about about how we can do

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
talk to you about about how we can do
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.550
talk to you about about how we can do
this and and looking at this still of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
this and and looking at this still of
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.730
this and and looking at this still of
the of the photograph of Roberto Carlos

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
the of the photograph of Roberto Carlos
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.330
the of the photograph of Roberto Carlos
his goal

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
his goal
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.560
his goal
I want us to just look at this and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
I want us to just look at this and
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.330
I want us to just look at this and
figure out how far he was so this is

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
figure out how far he was so this is
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.249
figure out how far he was so this is
Roberto Carlos then the end goal is a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
Roberto Carlos then the end goal is a
 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.780
Roberto Carlos then the end goal is a
little bit hard to see but is right here

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
little bit hard to see but is right here
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520
little bit hard to see but is right here
so so the goalkeeper from your birthday

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
so so the goalkeeper from your birthday
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.380
so so the goalkeeper from your birthday
is standing in front of it this right

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
is standing in front of it this right
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600
is standing in front of it this right
here is the edge of the penalty box and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
here is the edge of the penalty box and
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.240
here is the edge of the penalty box and
then this one is is sometimes called the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
then this one is is sometimes called the
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460
then this one is is sometimes called the
goal box for the goal area the point is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
goal box for the goal area the point is
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.170
goal box for the goal area the point is
that we basically want to figure out

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
that we basically want to figure out
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.550
that we basically want to figure out
okay you know here here are these three

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
okay you know here here are these three
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.280
okay you know here here are these three
lines and here's the ball and with that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
lines and here's the ball and with that
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.960
lines and here's the ball and with that
information how do we determine how far

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
information how do we determine how far
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.350
information how do we determine how far
the ball is from the end line maybe I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
the ball is from the end line maybe I
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.929
the ball is from the end line maybe I
will try to draw a picture of the the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
will try to draw a picture of the the
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910
will try to draw a picture of the the
box you can't do this and I put the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
box you can't do this and I put the
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.149
box you can't do this and I put the
penalty kick down over there although we

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
penalty kick down over there although we
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.679
penalty kick down over there although we
can't use it because you see it's not in

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
can't use it because you see it's not in
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959
can't use it because you see it's not in
the photo so we're not gonna be able to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969
the photo so we're not gonna be able to
 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.310
the photo so we're not gonna be able to
use it as a point of reference having

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
use it as a point of reference having
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.870
use it as a point of reference having
drawn the dog where the penalty kick is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
drawn the dog where the penalty kick is
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.580
drawn the dog where the penalty kick is
taken there's also a little arc right

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
taken there's also a little arc right
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.309
taken there's also a little arc right
here that it's actually a circle

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
here that it's actually a circle
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.990
here that it's actually a circle
centered here it's an arc

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
centered here it's an arc
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.460
centered here it's an arc
Circle Center right there I wanna do

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
Circle Center right there I wanna do
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.670
Circle Center right there I wanna do
that there was a circle Center and the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
that there was a circle Center and the
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.870
that there was a circle Center and the
idea is that when you take the penalty

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880
idea is that when you take the penalty
 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.900
idea is that when you take the penalty
kick you're supposed to be 915 away from

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
kick you're supposed to be 915 away from
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.190
kick you're supposed to be 915 away from
the from where the penalty kick is taken

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
the from where the penalty kick is taken
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.100
the from where the penalty kick is taken
and so the players cannot stand inside

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
and so the players cannot stand inside
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.330
and so the players cannot stand inside
that circle so that they're that far

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
that circle so that they're that far
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.580
that circle so that they're that far
away from it right so here we see we see

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
away from it right so here we see we see
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.260
away from it right so here we see we see
a little part of that arc which some

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270
a little part of that arc which some
 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.400
a little part of that arc which some
people call the D and what we'll see if

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
people call the D and what we'll see if
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.880
people call the D and what we'll see if
we need it

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
we need it
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.590
we need it
Roberto Carlos is out here somewhere and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
Roberto Carlos is out here somewhere and
 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.210
Roberto Carlos is out here somewhere and
we're trying to figure out exactly where

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
we're trying to figure out exactly where
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.310
we're trying to figure out exactly where
he is at least how far he is and so the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320
he is at least how far he is and so the
 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.390
he is at least how far he is and so the
distance that we're trying to figure out

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400
distance that we're trying to figure out
 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.290
distance that we're trying to figure out
is basically from here to the end line

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
is basically from here to the end line
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.640
is basically from here to the end line
and here there's some things that are

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650
and here there's some things that are
 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.199
and here there's some things that are
worth pointing out one thing that I find

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209
worth pointing out one thing that I find
 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.550
worth pointing out one thing that I find
fascinating about soccer fields is that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
fascinating about soccer fields is that
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.040
fascinating about soccer fields is that
they're not all the same size but the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
they're not all the same size but the
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.830
they're not all the same size but the
boxes are all be the same size and I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
boxes are all be the same size and I
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390
boxes are all be the same size and I
hope you'll forgive me that I'm going to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
hope you'll forgive me that I'm going to
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.770
hope you'll forgive me that I'm going to
do it in metric system because that's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780
do it in metric system because that's
 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.360
do it in metric system because that's
those are the numbers that I'm used to

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370
those are the numbers that I'm used to
 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.070
those are the numbers that I'm used to
so in Spanish we call the little box las

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
so in Spanish we call the little box las
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.770
so in Spanish we call the little box las
Cinco cones in quinta because this is 5

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
Cinco cones in quinta because this is 5
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.810
Cinco cones in quinta because this is 5
meters and a half and sometimes in

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820
meters and a half and sometimes in
 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.250
meters and a half and sometimes in
Spanish we call this one la la if you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260
Spanish we call this one la la if you
 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.970
Spanish we call this one la la if you
say it's consequent

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
say it's consequent
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.890
say it's consequent
like this con cincuenta because that's

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
like this con cincuenta because that's
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.530
like this con cincuenta because that's
how that's how long it is 60 meters and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
how that's how long it is 60 meters and
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.060
how that's how long it is 60 meters and
a half what we want to do is somehow

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070
a half what we want to do is somehow
 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.009
a half what we want to do is somehow
figure out how to go from from this

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019
figure out how to go from from this
 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.039
figure out how to go from from this
picture to this picture and right away

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049
picture to this picture and right away
 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.100
picture to this picture and right away
we see an obstacle which is that the the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110
we see an obstacle which is that the the
 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.229
we see an obstacle which is that the the
wall is in the way and so we actually

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239
wall is in the way and so we actually
 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.949
wall is in the way and so we actually
don't know how to draw this green line

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959
don't know how to draw this green line
 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.410
don't know how to draw this green line
because the wall is blocking where you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420
because the wall is blocking where you
 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.210
because the wall is blocking where you
know the reference points and so the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220
know the reference points and so the
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.030
know the reference points and so the
only thing that we're able to do is draw

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
only thing that we're able to do is draw
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.789
only thing that we're able to do is draw
a diagonal line it's as if we were gonna

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799
a diagonal line it's as if we were gonna
 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:38.930
a diagonal line it's as if we were gonna
kick the ball and we actually need to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
kick the ball and we actually need to
 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.850
kick the ball and we actually need to
avoid the wall and draw a diagonal that

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860
avoid the wall and draw a diagonal that
 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.050
avoid the wall and draw a diagonal that
will go from the way the ball is sitting

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060
will go from the way the ball is sitting
 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.449
will go from the way the ball is sitting
to I don't know somewhere precisely the

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459
to I don't know somewhere precisely the
 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.100
to I don't know somewhere precisely the
issue is that because this is a

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110
issue is that because this is a
 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.780
issue is that because this is a
photograph that distorts angles when we

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
photograph that distorts angles when we
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.430
photograph that distorts angles when we
have a right angle here that's not a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440
have a right angle here that's not a
 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.199
have a right angle here that's not a
right angle in the picture and so we

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209
right angle in the picture and so we
 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.670
right angle in the picture and so we
actually don't really know exactly where

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680
actually don't really know exactly where
 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.009
actually don't really know exactly where
the 90 degree here's one thing that that

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019
the 90 degree here's one thing that that
 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.420
the 90 degree here's one thing that that
we might try to do we might try to say

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430
we might try to do we might try to say
 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.180
we might try to do we might try to say
okay since we have to draw a skew line

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190
okay since we have to draw a skew line
 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.500
okay since we have to draw a skew line
over here then we should probably draw

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510
over here then we should probably draw
 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.509
over here then we should probably draw
it over here oh so let me draw it over

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519
it over here oh so let me draw it over
 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.030
it over here oh so let me draw it over
here and I think that the first thing

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040
here and I think that the first thing
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.039
here and I think that the first thing
that I would try to do is I might say

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049
that I would try to do is I might say
 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.550
that I would try to do is I might say
okay well if this distance right here 16

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560
okay well if this distance right here 16
 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.170
okay well if this distance right here 16
and 1/2 and then this distance right

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180
and 1/2 and then this distance right
 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.490
and 1/2 and then this distance right
here is what I'm trying to find let's

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500
here is what I'm trying to find let's
 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.380
here is what I'm trying to find let's
call it X of course if I know X then the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
call it X of course if I know X then the
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.700
call it X of course if I know X then the
distance from the from the ending will

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710
distance from the from the ending will
 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.830
distance from the from the ending will
be X plus sixteen point five then I

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
be X plus sixteen point five then I
 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.760
be X plus sixteen point five then I
think was

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770
think was
 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.070
think was
that might be worth doing is seeing how

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080
that might be worth doing is seeing how
 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.960
that might be worth doing is seeing how
these distance is transferred to this

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
these distance is transferred to this
 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.180
these distance is transferred to this
red line so if I draw this line right

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190
red line so if I draw this line right
 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.189
red line so if I draw this line right
here and this line right here it feels

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199
here and this line right here it feels
 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.899
here and this line right here it feels
like they should be related actually one

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909
like they should be related actually one
 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.360
like they should be related actually one
one thing that is true is that sixteen

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370
one thing that is true is that sixteen
 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.869
one thing that is true is that sixteen
point five divided by X is equal to this

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879
point five divided by X is equal to this
 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.119
point five divided by X is equal to this
distance divided by this distance I

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129
distance divided by this distance I
 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.469
distance divided by this distance I
think it's worth actually drawing a

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479
think it's worth actually drawing a
 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.719
think it's worth actually drawing a
little picture here to keep that in mind

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729
little picture here to keep that in mind
 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:48.980
little picture here to keep that in mind
because that's going to be important

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990
because that's going to be important
 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.260
because that's going to be important
parallel lines like this one in this one

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270
parallel lines like this one in this one
 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.080
parallel lines like this one in this one
they're parallel and if we draw two

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090
they're parallel and if we draw two
 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.050
they're parallel and if we draw two
lines I cross them like this one and

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060
lines I cross them like this one and
 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.320
lines I cross them like this one and
this one then if I measure this distance

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330
this one then if I measure this distance
 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.870
this one then if I measure this distance
let's say I call it a and this distance

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880
let's say I call it a and this distance
 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.719
let's say I call it a and this distance
is B and if I measure these two a prime

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729
is B and if I measure these two a prime
 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.839
is B and if I measure these two a prime
and this distance B Prime and as long as

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849
and this distance B Prime and as long as
 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.399
and this distance B Prime and as long as
these lines are parallel so I'm going to

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409
these lines are parallel so I'm going to
 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.659
these lines are parallel so I'm going to
draw this here to signify that is lines

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669
draw this here to signify that is lines
 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.700
draw this here to signify that is lines
are parallel then I'm going to get that

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710
are parallel then I'm going to get that
 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.689
are parallel then I'm going to get that
a over B is equal to a prime over V

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699
a over B is equal to a prime over V
 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.360
a over B is equal to a prime over V
Prime and so it feels like if I want to

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370
Prime and so it feels like if I want to
 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.089
Prime and so it feels like if I want to
find X and this then then I might be

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099
find X and this then then I might be
 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.860
find X and this then then I might be
able to relate it over here and the good

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870
able to relate it over here and the good
 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.600
able to relate it over here and the good
thing is that these distances I can try

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610
thing is that these distances I can try
 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.459
thing is that these distances I can try
to measure in this picture so I'm going

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469
to measure in this picture so I'm going
 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.680
to measure in this picture so I'm going
to try to do that I'm going to try say

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690
to try to do that I'm going to try say
 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.510
to try to do that I'm going to try say
okay well let's mark this point right

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520
okay well let's mark this point right
 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.309
okay well let's mark this point right
here and I can actually measure these

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319
here and I can actually measure these
 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.170
here and I can actually measure these
things so let me go ahead and do that

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
things so let me go ahead and do that
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.809
things so let me go ahead and do that
this is about seven point three long

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819
this is about seven point three long
 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.779
this is about seven point three long
seven point three centimeters and this

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789
seven point three centimeters and this
 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.450
seven point three centimeters and this
is about 4.5 centimeters so then you

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460
is about 4.5 centimeters so then you
 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.159
is about 4.5 centimeters so then you
might think that sixteen point five

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169
might think that sixteen point five
 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.610
might think that sixteen point five
divided by X since it's equal to this

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620
divided by X since it's equal to this
 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.730
divided by X since it's equal to this
distance divided by this distance you

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740
distance divided by this distance you
 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.309
distance divided by this distance you
might think that that should be equal to

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319
might think that that should be equal to
 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.439
might think that that should be equal to
four point five divided by seven point

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449
four point five divided by seven point
 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.080
four point five divided by seven point
three and then you could use that

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090
three and then you could use that
 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.209
three and then you could use that
equation to solve X except it doesn't

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219
equation to solve X except it doesn't
 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.050
equation to solve X except it doesn't
and and why doesn't it make sense

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060
and and why doesn't it make sense
 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.490
and and why doesn't it make sense
because there's a change in perspective

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500
because there's a change in perspective
 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.279
because there's a change in perspective
because here in in this picture I'm

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289
because here in in this picture I'm
 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.760
because here in in this picture I'm
looking at the field from on top whereas

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770
looking at the field from on top whereas
 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.559
looking at the field from on top whereas
here I'm looking at it from the front

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569
here I'm looking at it from the front
 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.120
here I'm looking at it from the front
and when I do that if I look at it in

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130
and when I do that if I look at it in
 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.510
and when I do that if I look at it in
this way it's it's like when you when

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520
this way it's it's like when you when
 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.939
this way it's it's like when you when
you walk in a room that has a square

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949
you walk in a room that has a square
 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.129
you walk in a room that has a square
grid of tiles and the ones that are

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139
grid of tiles and the ones that are
 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:35.810
grid of tiles and the ones that are
closer to you look bigger than the ones

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820
closer to you look bigger than the ones
 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.249
closer to you look bigger than the ones
that are farther than from you even

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259
that are farther than from you even
 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:38.510
that are farther than from you even
though they're the same size and so we

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520
though they're the same size and so we
 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.260
though they're the same size and so we
have the same issue

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270
have the same issue
 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.620
have the same issue
here that this part over here actually

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630
here that this part over here actually
 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.850
here that this part over here actually
looks bigger than it really is

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860
looks bigger than it really is
 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.620
looks bigger than it really is
and so what we need to figure out is how

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630
and so what we need to figure out is how
 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.470
and so what we need to figure out is how
does a change of perspective change

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480
does a change of perspective change
 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.200
does a change of perspective change
measurements and and this is an

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210
measurements and and this is an
 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.520
measurements and and this is an
interesting thing because this is a very

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530
interesting thing because this is a very
 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.010
interesting thing because this is a very
very classical problem in geometry and

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020
very classical problem in geometry and
 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.530
very classical problem in geometry and
and was first developed when artists and

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540
and was first developed when artists and
 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.820
and was first developed when artists and
geometers were trying to figure out how

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830
geometers were trying to figure out how
 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.240
geometers were trying to figure out how
to draw in perspective and and it's a

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250
to draw in perspective and and it's a
 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.530
to draw in perspective and and it's a
little piece of geometry that has been

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540
little piece of geometry that has been
 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.240
little piece of geometry that has been
somewhat forgotten actually I think we

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250
somewhat forgotten actually I think we
 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.190
somewhat forgotten actually I think we
should talk about it we have a green

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200
should talk about it we have a green
 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.410
should talk about it we have a green
line and a red line and then the

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420
line and a red line and then the
 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.900
line and a red line and then the
question is if I'm standing right here

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910
question is if I'm standing right here
 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.210
question is if I'm standing right here
how do how do the distances in the green

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220
how do how do the distances in the green
 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.770
how do how do the distances in the green
line transporter distances on the red

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780
line transporter distances on the red
 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.240
line transporter distances on the red
line so if I try to draw a picture like

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250
line so if I try to draw a picture like
 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.300
line so if I try to draw a picture like
the one that I drew back here except now

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310
the one that I drew back here except now
 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.670
the one that I drew back here except now
the lines are not parallel they meet at

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680
the lines are not parallel they meet at
 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:38.360
the lines are not parallel they meet at
that point then the question is how does

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:38.370
that point then the question is how does
 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.150
that point then the question is how does
this distance and this distance relate

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160
this distance and this distance relate
 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.790
this distance and this distance relate
to this distance and this distance and

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800
to this distance and this distance and
 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.070
to this distance and this distance and
the trouble is they don't there's

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080
the trouble is they don't there's
 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.050
the trouble is they don't there's
there's no relationship between them no

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060
there's no relationship between them no
 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.310
there's no relationship between them no
matter what two distances you choose

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:49.320
matter what two distances you choose
 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.290
matter what two distances you choose
here you can choose that a place to put

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300
here you can choose that a place to put
 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.580
here you can choose that a place to put
this line so that you can get any other

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:52.590
this line so that you can get any other
 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.080
this line so that you can get any other
two distances here there's no relation

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.090
two distances here there's no relation
 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.910
two distances here there's no relation
between these two numbers and these two

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:55.920
between these two numbers and these two
 

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.610
between these two numbers and these two
numbers and what the classical geometers

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620
numbers and what the classical geometers
 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.530
numbers and what the classical geometers
figured out is that you actually need an

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:00.540
figured out is that you actually need an
 

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.540
figured out is that you actually need an
additional line we're going to introduce

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.550
additional line we're going to introduce
 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.250
additional line we're going to introduce
an additional line I made it very close

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.260
an additional line I made it very close
 

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
an additional line I made it very close
what they figured out is that now if you

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.270
what they figured out is that now if you
 

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.720
what they figured out is that now if you
look at this number over here so if I

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:08.730
look at this number over here so if I
 

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.540
look at this number over here so if I
call this distance a this distance B and

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.550
call this distance a this distance B and
 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.300
call this distance a this distance B and
this distance C and I call this little

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:14.310
this distance C and I call this little
 

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.170
this distance C and I call this little
distance a and this distance B and this

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180
distance a and this distance B and this
 

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.810
distance a and this distance B and this
distance C then the question is how are

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:20.820
distance C then the question is how are
 

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.490
distance C then the question is how are
these related it turns out that the

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500
these related it turns out that the
 

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.920
these related it turns out that the
answer is this beautifully mysterious

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:24.930
answer is this beautifully mysterious
 

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.250
answer is this beautifully mysterious
thing where if you take four points like

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:28.260
thing where if you take four points like
 

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.780
thing where if you take four points like
these four points and maybe I'll call

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:29.790
these four points and maybe I'll call
 

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.630
these four points and maybe I'll call
this a point a B C and D then there's

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640
this a point a B C and D then there's
 

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.670
this a point a B C and D then there's
something called the cross ratio what

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680
something called the cross ratio what
 

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.700
something called the cross ratio what
you do is that you compute the distance

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:37.710
you do is that you compute the distance
 

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.160
you do is that you compute the distance
AC you compute the distance BD you

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.170
AC you compute the distance BD you
 

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.440
AC you compute the distance BD you
multiply them and then you divide by the

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:42.450
multiply them and then you divide by the
 

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.140
multiply them and then you divide by the
distance BC and the distance ad I think

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:45.150
distance BC and the distance ad I think
 

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.670
distance BC and the distance ad I think
this is a totally weird thing to do

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680
this is a totally weird thing to do
 

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.830
this is a totally weird thing to do
that's the cross ratio why do we do this

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:48.840
that's the cross ratio why do we do this
 

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.920
that's the cross ratio why do we do this
because it turns out that this is the

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:51.930
because it turns out that this is the
 

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:52.970
because it turns out that this is the
quantity

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980
quantity
 

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.079
quantity
that is preserved by a change of

00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:54.089
that is preserved by a change of
 

00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:56.240
that is preserved by a change of
perspective so if I compute this

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.250
perspective so if I compute this
 

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.569
perspective so if I compute this
quantity on my red points I'm going to

00:08:59.569 --> 00:08:59.579
quantity on my red points I'm going to
 

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:01.550
quantity on my red points I'm going to
get the same answer as if I compute that

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560
get the same answer as if I compute that
 

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.230
get the same answer as if I compute that
quantity on my green you can imagine for

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240
quantity on my green you can imagine for
 

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.759
quantity on my green you can imagine for
example one way of thinking about this

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:04.769
example one way of thinking about this
 

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:06.379
example one way of thinking about this
is that if I look at this picture you

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:06.389
is that if I look at this picture you
 

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:07.759
is that if I look at this picture you
might think that you know this is a

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:07.769
might think that you know this is a
 

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:09.680
might think that you know this is a
projector and this is a wall and so if

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:09.690
projector and this is a wall and so if
 

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.759
projector and this is a wall and so if
you're trying to project the movie and

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:10.769
you're trying to project the movie and
 

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:12.740
you're trying to project the movie and
you a new angle the protector

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:12.750
you a new angle the protector
 

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.600
you a new angle the protector
differently then you're distorting the

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:14.610
differently then you're distorting the
 

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.699
differently then you're distorting the
picture in the wall and as you know some

00:09:16.699 --> 00:09:16.709
picture in the wall and as you know some
 

00:09:16.709 --> 00:09:17.960
picture in the wall and as you know some
things become bigger some things become

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:17.970
things become bigger some things become
 

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.579
things become bigger some things become
smaller and the question is what doesn't

00:09:19.579 --> 00:09:19.589
smaller and the question is what doesn't
 

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:21.350
smaller and the question is what doesn't
change and it turns out that the one

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360
change and it turns out that the one
 

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.400
change and it turns out that the one
thing that doesn't change is it's a

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:22.410
thing that doesn't change is it's a
 

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.500
thing that doesn't change is it's a
cross-racial it's it's a very strange

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.510
cross-racial it's it's a very strange
 

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.509
cross-racial it's it's a very strange
thing but that's the thing that is going

00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519
thing but that's the thing that is going
 

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:28.519
thing but that's the thing that is going
to allow us to compute Roberto Carlos is

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:28.529
to allow us to compute Roberto Carlos is
 

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:30.620
to allow us to compute Roberto Carlos is
ago because this is just a change of

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:30.630
ago because this is just a change of
 

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.850
ago because this is just a change of
perspective between the angle of the

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860
perspective between the angle of the
 

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.280
perspective between the angle of the
camera and and the angle from the from

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:34.290
camera and and the angle from the from
 

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.710
camera and and the angle from the from
the sky and so we can just compute the

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720
the sky and so we can just compute the
 

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.019
the sky and so we can just compute the
cross ratio and these two pictures and

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:39.029
cross ratio and these two pictures and
 

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:40.699
cross ratio and these two pictures and
get that it should be fixed and we'll

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:40.709
get that it should be fixed and we'll
 

00:09:40.709 --> 00:09:41.900
get that it should be fixed and we'll
figure out the distance one thing you

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:41.910
figure out the distance one thing you
 

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.129
figure out the distance one thing you
might notice we don't have enough

00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:43.139
might notice we don't have enough
 

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:44.870
might notice we don't have enough
information now because to compute the

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880
information now because to compute the
 

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.689
information now because to compute the
cross ratio we need four points and here

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:49.699
cross ratio we need four points and here
 

00:09:49.699 --> 00:09:53.540
cross ratio we need four points and here
when we were looking at these lines at

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:53.550
when we were looking at these lines at
 

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.560
when we were looking at these lines at
the green line that we're trying to

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.570
the green line that we're trying to
 

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.720
the green line that we're trying to
compute we only had we were only paying

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:56.730
compute we only had we were only paying
 

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.559
compute we only had we were only paying
attention to where Roberto Carlos is and

00:09:59.559 --> 00:09:59.569
attention to where Roberto Carlos is and
 

00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:03.500
attention to where Roberto Carlos is and
this point and this point we're missing

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:03.510
this point and this point we're missing
 

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.840
this point and this point we're missing
a fourth point okay now luckily the

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:07.850
a fourth point okay now luckily the
 

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.220
a fourth point okay now luckily the
soccer field have the cinco qin

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:10.230
soccer field have the cinco qin
 

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.430
soccer field have the cinco qin
cincuenta box the call box and so we're

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440
cincuenta box the call box and so we're
 

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.930
cincuenta box the call box and so we're
going to use this point right here this

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940
going to use this point right here this
 

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.340
going to use this point right here this
sixteen point five meters splits up into

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:18.350
sixteen point five meters splits up into
 

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.300
sixteen point five meters splits up into
5.5 here or six yards and 11 here and so

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:23.310
5.5 here or six yards and 11 here and so
 

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.829
5.5 here or six yards and 11 here and so
now what I'm going to do is take instead

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839
now what I'm going to do is take instead
 

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:26.389
now what I'm going to do is take instead
of these four green points I can take

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399
of these four green points I can take
 

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:30.800
of these four green points I can take
this one this one this one and this one

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:30.810
this one this one this one and this one
 

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.259
this one this one this one and this one
and then because of this property right

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:33.269
and then because of this property right
 

00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:35.720
and then because of this property right
here these ratios the red ratios are the

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:35.730
here these ratios the red ratios are the
 

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.460
here these ratios the red ratios are the
same as the green ratios and so one

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:37.470
same as the green ratios and so one
 

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.000
same as the green ratios and so one
thing that I can do is just say that the

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.010
thing that I can do is just say that the
 

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.949
thing that I can do is just say that the
the scaling from here to here is a

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959
the scaling from here to here is a
 

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:45.259
the scaling from here to here is a
constant C and that means that if this

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:45.269
constant C and that means that if this
 

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:48.680
constant C and that means that if this
is five point five then this distance

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:48.690
is five point five then this distance
 

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.610
is five point five then this distance
right here is five point five times C

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:51.620
right here is five point five times C
 

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.240
right here is five point five times C
this one if this is eleven then this

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.250
this one if this is eleven then this
 

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.670
this one if this is eleven then this
distance is eleven times C

00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680
 
 

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.240
 
and if this is X then this is X times C

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.250
and if this is X then this is X times C
 

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.179
and if this is X then this is X times C
and so we're going to be computing the

00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:07.189
and so we're going to be computing the
 

00:11:07.189 --> 00:11:09.790
and so we're going to be computing the
cross ratio over here which means that

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800
cross ratio over here which means that
 

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.319
cross ratio over here which means that
we should come and measure it over here

00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:11.329
we should come and measure it over here
 

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:14.559
we should come and measure it over here
in our furrow of the Roberto Carlos goal

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:14.569
in our furrow of the Roberto Carlos goal
 

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:16.240
in our furrow of the Roberto Carlos goal
so now I'm going to consider this point

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:16.250
so now I'm going to consider this point
 

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.009
so now I'm going to consider this point
right here so that I can have four

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:18.019
right here so that I can have four
 

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:21.280
right here so that I can have four
points to compute my cross ratio and so

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:21.290
points to compute my cross ratio and so
 

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.100
points to compute my cross ratio and so
now this distance over here was four

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:24.110
now this distance over here was four
 

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.949
now this distance over here was four
point five and so now we should figure

00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959
point five and so now we should figure
 

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.269
point five and so now we should figure
out how much is this and how much is

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279
out how much is this and how much is
 

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:31.960
out how much is this and how much is
this now I can make a wrong guess the

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:31.970
this now I can make a wrong guess the
 

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.319
this now I can make a wrong guess the
wrong guess is that you know in the real

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:35.329
wrong guess is that you know in the real
 

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:38.499
wrong guess is that you know in the real
picture this is twice this and so I

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:38.509
picture this is twice this and so I
 

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:40.720
picture this is twice this and so I
might get oh then this would be twice

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:40.730
might get oh then this would be twice
 

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.100
might get oh then this would be twice
this it should be three and one point

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.110
this it should be three and one point
 

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.199
this it should be three and one point
five but we talked about how in this

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:44.209
five but we talked about how in this
 

00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:46.030
five but we talked about how in this
picture these distances are look longer

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040
picture these distances are look longer
 

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.379
picture these distances are look longer
they're closer to you so I think when I

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:47.389
they're closer to you so I think when I
 

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:48.639
they're closer to you so I think when I
measure this I should get that this

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:48.649
measure this I should get that this
 

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:49.809
measure this I should get that this
should be bigger than two times this

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:49.819
should be bigger than two times this
 

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:52.119
should be bigger than two times this
there's our distortion there so let's

00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:52.129
there's our distortion there so let's
 

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:54.009
there's our distortion there so let's
take out the ruler and measure it one

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:54.019
take out the ruler and measure it one
 

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:56.800
take out the ruler and measure it one
point three and so as I just discussed

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:56.810
point three and so as I just discussed
 

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.150
point three and so as I just discussed
that this should be more than twice this

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160
that this should be more than twice this
 

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.980
that this should be more than twice this
and so now we can compute the the cross

00:11:59.980 --> 00:11:59.990
and so now we can compute the the cross
 

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.220
and so now we can compute the the cross
ratio for these four points and for

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.230
ratio for these four points and for
 

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.360
ratio for these four points and for
these four points and I should get the

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
these four points and I should get the
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.189
these four points and I should get the
same answer so why don't we go ahead and

00:12:06.189 --> 00:12:06.199
same answer so why don't we go ahead and
 

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:08.619
same answer so why don't we go ahead and
do that this formula tells me that I

00:12:08.619 --> 00:12:08.629
do that this formula tells me that I
 

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:10.900
do that this formula tells me that I
should take this distance which is four

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:10.910
should take this distance which is four
 

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.299
should take this distance which is four
point five then I should take BD which

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:13.309
point five then I should take BD which
 

00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:15.100
point five then I should take BD which
is this distance three point two plus

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.110
is this distance three point two plus
 

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.809
is this distance three point two plus
seven point three that's about ten point

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:16.819
seven point three that's about ten point
 

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:19.749
seven point three that's about ten point
five and divide by the small distance in

00:12:19.749 --> 00:12:19.759
five and divide by the small distance in
 

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:21.400
five and divide by the small distance in
the middle which is three point two

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:21.410
the middle which is three point two
 

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.650
the middle which is three point two
times the big distance which is eleven

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:23.660
times the big distance which is eleven
 

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.449
times the big distance which is eleven
point eight so this is the close ratio

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:25.459
point eight so this is the close ratio
 

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:28.689
point eight so this is the close ratio
in the photo one point two five one

00:12:28.689 --> 00:12:28.699
in the photo one point two five one
 

00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:30.400
in the photo one point two five one
let's do maybe two three digits and so

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:30.410
let's do maybe two three digits and so
 

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.929
let's do maybe two three digits and so
that's what I can measure that's in the

00:12:31.929 --> 00:12:31.939
that's what I can measure that's in the
 

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:34.389
that's what I can measure that's in the
photo that's the measure cross ratio now

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399
photo that's the measure cross ratio now
 

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:36.699
photo that's the measure cross ratio now
what is the real cross ratio let's

00:12:36.699 --> 00:12:36.709
what is the real cross ratio let's
 

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:39.790
what is the real cross ratio let's
compute it over here so first I'm

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800
compute it over here so first I'm
 

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.129
compute it over here so first I'm
supposed to take the distance from here

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:42.139
supposed to take the distance from here
 

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:45.519
supposed to take the distance from here
to here right now that's five point five

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:45.529
to here right now that's five point five
 

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:47.939
to here right now that's five point five
C plus eleven C so there's going to be

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:47.949
C plus eleven C so there's going to be
 

00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:52.360
C plus eleven C so there's going to be
sixteen point five C now I'm supposed to

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:52.370
sixteen point five C now I'm supposed to
 

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.049
sixteen point five C now I'm supposed to
compute this distance 11 C plus X C so

00:12:56.049 --> 00:12:56.059
compute this distance 11 C plus X C so
 

00:12:56.059 --> 00:12:58.809
compute this distance 11 C plus X C so
I'll factor out the C and I'll get 11

00:12:58.809 --> 00:12:58.819
I'll factor out the C and I'll get 11
 

00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:02.049
I'll factor out the C and I'll get 11
plus X times C and now I'm supposed to

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:02.059
plus X times C and now I'm supposed to
 

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:04.329
plus X times C and now I'm supposed to
divide this by the small distance in the

00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:04.339
divide this by the small distance in the
 

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:07.360
divide this by the small distance in the
middle which is 11 C and this big

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:07.370
middle which is 11 C and this big
 

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.579
middle which is 11 C and this big
distance which is sixteen point five C

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:09.589
distance which is sixteen point five C
 

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:12.319
distance which is sixteen point five C
plus XC and

00:13:12.319 --> 00:13:12.329
plus XC and
 

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:14.780
plus XC and
I'll factor out the C now one lovely

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:14.790
I'll factor out the C now one lovely
 

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.340
I'll factor out the C now one lovely
thing that happens here is that all the

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:16.350
thing that happens here is that all the
 

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.710
thing that happens here is that all the
C's cancel out like this cancels out

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720
C's cancel out like this cancels out
 

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.769
C's cancel out like this cancels out
with this this cancels out with this and

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779
with this this cancels out with this and
 

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:23.210
with this this cancels out with this and
so we just get something in terms of X

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220
so we just get something in terms of X
 

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.729
so we just get something in terms of X
this is the measured cross ratio this is

00:13:25.729 --> 00:13:25.739
this is the measured cross ratio this is
 

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:28.309
this is the measured cross ratio this is
the real cross ratio and then the magic

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:28.319
the real cross ratio and then the magic
 

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:29.239
the real cross ratio and then the magic
here is that these two numbers are

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:29.249
here is that these two numbers are
 

00:13:29.249 --> 00:13:31.220
here is that these two numbers are
actually equal to each other so this is

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:31.230
actually equal to each other so this is
 

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:37.400
actually equal to each other so this is
equal to this one 81.5 plus sixteen

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:37.410
equal to this one 81.5 plus sixteen
 

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.289
equal to this one 81.5 plus sixteen
point five x is equal to one eighty one

00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:42.299
point five x is equal to one eighty one
 

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:47.449
point five x is equal to one eighty one
point five plus 11 x times one point two

00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459
point five plus 11 x times one point two
 

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:54.229
point five plus 11 x times one point two
five one so that's equal to x one point

00:13:54.229 --> 00:13:54.239
five one so that's equal to x one point
 

00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:57.889
five one so that's equal to x one point
two five one equals so through value of

00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899
two five one equals so through value of
 

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:00.199
two five one equals so through value of
x all right all right so that's how far

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:00.209
x all right all right so that's how far
 

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:01.579
x all right all right so that's how far
he is from the box

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:01.589
he is from the box
 

00:14:01.589 --> 00:14:03.229
he is from the box
so that's how far he is from the box

00:14:03.229 --> 00:14:03.239
so that's how far he is from the box
 

00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:06.669
so that's how far he is from the box
exactly so X is equal to approximately

00:14:06.669 --> 00:14:06.679
exactly so X is equal to approximately
 

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:10.460
exactly so X is equal to approximately
16 point sixty three which if you look

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:10.470
16 point sixty three which if you look
 

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.160
16 point sixty three which if you look
at it it's actually pretty much the size

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:13.170
at it it's actually pretty much the size
 

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.829
at it it's actually pretty much the size
of the box right so the the box is

00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839
of the box right so the the box is
 

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:17.869
of the box right so the the box is
sixteen point five and he's sixteen

00:14:17.869 --> 00:14:17.879
sixteen point five and he's sixteen
 

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:20.299
sixteen point five and he's sixteen
point six away so he's basically two

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:20.309
point six away so he's basically two
 

00:14:20.309 --> 00:14:22.309
point six away so he's basically two
boxes away from the goal line and then

00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:22.319
boxes away from the goal line and then
 

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:24.979
boxes away from the goal line and then
if we add this so that's it that's how

00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:24.989
if we add this so that's it that's how
 

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:28.759
if we add this so that's it that's how
you do this it's pretty cool no I really

00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:28.769
you do this it's pretty cool no I really
 

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:30.319
you do this it's pretty cool no I really
thought this was a lot easier I actually

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:30.329
thought this was a lot easier I actually
 

00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:32.689
thought this was a lot easier I actually
had to I mean I'll tell you how this

00:14:32.689 --> 00:14:32.699
had to I mean I'll tell you how this
 

00:14:32.699 --> 00:14:34.369
had to I mean I'll tell you how this
happened I was teaching a gym class in

00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:34.379
happened I was teaching a gym class in
 

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:36.619
happened I was teaching a gym class in
geometry and it came time to the

00:14:36.619 --> 00:14:36.629
geometry and it came time to the
 

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:38.210
geometry and it came time to the
projected to teach projective geometry

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220
projected to teach projective geometry
 

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.530
projected to teach projective geometry
and I learned about the conservation in

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540
and I learned about the conservation in
 

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.789
and I learned about the conservation in
that class that I was teaching for the

00:14:40.789 --> 00:14:40.799
that class that I was teaching for the
 

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:42.979
that class that I was teaching for the
first time and I thought wow this sounds

00:14:42.979 --> 00:14:42.989
first time and I thought wow this sounds
 

00:14:42.989 --> 00:14:45.079
first time and I thought wow this sounds
actually really powerful I've come to
