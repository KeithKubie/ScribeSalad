you

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
 
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.999
 
so particle physicists we're trying to

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:11.009
so particle physicists we're trying to
 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.320
so particle physicists we're trying to
understand sub structure of matter

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
understand sub structure of matter
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.330
understand sub structure of matter
what's really out there what's at the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
what's really out there what's at the
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.640
what's really out there what's at the
core it matter how it interacts what are

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650
core it matter how it interacts what are
 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.679
core it matter how it interacts what are
the fundamental forces and as you go to

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689
the fundamental forces and as you go to
 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.970
the fundamental forces and as you go to
deeper and deeper skills you've learned

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
deeper and deeper skills you've learned
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.550
deeper and deeper skills you've learned
different things so there's sort of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560
different things so there's sort of
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.409
different things so there's sort of
two-pronged approach there's some very

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419
two-pronged approach there's some very
 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.089
two-pronged approach there's some very
theoretical work that goes on and this

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099
theoretical work that goes on and this
 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.130
theoretical work that goes on and this
some very experimentally oriented work

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

out there and we try to derive what the
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.440
out there and we try to derive what the
consequences would be in tests whether

there's a number of questions that we

we can we can figure out what that

something deep and fundamental telling
 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.330
something deep and fundamental telling
us that the Large Hadron Collider might

actually be able to produce the Dark

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840
actually be able to produce the Dark

Matter particle it might not produce it

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880
Matter particle it might not produce it
 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.220
Matter particle it might not produce it
directly but it could produce something

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230
directly but it could produce something
