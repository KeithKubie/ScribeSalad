It's funny, because I'll
tell people I work at Google.

00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:03.790
And they'll go,
what do you work on?

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.535
I design Search.

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:07.980
And they kind of pause for
a second, and they're like,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.490
what is there to design?

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.990

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.080
Design is a balance
between a number

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.910
of things-- the utility, the
usability, and the beauty.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.310
I think that you kind of
require those three ingredients.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.801
One of the first
things that I did

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.175
when I joined the
Search team was

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:29.840
that I said that
Search was too slow.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.335
The response was,
well, we probably

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:33.710
have to change
the speed of light

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.880
in order to solve
this problem, OK?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.940
And I said, no, I think
it could be faster.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.810
The box in which you type,
it was the default size

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.540
that input boxes
are in the browser.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.440
And so for like a decade,
that's what it was.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.200
This is the way in which
people are talking to Google.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.270
They're doing it through
this tiny little box.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.252
I said, well, why don't
we make that bigger?

00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:51.710
It was a very simple
design change.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.620
We just made the
input box larger.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.800
Commensurately, the
font size got larger.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.977
And the autocompletions
gets larger.

00:00:57.977 --> 00:00:59.560
And people started
noticing them more.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.018
By noticing them more, they
actually started using it more.

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:05.190
They were actually able to
get to the answer they wanted

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.140
faster, just by tweaking
the size of this box.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.780
There's lots of things that look
very small that you might not

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.820
notice that we changed to
make the experience better.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.790
Over time, it actually
really adds up.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.960
I still think it's too slow.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.070
That's why we're investing
so heavily in the voice

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.760
experience, because it's
actually much easier to ask

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.324
more complicated questions than
if you had to type them in,

00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:26.490
particularly if you have
to type them in on a phone.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700
As you speak, the
words are appearing,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.984
and it feels so fluid and fast.

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:33.400
Once you start removing these
speed bumps, even if they're

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.420
tiny speed bumps and just
getting them out of the way,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.660
that's pretty transformative.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.880
Arthur C. Clarke
has a famous quote.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700
"Any sufficiently
advanced technology

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.670
is indistinguishable
from magic."

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.640
To make magic is to actually
make the technology go away.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.560
That's what I see my job
is, is to craft experiences

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.460
that just work.
