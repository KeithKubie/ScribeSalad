00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.349
That Time a Flying Pig Grounded Every Plane
at London's Heathrow Airport

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.650
Imagine if you will that you’re sitting
in an airport waiting to go on vacation.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.170
Suddenly and without warning you hear a voice
over the tannoy system informing you that

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.310
every single plane scheduled that day had
been grounded.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
As your mind begins to think of all the horrible
things that could have caused the delay, you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.660
hear the voice again informing you that flights
have been grounded not by a freak storm, crash

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.370
or technical glitch, but by an escaped flying
pig.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.690
As unbelievable as it’s going to sound,
this is genuinely something that once happened

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.360
in London in the 1970s thanks to the band
Pink Floyd and their gigantic pig shaped balloon.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.530
In 1976, Pink Floyd recorded an album called
Animals which drew inspiration from the 1945

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.140
novel Animal Farm, a thinly veiled allegory
of Soviet communism that prominently features

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.789
pigs as characters.

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.730
After the album was recorded, the band met
with a design team called Hipgnosis to create

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.849
the album’s cover.

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:15.180
Despite being regarded by many as some of
the best album designers of all time (working

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.160
with and designing albums for the likes of
AC/DC, ELO, Styx and Rainbow), all of Hipgnosis’

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.880
ideas fell flat with the band.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.000
For instance, a notable idea pitched by the
group was an album cover featuring a young

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.830
boy walking in on his parents in the middle
of a bout of vigorous intercourse- an idea

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.800
the band unsurprisingly poo pooed.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.840
Battersea-Power-StationAfter some deliberation,
bassist Roger Waters suggested to Aubrey Powell

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.950
of Hipgnosis that they use Battersea Power
Station as the backdrop for the cover.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.160
Waters later explained to Rolling Stone, “I’d
always loved Battersea Power Station, just

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.760
as a piece of architecture.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.630
And I thought it had some good symbolic connections
with Pink Floyd as it was at that point.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.830
One, I thought it was a power station, that’s
pretty obvious.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.750
And two, that it had four legs.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.729
If you inverted it, it was like a table.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.599
And there were four bits to it, representing
the four members of the band…”

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.420
(I’m getting a definite This is Spinal Tap
vibe here…

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.420
Just me?)

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.570
The band had recently commissioned a gigantic
40 ft. inflatable pig for their upcoming tour.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.700
Putting two and two together, Powell stated
in an interview that when the pair were discussing

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.480
the power station idea, “Roger and I both
looked up at the Station, and said, ‘let’s

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.780
fly the pig between the chimneys’.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.780
Just like that.”

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.070
After applying for what we can only assume
was an ungodly amount of permits to float

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.500
a giant balloon shaped like a pig above an
(at the time) operational major power station,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.080
the band with help from Powell picked out
the best angle from which to shoot the cover.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.390
Other prep work included hiring an expert
marksman who was given orders to shoot the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.970
pig down should it escape.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.190
The band then decided on a date on which to
shoot the photo- December 2, 1976, a day which

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.540
was supposed to be mostly clear with some
cloud, which the band specifically wanted

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.510
so that the sky didn’t look “boring”,
or as boring as it could be with a giant floating

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.630
pig in the middle of it.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.290
However, on the day of the shoot, the pig
wouldn’t inflate for reasons never explained

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.300
in any interview we could find.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.190
This annoyed Powell to no end because, “that
day there was the most incredible, Turner-esque

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.190
sky.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.350
But for some reason, the pig wasn’t inflating.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.980
I shot the Station anyway, because the sky
was so amazing.”

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.000
After trying and failing to inflate the pig
for several hours, the band gave up and they

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.290
agreed to come back the next day.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.190
The group returned and, oddly, this time the
pig inflated just fine.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.220
After painstakingly attaching the pig to Battersea’s
southernmost chimney, disaster struck as the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.620
tether holding the balloon in place broke
during a wind gust, causing the gigantic inflatable

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.790
porcine to begin lazily drifting away.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.750
The pig was loose.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.110
So what happened to the sniper they hired
for just such a bizarre event?

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.160
Well, apparently the manager simply forgot
to tell him or his gun that they required

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.620
his services the next day.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.140
So he never showed up.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.040
As the pig began to climb ever higher, rising
to heights no pig, inflatable or otherwise,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.270
had ever hoped or dared to dream, a terrible
realisation crept over those watching it sail

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.690
toward the heavens- the pig was flying directly
towards Heathrow airport.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.150
As panic began to set in, the band did what
many would do in such a situation, according

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.680
to Powell, “Pink Floyd left the site.”

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.450
Moments after the skyward swine escaped, Heathrow
officials received several communiqués from

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.710
pilots in passing planes matter-of-factly
telling them that they’d just seen a giant

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.450
pig float past their windows.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.450
After realising that the calls weren’t a
joke, all flights from the airport were grounded.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.110
As the pig danced around in the sky, police
helicopters and eventually the RAF were called

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.950
in to chase it down, but to no avail; by the
time they arrived the pig was gone and, despite

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.930
their sincerest efforts, they couldn’t find
it.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.040
With the pig off enjoying its freedom and
the band having absconded the scene of the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.100
crime, this left Aubrey Powell to take the
fall.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.160
After police arrived, according to Powell,
he was promptly arrested and taken in for

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160
questioning.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.940
Meanwhile the band, who’d managed to retain
their freedom, set about trying to find the

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.240
pig- giant inflatable pigs not being cheap,
after all.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.380
Using their status as Pink Floyd, they were
able to convince radio stations across the

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.340
country to plead with listeners to keep their
eyes peeled for a giant floating pig, providing

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.780
a number they could call if they happened
to see it.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.710
Almost immediately this number was flooded
with prank calls because, of course it was.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.150
However, at around 9:30 pm that evening, a
phone call from an irate farmer in Kent (about

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.970
40 miles or 65 km away) came in, with the
farmer sharply asking “Are you the guy looking

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.220
for a pig?”

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.240
After having this fact affirmed, the farmer
angrily told the group that such an object

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.450
had landed on his farm and was currently scaring
all his cows.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.040
After getting the man’s details, Powell,
along with the police, went and collected

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.560
the swine which was miraculously undamaged
from its adventure.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.130
pink-floyd-animalsSurprisingly, the police
and officials at Battersea allowed the band

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.460
to come back and re-shoot their album cover,
with the proviso that they actually bring

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.570
the sharpshooter along this time.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.870
Although Powell was able to get shots with
the tethered pig, the sky that day was entirely

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.750
clear and he ended up hating how they looked
initially.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.199
However, he was able to get the shot he wanted
by using a photo from the first day and superimposing

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.280
the pig on top of it.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.730
Sans Photoshop, this did not look that great
if you looked too closely at the picture.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.350
As such, this all went against Waters’ original
requirements that the “picture should be

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.979
real”, rather than superimposing the pig,
as Powell had at one point suggested before

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.410
the whole debacle.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.810
This nevertheless all ended up working out
for the band swimmingly.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.889
As Powell later noted, the escaped pig “was
front-page news: Pink Floyd couldn’t have

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.870
got better publicity if they tried.”

00:06:48.870 --> 00:08:01.110
After its little adventure, the pig went on
tour with the band later the following year.
