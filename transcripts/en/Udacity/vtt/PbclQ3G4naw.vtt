00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Once I understand who my archetypes or persona is, the next thing I want to figure out

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is how do I get them in to this funnel.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Regardless of whether it's web or mobile, I need to somehow figure out

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
how to get the interest of my customer archetypes--Dave in the major urban area

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or Sally in the Midwest or someone in China or India.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
How do I get them interested, and there are two types of ways to create demand.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The first set of things are paid demand creation activities.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Fancy word for saying--I'm going to pay somebody to get your interest.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
First people I might want to pay is the public relations agency.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I might pay them a certain fee per month to help get stories about my products

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and or my company in newspapers or in blogs or in tech journals, etc.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And so hiring a PR agency is a paid demand creation activities.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Another common paid activity is advertising. What kind of advertising?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, it depends what my archetype reads.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If they read a blog, I want somehow get either keywords or better ads or something in the blog.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If they read newspapers, tech journals, or listen to radio or television,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that is I want to match my demand creation activities to what I know about my archetype.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm not just going to randomly do this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm actually going to try to match what I know to what I'm going to pay for.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Next thing could be trade shows. In some industries, people still physically go to trade shows.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Have booths, walk the aisles, meet people.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Maybe I should be in one and have a booth and maybe I'll find out my archetypes don't even care,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and by the way, just as inside, you might also want to be worried about whether your partner show up.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Maybe they show up at trade shows.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The other thing is that I might find out that such trade shows or webinars might be interesting

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
or I just might want to be sending them e-mail or direct mail.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
US post office or post offices in other countries are still happy to carry your advertising.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Though this become less and less effective the more and more people are on the web,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and then finally search engine marketing, Google ads or Facebook ads, etc.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
are now just a standard way to pay for demand creation activities

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
regardless of whether it's a physical channel or a mobile channel.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
All of these activities are designed to feed the sales model.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The demand creation funnel is going to fed by these things you do.
