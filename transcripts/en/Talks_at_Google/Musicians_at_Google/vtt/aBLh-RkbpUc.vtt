00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:02.250
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hi, I'm Nick Dedina.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.170
I'm with the Music, Google Music Group.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.380
And we are here today with Nick Mason.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.250
Who has done so much in his career besides
working with people like Robert Wyatt and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.829
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: The Damned.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:18.829
[laughs]

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.710
&gt;&gt;Nick: The Damned, which is big on my list.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.789
He's also been Pink Floyd's longest serving
and I would say probably the original member

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:28.829
of the band.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.929
And been their drummer.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.439
He's an amazing musician.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.710
And, really looking forward to talking to
him.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.340
And, welcome.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.609
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Thank you.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:42.609
[applause]

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:50.340
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, we, I know we've just
had the first batch of Pink Floyd remasters.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.879
We kinda got to jump into there.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.699
And we also have The Wall coming out.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:56.719
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Mm-hm.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.850
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What was it like kinda not
only going through your, you know, your history

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.220
with the band and all the music you made,
but also going through the vaults and hearing

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.470
all this stuff you probably hadn't known about
or hadn't remembered?

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.580
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Well, fascinating exercise.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.660
Inevitably.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.260
Because that's absolutely true.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.070
You forget the notes that were made.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.640
And it's extraordinary in a way that anything
remains.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.740
Because the tendency was to, just discard
things in the way that, if there'd been sketches

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.320
or if there'd been notes on paper.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.700
You just think, at the time, you think the
only thing that matters is the finished product.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.750
The finished album.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.590
And so actually, far more interesting exercise
than I think we ever thought.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.110
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: so you guys, I know you
started really working with some of the people

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.390
before Pink Floyd.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.820
Even kind of officially was a band.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.350
But one of the surprises for me was hearing
the early sessions with Syd Barrett and it

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.220
didn't seem like he needed that much of a
run up time for his talent to be exposed.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.430
Those were really good, really strong material.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.170
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: I think that some writers, some,
someone like Syd was a natural talent.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.230
The interesting thing is, in a way, that if
you look at Roger's first song.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.610
On "Piper at the Gates of Dawn."

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.800
"Doctor, Doctor" I mean, no disrespect but
it's not a great song.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.220
But with application, within another album,
his writing set of controls were far more

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.250
complex songs.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.280
That really worked.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.770
But it's that thing of, some people it just
comes like that, other people have to work

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.770
to it.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.480
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So I kind of always thought
you guys were these musos.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.450
You know these just, you really picked up
your instruments and played.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.700
And we had talked a little earlier about,
with The Damned.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.700
And the punk.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700
But you guys were kind of, it's what you did.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.910
And you really had a proficiency that just
went up.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.490
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: The last of the gifted amateurs
is what I would say.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.490
[laughter]

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.490
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.630
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: I mean, because I would say,
we, it's one of the interesting differences

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.880
I think between then and now.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.230
Is that time, at the time there wasn't anyone
to teach you to play the electric guitar or

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.570
rock drums or anything like that.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.880
You listened to something that you heard on
the radio.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.290
And you thought, "How'd they do that?"

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.500
[taps on knees] you know.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.150
Whereas now, certainly my experience with
my kids is that at school they can go and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.450
take classes and they can actually sit grades
playing Jimi Hendrix tracks.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.600
It's wonderful.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.290
But it leads to a new level of musicianship,
I think today.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.440
Which, I, has to, I love.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.780
I think it's great.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.040
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But there's that balance
between your craft and your creativity, and—

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.430
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.020
Like naive painting or something.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:10.380
In some ways, well, again, interesting that
so often classical players are terribly inhibited

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.300
by their training.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.810
And very rarely can break out and improvise.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.939
And there are quite a number of great players
who have wanted to improvise and been absolutely

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.080
unable to.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.469
I mean, this is perhaps one of my favorite
stories about the whole experience of doing

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:38.210
these, these editions recently.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.270
But the nicest one was when we were working
on "Wish You Were Here."

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:51.520
We were playing the track and Yehudi Menuhin
and Stephane Grapelli were working in studio.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.229
I think we were in Studio 3 in Abbey Road,
then Studio 2.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.960
And they came in just to see what we were
up to.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.999
And we invited them to play.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.779
And Stephane Grapelli absolutely just went
in and knocked something out.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.280
And that's one of the elements that's in the
package.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.370
And Yehudi would really like to have played
but was far too uneasy at the prospect of

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.820
improvising.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.900
And in a way that is, I'd say it's sad.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.839
But that is perhaps the price you pay for
being the virtuoso.

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:30.379
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's one of the real treasures
of that.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.379
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Mm-hmm.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.639
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Is that, not just his work.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.659
I don't know if you sat, if you guys sat down
with him and told him what the song was about.

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:39.659
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: God no.

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:40.659
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And what the lyrics were
about.

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:41.659
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Absolutely no.

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:42.659
Never.

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.439
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But his solo really fits
the mood and extends.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.569
It does what a solo is supposed to do.

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.569
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:47.569
Absolutely.

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:48.569
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It spins the emotion of
the piece so beautifully.

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.379
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Now you just responded to listening
to the track.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So I mean to invite someone
like him in to play with you.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.340
I imagine, you could tell by Pink Floyd's
work, you guys have had such a vast interest

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.789
in music.

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:10.009
Not just the, you know, the kind of sharp
subdivisions of music.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.129
What did you listen to growing up?

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.550
And how did you eventually get to the drums?

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:22.110
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Uh, well, I think all of us
listened to, I mean, the beginnings of rock

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.110
and roll.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.199
Which would have been Elvis and Bill Haley
and so on.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:33.439
I mean, they, it was, well, I can remember
that the first rock and roll that I heard

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:37.430
on the radio, you, the BBC simply didn't play
it.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.280
It was Radio Luxembourg, one hour on a Friday
night.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.979
Called "Rocking to Dreamland," I think.

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:49.099
It was a very small, small thing in Europe
anyway.

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:55.479
And so I think we, that inevitably was the
primary influence.

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:01.029
But I think we probably all listened to, well
perhaps a broader range of music.

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:02.570
Certainly quite a lot of classical music.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.369
But also jazz.

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:06.649
Tried jazz.

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.889
And then all the be-bop era stuff.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.199
Certainly in my case.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:18.809
I had, and still do really, like all the sort
of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and so on.

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:24.449
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And so this led to you guys,
I mean you were one of the first bands really

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:29.800
and especially first British bands, where
it wasn't something you guys had to do.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.490
Or you felt like it was your option.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.830
You had came from very interesting families.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.249
Your father has, did very interesting work.

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:43.689
And you instead, you guys decided you know,
to play music.

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:45.740
And it started as a lark, or?

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:53.470
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah, I suppose the thing is,
well, the sociology of it, if you like.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:59.169
I suppose we were part of that change where
rock and roll started coming from the middle

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:01.960
classes rather than anywhere else.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.929
And previous to that had been sort of a working
class concept.

00:08:06.929 --> 00:08:12.900
And then the, I suppose around earlyish '60s.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.729
And certainly, I'm talking UK always here.

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:19.759
What really happened were the art schools
started turning up the bands.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:24.620
And that includes a band called The Pretty
Things who were one of the earliest of those.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.289
But the Beatles certainly had an element of
the art school.

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:36.089
And certainly, and the Rolling Stones were
sort of a college band rather than sort of

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:41.469
working class off the railways which had been
the early English rock scene.

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:44.660
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah, I read a thing with
Mick Jones of "The Clash".

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.279
Where he said he went to art school because
he wanted to be in a rock and roll band.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.370
And he didn't know how to do it and that's
where he heard you did it.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.370
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: [laughs]

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.759
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And he said as a byproduct
of that, he got a great art education.

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:57.149
And used that for the sleeves and the costumes.

00:08:57.149 --> 00:08:58.149
[inaudible]

00:08:58.149 --> 00:08:59.149
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah.

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:01.279
Well, I have to say for, I mean, we weren't
quite art school.

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.019
We were architecture school.

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:05.839
And it was absolutely brilliant training.

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:09.829
I mean, first of all, it was a sort of government
funded initiative.

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:14.399
In that we got a grant to go.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.399
Architecture's a very long course.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:17.410
So you've got sort of a good seven years.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.250
If it was gonna take a while to learn some
of those drum patterns.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.070
[laughter]

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:29.730
And also in our case it led to a lot of other
spinoffs in terms of people that we later

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:36.740
worked with who were not necessarily musicians
but became lighting designers, stage designers.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.920
Best known of all is Mark Fisher.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:47.860
Who did the original designs for The Wall
and the mechanics of the way The Wall worked.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.660
And fell down and all the rest of it.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.950
Mark was a contemporary of ours.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.759
He was at the AA which was the other architectural
school in London.

00:09:55.759 --> 00:10:01.310
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So that's another element
you guys kind of brought was, I mean, I think

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.410
maybe Alice Cooper later.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.339
Your, there's the element of your music and
then there's the element of your life, presentation,

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:10.890
which certainly evolved over the years.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.890
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Uh, yeah.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.430
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Was that a conscious or—

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.069
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: I'm just making the connection
with Alice Cooper and thinking about the snakes.

00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:18.069
[laughter]

00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:19.069
We never really did snakes.

00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:20.069
Sorry.

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:21.069
What—

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:27.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: No, but there was a, I don't
know if it was part of the British underground

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.810
scene but there always seemed to be your stage
shows there was more elements to your stage

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:35.810
shows than—

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.690
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Well, I think that was, yeah,
that was again, that was connected to the

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.690
architecture element.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:48.190
Because there was, we had a part time lecturer
who spent half the time at Hornsey College

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.970
of Art and half the time at Regent Street.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:59.480
And he was working at Hornsey, with light
and sound workshops.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:05.959
The idea of these light shows being the sort
of potential of the next paintings hanging

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:07.050
on the walls.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:14.300
And we went and supplied music for this.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.579
This exercise at Hornsey.

00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:21.269
And this didn't come out of our school at
all, funnily enough.

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:26.649
And that was sort of about being right place,
right time.

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:32.900
I mean I think most bands need, I think all
bands actually need that mix.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:38.670
I mean however good you are or however bad,
you need to be, in the right place at the

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.670
right time.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.240
You know two years earlier, wouldn't have
happened.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.699
Two years later it wouldn't have happened.

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:44.250
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So what's the film?

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.089
It's a wonderful movie uh, "Blowup?"

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:47.310
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Oh yes.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.310
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Blowup.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:55.170
I mean, seeing that as an American now, I
think it's supposed to be very glamorous and

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:59.050
you realize London is still coming out of
a war.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.129
There's still like bomb sites in the film
and it's a little shabby.

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:07.800
But I always use that as a kind of thing that
maybe the world that Pink Floyd was involved

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800
in.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800
Or?

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:16.430
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: I think, well we were sort of
slightly, we were sort of mid-60s, I suppose.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:21.949
Now, I think we were into this new, I mean,
it was the London underground.

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:29.819
But it was also that change where younger
people were actually making money.

00:12:29.819 --> 00:12:31.149
And this was the big change.

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:40.269
I mean up until when England came out of that
whole post-war period, up until then, young

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:43.120
people were apprentices.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.939
I mean was the sort of thinking, more or less.

00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:51.700
And suddenly they had this thing with these
particularly, I mean, before us, the young

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.550
photographers and the whole sort of old fashioned
thing.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.160
As well as the music.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.819
It was a pretty broad brush.

00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:03.190
And it was you know, it was the '60s. we were
all really worried about what we were gonna

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.529
do with all our free time.

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:05.529
[laughter]

00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:09.160
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So that's one of the differences
between Britain and America at that time.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.769
It just seems to be the amount of money the
consumer had, or what materials cost.

00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:21.779
But I think an outshoot of that was, at that
time Britain was more singles orientated and

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:23.639
America was more LP orientated.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:32.399
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah, I mean, not, again, I
can only, my experience is England.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:39.010
And the key moment was really Sergeant Pepper
and that was back, because that was the moment

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.079
at which the album sales overtook the singles.

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:45.899
And that was an absolute change.

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:48.860
And again, that's, that comes back to what
I was saying earlier.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.870
We were right place, right time.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:56.699
Because the way we worked was really suited
to the concept of working on an album basis

00:13:56.699 --> 00:13:58.329
rather than a single basis.

00:13:58.329 --> 00:14:02.709
I mean, our first recordings were absolutely
geared to the idea that we had to have the

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:03.709
hit single.

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:09.939
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And that's strange, kind
of, coming, 'cause, I have no idea, I mean

00:14:09.939 --> 00:14:12.779
200 million, 300 million albums for Pink Floyd?

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:14.800
Which is phenomenal.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.230
But you guys have never been perceived as
a singles band.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.230
An LP band.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.230
But at the beginning, maybe you—

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.800
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: At the beginning we were.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.689
We decided we were an album band when we couldn't
sell the singles.

00:14:28.689 --> 00:14:29.699
[laughter]

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:33.779
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, how was that transition?

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:37.980
I know you brought in and old member.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.540
And then you brought in David Gilmore.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.949
When Syd Barrett was starting to have troubles
or trouble with the band.

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:50.569
How was that and what did you see in David
Gilmore to invite him aboard?

00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:53.290
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Um, what did we see in David?

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.240
Well, that's a fairly multipart question.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.189
Uh, in no particular order.

00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:05.560
Well I always like to say that we really wanted
the best guitarist available.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.779
But he wasn't, so we picked David.

00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:08.779
[laughter]

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:10.060
But that's being unkind.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.420
But no, David was perfect.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.569
Partly because of great voice.

00:15:15.569 --> 00:15:17.230
Great guitar player.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.360
And actually out of work at the time.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.250
We actually thought he was rather possibly
too good for us I think.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.029
But he was driving a van at the time for Ossie
Clark.

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:31.100
So he was sort of, we sort of guessed that
he'd be up for it.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:38.101
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah and then how was that
transition when there seems to be that there's

00:15:38.101 --> 00:15:40.860
a parting of ways between Syd Barret and Pink
Floyd?

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.860
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.860
Uh.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.860
Very British.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.740
Very Pink Floyd, in that we tried not to address
it at all.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.740
[laughter]

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:52.290
And you know the famous story is that we,
which is true, which is that Syd was absolutely

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.350
having a breakdown.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.779
And in a, again, very British way we tried
to ignore it.

00:15:56.779 --> 00:16:00.460
By occasionally sort of saying "Alright, well,
let's take a day off."

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.860
Which is really not the solution at all.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:11.080
Um, and it just got more and more difficult
for him to operate actually, rather than work

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.350
with us or anything like that.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.700
He was really falling apart.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.129
And we were, as I say, just trying to ignore
it.

00:16:17.129 --> 00:16:24.490
And finally one day, we'd done three or four
shows with David on board as well.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.649
As a five-piece.

00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:31.589
And we just said, "You know what, let's just
not pick Syd up today."

00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:36.329
And went off and carried on doing the shows
without him.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:40.939
Well, of course, very soon it all had to be
resolved.

00:16:40.939 --> 00:16:44.759
But it was a sort of strange moment.

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:50.019
But of course, once we, once Syd had dropped
out and we were working with David.

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:53.699
It was a real, it was another kick start.

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:55.059
It was almost like starting again.

00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:57.930
It was actually terrific for us really.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.050
Because we were all motivated.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.350
And we all knew exactly what we wanted to
do together.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.069
And it made life really easy.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.410
We still have to carry the guilt I think.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:12.490
The fact that we were not prepared to recognize
that Syd was in trouble and having this breakdown.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:17.470
And we should have done something about it
far far earlier.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.080
But we weren't very good at it at the time.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:27.750
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well I imagine one of the
things that's hard is, you're dealing with

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.390
Syd on a personal, you know, business level.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:37.070
And other people have kind of sainted him
and his work as perfect.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:42.840
And you, you know, in its time, he didn't
keep going the way you guys did.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:50.360
But it seems like you really, your personality
started coming out more as you know, after

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360
he—

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.810
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah, well I think Syd was absolutely
the leader of the band.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:56.880
He was the writer.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.750
Wrote all the good songs.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.400
And he was the front man.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.940
What's strange in a way, was that we absolutely
thought we could carry on without him.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.030
Because we had no history of other songwriters.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.220
Roger taking over or Rick writing, really.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.130
But there was, there still was the sort of
curious drive to keep going.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.430
There was something that we thought we could
do.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:29.910
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So this is kind of a period
where, in Britain, you guys are having kind

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.690
of a great deal of success right out the gate.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.690
I mean.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.110
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Well, we had a couple of, we
did have sort of a semi-hit single.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:46.610
Or a couple of relatively successful records.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.930
The big thing though was this business of
working live.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.660
And actually in the UK, it wasn't that great.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:59.640
I mean, we were the sort of you know, this
new wonderful exciting underground music.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.400
That everyone in London thought was incredibly
cool and smart and everyone outside London

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.070
thought it was truly ghastly.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.030
And you know.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.150
[laughter]

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:15.830
We were quite often more or less booed off
the stage but not the most popular act that

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.160
had been there.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:23.710
And we, again, it's this, I don't wish to
make my career sound as though it was entirely

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:33.390
based on luck, but there's an element of what
happened at the same time, was that the new

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.900
universities, all the red brick universities,
were starting to understand that one of the

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:46.340
ways the student unions could operate was
to put on these shows.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:53.360
And so all these universities sort of became
a whole touring thing.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.500
And instead of having to do these top rank
ballrooms which were full of soul bands playing

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:04.680
"Knock on Wood" rather badly, we'd do these
universities where all these intense students

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.630
would sit and listen to the music.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.780
Which was exactly the audience we needed.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.650
And the other thing at the same time was that
we were working in Europe.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.330
And in particular in France.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.370
The French embraced us.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:27.280
And really, the French perhaps sort of, French
and Dutch probably particularly, really gave

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.280
us a living.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.750
We might not have had it entirely in the UK.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.550
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So yeah, at this time in
the States we had, FM radio had started.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.450
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Mm-hmm.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.440
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And there wasn't corporate
control.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.030
The DJs could play what they wanted to.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.030
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Wonderful.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So they were playing the
long, there weren't edited Pink Floyd cuts.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.650
They were playing the long Pink Floyd cuts.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:48.650
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Oh brilliant.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.830
I remember when we first came over in '67.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.990
The whole thing of doing the FM radio shows.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.320
It was just wonderful.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.130
Drive out to this shack and there'd be this
guy with this fantastic record collection.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.080
It would be sort of two or three hours of
putting stuff on.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:12.210
There's still quite a famous tape, I think,
of a radio show in Philadelphia.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:17.210
Where we went to this FM station after we'd
finished doing a show.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.080
We were supporting The Who.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.840
And we went out to this radio station with
Keith.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.590
And Pete.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.180
And Roger, myself and Rick, I think.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.790
And I think we might have had a few drinks
or something might have happened.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.790
[laughter]

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.820
But there's the sound of Rick going "I don't
like this record."

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.710
And sort of just ripping it out of the turntable.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.690
[laughter]

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:41.690
Good times.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:45.500
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, and you guys were involved
with film, too.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.800
I mean, you did some sound tracks.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.880
Which I don't know if they were big at the
time or not.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.210
But they're beloved now.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:22:03.040
In, when, especially "Obscured by Clouds"
kind of really almost brings you to another,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040
you know, new sounds.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.490
How did you get involved with that?

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:11.220
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: IT was, well, the first film
that we did a proper soundtrack for was Barbet

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.890
Schroeder.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.560
"More."

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.281
And, I think, we'd sort of established the
idea that we liked working with images.

00:22:20.281 --> 00:22:26.260
And weren't very interested in learning to
do moon walking or anything like that.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.600
And so there was a sort of natural link really.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.260
To film.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.920
And Barbet was perfect.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.870
Because again, there was the French connection.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:44.940
In so much as that he was really up for using
us rather than anyone else.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.380
And he also was very relaxed about how it
was done.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:57.990
It was done relatively low budget and that,
people I don't think at that time had invented

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.430
[indistinct] or any of the smart ways of linking
music.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:09.150
So what we actually did was, we would go and
watch the film in its current edit.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.730
And then we would simply time sections.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:18.760
So we'd go "We need 17 and a half seconds
of this sort of feel to the music."

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.280
And we'd go into the studios and record this
sort of thing.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.650
And then go back and Barbet would sort of
fit it.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.780
And if necessary maybe modify the film slightly
and sometimes we'd just make cross fades that

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:41.060
were long enough for the film to actually
be a second and a half out.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.620
They weren't very tight cues.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.590
It was, I think it worked really well.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.860
And I think that gave us a real taste for
it.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.180
We then went home and did,The Valley, "Obscured
by Clouds" was the one after that.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah, in "Obscured by Clouds"
there is a wonderful records you guys did

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.410
called "Meddle."

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:06.510
Which I know as a lot of my friends, it's
one of their favorite Pink Floyd records.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:10.580
Where it seems like you guys again, took another
leap.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:17.220
Where it was just a, almost, if you when you
listen to "Obscured by Clouds" too, those

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.060
will almost like coalesce into "Dark Side
of the Moon."

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.620
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah, I have to say, I tend
to think if you look at the progression of

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.940
albums, "Meddle" is quite critical.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.240
It goes sort of "Piper", "Saucer", and then
more or less "Meddle."

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.320
So I think "Ummagumma" and “Atom Heart Mother”,
are both sort of cul-de-sacs.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.530
That we were good to do.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:48.640
And I'm not ashamed of the records but in
terms of the progression, "Meddle" certainly

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:55.880
was that, the sort of idea that you could
have a piece that was the entire side of an

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.880
album.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.880
That that would actually be a good way of
working rather than not.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.890
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, how did you guys approach
"Dark Side of The Moon?"

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:08.070
Were you consciously thinking "This is gonna
be it?

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.380
This is our moon shot here?"

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.750
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: That would be great.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.140
If we'd all sat around and just gone "I know
what, let's make a record that would be in

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.450
the top 100 for the next 30 years."

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.450
[laughter]

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.380
That would be very smart.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.600
Smart programming.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:30.270
No, we wanted, we were going to make the next
record.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:36.650
And we started talking about the idea of doing
something that was a bit more than just individual

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:37.650
tracks.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:42.220
I think probably initially we had got two
or three individual tracks.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.310
With some ideas.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:49.600
And then we actually talked about the idea
of doing something and giving it this theme.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:59.480
And the theme would be, things that make life
difficult.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.410
Four long haired youths doing drugs and alcohol,
talking about what makes life difficult may

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.920
sound a bit odd now.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.920
[laughter]

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:14.370
But at the time, we just sort of sat about
talking about mortality and money and so on.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:19.980
And once we'd sort of got a vague idea of
what we were going to try and do, Roger went

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.450
off to write lyrics.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.220
And on the various subjects.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.540
And it began to sort of fit together really.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.910
I still think it's interesting on that record.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.180
And it's one of the reasons why I think the
record has survived for so long.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:42.280
Is this very curious thing that Roger had
the ability to write lyrics that quite often

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:47.060
are more relevant to a 50 year old than to
a 20 something year old.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:53.710
You know it's particularly some of the lines,
you can listen to now and think "Yeah, yeah,

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.190
well that—" kicking away the moments that
make up a dull day”.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:02.260
I mean it's as relevant perhaps more relevant
now than then.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:08.020
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I don't know if it's his,
because of Syd Barrett.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.890
Or because of Roger Waters, kind of had a
prickly personality.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.150
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: That's one way of putting it.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.620
They said the same about Stalin.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.620
[laughter]

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:23.980
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But he, especially on that
album, those lyrics are, they are pointed.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:31.800
And I can think of other things that kind
of, it's an album I took one way as a child

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.220
and another way today.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.840
How did that affect your career?

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.780
Because I would imagine, that album is the
second biggest selling album of all time.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:50.120
And it hasn't lost an ounce of relevance or,
hasn't dated at all.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.690
How did that affect especially your career?

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.270
And Pink Floyd, and in America?

00:27:55.270 --> 00:28:00.380
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Well, it transformed everything
for us.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.370
Because success in America is what matters.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.470
in rock music.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:12.340
And so it pushed us suddenly from league division
2, to the premier league.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:19.000
Which meant of course that we could then change
our shows into something far more advanced.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.900
I mean, that's, you know, that's how it works.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:27.240
You can then get the best people to help you
do the staging.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.350
Bigger shows.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:36.610
I think it made life difficult in other ways
because you then lurch from theater shows

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.800
to arena shows to stadium shows.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.880
The stadium shows require a very different
approach.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.320
I mean now, well, you know.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.970
You see it, having watched Madonna yesterday.

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:59.120
I mean, it's the stadium show, it's a fantastic
thing that people can do relatively, I won't

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.120
say simply.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.390
But everyone's sort of familiar with how it
works and how to make it work.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:10.220
But at the time, the lurch into stadiums was
not good.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:18.440
Because the requirement for the staging in
order to keep the focus on the stage, is huge.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:23.160
And you tended to find that you'd still, you
got half the stadium who were watching the

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.870
show, and the rest of them were playing Frisbee
at the back or whatever.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:27.870
[soft laughter]

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.220
Which is not so good.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:35.710
The other problem with it was of course that
we then had to do the follow-up album.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:42.290
And I think we got there in the end, but being
wiser after the event, what we should have

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:49.040
done was a lot more touring and a lot more
live, we should have played "Dark Side" live

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.040
more.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.040
And filmed it.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.080
It's one of the great regrets that we didn't
really ever have a record of how we did it

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.530
originally.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.990
And it meant that we actually spent a year
in the studio not getting anywhere.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:08.090
It actually, the first six, nine months of
recording of "Wish You Were Here" produced

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.760
absolutely nothing.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:16.930
And we just finished recording a sort of "How
we did it" DVD.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.570
And four more miserable people

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:19.570
[laughter]

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.050
That you'd hope to interview, going "Yeah,
well, I thought.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.760
Oh God, what are we gonna do now?" and so
on.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.960
It was a pretty average time really.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:36.010
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But it's almost ironic because
it feels as if "Dark Side" would have been

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:43.500
the struggle and there's "Wish You Were Here"
is a more melancholy record.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.500
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Mm-hmm.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.830
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, they're actually both
pretty melancholy records.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:49.050
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: [laughs] Yeah, we don't really
do "The Sound of Music."

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.050
[laughter]

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.770
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.840
But there's a lightness and it doesn't feel
like a struggle.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.400
It feels, it's almost like you guys went back
to some of the elements in "Meddle" too.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.460
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah, it's hard to remember
exactly.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:08.230
I don't know that the struggle was perhaps
the period before it.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.990
Just before we actually hit some ideas and
actually had something to do.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.050
But "Dark Side" wasn't really a struggle.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:19.970
No, it was actually probably the point at
which we worked at our best together.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.400
In terms of getting something done and getting
it right.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.830
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I would say growing up that
"Money" was always played on the radio.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.510
And then of course "Another Brick in the Wall."

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:38.310
But today, "Wish You Were Here" is probably
the most played on every radio format.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:42.390
You'll be listening to a Mexican ranchero
station and suddenly "Wish You Were Here"

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:43.390
will pop up.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.050
It's become like a gold standard.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:48.670
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Well, always nice to here.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.130
But it is curious.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:54.720
Because you know, you look back on these things
and actually then to try and sort of make

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.200
some sense of why they work or why they don’t
work is almost impossible really.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:08.440
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And then when the kind of
punk explosion happened, um, I always think

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:16.740
it's kind of funny that Pink Floyd is thought
of as just about the darkest band imaginable,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.580
and you guys put out "Animals".

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.580
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Mm-hmm.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:27.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Which was, I mean the punk
scene comes out as light and airy compared

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.180
to that album.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.180
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: [laughs]

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I mean it was that?

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:36.160
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah, well, we've ruminated
a bit on "Animals" and whether it was influenced

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.370
by punk.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:39.370
And I suspect it was to some extent.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:46.570
That there was I think, even we were recognizing
that there was this sort of prog-rock, punk-rock,

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:51.370
everything had got a bit overblown and everyone
was building bigger and bigger sets.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:54.680
And it was not really the way everyone wanted
to go.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.110
So there was an element of that influence.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:07.270
And the fact that we were absolutely pilloried
is the wrong word, but attacked by the sort

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.370
of punk movement.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.120
As being these sort of old has-beens.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.140
And there was that feeling of, "Well we'd
better respond to this."

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:21.640
But actually it was also part of a change
in the way we recorded.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.410
Because for this album we'd build our own
recording studio.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.160
And it was not in Abbey Road.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:32.360
It was a much much simpler, much more basic
recording facility.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.850
And I think that had an influence on it as
well.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:40.820
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, I think it was a little
after "Animals" you worked with The Damned.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.440
So here's a punk band.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:48.130
I don't know if it's just Captain Sensible
who's always named Pink Floyd as the highest

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.300
of, he just completely adores them.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.540
Whether it was his influence or the whole
band, but how was that?

00:33:54.540 --> 00:34:00.230
Going from you were kind of stadium heroes,
to working with them.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.330
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Well I absolutely loved it.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.320
I think I got more out of it than they did.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:11.200
Because as so often happens, well, the truth
of the matter is that The Damned had approached

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.770
our publishing company.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.380
Because they actually wanted Syd to produce
their record.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.690
And that was not going to happen.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.350
So they said "Well, Syd's not available.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.600
We've got an old drummer who'll do it."

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:30.870
And so I was really interested but unfortunately
the band were in the middle of having musical

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:31.870
difference.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.440
And so there was a big split.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.659
Between, I think it was Brian and Dave Vanian
on one side and Captain and Rat on the other.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.870
So I spent quite a lot of time waiting for
them to sort of finish a fight before we could

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.450
get on and do something.

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:50.190
But I loved that business of making the record
in a week or so.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:57.600
And I'd say to the Captain, after three takers
I'd say "I think that's really good.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.880
Why don't we do another one?"

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.350
And he'd got "Naaaah.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.350
Why?

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:04.350
Naaaah.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.350
That's fine."

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.350
And I loved that.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:12.760
I mean actually you end up with the sort of
energy that you never get from doing 27 takes

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.530
and 40 overdubs.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:22.560
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So when you guys moved to
The Wall, which if anything, I don't know

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:28.500
about it in Britain, but that at the time
became probably even bigger than "Dark Side

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.500
Of The Moon."

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:34.820
I mean, we had, we were, I took a yellow school
bus.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.750
And you'd have 50 American kids singing along
to that on AM radio.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.080
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: [laughs]

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:47.930
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But was there a difference
in the band dynamics when the album came out?

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:53.030
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: No, well, there was by the time
the album was finished.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:36:03.710
But I think when we started on it, it was
fairly, we were in a relatively good place.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:08.910
In so much as that it was a different, it
was different.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:12.460
Because Roger had actually produced demos
of the whole thing.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.950
It was a whole concept rather than bits and
pieces.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.270
And even put together.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.890
And so we actually knew what it was gonna
be.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.790
We'd all agreed that that's what we wanted
to do.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.250
And so it was fine.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:30.200
We were then sort of thrown into disarray
because we moved to France rather rapidly

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.920
when we discovered that we'd lost a lot of
money and that the Inland Revenue were going

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:39.870
to possibly come and take our houses and cars
and all the rest of it.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.200
We thought this was a very bad idea.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.440
So we headed for France.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.890
Which in another way was a good thing.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:52.020
Because it meant that we were really, suddenly
had to focus on what we were doing.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.741
We might have taken a year longer, I think,
to record it if we'd just done it in England.

00:36:56.741 --> 00:37:02.110
In between doing all the other things we were
doing at the time.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:06.820
But a lot of "The Wall" recording was actually
really good and really exciting.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.830
Because we brought in all these other people
to get involved and help.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.090
We'd got James Guthrie doing sound.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.040
We'd got Bob Ezrin helping with production.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.980
And later on we had Michael Kamen doing the
string arrangements.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.060
So working with all these people was terrific.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:29.470
And we were working in the south of France
which is never a bad thing.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.700
Compared to London anyway.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.920
Um, so it was all fairly good.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.660
It began to fragment much further along the
line.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:44.340
When there were disagreements between Roger
and Rick in particular about when we were

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.210
going to work and when we weren't or whatever.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:51.500
And then it sort of all blew up just about
the time that we were finishing the record.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:57.260
But the actual process of making a lot of
the record was, I won't say easy.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.070
But it was perfectly civilized.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:07.710
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It's, that's a record that
seems to speak to teenagers and yet it's,

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.230
and American teenagers.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:14.710
But it's so much, pretty much all your work,
it's such an English record.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:20.480
And it seems to be such an, it's almost like
the more specific you are, the more universal

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.480
you are.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.770
Because it seems to be such a singular story
and it affects everyone else.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:32.000
How did, did you guys feel any pressure about
that being your story?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.640
Or did you just feel that you're in a band?

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.030
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: No, I think that's interesting.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:42.030
I think going back to this business of Roger
playing the demo.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.550
He actually played us two demos.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:47.670
He played the demo of "The Wall" and the demo
of "Hitchhiker".

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:55.330
And actually we all sort of responded to "The
Wall" rather than "Hitchhiker" and felt that

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.360
it spoke to us.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.930
As well as it was very autobiographical in
certain ways.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:06.030
Very strong elements of very specific moments
in Roger's life.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:13.270
But I think we felt that they, it had moments
that hit us as well.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.270
Particularly.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.140
So it was very easy to engage in the whole
thing.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:22.000
And get involved in it, from that point of
view.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.350
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And was that another, I
know the tour at that time was just considered

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.900
this, I mean, a true spectacle.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900
Which--.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.790
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: It was a madness.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:33.290
That's what it was.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:38.600
Because it was a show that could never make
any money.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:45.350
It was done absolutely as a sort of as part
of a bigger plan actually of course.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:49.670
Which was to do the show and then eventually
film it.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:54.590
And then that changed in the end with the
way the whole thing was.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:57.480
Well, just the way it all panned out.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.580
Now I think if you ask Roger now.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:05.441
I think Roger wouldn't necessarily have chosen
to let it go down the path that it did.

00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:09.950
It was sort of overtaken by the fact that
when we did film some of the London shows

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.850
it still didn't do whatever was really required.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:20.460
And we ended up taking Alan Parker who was
a sort of [indistinct] originally.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.020
I don't think he really wanted the job but
felt that he really had to take it.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.390
And so he ended up directing it and changing
it into much more of a feature film.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Which was very successful
too.

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:39.940
All those play doors, and, there was a time
with Pink Floyd that you guys were so popular

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.980
week after week, month after month, year after
year, that they actually changed the charts

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.980
in America

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.980
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: [laughs]

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.290
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: basically to take Pink Floyd
records off of it because you were stopping

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.120
other bands from getting exposure.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.490
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: So American.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.490
[laughter]

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.510
Get rid of those damned Europeans coming over
here.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.510
[laughter]

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:02.960
Yeah, there were a number of quite nice things.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:10.740
I think what still, I think there was some
altercation between the record company and

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.740
the billboard.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.770
They wouldn't take the extra advertising.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.020
So we were never given more than a gold record.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.080
Rather than a platinum also.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.100
Something like that.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:23.920
But I don't think it's something that we lose
a lot of sleep over.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.920
No.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:31.150
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And then, the final cut,
which I know was a contentious record.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.880
With the band.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:40.840
Is one of those albums I think the same way
that "Dark Side of the Moon's" kind of existential

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.020
themes, kind of, there's no time in for them.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:51.280
That album, with the kind of the debt crisis
we're going through.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.360
The wars we're going through.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.830
It's still, it's suddenly speaking to people
again.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:02.210
In a, you know, in a way that, especially
in America it didn't during the beginning

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.100
of Thatcherism and whatnot.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.840
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah, in many ways it was quite
a political record.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.140
I think it was, well Roger always describes
it.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.630
He's fond of it but he will concede it's flawed.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.770
Which I think is quite a good way of putting
it.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:27.020
But it's got one or two sort of quite interesting
side aspects to it.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:32.960
One of which is something that's I've always
sort of being sorry about in a way, that we

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.820
used up some new technology on that.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.350
Some quad technology.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.780
Developed by a guy called Hugo Zuccarelli.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.750
I think his name was.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:47.050
And it was this absolutely mind blowing quadraphonic
kind of thing.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.310
That only required a stereo mic.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.230
It actually had a, I say a "human head".

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.640
It wasn't a real human head.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.650
But it modeled a human head with all the ear
ducts.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:03.619
And it was stunningly good in terms of surround
sound.

00:43:03.619 --> 00:43:05.030
I mean, I remember it still.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.360
Sitting there and listening to this.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:12.000
And we never managed to actually get this
technology onto the record properly.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.340
But it was a sort of side aspect to the thing
itself.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.670
But having been involved in quite a lot of
the sound effects that we used on the record,

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:28.250
lot of sounds, Doppler effect, traffic, and
things like aircraft and so on.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:33.441
It's something that I'm really sorry we were
never able to actually engineer into the record

00:43:33.441 --> 00:43:34.441
itself.

00:43:34.441 --> 00:43:43.190
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So when you guys carried
on as Pink Floyd without Roger Waters, and

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:47.240
then just one last question before we open
it to the audience members.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.240
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Mm-hmm.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.580
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But how was it, it was so
nice to see you guys do the Live Aid performance

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.750
and, together.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.050
And for a really appropriate cause.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.240
Did that, did that whole performance mend
some fences?

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.240
Or?

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.240
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Oh yeah.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.870
No, it was a very good thing to do.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.160
And well it was a brilliant thing to do really.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.040
Because it was playing for all the right reasons.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.820
It showed we could be vaguely grown up.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:17.690
And I was able to say to my children "Look,
see we're not that bad."

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.900
No, it was terrific.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.770
And I think everyone came away with all the
right feelings from that.

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.190
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's wonderful.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.360
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: But no we are not announcing
a new Pink Floyd tape.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.360
[laughter]

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.610
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, just

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:32.950
[audience member sneezes]

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:33.950
Bless you.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.360
One more thing before we open to the crowd.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:45.510
I was at a super bowl game last night and
I mentioned I'd be talking to you, and I expected

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:50.610
some oohs and ahs about Pink Floyd and instead
my friend, Matt, got very excited and ran

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:56.190
to his bookshelf and took off this copies
of Octane Magazine.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.190
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: [laughs]

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:01.960
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That he keeps because he
loves your articles so much.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.960
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Ah, excellent.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:11.530
And I have to say, one of the things that
came out of the whole thing was that I found

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.130
that I really did rather enjoy writing.

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:18.750
And I started work on, well, it would have
been '94 I guess.

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.110
At the end of the tour.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:27.160
And started work on doing a sort of autobiography,
story of the band thing.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.770
Which took a while to work with what was acceptable
with the others or not.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:34.480
And people said "How'd they feel about it?"

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:40.420
And I tend to say the book has been almost
universally acclaimed, and when I say "almost

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.380
universally", there are three people who don't
like it.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.380
[laughter]

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.790
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: it's a really fun book.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.010
And a really beautiful book.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.130
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Thank you.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:56.190
But as I say, I just ended up really enjoying
the business of writing.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.180
And ended up doing quite a lot of car journalism
as well.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.180
Fun.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, thanks.

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.710
Do we have any questions?

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.120
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi Nick.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.180
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Hi.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.250
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Oh.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:12.830
So in the late '90s or so, the news kind of
broke out that there was probably some sort

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:18.400
of sync between "Dark Side of the Moon" and
"Wizard of Oz." [laughter] And then you were

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.785
famously quoted as saying "We didn't purposely
sync it up to Wizard of Oz, we sunk it up

00:46:22.785 --> 00:46:23.810
to The Sound of Music."

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:24.810
[laughter]

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:25.810
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Yeah.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:26.810
No I, sorry, sorry.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:31.211
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Just wanted to know, like, is there
actually and intent to sync up to "A Dark

00:46:31.211 --> 00:46:32.280
Side of the Moon" and "Wizard of Oz"?

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.790
Or is it a coincidence?

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:37.240
Or something that you know, some stoned kid
just read way too much into?

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.490
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Well, the thing is, it was very
strange.

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:47.960
Judy Garland came into the studio and she
said "I've got this idea for a record."

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.960
[laughter]

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.170
And it just went from there.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:53.850
No, it's just one of those peculiar things.

00:46:53.850 --> 00:47:02.010
I mean, I think, anyone who works with film,
movie, whatever, and music knows how easily

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.790
you can tie things together actually.

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:08.740
The strange thing is this business of odd
cues that work.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:13.040
But I'm sort of got a feeling you could do
the same with The Wall and Spartacus.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.300
And you know, it depends on how much time
you've all got.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.440
I mean if you've really got that sort of time.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.500
I don't know, I think possibly I'd suggest
you do something else with it.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.500
[laughter]

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.330
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thank you.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:32.650
&gt;&gt;Male #2: How important was Alan Parsons
as a creative influence on Dark Side?

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:39.331
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Um, Alan was, well he was, I
think the best thing with Dark Side is, rather

00:47:39.331 --> 00:47:46.460
than try to assign very specific amounts of
importance is just to say, the reason why,

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:52.270
one of the reasons why Dark Side has worked
so well is because it had so many people doing

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:53.790
good things.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:48:00.380
I mean I think we'd all say that we were really
lucky to get Alan.

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:06.040
He was the best of that Abbey Road sort of
system.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.040
Almost.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.950
Where he'd worked his way through the system
so he was a really accomplished engineer.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:15.780
But he was also familiar with all the technology
that was going on at the time.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.790
There was certainly an element of the producer
in him.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:23.910
As he proved conclusively with the Alan Parsons
Project.

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:29.210
You know, I mean, it was again, it's just
that business of sort of real life.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:34.260
We assumed that Alan would be engineering
our next record.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:40.430
And of course, when we announced this good
news to him he went "Well, actually, I want

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:41.580
to be a producer now.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.580
Thank you very much."

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.750
And went off and did the project.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:47.250
So we sort of slightly grew out of each other.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.180
But we were very lucky to have him.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:55.300
And without a doubt, he plays a very important
role.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.980
As did Chris Thomas.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.990
As did a lot of the unsung heroes of Abbey
Road.

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:05.890
The guys in the white coats who came and fixed
things and came and fiddled with things to

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.380
make them work.

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:14.000
You know, I'm thinking again, it sort of relates
to the Beatles when they discovered phasing

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.970
and flanging and so on.

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:21.369
It wasn't only George Martin or the Beatles
themselves.

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:24.600
There'd be guys there who would invent things.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:33.960
I mean, the, when we were recording Piper,
there was a guy there called Bernard Speight.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.200
Who was an engineer.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.960
He was just the engineering department.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:42.050
But he built for us the original quadraphonic
hand part.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:45.340
And you know, that just came because there.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.490
Because they had all the bits and pieces in
the workshop.

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:50.050
And because we talked about him.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:54.260
And it's those sort of things that add immeasurably
to what you're doing.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:59.370
And of course they never get the medal or
the due recognition.

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.650
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thank you.

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.920
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Hi Nick.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.380
Is this on?

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.020
Oh there.

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:15.220
I went to the Animals concert in Anaheim Stadium
where it rained right before the concert came

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.220
on.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:19.310
And it seemed, the sun came out and there
was a double rainbow over the stage.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.390
And it seemed like you guys came out early
just to take advantage of the double rainbow.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:23.390
[laughter]

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:24.390
At least, seemed like that to us.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:25.390
Was that true?

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.390
Or is that just coincidence?

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.390
[laughter]

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.790
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Can you remind me what you were
taking at the time?

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:30.790
[laughter]

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:35.720
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It seemed like, it was scheduled
for eight o'clock and you guys came out at

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.410
like five minutes to eight and there was a
couple of—

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:40.900
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: We might well have done, I mean,
if there's one thing we've learned it's to

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.160
take advantage of the weather when you can.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:47.940
Because my God, we've done some shows in truly
terrible situations.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:52.800
And, no, there is something wonderful when
it does work.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.430
When you get the weather and it's open air
or whatever.

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:57.650
It's always special.

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:58.650
It's great.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.120
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Thanks.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:07.820
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Yeah, I was curious, to what degree
or maybe rather in which way were psychedelic

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.790
experiences relevant as inspirations for your
music.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:16.800
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: I think to almost no measure
at all.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:25.830
I think actually what happened with, we were
really scared off, well, acid in any form

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:28.060
by Syd's experiences.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:34.950
Because no one knows for sure, but it certainly
seemed like part of the, of Syd's sort of

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:39.280
psychosis was brought on by overuse of LSD.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.190
And I think that put us on the rum and black
currant for quite a while before we decided

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.680
to go experimenting anywhere else.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:51.880
And certainly, so for the earlier records,
I think to a very small extent.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:58.410
&gt;&gt;Male #5: you're a band that has a lot of
cover versions of some of your songs.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:00.010
Especially "Comfortably Numb."

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:04.350
I'm curious if you've heard any of them and
whether you like listening to reinterpretations?

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:07.280
Or whether it's painful to hear somebody else's
version of your stuff?

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.550
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Um, actually I love reinterpretations
of it.

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:14.960
I mean, "Dub Side of the Moon."

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:20.070
The Scissor Sisters, Eric Pritts.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.710
Even Luther Wright and the Wrongs.

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:22.810
Anyone familiar with?

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:23.810
[laughter]

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:28.080
For anyone who doesn't know, Luther Wright
and the Wrong's country western.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.170
They've done "The Wall" as a complete piece
in country western style.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:35.530
I mean, that's something.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:36.590
[laughter]

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:42.070
Actually, I'm far more ambivalent about tribute
bands.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:48.380
Because for me, music has always been about
sort of doing your own thing.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.490
And sort of the creative side of it.

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:56.100
And I'm a little uncomfortable about people
copying every mistake I've very made.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.100
[laughter]

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.900
You know that's something you just think "No,
no, do it your own way."

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.740
And they are, and I have to say some of them
are absolutely brilliant.

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:09.310
The most impressive of all has got to be,
I think it's the Australian Pink Floyd.

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:12.170
Who have split, having had musical differences.

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.170
[laughter]

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:17.060
You know, you'd thought they'd seen it coming.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.060
[laughter]

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:25.190
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Hey, can you tell us about Live
In Pompeii?

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.930
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Live in Pompeii.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:35.820
Interesting because when it was suggested,
we had no, we were not that interested.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.620
I mean it seemed like quite a good idea.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:45.760
I mean, but now, to have a record of that
show done in that way, is something I think

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.450
to be really grateful for.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:50.130
We hadn't thought it through at all.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.640
It was Adrian Maben the director.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.720
Who decided.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.760
Had this idea of using the amphitheater and
so on.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:03.400
But what was curious about it was that, I
think that what really worked was that we

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:07.840
didn’t have the complications of doing a
real live show.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.840
So we could cut.

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.190
And film, and move cameras around and all
the rest of it.

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:15.109
But it still had a live feel to it.

00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:18.760
Which I think all the dust and the open air
element gave it.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.820
We couldn't have done it in a studio.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:25.200
But the open air element made it into something
else.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.440
I love it.

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:32.460
Of course I also particularly love it because
apparently when they were filming "One of

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:40.260
these Days" there's an awful lot, for people
who've seen the film, there's a lot of tracking

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.260
'round the drum kit with me playing.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.359
And apparently they lost some reels of film
which were of the others playing.

00:54:47.359 --> 00:54:48.359
[laughter]

00:54:48.359 --> 00:54:50.780
So it's a bit of a drum feature.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:51.840
[laughter]

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:59.700
&gt;&gt;Male #7: I've always been intrigued by "Money"
and whenever I hear it I envision the point

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.500
when the band is sitting together and someone
comes up and says, "I know we're gonna make

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.780
a song in seven four time.

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.650
And release it to the public."

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:10.190
Can you give any insight about that moment?

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:12.240
And these weird time signatures and?

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.910
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: I think it was Roger just playing
on a guitar.

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:19.390
And coming up with this idea.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:25.720
And really, I'm not sure he even realized
whether it was seven or whatever.

00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.370
But I think it was just a sort of idea.

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:38.790
And for some reason, even me, no, even I,
felt that it was a good idea.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:43.540
And I've never been sort of, certainly that
period, never really dealt with anything other

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.730
than four four.

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:48.860
So it was, there was a rather steep learning
curve to it.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:54.500
But it was a sort of interesting idea just
to be played.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.670
And then what Roger and I worked on the, on
some tape loops.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:04.040
To actually make the original sort of the
start of the song.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.440
The rhythm track almost for the start of the
song.

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:10.670
And it's got, it's just one of those things
where after you played it enough times you

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:14.950
just think, oh yeah, now that's six, perfectly
comfortably.

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:20.150
But it was very odd when we used to play it
live and people would occasionally try and

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:21.290
dance to it.

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:22.290
[laughter]

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:25.070
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Did you have any problems with
the record executives?

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:28.940
Saying, you know--
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Not about that.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.270
I mean.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:31.610
[laughter]

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:39.150
I think over many many years there's always
been moments where the record company have

00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:41.850
had trouble with something we wanted to do.

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:47.260
Actually they've had more trouble and there
probably are record people here who know perfectly

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:52.740
well that actually what we did to make life
a lot easier to ourselves was, we introduced

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.890
them to Storm Thorgerson.

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:59.790
And Storm and Hipgnosis made life far more
difficult I think for the record company than

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:03.260
the music side of it ever did.

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:15.070
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, everyone, let us give
a nice thank you to Nick Mason.

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:16.070
[applause]

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:19.290
&gt;&gt;Nick Mason: Thank you.
