00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.857
- [Narrator] What I'm
gonna do in this video

00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:04.908
is give us an overview of the
first significant dynasties

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:07.405
in Ancient and Imperial China.

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:11.050
Now, in a previous video, we
talk about the Xia dynasty,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.919
which we're not sure whether it exists

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.682
because we don't have a lot
of historical documentation,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.981
but based on legend,

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:21.564
it apparently emerged
around 2100-2200 BCE,

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.017
so we're talking about
over 4000 years ago,

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:28.639
and lasted until the
emergence of the Shang dynasty

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:29.639
in 1600 BCE.

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:33.196
Now, the Shang dynasty

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:35.495
you could view as the first
real historical dynasty

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:39.012
because we have artifacts, we
have archeological evidence,

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:40.556
we even have writing,

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:44.098
the famous oracle bones
of the Shang dynasty

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:46.512
that were used to make decisions

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:49.772
to prognosticate about the future.

00:00:49.772 --> 00:00:51.293
And what's interesting about this writing

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:54.845
on these oracle bones
that over 3000 years old

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:58.404
is that modern Chinese
script is actually evolved

00:00:58.404 --> 00:01:02.015
from this over 3000 year old writing.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:06.182
Also in that Shang dynasty,
we see major bronze artifacts.

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:07.979
And, once again,

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.464
it's the first real
historical evidence we see

00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:14.631
of a reasonably large
geographic area being unified

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:19.183
around the Yellow and the Yangtze River.

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:21.505
Now, in that video on the Shang dynasty,

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:25.672
we talk about how it
eventually falls in 1046 BCE.

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:30.234
And it falls to the Zhou dynasty.

00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:33.730
And the Zhou dynasty,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.120
they defeat the last Shang emperor, Di Xin

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.081
at the Battle of Muye in 1046.

00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.774
And based on their view of things,

00:01:42.774 --> 00:01:44.446
or current historical accounts,

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:46.208
Di Xin became a corrupt ruler.

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:48.727
He was under the influence of his consort

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:50.527
and the Zhous say,

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.605
hey the reason why we
were able to defeat them

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:56.459
and overthrow them and
establish a new dynasty

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.475
is because of the Mandate of Heaven.

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:01.019
The Mandate of Heaven is this idea

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:03.724
that will be incorporated
by the Zhou dynasty

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:06.092
and then becomes part of Chinese culture

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.285
and tradition for thousands
of years after that.

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:13.592
Heaven, in this sense, is
not a place in the clouds

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:16.018
that some might imagine
in a Western tradition.

00:02:16.018 --> 00:02:16.956
It's really, you could view it

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:19.614
as a guiding force of the universe.

00:02:19.614 --> 00:02:23.016
And it's this idea that if
leaders become incapable,

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.572
if they become corrupt,

00:02:24.572 --> 00:02:26.580
that this guidance force of the universe

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.714
will throw them out and put
more capable leaders in power.

00:02:30.714 --> 00:02:34.046
And so, King Wu of Zhou who defeats Di Xin

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:35.474
at the Battle of Muye,

00:02:35.474 --> 00:02:37.517
he invokes this Mandate of Heaven

00:02:37.517 --> 00:02:41.615
and will continue to be invoked
throughout the Zhou dynasty.

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:43.078
Now, the Zhou dynasty

00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:46.724
is going to be a very
long-lasting dynasty,

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:48.535
but it is not centralized.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.019
It can be described as
kind of a feudal system.

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.491
There's multiple kingdoms who
have allegiance to the Zhous

00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:57.266
and at multiple times they
have difference degrees

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.402
of autonomy and of power.

00:02:59.402 --> 00:03:02.049
Now, the Zhou dynasty is generally divided

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.638
into the Western Zhou in
the capitals in the West

00:03:04.638 --> 00:03:06.832
and the Eastern Zhou dynasty

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:09.224
when the capital moves to the East.

00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:12.277
Now, the Eastern Zhou dynasty,
this period right over here

00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:14.610
between 770 BCE and 476 BCE,

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.684
often known as the Spring
and Autumn periods,

00:03:19.684 --> 00:03:23.199
this is often referred to
as a significant period

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:27.587
of philosophical, a philosophical
golden age in China.

00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:29.270
It was the time of Confucius.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.742
It was the time of Lao-Tzu,

00:03:30.742 --> 00:03:35.281
who comes up with the Tao or
the core of the Tao philosophy.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.518
So, a lot of major
philosophical upbringings

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:41.221
of even modern China start
to emerge in this time.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:45.366
Now, the latter half of
the Eastern Zhou period,

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:47.120
you have the Warring States period.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.755
And that's where you
see these dotted lines.

00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:52.157
And the Zhou dynasty, which
was already very decentralized,

00:03:52.157 --> 00:03:54.862
becomes even more fragmented.

00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:58.264
And China really doesn't
get well unified again

00:03:58.264 --> 00:03:59.431
until 221 BCE.

00:04:01.944 --> 00:04:06.111
In 221 BCE, you have the
emergence of the Qin dynasty.

00:04:08.028 --> 00:04:10.733
And even though the Qin
dynasty is very short lived,

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:14.078
it only lasts a few
decades, it's significant

00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:17.979
in that it's the first really
strong central dynasty.

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.278
It's often referred to as
the first imperial dynasty.

00:04:20.278 --> 00:04:23.340
As we mentioned about the
Zhous, very decentralized,

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.420
this feudal system.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.856
But the Qin dynasty, under Qin Shihuangdi

00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:30.225
or sometimes Qin Shihuang,

00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:32.392
he is a very strong ruler.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.030
He sets up this legalistic government,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.108
very strict legal codes.

00:04:38.108 --> 00:04:40.883
He really oppressed his
opponents in significant ways,

00:04:40.883 --> 00:04:43.007
but the byproduct of that is he was able

00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:45.352
to really unify China.

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:47.732
Now, other things that he
did, the Great Wall of China,

00:04:47.732 --> 00:04:49.869
which didn't just get built by him,

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:53.805
but there were already walls
that were being erected

00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:55.616
throughout China at this time.

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:57.007
He started to unify these walls

00:04:57.007 --> 00:05:00.531
and then break down the walls
that were within his empire.

00:05:00.531 --> 00:05:03.422
And so, he's often credited as
really starting the formation

00:05:03.422 --> 00:05:05.831
of what we now call the
Great Wall of China,

00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:08.687
which kept being built and improved upon

00:05:08.687 --> 00:05:11.740
by later generations, later dynasties.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.492
The other thing that he's well-known for

00:05:14.492 --> 00:05:18.535
is establishing this
centralized bureaucracy

00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:21.008
where the civil servants
are able to earn their spots

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:22.769
based on taking exams.

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:26.275
This would last for several
thousand years in China.

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:29.259
Now, as I mentioned, the Qin
dynasty would be short-lived,

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:30.362
but then it would be followed

00:05:30.362 --> 00:05:34.344
by one of the most significant
dynasties in Chinese history

00:05:34.344 --> 00:05:37.200
that really takes the work of the Qin,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.371
but makes it a little bit more moderate.

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:41.984
And the Han dynasty is often referred to,

00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:44.632
by Chinese historians, as
the Golden Age of China.

00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:47.402
It's a time where Confucian philosophy

00:05:47.402 --> 00:05:48.783
really becomes dominant.

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:49.979
You have significant advances

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.150
in math, science, and technology.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.880
This is an image of the nine chapters

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.111
on the mathematical art,

00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:56.881
where ideas like Gaussian elimination

00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:57.879
and Cramer's Rule,

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.484
things that wouldn't be explored in Europe

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:04.453
for over a thousand years, are
documented during Han China.

00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:09.152
You have the famous paper
making emerge during Han China.

00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:12.879
And as you can see, it
lasts for over 400 years.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.899
There's a brief period right over here

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:18.899
where you have the Xin
dynasty gets established,

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:23.293
and that separates the Western
Han from the Eastern Han,

00:06:23.293 --> 00:06:25.754
but this is a significant
period of development

00:06:25.754 --> 00:06:30.630
of Chinese philosophy, Chinese
writing, Chinese technology

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.417
that lasts even until today.

00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:36.644
And to get an appreciation
of the Confucian philosophy,

00:06:36.644 --> 00:06:39.930
remember Confucian lived
over several hundred years

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:40.870
before the Han dynasty,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.204
but this is when it really
becomes the philosophy,

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:46.420
or even you could think
of the religion of China.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.590
I'll leave you with a few
quotes from Confucius.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.946
And I'll do a whole video on him later on,

00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:53.827
but these are some of my favorite.

00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:58.239
"Real knowledge is to know the
extent of one's ignorance."

00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:00.282
And this is a version of the Golden Rule.

00:07:00.282 --> 00:07:04.532
"Do not impose on others what
you yourself do not desire."

00:07:04.532 --> 00:07:07.689
And to put into context,
these ideas of Confucius,

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:10.557
the writing, the mathematics
that was developed there,

00:07:10.557 --> 00:07:12.066
it was the civil service.

00:07:12.066 --> 00:07:14.307
These continue on for
several thousand years.

00:07:14.307 --> 00:07:15.860
And this was during the time, you know,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.691
just to think about what else
was going on in the world.

00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:19.781
This was at the time of the Roman Empire.

00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:20.965
And so, it is interesting

00:07:20.965 --> 00:07:24.097
that at the time of the
Qin and then Han dynasties

00:07:24.097 --> 00:07:26.976
where you first have this
real centralized empire,

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:29.031
that was right around
the time that Rome itself

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.831
was also becoming centralized.

00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:32.735
And it's interesting to think about,

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:34.615
what was it about that period of history

00:07:34.615 --> 00:07:36.705
where you have these
two significant empires

00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:38.180
starting to really emerge?

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.329
And they weren't completely isolated.

00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:42.862
There was actually
interaction between the two.
