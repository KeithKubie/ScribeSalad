00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.720
Hey guys! Check this out.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.720
It seems you can find nearly anything on Pinterest these days.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.120
Including how to make gunpowder the old fasion way.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.000
But this isn't necessarily an idea that's new

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.560
The recipe for gunpowder has existed in encyclopedias ever since there were encyclopedias.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.320
But today we're putting it to the test.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.200
Now, I've been meaning to try this experiment ever since I started creating YouTube videos

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.700
and it's taken until now to finally get around to it.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.440
Now you may remember in a previous video

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.080
I took paint cans and broken-up pieces of stirstick,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.140
and put them all together and threw them in a fire to make homemade charcoal.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.520
Charcoal has a lot of different uses but the reason I made that batch

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.920
was for this experiment today.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.480
Now, the three main ingredients we need for making our old fashion black powder are

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.520
potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.800
My go to for potassium nitrate is this brand of stump remover which is 100%.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.080
And I found a ready supply of sulfur by going down to a local gardening store and picking up a couple of different varieties.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.060
Of course charcoal you can make yourself:

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.380
it's the black stuff left over in the ashes of your fire

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.600
and it's pretty much a big chunk of carbon.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.780
In my experiment making charcoal I tried using paint stir sticks I also tried sticks and twigs I found on the ground and a bag of sawdust.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.420
They all look a little bit different and come from different sources but at this point they're essentially made of the same stuff.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.680
Now charcoal is basically elemental carbon

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.880
and it's number 6 on the periodic table of elements.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.900
And sulfur is number 16.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.520
The sulfur itself should be a relatively pure element but it comes in different sizes and shapes as well.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.080
None of these materials burn very quickly by themselves

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.880
but if you mix them together in the right ratios the results can be explosive.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.020
So now that we have gathered up all of our individual ingredients, the first step in making our black powder is to crush them all into a very fine powder

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.400
but it's very important that we do this in separate containers because we don't want those powders to mix together yet.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.720
So lets go ahead and get busy crushing this stuff up.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.400
Charcoal dust.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.420
Beautiful.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.100
This is looking good.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.360
I'm getting exited.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.180
So update guys, I've just all three of my powders finely floured

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.120
and this is how I did it.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.620
I took individual containers and a blender and I blended it into a fine powder

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.960
and then used a strainer to gently sift out only the finest particles.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.600
Now in the case you don't have a blender

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.480
you could always use something like a mortar and pestle.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.520
This is basically a bowl with a stick that crushes up all the powder.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.400
In either case it's a good idea to use a very fine strainer to filter out only the smallest particles.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.840
Now comes the fun part: we get to mix it all together.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.840
Now I'm going to be using the traditional ratios that trace back thousands of years to when the Chinese first discovered this and used it in their fireworks.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.920
It's a very simple ratio of 75% potassium nitrate,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.660
15% charcoal and 10% sulfur by weight.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.560
Now potassium nitrate by nature is hydroscopic;

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.500
it pulls moisture out of the air, and that is not good for gunpowder.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.920
So before we mix these powders together I'm just going to bake this in the oven for about 25 minutes.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.780
Ok, so our potassium nitrate has been in the oven for 25 minutes

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.000
let's get it out and let it cool down and mix these three powders together.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.320
Now to keep things nice and easy

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.040
I just mixed up a 100-gram batch.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.840
I used 10 grams of sulfur,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.080
15 grams of charcoal

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.160
and 75 grams of potassium nitrate.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.300
Now that we've got these powders in contact

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.780
its important to be very, very careful and do this in a fire safe area.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.120
It's good to have a fire extinguisher nearby or even better, to be outdoors in the open air.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.420
When we mix this we don't want to use metal because it's conductive we want to use something like wood or plastic

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.080
the idea being that we just want to prevent any static electricity from being discharged into the mix.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.680
Our white powder has just become black.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.580
Black powder.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.460
It's extremely light and fluffy.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.760
It's very surprising, probably because of the charcoal.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.420
I wonder if I can blow bubbles in it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Not very well.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.760
Now to make sure this gets mixed up a little more thoroughly I'm going to pour it back and forth between two cups.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.160
Give it a shake, give it a stir, and just do my best to make sure these three materials are intimately combined.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.700
Keep away from sources of ignition.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.520
Boom!

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.340
And it goes off.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.580
So there we go.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.060
I've been shaking and stirring this as intimately as I could get it for the last 2 minutes.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.020
Hopefully, by now it's thoroughly constituted.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.380
So let's pull out a small spoonful, light a match and see if we can touch it off.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.040
Alright, weighing our composition. The verdict is

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.280
98.5 so we lost about a gram and a half in the process.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.180
But that's okay because we've still got a lot

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.040
in fact 100 grams that's probably too much.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.080
Right here guys is our homemade black powder.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.720
Looking good, looking good.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.040
Beautiful.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.380
So just realized I measured out a heaping tablespoon

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.700
of powder which is WAY too much,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.040
because if this works when it goes off it's gonna make a huge cloud of black smoke.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.260
But that's something I'm totally willing to do for you.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.280
It's time to light it off, guys

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.520
and I'm a little bit nervous because this
actually is quite a bit of black powder

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.400
but let's do it!

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.060
Here we go!

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:55.560
Nice, nice burn! And that put off quite a bit
of smoke that's what I would expect

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.500
black powder to look like I would say that
was a success so that worked and it

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.470
pretty much worked the way I was hoping
it would it looked like kind of a slow

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.770
burn but that's only because it's in the
open air we crammed this into something

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.940
like a firecracker it would go off with
a bang. Look at the residue here you just

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.470
see a little bit of ash but it looks
like everything has burned completely

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.480
looks like our composition was just
about perfect

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.650
[I'm] very pleased. One more thing I want to
try really quick is make a small line of

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.760
this powder to make an improvised fuse

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.770
Beautiful. Alright test number two. I've
laid out a nine inch strip of powder to

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.840
act as an improvised fuse so we can test
the burn rate. Here we go.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.020
Sweet! So nice very consistent, slow, and
steady burn that's exactly what I see

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.160
now this burns relatively slowly because
it's in the open air if it were in a

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.460
confined container the burn rate would
increase exponentially and probably make

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.080
the container explode. So guys our black
powder works it looks great it burns

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.560
really well so let's do a quick summary
of how we got to this point. We start off

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.580
with three different materials -- potassium
nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.520
We ground those materials into a fine powder than
used a strainer to sift off the finest

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.780
materials and mix them together in a
ratio of 75 percent, 15 percent, and 10

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.050
percent respectively.
We used a plastic straw to stir them

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.470
together then taped two cups together to
shake it for about two minutes, which

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.979
resulted in this fine dark gray
composition we call black powder and

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.820
black powder doesn't necessarily have to
mean gun powder, there are far more uses for

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.070
it than that.
It could be used for making fuses

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.790
rockets and fireworks and in the early
days it was used as a blasting agent for

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.450
mining materials out of rock so in an
end-of-the-world type situation you

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.229
could theoretically use this stuff to
play Minecraft in real life but it's a

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:54.160
very dangerous substance and it is
regulated by the ATF which means it may

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.430
not be legal for you to manufacture or
possess but don't worry because you can

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.070
just run down a local sporting goods
store and pull something similar right

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.550
off the shelf. Hey, thanks for joining me
for this video guys we now know how to

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.080
make black powder. I'll be looking for
you the next video talk to you then.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.919
Now that we have this stuff for our next
video we should try making firecrackers

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.060
