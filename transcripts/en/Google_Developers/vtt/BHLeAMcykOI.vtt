ANDREW BROGDON: When
you register an app

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.660
and create an ad
unit in the AdMob UI,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.300
you get not one
but two ID values--

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.970
an app ID and an ad unit ID.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.310
So what are those and
how are they used?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.470
Well, an app ID is
a unique identifier

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.840
for an app using AdMob.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.230
They're one-to-one.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.270
The value doesn't
change, and its main use

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.130
is in the call to
initialize the mobile ads

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.410
SDK when your app launches.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.410
An ad unit ID represents
a spot within an app

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.830
where you might show an ad.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.830
That could be a location
in your interface where

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.200
a banner's going to be or one
of the moments in the flow

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.616
of your app where you'd like
to show a rewarding video ad,

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:42.210
such as at the end
of each game level.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.400
It's basically an
instance in space or time

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.610
where you'd like the
option of showing an ad.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.150
That's an ad unit.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.040
By having different
IDs for your ad units,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.410
you can track and report
on them separately

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.000
and use different
mediation groups,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.670
depending on what's generating
the best revenue for you.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.750
So there you go.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.000
App ID is for a whole
app, and an ad unit ID

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.780
is for a spot within that app
where you'd like to show an ad.
