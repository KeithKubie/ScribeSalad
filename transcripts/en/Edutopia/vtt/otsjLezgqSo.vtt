00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:22.796
&gt;&gt;Mark: The idea of making computer
game is, to a lot of people,

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:24.226
is probably quite an intimidating

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:27.756
or something they think
only geniuses can do.

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:33.776
It's just not true.

00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:36.706
&gt;&gt;Kareem: Little Big Planet
is an all in one tool set.

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:38.136
&gt;&gt;James: While it ships
with a hundred levels,

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:41.656
you get to make your own levels using
exactly the same tools that we do.

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.196
&gt;&gt;John: It really appealed to me,

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.636
being able to build whatever
I could think of really.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.666
&gt;&gt;James: Once you've made those
levels, you get to publish them

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.066
on the internet and you get to
share them with your friends

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.146
and with everyone else in the world.

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:55.796
&gt;&gt;James: And we have just
over six million levels

00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:56.686
and games up there now.

00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:58.386
&gt;&gt;Christophe: It's just
a platform for creation.

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:00.616
&gt;&gt;Alex: If you like,
it's a Lego crossed

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:03.996
with a YouTube crossed
with a platform game.

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:11.906
&gt;&gt;John: Most computer games
judge your skill or your ability

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:15.636
in the game based on how many kills
you've got or how fast you can get

00:01:15.636 --> 00:01:17.856
around a track, which can
be judged by computer.

00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:19.756
The only people who
can really judge levels

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:23.486
in Little Big Planet are
other real life human beings.

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:25.766
A computer can't say
if art is amazing

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.086
or not; only another human can.

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:30.366
&gt;&gt;Alex: We coined this phrase, "Play,
Create, Share," for the first game,

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.056
but we didn't actually
realize how true that was.

00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:36.136
&gt;&gt;James: I think the only way you can
really learn from what you've made is

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:37.406
to see what other people think of it.

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:40.836
To go through that whole process
of people enjoying what you've made

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:42.276
but also judging what you've made.

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:46.086
&gt;&gt;Alex: What Media Molecule
provides is this idea of education

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:47.946
and mutual community support.

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:50.046
&gt;&gt;Christophe: Collaboration
is so essential.

00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:53.516
You can create something really
good by yourself, in your cave.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:58.006
But if you don't listen to any advice
and any critics, or you're like, "Ha,

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.536
ha, I don't care about those
guys who don't like my levels,"

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:03.106
you will never learn,
you will never progress.

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:06.416
&gt;&gt;Alex: We realized that it was
that cycle of showing something off

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:09.416
that really motivated
and allowed people

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:11.016
who didn't consider
themselves creative

00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:13.806
to totally get motivated
and make stuff.

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:16.446
&gt;&gt;Christophe: When you play
together, when you create together,

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:21.586
I made something and my colleague
takes it and improves it.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:25.216
And then I get it back and it's
like, "Wow, that's really nice."

00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:27.596
And then, "Ah, that
gives me another idea."

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:29.586
&gt;&gt;James: Some people are
artists, some people are more

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:31.446
like programmers, some
people make music.

00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:34.186
&gt;&gt;Kenneth: People who kind of
adopt, they kind of wear the hat

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:39.056
of the educator and they take great
pleasure in explaining to other users

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.176
in the community how stuff works.

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:42.126
So they'll build a level which
is effectively a tutorial.

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:44.586
&gt;&gt;Kengo: They learn something, think
"Hey, this is amazing," and then want

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:46.136
to learn, just pass
on that knowledge.

00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:48.616
And I think that's something
very inherently human really.

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:52.696
&gt;&gt;Alex: And you learn so much
from seeing what masters have done

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.156
and being able to take it apart
and put it back together again.

00:02:55.386 --> 00:02:57.746
&gt;&gt;James: The more that we enable
people to create stuff together,

00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:01.156
the more kind of an explosion
of creativity we get,

00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:02.616
that we could never have anticipated.

00:03:02.946 --> 00:03:05.696
&gt;&gt;Alex: The most satisfying thing
with me, with Little Big Planet is,

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:09.856
at its core, it's quite simple,
but I've seen people use it in ways

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.076
that I could never have imagined.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:13.656
&gt;&gt;Kareem: Personal
expression I think is one

00:03:13.656 --> 00:03:16.296
of those things that will never go.

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:20.356
Everybody has a story to tell
and that's a very human thing.

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:24.726
&gt;&gt;James: Showing people
that they can,

00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:26.276
if they're given the right tools,

00:03:26.316 --> 00:03:27.876
they can make stuff
that's really great.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:32.386
&gt;&gt;John: Everything I see, almost on a
daily basis, is completely brand new

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:35.566
and I often ask myself,
"How did they do that?"

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.396
&gt;&gt;Mark: They'll just do something
that's really off the wall,

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:40.116
that could be disaster,
but it can also end

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:42.206
up being the next massive thing.

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:43.336
&gt;&gt;James: So ultimately, it's

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:45.826
about just removing the
barriers to creativity.

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:48.586
&gt;&gt;Kengo: When you're making
stuff in real life, you know,

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:52.056
there's only so much
you can really do.

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:55.436
What's nice about this is that
you can just keep going really,

00:03:55.436 --> 00:03:56.996
and if things go wrong, that's fine.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:00.856
&gt;&gt;Mark: Empowerment is
a word that we use a lot

00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:02.296
when talking about Little Big Planet.

00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:04.256
&gt;&gt;Alex: As a kid, I'd
never reached an audience.

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:06.606
I could make my Lego model and
I could never show it to anyone.

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:09.946
But now, you know, the generation
younger than me is capable

00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:11.286
of reaching millions of people.

00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:13.316
&gt;&gt;Mark: The realization that
you've got the ability to kind

00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:15.766
of change your world around
you and make things happen.

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.726
&gt;&gt;Kareem: It doesn't
make you sit on the sofa

00:04:18.166 --> 00:04:21.096
and watch it, or interact with it.

00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:25.466
It actually takes you inside it
and makes you contribute to it.

00:04:25.696 --> 00:04:30.226
It changes the console from
being an entertainment device

00:04:30.306 --> 00:04:31.546
to an expressive tool.

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:34.276
&gt;&gt;Mark: If you can give
somebody tools that make it feel

00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:36.476
like you're playing a game
or that you're having fun,

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:41.396
then the learning is
almost accidental.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:42.896
&gt;&gt;Alex: These days,
that's the future.
