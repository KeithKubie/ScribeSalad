00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.780
STEPHANIE SAAD CUTHBERTSON: 92%
of the top 125 apps and games

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.070
now use Android Studio.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.510
This morning, we'll
release our latest,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.460
which is Android Studio's
2.2 preview, focusing

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.010
on speed, smarts, and
Android platform support.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.479
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Jamal,
Android Studio 2.2

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.869
was announced and
launched today.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:35.160
Can you give us the highlights?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.140
What are the changes from
Android Studio 2.0 that

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.390
are going to make the most
difference in a developer's

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.034
experience?

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:42.950
JAMAL EASON: Well, there
are three key things.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.674
First, we talked about
new testing tools.

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:46.840
So the new test recorder
is a really amazing feature

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.766
that got a lot of
excitement from developers.

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.390
And two was with the
new Layout Editor.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.900
So it actually
introduces a new layout.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.530
So instead of worrying about all
the different nested layouts,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.863
you have one flat layout
that's actually more performant

00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:57.910
and more dynamic.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.600
And number three,
enhanced C++ support.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.910
Now we support hybrid
debugging, and support

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.690
for ndk-build and CMake builds.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really great.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.690
I think one of the things we've
been hearing from developers

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.500
for a long time is
more C++ support.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.860
It gives them a stronger
ability to build cross-platform

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.150
and make sure that that
code that they're building

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.243
can apply more to their
Android apps as well.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:17.676
JAMAL EASON: Absolutely.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: In
fact, especially,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.080
game developers have been
asking about it as well.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.170
I can't wait to see
what they'll do with it.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.430
JAMAL EASON: Absolutely.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Is there anything

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.163
else that developers should
do besides downloading

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:28.960
Android Studio 2.2 and
giving us feedback?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.656
JAMAL EASON: I think that's it.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:32.350
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Jamal, thanks
so much for joining us today.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.474
JAMAL EASON: Not a problem.

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:36.210
