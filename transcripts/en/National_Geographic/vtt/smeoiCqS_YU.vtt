00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:37.739
we are going to build the wall it will
be a real war a real war

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.239
are you ready
are you ready

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:19.580
this is the Rio Grande that is Mexico
that is the United States Texas and that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:28.560
is Mother Nature's wall it's pretty
great the Rio Grande starts at Colorado

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.180
flows through New Mexico and becomes the
us-mexico border when it enters Texas a

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.030
border wall already exists along the
river in urban areas as for the rest it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.910
is some of the most inhospitable terrain
in the southwest

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.590
on both sides of the border there are
national parks state parks wildlife

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.310
areas and historic ranches that go back
for centuries

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.289
this region is like the Greater
Yellowstone Ecosystem of the Chihuahua

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:18.040
desert and the last true wilderness left
in the state of Texas desert bighorn

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.980
sheep went extinct in this region but
they've been reintroduced and once again

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.640
battle for breeding rights along both
sides of the Rio Grande

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.139
the physical border wall would block
them from the Rio Grande the only

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.549
reliable water source along with
everything else that depends on the

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.560
river for water for survival
black bears were also killed out west

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.120
texas then about 25 years ago a female
came out of the Malins in mexico cross

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.139
the Rio Grande and had Cubs a Big Bend
National Park

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.660
the Bears are back now about 40 of them
the border wall would isolate them

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.130
genetically and prohibit future
dispersals for them and other important

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.580
species

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:54.480
I wish that everybody who wanted to
build an actual physical wall could come

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.230
and see this place first because I think
if they came saw it and realized what

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.820
the wall was going through and what it
would do it would have a profound impact

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.810
on their way to think it

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.840
the Chihuahuan Desert has landscapes and
an array of life that rivals Yellowstone

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.000
whose Sydney in the Serengeti

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.590
but it's rewilding efforts the research
and the conservation work here has just

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.100
begun in the center it's the Rio Grande
River

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.789
a border for us
but the heartbeat for this ecosystem a

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:53.120
flowing changing desert oasis
the lifeline during drought

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.310
we're gonna build the wall folks we're
gonna build that wall will go up so fast

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.970
your head will spin and you'll say you
know he meant it

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.610
you
