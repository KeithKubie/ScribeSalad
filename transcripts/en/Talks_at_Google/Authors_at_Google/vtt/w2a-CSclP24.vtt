00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.689
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.799
Thank you all for joining us for today's Authors
at Google talk.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.819
It is my pleasure to introduce you to our
speaker today.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.150
I think you guys already know him, now, Mr.
Ron Kaufman.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.910
Ron is the world's leading educator and motivator
for uplifting customer service and uplifting

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.700
service cultures.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.600
He is author of the book Uplifting Service
and 14 other books on service, business, and

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.600
inspiration.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.840
Ron is rated one of the world's top 25 hot
speakers by Speaker Magazine for his high

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.680
energy and high content presentations.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.289
He has been featured in the New York Times,
the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and on

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:39.289
TV.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.149
Please join me in welcoming Mr. Ron Kaufman.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.559
[cheers] [applause]

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.019
&gt;&gt;Ron Kaufman Thank you very much.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.339
Great to be here at Google.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.319
Thank you so much for this hour of your time.

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:51.769
I want to jump right in.

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.239
The book that you got a copy of is called
Uplifting Service.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.049
While I'm based in Singapore, the reason my
wife and I are in New York is because on this

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.090
Sunday, you'll see it published in the New
York Times Bestseller List.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.449
The book expo's here in New York, so we hit.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.990
That's a three year project that's finally
come to fruition.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.990
This is all I do.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.140
I travel around the world with my wife, doing
uplifting service, coaching, consulting, training,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.250
working with some of the largest companies
in the world.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.939
That is a picture of my passport.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969
[light laughter] Yeah, holy moly, right?

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.399
It's actually at the point now where immigration
officers look at it and look back up and look

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.399
down.

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.890
The reason is that I'm one of these people
who, from a very early age, was driven out

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.610
there in the world to do things with other
people.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.740
This is a picture of the Brown University
ultimate Frisbee team.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.840
I show you this picture because it demonstrates
that at one point, I did have hair.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.630
[laughter] But it also points to two other
very interesting people who were on the team.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.119
For example, I became a domain expert in service
leadership and in building service cultures,

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.650
but this fellow right here in the front row,
does anybody recognize him?

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.039
His name is James Garvin.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.640
He's chief scientist for NASA exploration.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.140
When the Mars things went up, this is Jim.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.140
More interesting.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.060
Who is this guy?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.970
That gentlemen on the Brown University ultimate
Frisbee team is Peter Norvig, who was the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.500
Google Director of Search Quality and now
is your Director of Search.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.100
Join me in giving ultimate Frisbee a big clap
for the impact that we've had in the world.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.940
[applause]
This person is the one who really has a big

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.320
impact on my life.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320
It's my wife.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320
Her name is Jan.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.920
She and I scuba together, we travel together,
we get the pleasure of working in different

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.720
places like the World Bank together.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.140
She's sitting right here in the back of the
room.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.440
Would you join me in giving her a big clap,
because I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440
her.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440
[applause]
All right.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440
This is actually the mission that I'm on.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.630
People say, "Ron is a man on a mission."

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.630
It's true.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.540
I am committed to uplifting the quality and
the spirit and the practice of service all

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.540
over the world.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.760
I think one of the problems that we have today
is it's not being taught.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.320
If you think about the education you got,
if you're in this room, you're a well-educated

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
person.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.850
You learned whatever you learned, but I'll
bet none of you actually ever took a class

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.440
on the fundamental principles of service,
or how to develop a strong service culture,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.140
or how to differentiate an organization based
on quality of service.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.570
That's what it is that we're really bringing
around the world.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.730
I was fortunate because I studied with this
gentlemen for 7 years after college.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.260
His name is Fernando Flores.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.580
He's an expert in something called ontological
design.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.840
Two of his protégés, Chauncey Bell and Chris
Davis, I attribute to them me becoming a different

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.620
kind of observer in the world.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.350
What is ontological design?

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.170
Fundamentally, what are the fundamental linguistic
distinctions and the standard practices that

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.030
enable competent action in some domain?

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.860
I can't talk like that with most people in
business, but here at Google, I think I can.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.750
When I look at something, like, "How does
service work?" or "How do you optimize search?"

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.290
or whatever it is, if you know what the fundamental
distinctions are, and the standard practices,

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.570
and you know the strategies of those that
do it well, then potentially, it could become

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.570
replicated.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.100
That underpinning has caused me to look at
the real leaders in service: Singapore Airlines,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.170
Ritz Carlton hotels, Zappos, Apple Computer.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.440
What are they doing?

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.230
But not anecdotally, like, "They have a genius
bar and a beautiful building that was designed

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.340
by Steve Jobs."

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.340
Not like that.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.160
But fundamentally engineering wise, how are
they building out that kind of a culture.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.940
That's what I've written about in the book,
and I'm going to give you a brief presentation

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.150
of it today.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.380
I've been living in Singapore for more than
two decades.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.350
I moved there because this whole country was
wrestling with the issue of how to develop

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.980
a service culture, and they had to, for economic
necessity.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.040
Back in 1980s and 1990s, all the manufacturing
left and went to China.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.130
All the back office processing went to the
low-cost locations like India and the Philippines,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.680
and now even moving to Bangladesh.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.540
So Singapore had to reinvent itself to still
create value in the world.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.980
And they succeeded.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.470
They already had one particular iconic example.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.430
Has anybody here ever flown on this airline?

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.480
Okay, did you have a good experience?

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.480
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yes.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.880
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: I mean to the point where people
are willing to pay more, a higher premium,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.310
to fly on exactly the same route at just about
the same time.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.630
The aircraft itself will fly at a higher yield,
that means there's more people on board, than

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.190
the other carriers, which is why Singapore
Airlines today has $6 billion in cash reserves

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.530
in an industry where airlines go out of business
on a regular basis.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.000
It's not because they have better aircraft.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.490
That airbus can be purchased by Emirates and
Cathay Pacific and British Airways.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.570
It's not because they use better airports
or better travel agents, or even a better

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.590
website.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.290
It's because they differentiated based on
the quality of their--

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.290
&gt;&gt;female#2: Service.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.290
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Service, right.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.290
They've even created an icon for it.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.850
They call it the Singapore girl.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.280
I've been working with them for 20 years,
so I know what it is that they've done.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.120
I've seen underneath the covers what's the
architecture that they're using to engineer

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.090
that in a sustainable way over time.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.410
This is a shot of Changi International Airport,
which is Singapore's airport and Singapore

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.680
Airlines' home base.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.450
This is an interesting cultural situation,
where you need service to be delivered from

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.919
top to bottom, end to end, and across many
different organizations, because 40 million

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.830
people go through the airport.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.890
Now, you go through airports.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.790
Let's say you're at an airport somewhere and
you're lost, you have a question, you need

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:17.790
something.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.860
Who will you ask for help?

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.860
Ready?

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.389
Turn to the person next to you, answer that
question.

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.110
You're in an airport, you're lost, 'where's
the gate, where's the post office'?

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.110
Who will you ask?

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.270
Talk to the person next to you.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.480
Go.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.889
[audience murmurs]

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.180
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: All right, yell it out for me.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.180
Who will you ask?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.180
Who will you ask?

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.830
&gt;&gt;male #1: The first person I see in any kind
of uniform.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.170
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: The first person you see in any
kind of uniform.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.020
You don't care if it's the police and you're
asking for the post office.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.330
You don't care if you're at the post office
and you're asking where's the gate.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.240
So they needed to create a culture where every
single one of the 28,000 people that work

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.930
there would take responsibility for the quality
of the customer experience.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.490
They've done that very successfully.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.669
They've got a phrase, 'many partners, many
missions, but there's only one Changi'.

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.730
Now, I've been working with them for a really
long time, and I know how they do it.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.930
They've solved this problem, which many large
organizations have, of what I call a confused

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.930
culture.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.639
We recruit this kind of person, but we give
bonuses for this kind of a thing.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.130
The marketing promise is like that, but the
actual customer service experience is like

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.130
this.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.780
That's confusing for people who work in a
large organization.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.380
All Singapore Airlines has done, all the Ritz
Carlton has done, all Zappos has done, is

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.419
they've lined it up.

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:36.639
They've taken away the confusion, and they've
done the same things that other organizations

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.980
are doing, but in sync with one another to
create a certain impact.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.590
I'm going to show you the architecture of
how that works.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.190
Let's start by asking you to talk to the person
next to you.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.210
Should be a very simple question.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.100
Google was actually-- It's a service business.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.230
You're providing things for people, right?

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.960
You're giving them answers, giving them ad
space.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.130
You're giving them what they need.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.560
So what is the definition of service?

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.870
Please talk to your partner.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.620
Go.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:10.120
[audience murmurs]

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:16.139
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Okay, come on back.

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:21.550
Let me ask: did you and your partner turn
to each other and then immediately share exactly

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.550
the same words?

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.550
&gt;&gt;male #2: No.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.550
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: No.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.300
So if I passed out cards here, and everybody
wrote down their definition.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.550
Let's say there are 60 people in the room.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.550
You handed in the cards.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.600
How many definitions would I have?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.770
&gt;&gt;male #3: 60.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:32.949
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: 65, right?

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:34.740
[laughter] That's a problem in the world today.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.029
It shows how fundamental the problem is, because
even something as basic as "What is service?"

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:42.159
[snaps] we're not being taught.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.452
People are going, "Well, it's the customer
wants, and what he needs.

00:08:44.452 --> 00:08:45.680
It's exceeding and delighting."

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.910
That gets really fuzzy.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.220
It doesn't need to be that way.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.860
Here's a definition that I use, and I introduce
in the book, right at the beginning.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.319
Service is taking action.

00:08:55.319 --> 00:08:56.319
Would you agree?

00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:57.319
Right.

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:59.000
In order-- Service doesn't sit in a box.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.540
Somebody's got to do something to take action.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.220
What's the purpose of taking the action?

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.089
&gt;&gt;male #4: To meet some need.

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:14.320
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: To meet some need, to give somebody
what they want, to satisfy, to delight, to

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.320
create some what?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.370
&gt;&gt;Several audience members: Some value.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.370
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Some value.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.290
The purpose of the action has got to be to
create some value for someone else, unless

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.290
it's self-service.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.129
Let's just pause for a second.

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:29.480
Does this definition adequately describe what
you do?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.379
You may be in tech, just keeping other people's
computers running.

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:34.040
You may actually be working with advertisers.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.089
You may be working with other websites.

00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:36.399
You may be working with partners.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.860
You may be working with-- Talk to your partner
for a second.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.601
Does this simple definition of service, taking
action to create value for someone else, does

00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:45.510
it apply to your job?

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.769
Talk to your partner.

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:47.829
Go.

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:49.959
[audience murmurs]

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:52.089
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Absolutely.

00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:53.149
Right?

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:54.209
Right.

00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:58.740
However, a lot of people come to work, and
they say, "No, my job is just doing what's

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.059
on this checklist" or "Leave me alone.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:05.809
I'm just doing my job" rather than understanding
that the purpose of doing the job is to create

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:06.809
some--

00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:07.809
&gt;&gt;male #5: Value.

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:08.809
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --value for somebody else.

00:10:08.809 --> 00:10:11.829
What is service excellence?

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:14.350
What is a service culture?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.290
How are these two things related to each other?

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.310
Because they're not the same.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.369
Service excellence is a certain level of performance
in value created.

00:10:21.369 --> 00:10:23.730
A service culture is something else.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.040
Talk to your partner again.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.920
What are these two things, and how are they
related to one another?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.750
Go.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.410
[audience murmurs]

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.070
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:43.560
Good, good, good.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:50.009
Come on back, come on back.

00:10:50.009 --> 00:10:54.939
I'm going to answer these in the next few
minutes.

00:10:54.939 --> 00:11:01.540
Really [pause] dissolve the confusion that
people have.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.910
So many people in the world and in business
today, they hear the word service, and they

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.059
say, "Oh, that's the soft stuff."

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:09.699
And then they hear the word culture, and they
go, "That's really airy-fairy."

00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:11.189
I'm saying, "No, no, no.

00:11:11.189 --> 00:11:12.720
Not to Singapore Airlines, it's not.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720
Not to Ritz Carlton, it's not.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.379
Not to Apple Computer, it's not.

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:16.459
Not to Google, it's not."

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:20.059
You've got to really understand what this
is and how to build it.

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:24.470
That's the big question: how do you actually
build a culture of uplifting service and make

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.439
it stronger and stronger and sustainable over
time?

00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:31.770
That's what my career has really been about,
is identifying what is the plan, what is the

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:37.649
architecture, how do you engineer this thing
so it's not just up to a charismatic leader?

00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:42.389
I'm going to go back and use a very old architecture
that's been influencing human behavior for

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:43.490
a long time.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.889
The components are clear: there's got to be
a leadership element, people who are driving

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:51.600
an organization in a certain direction with
their personal example and things that they

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.410
do inside the organization.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.470
There's an educational component, which is
not the same as training.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.050
We'll come to that in a second.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.970
And in the middle is this interesting area
called building blocks, that I'll point to

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.430
at the end of this presentation.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.430
Okay?

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.459
Let's start at the base.

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:10.100
What is the difference between education and
training?

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.459
They're not the same.

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:12.829
Take a moment, talk to your partner.

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:18.749
What's the difference between education and
training?

00:12:18.749 --> 00:12:20.970
Go.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.420
[audience murmurs]

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.339
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Very good.

00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:30.379
Very good.

00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:31.379
Training is what?

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:32.379
&gt;&gt;male #6: Stuff that happens

00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:33.379
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:40.199
You can train someone what to do, and you
want them to be well trained in a certain

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:41.620
situation where they need to do the--

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.050
&gt;&gt;male #6: Right thing.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.050
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Right thing.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.050
Right.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.050
But education's different.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.660
Education is teaching people how to think,
so they can figure out what to--

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.660
&gt;&gt;male #6: [inaudible]

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.660
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Do.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.660
Right.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.439
If you have children, do you just want them
to be really well trained?

00:12:55.439 --> 00:12:57.639
You want them to be educated, right?

00:12:57.639 --> 00:13:01.860
Customer service training has a fundamental
flaw: it's good in certain situations where

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.810
you need someone to absolutely follow the
checklist.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.920
But if all we're providing in the world today
is training about what to do, what happens

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.649
when the customer shows up with a new situation
you haven't seen before?

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:15.610
It gets escalated up the chain, becomes a
bottleneck.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.370
That's that point I was saying about we need
fundamental education for service in the world

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.370
today.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.489
Now, training is fine sometimes.

00:13:22.489 --> 00:13:23.920
Yeah.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.679
My wife and I have a friend who's a former
US Marine.

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:27.679
He's been in combat.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:31.269
He said, "When the bullets are flying, you
stop thinking.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.279
But your body knows what to do because it's
been--"

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.279
&gt;&gt;female #3: Trained.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:36.269
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: That's why they go to boot camp.

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:39.819
When this guy takes a machine up in the air,
and he's got hundreds of passengers in the

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.589
back, I don't want him to do creative thinking.

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:44.170
[laughter] Right?

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:48.220
Which is why-- We put them in a simulator
and we throw tough situations so they will

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.220
become well--

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.220
&gt;&gt;male #7: Trained.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.170
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: That's why no one died.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.690
Because when the geese hit the engines, the
pilot and the copilot both immediately went

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.709
to the checklist and did what they were--

00:13:57.709 --> 00:13:58.709
&gt;&gt;male #8: Trained.

00:13:58.709 --> 00:13:59.839
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Trained and told to do.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.939
Their bodies knew how to do it.

00:14:00.939 --> 00:14:05.240
If this guy goes in on you, don't ask him
to think out of the box.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.410
[laughter] But in business, we need people
who can come up with new ideas.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.820
We need people who can solve problems we've
never seen before, and innovate to come up

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.480
with new ways to create value.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.579
We want people who can make a decision on
the spot and have it be a good decision without

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:19.320
having to bring it to somebody else.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.839
We find that the way that happens is that
when you get a chance to work on this and

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:24.549
talk about it with other people.

00:14:24.549 --> 00:14:29.440
And personally, I believe it should be uplifting,
if the topic is service, because there is

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.759
a skills set component, but there's also a
mindset, or an attitudinal component.

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:35.759
You agree?

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:39.230
You're customers, you're service providers,
you get what I'm saying.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.290
So let's do this right now.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.499
Would you turn to your partner and just say,
"Thank you for being my partner."

00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:45.499
Go.

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:46.499
[audience murmurs]

00:14:46.499 --> 00:14:47.499
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:14:47.499 --> 00:14:50.139
Now, would you do this.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.139
Please rub your hands together.

00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:53.910
[rubbing noise] Rub your hands together, here
we go.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.910
Clap twice.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:55.910
[clapping] Hands up.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.910
Turn to your partner.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.139
Give him a high five.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:00.180
Say, "Thanks for being my partner."

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.200
[clapping] [audience murmurs]

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.880
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Could you feel the difference?

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.399
Did it feel better or worse.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.399
&gt;&gt;male #9: Better.

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:06.399
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Better, right?

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:08.970
It was still a thank you, but it was done
with a different-- [snaps]

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.199
&gt;&gt;male #9: Attitude.

00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:11.199
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Yeah.

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:14.999
I'm going to demonstrate for you now a piece
of fundamental service education.

00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:15.999
Six levels of service.

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:18.179
We're going to start low.

00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:19.179
The word is--

00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:20.249
&gt;&gt;female #4: Basic.

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:21.249
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Basic.

00:15:21.249 --> 00:15:22.459
Definition of the word, please.

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:23.459
Talk to your partner.

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:24.459
10 seconds.

00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:25.519
Basic means what?

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:27.100
[audience murmurs]

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.689
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Go.

00:15:28.689 --> 00:15:29.689
Basic is the--

00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:30.689
&gt;&gt;male #10: Minimum.

00:15:30.689 --> 00:15:31.689
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --fundamental, the--

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:32.689
&gt;&gt;male #10: Minimum.

00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:33.689
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Yeah, basic means basic.

00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:34.689
Thank you.

00:15:34.689 --> 00:15:35.920
[laughter] That's basic.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.420
It's a minimum.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.290
But I call it the bare minimum.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:46.200
A good example, and we experienced it the
other day, is a taxi that smells bad, with

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.100
a driver who's in a bad mood, who's a bad
driver.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.040
But he gets you where you want to go.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.100
Ever happen to you?

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.639
That level we're going to call basic.

00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:59.079
Here's how to say it.

00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:00.720
[low, drawn out voice] Basic.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720
Stay with me.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.720
One, two, three.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.720
Go.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.720
&gt;&gt;people audience: Basic.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.869
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: How do you feel?

00:16:05.869 --> 00:16:06.869
Bleugh.

00:16:06.869 --> 00:16:08.670
Okay, let's not stay there.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.399
Let's take a step up.

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:13.079
One step above basic is expected.

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:14.709
It's normal.

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:15.709
Average.

00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:19.970
If you tell the driver where you want to go,
do you expect that he knows how to get there?

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.970
&gt;&gt;audience: Yes.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:21.970
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Does it always happen?

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:22.970
&gt;&gt;audience: No.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.290
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Do you ever get a driver that says,
"Where do you want to go?", you tell him,

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.499
and he says, "Where's that?"

00:16:26.499 --> 00:16:27.499
&gt;&gt;male #11: Yeah.

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:30.040
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: The moment he says, "Where's that?"
where does your mood go?

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040
Up or down?

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040
&gt;&gt;audience: Down.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.010
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Drops, because he may go the long
way or the wrong way, or you've got to give

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.070
him directions.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.079
Eventually, he gets you where you want to
go, so he does meet the--

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:41.079
&gt;&gt;audience: Basic.

00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:42.619
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --basic, but it's not what you--

00:16:42.619 --> 00:16:43.619
&gt;&gt;audience: Expect.

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:44.619
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:16:44.619 --> 00:16:46.290
What I want you to do is what this fellow's
already doing.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.850
Cross your arms, please.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.230
Cross your arms.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.730
Take the sound of your voice, move it up in
your nose.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.660
It goes like this: [nasally voice] expected.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.870
Here you go.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.070
One, two, three.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.070
Go.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.070
&gt;&gt;audience: Expected.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.070
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.070
Sounds like finance departments.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.070
[laughter] Okay, I'm just kidding.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.820
I'm just kidding.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.069
What is higher than [nasally voice] expected?

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:10.980
Oh, and by the way, what is the traditional
definition of customer satisfaction?

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.980
Meeting customer--

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.980
&gt;&gt;audience: Expectations.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.980
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --expectations.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.990
Look how low that is on the scale.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.480
So what is one step higher?

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.709
It's when you serve someone the way they like
it.

00:17:20.709 --> 00:17:22.439
They way they hope for it.

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:23.569
The way they prefer it.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.790
The word I use is called--

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.790
&gt;&gt;audience: Desire.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.850
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Desire, right?

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:31.150
So that's getting the clean taxi with the
friendly taxi driver with the guy-- right?

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.059
When you get it, you go, "Ah!

00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:34.179
That's what I was hoping for.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.179
That's what I--"

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.179
&gt;&gt;audience: Desire.

00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:37.179
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Desire.

00:17:37.179 --> 00:17:38.179
Okay, now, here's how you say this one.

00:17:38.179 --> 00:17:39.320
Shoulders, please.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.070
Like this-- Your shoulder's broken?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.240
Come on.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.240
There you go.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.240
Now you add the sound.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.270
It goes like this: [starts low, ends high]
Desire.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.419
Give it a shot.

00:17:48.419 --> 00:17:49.580
[laughter] One, two, three.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.580
Here we go.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.580
Go.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.580
&gt;&gt;audience: Desire.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.580
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Come on, Googlers, one more time.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.580
It's not on lunchtime.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.580
One, two, three.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.580
Go.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.580
&gt;&gt;audience and Kaufman: Desire.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.580
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.760
Tell your partner how well he did that.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.930
Go.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.280
[audience murmurs]

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.870
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Now, let's just see if this is
relevant.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.630
Let's do these three levels together.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.630
Down low is--

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.390
&gt;&gt;audience and Kaufman: [low, drawn out voice]
Basic.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.710
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: One level up, cross your arms.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.330
&gt;&gt;audience and Kaufman: [nasally voice] Expected.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.330
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Shoulders.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.330
[snaps]

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.330
&gt;&gt;audience: [start low, ends high] Desire.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.149
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: What would be an example at Google?

00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:25.179
What would be an example of something that
you do that someone else would say, "Ah yeah,

00:18:25.179 --> 00:18:26.400
it was the bare minimum.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.400
It was late.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400
It was incomplete.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400
It was slow.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.909
It didn't have all the data that I could have
used."

00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:33.830
What would be [nasally voice] expected?

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:34.830
Industry average?

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.830
Normal?

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.420
Oh, and then what would be the way they like
it?

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.559
That would cause them to say, "Ah, that's
what I was hoping for!

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:43.559
That's what I--"

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:44.559
&gt;&gt;audience: Desire.

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.559
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Desire.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.799
Okay, talk to your partner for a moment.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:47.799
Go.

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:51.899
What's an example of that at Google?

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:59.309
[audience murmurs]

00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:06.720
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.429
Good.

00:19:10.429 --> 00:19:14.139
Okay.

00:19:14.139 --> 00:19:19.870
Notice by the way that what you're describing
right now is someone else's experience with

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.350
what we do at Google, not what we do at Google.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.350
Right?

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.350
It's not a checklist.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.460
It's not a procedure.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.650
It's not a KPI.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.429
It's someone else's experience of that.

00:19:30.429 --> 00:19:33.429
That becomes very clear when we take the next
step.

00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:34.750
Above desire is the unexpected.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.779
It's the one that you didn't know was coming.

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.880
I call it [voice squeaks] surprising.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.880
Okay.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.919
The way you say it is like getting a gift,
with your hands like this.

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:43.919
[voice squeaks] Surprising.

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:44.919
Try it.

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:45.919
One, two, three.

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:46.919
Here we go.

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:47.919
&gt;&gt;audience: [voices squeak] Surprising.

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:48.919
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: [voice squeaks] Surprising.

00:19:48.919 --> 00:19:49.919
Very good.

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:55.340
Has anybody ever bought you a gift, wrapped
it up, brought it to the party, birthday,

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.340
holiday.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.909
You opened it, and when you saw what it was,
you were genuinely surprised.

00:19:59.909 --> 00:20:00.909
[squeaks] Ever happened?

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:01.909
[laugher] Ever happened?

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:02.909
&gt;&gt;male #12: Not exactly that sound.

00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:04.990
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Not exactly that sound.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.230
[laughter] But okay, you got the surprise.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.230
Now.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.390
Has anybody ever given you a gift.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.980
They bought it, they wrapped it up, they brought
it to the party.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:18.769
But when you opened it up, and you saw what
it was, you went, "Eheh." [laughter] Hmm?

00:20:18.769 --> 00:20:21.490
And then, to be polite, you pretended to be
surprised.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.260
Okay, now what was the difference between
those two things?

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.340
In both cases, whoever bought it for you intended
to surprise you.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.279
In one case, [squeaks] it worked.

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:33.919
In the other case, eheh, it didn't.

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:36.000
What was the fundamental difference?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.370
Talk to your partner.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.500
Go.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:48.750
[audience murmurs]

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:56.909
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: The difference, the fundamental
difference, was whether or not the person

00:20:56.909 --> 00:21:00.740
who bought that for you understood what you--

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.919
&gt;&gt;audience: Wanted.

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:06.460
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Not necessarily what you wanted
or what you expected, because if you already

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.930
wanted it, you already expected it, it wasn't
a--

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:09.930
&gt;&gt;audience: Surprise.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:10.930
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: [voice squeaks] Surprise.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.899
If they understood, though, what you v-v-v--

00:21:12.899 --> 00:21:14.120
&gt;&gt;audience: Value.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.470
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --value, and they put some creative
thought into it: "If she values this and I

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.750
do that, aha!"

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.200
A nice surprise.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.380
On the other hand, when the experience is
"eheh", maybe they got you something they

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.130
value.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.519
Maybe they got you something that you used
to value, but they haven't stayed current.

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:36.460
I guess it would be like if you had a data
to understand somebody's needs and interest,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.669
and they weren't really current, and you're
still serving up to them some results that

00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:42.400
was what they were interested in before, they're
not going, "Oh, what a surprise!"

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.090
They're going, "Boy, are you out of date."

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:50.080
Now, the level of service above surprising
is really where you astonish.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.450
It's extraordinary.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.649
The world I use for this is unbelievable.

00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:58.120
We're not going to demonstrate it yet because
I want to go below basic.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.649
What is below basic?

00:21:59.649 --> 00:22:00.669
It's terrible.

00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:01.690
It's awful.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.700
It's horrible.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.110
It's so bad, I call it--

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.110
&gt;&gt;female #5: Criminal.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.110
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --criminal.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.110
Right.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.610
I don't mean break the law, but I mean you
broke a promise.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.330
Like there's a service brand.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.639
There's a marketing promise there.

00:22:13.639 --> 00:22:15.010
There's an expectation there.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.279
And you violate it.

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:20.020
They way you say this one at the bottom is
you put your hands together like handcuffs,

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.020
please.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.020
Here we go.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.020
So you did that quickly.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.020
[laughter] Priors.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.020
[laughter] Hands together.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.020
Just go like this.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.299
[gravely low voice] Criminal.

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:28.309
Here we go.

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:29.320
One, two, three.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320
And:

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.000
&gt;&gt;audience and Kaufman: [gravely low voice]
Criminal.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.240
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: One step up.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.279
&gt;&gt;audience and Kaufman: [low, drawn out voice]
Basic.

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:40.799
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Cross your arms.

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:41.840
&gt;&gt;audience and Kaufman: [nasally voice] Expected.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Shoulders.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.840
&gt;&gt;audience and Kaufman: [start low, ends high]
Desire.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.840
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Hands.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840
&gt;&gt;audience: [voices squeak] Surprising.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: And fifth, here we go.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840
Un--

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840
&gt;&gt;audience: Unbelievable.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.840
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: I got a back row here, they're
going, [voice fades out] "Unbelievable."

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.840
[laughter] That's a basic unbelievable.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840
Come on.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.840
Google, give me one unbelievable unbelievable.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840
One, two, three, and:

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840
&gt;&gt;audience: [loudly] Unbelievable.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.289
How is the service at Google?

00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:58.429
&gt;&gt;audience: Unbelievable.

00:22:58.429 --> 00:22:59.429
[laughter]

00:22:59.429 --> 00:23:01.760
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: I admire your enthusiasm.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.110
[laughter] What would our customers say?

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.309
What would the people you serve say?

00:23:08.309 --> 00:23:11.692
If you're an internal service provider, you
work with colleagues in California and in

00:23:11.692 --> 00:23:14.220
another part of the world in another group.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.279
If you're an external service provider, if
you're working with Google partners, what

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:19.279
would they say?

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:23.039
What would their experience be of the quality
of service, the value that you create for

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:24.039
them?

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:25.039
Ready?

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:26.039
Turn to your partner.

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:28.000
Six levels of service.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.400
Go.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.200
[audience murmurs]

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.000
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Aha.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.740
Hold on, hold on.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.059
Now it gets more tricky.

00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:45.549
Now it gets more tricky.

00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:47.740
We say, "We are committed to service excellence."

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.279
A lot of organizations say that, so let me
ask you the question: where is excellence

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:54.250
on these six levels of service?

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.500
It's not one of the six words.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.649
But you get the question I'm asking you, right?

00:23:58.649 --> 00:24:01.409
Where is excellence on these six levels?

00:24:01.409 --> 00:24:04.120
Talk to your partner.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.909
[audience murmurs]

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:12.019
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Okay, tell me.

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:13.200
Yell it out, please.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200
Excellence is--

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.210
&gt;&gt;male #13: Expected.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.210
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --expected.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.210
Excellence is--

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.210
&gt;&gt;audience: Desired.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.210
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --desired.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.210
Excellence is--

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.210
&gt;&gt;audience: Surprising.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.210
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --surprising.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.210
Oh my God, how come all over the place?

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.500
The reason you can't just put your finger
on it is these six levels are not stairs like

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.500
they look.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.039
This thing's an escalator.

00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:33.539
It's constantly going down.

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:38.169
What I mean by that is that you come out with
something new, it's only new for a short period,

00:24:38.169 --> 00:24:39.169
and then it's

00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:40.169
&gt;&gt;male #13: Nice.

00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:41.169
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --nice.

00:24:41.169 --> 00:24:43.789
Then nice becomes normal, and normal becomes
no big deal.

00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:48.140
How many of you remember this? [laughter]
You laugh!

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.730
But when it first came out, it was--

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:50.730
&gt;&gt;audience: Unbelievable.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:51.730
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Unbelievable.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.720
Today: [low, drawn out voice] Basic.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.900
[laughter] So back to my question: if the
stairs keep slipping down, what does it mean

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.350
to be excellent on the six levels of service?

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.649
Where is excellence?

00:25:02.649 --> 00:25:05.030
Talk to your partner.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.370
[audience murmurs]

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:13.700
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Right.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.870
Right.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.299
Excellence has become a moving--

00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:19.299
&gt;&gt;male #14: Target.

00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:20.299
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --target.

00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:23.919
The only way, then, that you could be excellent
at Google or anywhere else in your life is

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:24.970
if you keep stepping--

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:25.970
&gt;&gt;audience: Up.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:26.970
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Up.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.309
Okay, so now let's be definitional.

00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:30.600
Remember ontological linguistic distinctions.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.250
What is service excellence?

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.009
I challenge you in business in your life to
ask a lot of leaders that and see what kind

00:25:36.009 --> 00:25:38.029
of a fluffy answer they come up with.

00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:45.910
This is a grounded answer: service excellence
is taking the next step up to create more

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.309
value for someone else.

00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:55.500
The service excellence culture is where every
single person comes to work every day and

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.210
says, "That's what I'm up to.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.759
I'm not here doing my job, I'm not here following
a procedure.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:03.879
I'm here taking some action that creates some
value.

00:26:03.879 --> 00:26:07.029
If I stand still, by default, I'm going to
be--"

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:08.029
&gt;&gt;male #15: Going down.

00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:09.029
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Stepping down.

00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:10.940
Especially in the competitive world that you
folks work in.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.940
[pause] So I want you to apply this to your
job right now.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:20.179
What would be an example of doing what you
do, but doing it a little bit differently,

00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:23.350
and someone else would say, "Thanks, I appreciate
that.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.789
That's better."

00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:26.039
It might be something more proactive.

00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:27.240
It might be better follow-up.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240
It could be greater flexibility.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.470
It might be additional options.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.470
I don't know.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.080
But it's got to be something that the other
person will--

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.360
&gt;&gt;audience: Appreciate.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.909
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --appreciate and v-v-v--

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:37.090
&gt;&gt;audience: Value.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.090
Okay?

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.090
Talk to your partner.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:43.509
Apply this to your job, right now.

00:26:43.509 --> 00:26:50.250
[audience murmurs]

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:56.990
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:09.620
All right, Googlers, come on back.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.450
Fundamental principle-- By the way, how old
do you think somebody needs to be to understand

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.450
that?

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.149
[pause] Catch it in your early teens, which
is where it should be taught.

00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:23.740
Now, let's couple that principle with this
one: service is delivered in a sequence.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.840
For example, I go to a web page and I type
in what I'm looking for.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.130
I start to see results.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.130
Then I click through.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.539
Then I see if I can navigate easily to get
what I'm looking for.

00:27:31.539 --> 00:27:33.250
Then I'm going to go back again, etc.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.499
Da-da-da-da-da-da, at some point, I'm gone.

00:27:35.499 --> 00:27:40.809
Same thing is true going to a restaurant,
same thing is true with most service in life.

00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:47.710
Every one of those points is evaluated by
the person being served on those six levels

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:49.279
of service.

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:54.690
How many of those points need to be below
[nasally voice] expected to mess up a service

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.690
experience?

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.789
&gt;&gt;male #16: One.

00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:57.840
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: One.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.450
How many of them need to be [voice squeaks]
surprising?

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.009
Assuming all the rest are [nasally voice]
expected to make it a good experience?

00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:05.009
&gt;&gt;audience: One.

00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:06.920
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Also one.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.920
That's the power.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.210
If you get everybody coming to work going,
"My job is to keep stepping up", you don't

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.379
need everybody to be surprising about everything
all day.

00:28:14.379 --> 00:28:17.860
You need everybody looking for an opportunity
to surprise.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:22.840
An example of that is at Changi Airport, where
they have the ambition to be known as one

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.549
of the friendliest airports in the world.

00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:26.500
They have a critical transaction.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.950
It's called arrivals.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:33.590
It starts when the aircraft door opens and
it ends when the taxi door closes.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:39.249
In between those two doors is an experience
that you have going through arrivals and immigration

00:28:39.249 --> 00:28:42.950
and getting your bags and customs and taxi
lines.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:47.740
One of those points was getting a low score
on the friendly scale.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.260
It was causing a problem.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.440
Which point do you think that might be?

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.220
Immigration.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.690
It's not their job to be friendly.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.010
[laughter] Right?

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:03.309
But Changi Airport wants to be and is the
most awarded airport on the planet, so they

00:29:03.309 --> 00:29:04.419
analyzed it.

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:08.110
They dug in and they said, "Look, we've got
to get these guys to be more smiley and more

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:12.500
friendly and say nice things to 42 million
passengers a year?

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.500
Please."

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.999
In fact, they tried it and it was a problem
because then the line slowed down.

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:22.110
[laughter] So they innovated, and they took
another step up.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.950
They actually did something very simple: on
every single one of the immigration counters,

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.450
they put one of these.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.150
It's a box of candies.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.360
Of breath mints.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.450
And they changed the script for the immigration
officers.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.450
All they have to say now when you walk up,
is they say, "Passport."

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.990
You hand it over and they say one word: "Sweet?"

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.100
42 million people: [voice squeaks] Oh!

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.100
Sweet.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.100
Friendly score shot up.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.890
Now, that's just a tiny example.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.571
Just like improving something in a search
result or improving something on a web page

00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:54.159
is a tiny example.

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:57.800
But it's the accumulation of those that produces
a powerful experience.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.210
For example, at Changi Airport, if you're
carrying something that you're not allowed

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:05.610
to bring on board the aircraft, and it happens,
now you can mail it back to yourself on the

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.260
spot.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.700
Solves a problem.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.970
Turns a complaint into a differentiator.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:17.539
You can have a butterfly experience at Changi
Airport in between your flights.

00:30:17.539 --> 00:30:19.950
Go to-- There's a little botanic garden.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:24.600
You just stand still, and butterflies will
come and land on you.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.090
[laughter] What's that got to do with an airport?

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:32.029
Well, if you want to be the number 1 airport
in the world, you want to be stress-free,

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:33.669
surprising, personal.

00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:35.070
What if you have kids?

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.629
Because they're not going to sit still for
a butterfly.

00:30:37.629 --> 00:30:40.710
What you want to do is tire them out before
the next flight.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:46.679
Take them to the indoor slide that's four
stories tall, that's the largest one in the

00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:50.080
country, and for free, your kids can go up
and down and up and down and up and down,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.350
so on the next flight, they will sleep.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.350
Creating Value.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.600
Monday morning, have a free coffee.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.169
What's driving them is this: it's your experience.

00:31:01.169 --> 00:31:02.360
It turns them on.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.830
That's what they call their inspiration.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.770
I know that at Google, you're doing it all
the time.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.369
You've also got a B to C and a B to D model.

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:13.299
This is one of our web pages up in the front.

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:16.580
You'll see it when you go to the homepage
at Up Your Service.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.740
That's from the butterfly garden.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.230
Well, this is from Singapore Airlines.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.539
That's B to C as well, for the most part,
except for cargo.

00:31:22.539 --> 00:31:26.590
This is Marina Bay Sands, one of the new,
very large, integrated resorts that recently

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.590
opened in Singapore.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:31.660
It's another B to C. Parkway Medical, another
one of the groups we're working with.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.960
So in many different industries, they get
it about improving service.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.809
But it's not only B to C.

00:31:36.809 --> 00:31:38.280
This is a company called Vopak.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.980
They are the largest oil and chemical storage
company in the world.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.570
I want you to see what we've been doing with
them, what they've been doing with the same

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.570
simple models.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:48.590
Now look at this.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:53.749
They have taken what they do in the terminals,
and they've mapped it out.

00:31:53.749 --> 00:31:58.779
This is what happens when a guest, one of
their customers, comes to visit the terminal.

00:31:58.779 --> 00:32:00.570
Look how many points they identified.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:06.249
Then, they drilled down under every one of
those points and said, "What would be criminal,

00:32:06.249 --> 00:32:11.559
basic, expected, desired, surprising, or unbelievable
for the people visiting our terminal at every

00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:12.559
one of those points?"

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:18.019
Oh, and then they did it again, for visiting
a customer at their office, which some of

00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:20.119
you Googlers do.

00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:23.740
Then they did it again, for getting a new
contract.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.110
Then they did it again, for actually executing
on the business that they're all about.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.980
Then they did it again, even for handling
customer feedback.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.179
Can you imagine the number of innovative improvements
they were able to identify?

00:32:35.179 --> 00:32:41.710
And that's just two of the simple models that
I've shown you here.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:46.710
Every single perception point is evaluated
on the six levels of service, and it's always

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.429
slipping down.

00:32:49.429 --> 00:32:55.120
So that first model, second model, third,
fourth, and fifth, constitute a fundamental

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.809
set of service education, that you can learn
more about at the website.

00:32:58.809 --> 00:33:01.070
Now, how many times did you learn math?

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.460
How many times did you learn history, and
science, and English?

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.850
Not once.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.870
And yet, companies today think they can send
somebody to a service class and they're done.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:09.990
Doesn't work that way.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:15.400
Here's a whole other set of education, about
building a deeper service partnership.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.850
Here's a whole other set of education, on
increasing customer loyalty.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.539
This is the area where, if you want to build
a coach, you've got to dig down deep underneath,

00:33:24.539 --> 00:33:28.539
and see what are the fundamental principles
of service.

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:30.789
That's what it is that I think needs to be
educated in the world.

00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:34.490
In the book that you got today, the fourth
section is called Learn.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:39.279
It has all those principles explained with
examples and action steps to apply.

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:40.629
That's the educational base.

00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:43.549
Now let's jump to the top and look at leadership.

00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:45.850
Who said that?

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:50.509
[pause] Most of you, I imagine, would own
at least one of his products.

00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:52.429
[pause] Steve Jobs.

00:33:52.429 --> 00:33:53.429
Right.

00:33:53.429 --> 00:33:56.820
Passionate about "What's the customer's experience
with that product going to be.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:03.400
Who said this? [pause] I'll give you a hint:
he likes to sell things.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.679
In fact, he's created the largest retail organization
on the planet.

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.710
23 million employees.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:10.710
Right?

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:11.710
Wal-Mart.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:12.710
Sam Walton.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:20.080
Who said this? [pause] Give you a hint: your
industry turned around an organization that'd

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.630
become arrogant and complacent and confident
that they knew better.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.820
It was Lou Gerstner.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:28.220
The man who went from American Express to
IBM and turned it around.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.270
Who said this? [pause]

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.310
&gt;&gt;male #17: Walt Disney.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.830
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: That's exactly correct.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.540
You know because you have kids.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.540
[laughter]

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.800
&gt;&gt;male #17: I don't.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.800
[laughter]

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.190
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: [laughs] You are a kid.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.820
[laughter]
Who said this?

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.400
It's Albert Einstein.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.610
Now let's get a little closer to home.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:56.520
Who said this? [laughter] Your guy.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:04.510
[laughter] And who said this? [pause] Your
other guy.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:10.560
So the awareness of the need to satisfy users,
it's always been there, from the very beginning.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.150
It's in the DNA of the organization.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.360
You understand taking action to create--

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360
&gt;&gt;audience: Value.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.740
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --value for someone else.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:21.450
You're fundamentally a service organization,
as is every single position inside this organization.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:25.750
We could do a lot more on leadership, and
there's a section in the book on that called

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:29.420
Lead, but I want to spend just a moment peeking
at this area in the middle.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.210
These 12 building blocks.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:37.520
These are common practice, especially in an
organization the size of Google.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.420
But it doesn't mean that the way they're being
done is necessarily best practice for creating

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.930
a cultural environment that constantly reinforces
and reminds people about the importance of

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.650
taking action to create more value for somebody
else.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:55.490
This is where companies get confused, because
these 12 different building blocks are often

00:35:55.490 --> 00:36:01.320
handled by different parts of the organization
who don't see the need to work closely together.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.760
All Singapore Airlines is doing is this.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.700
This is what all of the companies that are
differentiating based on customer experience

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.480
have figured out how to do.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.930
These are the 12 building blocks.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:18.380
Now, there's a very large section in the book
called Build, in which each one of these blocks

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.400
has a chapter.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:25.250
In each chapter are global best practices
and actionable steps that leaders and service

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.360
providers can take to actually make these
things stronger.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.600
Today, we don't have time to go through all
of them, but on the website, there are videos

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600
about each of them.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600
They're free.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600
They're all on YouTube as well.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.980
I want to just zoom in on two of these right
now.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:43.920
One of them is the critical importance of
having what I call an engaging service vision.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.750
Something that turns people on and makes them
want to do that.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.310
To say it in a way that people go, "Yeah,
that's what we're about!"

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.900
The key word here is not vision.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.370
The key word here isn't even service.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:58.080
The key word is engaging, because otherwise,
it's just words on the wall.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.770
Here's an example.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.570
[pause] Texas.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.020
Anybody here from Texas?

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.260
[pause] Okay.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.260
Texas is a country.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.260
You know that.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.260
[laughter] Right?

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.090
We're proud Texans.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.670
For good reason.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.170
They had a litter problem.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:18.950
The litter problem was that males between
the age of 19 and 35 were driving their pickup

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:23.360
truck with a shotgun in the back and throwing
the beer cans out on the highway.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.900
The litter was accumulating.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.880
The State Department of Transportation had
to spend more and more and more money each

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.470
year clearing it up.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.200
So they decided to have a campaign: Give a
Hoot, Don't Pollute.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.330
Think it worked?

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.450
&gt;&gt;male #18: [inaudible]

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.010
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: You know why?

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.030
Because in Texas, owls are considered varmints.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.490
[laughter] Didn't work at all.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.170
So they really went into the psychology of
what would it take to engage these [brawny

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.870
voice] proud, young, men who are Texans and
don't you tell them otherwise.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.060
They just changed the name of the program.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.060
Do you know what it is?

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.060
Don't--

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.060
&gt;&gt;female #6: Mess with Texas.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.850
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Don't Mess with Texas.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.820
Today, you could be driving along in your
pickup and throw a beer can out the window,

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.820
but you better watch out who's behind you,
because they may be saying, "Don't you mess

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.820
with my state."

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:11.170
Only by making that change in the vision of
what the program was about, the litter went

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:14.110
down and the expense went down.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:18.690
Texas highways today are looking better because
somebody figured out a better vision.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:23.590
When I started working with this company,
joint venture between Nokia and Siemens, and

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:28.620
the Teleco hardware and software space, they
had just approved a new marketing campaign

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.380
that was called-- two words: Knowing How.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.480
Think about that.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.250
Knowing How.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.230
Who is that appealing to?

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:42.910
[pause] The engineers and the people who work
there were proudly saying, "We know!"

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.330
But how appealing is that to the companies
that you serve?

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.660
People don't really care what you know.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.190
There's a lot of smart people in this company.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.240
They don't care so much what you know as what
you do with what you know for--

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.240
&gt;&gt;audience:Them.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.240
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --for them.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.140
So we simply changed it to Know How, Act Now.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.010
But now we're coming to the final exam of
this presentation.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.730
What's the purpose of the action?

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.230
Is it just to show that you know?

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.000
Or is it to actually create an impact for
the other person?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Right.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
We added two more words.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.910
It became Know How, Act Now, Create Wow.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.990
Which is the definition of the word unbelievable.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:27.000
This is now driving 60,000 people in the organization
to know "Who is my customer?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.350
What is their pain point?

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:29.630
What have we done for them in the past?

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:31.410
What are they currently complaining about?

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.630
What is our competition offering?

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:35.560
Who else in my organization is in communication
with them?

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:48.150
What action can I take that they will appreciate?"

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:56.950
Clear?

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.540
That's about as-- as it gets.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.120
But they understood this, and they said, "Okay,
we're going to come up with a new vision.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:07.000
It's called Creating Value Beyond the Numbers."

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.150
Think about what that means for a finance
department to say, "Our mission is not to

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:14.380
get the report right, not to just make the
payments, not to just be a normal, expected

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.470
finance department.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:20.550
We've got to now reach out to our colleagues
and help create more value for them.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.760
How to use the data.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.180
How to interpret these charts.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.770
How to use this to help you make better decisions."

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.970
Okay, pause for a second.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:32.160
What is the engaging surface vision for the
group that you work with?

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.550
If you've got one, share it.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.870
If you don't have one, now's the chance to
go, "You know, we should really figure that

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:37.870
out."

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:38.870
Okay?

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.210
Talk to your partner.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:43.930
Go.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:49.360
[audience murmurs]

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.800
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Okay.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:00.230
Don't worry.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:05.670
Don't worry.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:08.870
Most organizations in the world haven't taken
this step yet.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.680
They think it's the customer service department's
job.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.490
Or they think it's up to the boss or the service
manager, not realizing, "Hey, it's all of

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:17.490
us.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.330
It's service to all of us."

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:22.290
I've got one more story for you.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:25.900
It's from that last building block right there
called service role modeling.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:31.640
But first, a question: of all the 12 building
blocks, why would service role modeling go

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.640
last?

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.490
&gt;&gt;male #19: Because you have to know how you
can do other things before you can role model.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.860
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Okay, let me ask you a question.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.860
That's good.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:46.480
[pause] Let's say you're messing up in the
other areas, but your personal role model

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.980
is really strong.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.610
The staff that you work with can see that
you're committed to responding, you'll listen

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.840
to somebody who's got a complaint, you're
going the extra mile.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.530
Do you think other people will be a bit inspired
to help you out?

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.630
Even if the other things aren't working yet.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:05.610
On the other hand, if Google nails it and
gets all of the other 11 really just right,

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:10.550
but the role model of the people in the organization
doesn't demonstrate that they believe it,

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:14.300
do you think the new people, like this woman
here, it's her second day on the job, or the

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.650
intern that's over here who's just joining
Google for the summer, do you really think

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:22.560
that they're going to go, "Oh yeah, we believe
it!" because you have the program in place?

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.010
It's the power, the impact of what you do
today.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.030
It's your voice on the phone.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:32.150
It's the way you end an email, whether you
put that little PS that says, "By the way,

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.520
just want to let you know how much I appreciate
that effort" or "Hey, here's my personal,

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.520
my cell phone.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.280
Feel free to give me a call if you need my
help."

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.340
It's that personal role model that can make
a big impact.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.530
Every one of us can do it.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:49.510
So one last story, because it reminds me so
much differently from New York, which is where

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.230
we are right now.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:57.760
An American consultant went to Sweden to work
in a large factory on an implementation project.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.510
He was from California, so he was accustomed
to warm weather.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:07.024
He gets to Sweden, he's in his hotel, he looks
outside, and it looks like this.

00:43:07.024 --> 00:43:09.430
His Swedish host comes and picks him up in
the car.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.240
A nice Volvo.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.630
The Volvo's nice and warm.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.410
Picks him up at the hotel.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:15.830
They drive to the factory.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.020
They are there early.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.640
The factory is not opening for another half
an hour.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.850
They happen to get there really early.

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.240
No traffic that day.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:28.660
The guy drives his Volvo to the farthest edge
of the parking lot away from the factory building,

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.110
steps out of the car, buttons up his big,
heavy Swedish coat.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:35.332
The American from California steps out and
starts shivering.

00:43:35.332 --> 00:43:40.120
They walk all the way across this frozen parking
lot to get into the factory.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.530
They get there, and the guy from California's
practically frozen stiff, and turns and looks

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:48.610
at his host and says, "W-w-w-w-what did you
do that for?"

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:51.320
The Swedish guy looks at him, feels fine,
says, "Do what?"

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.860
He says, "We came early.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.760
Why did you park all the way over there?"

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.800
And the Swede said, "Isn't it obvious?"

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.520
The Californian said, "What do you mean, obvious?

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.520
I'm freezing!"

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.520
He goes, "Oh.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.580
Well, see, as my colleagues come-- We came
early.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.360
So we had plenty of time.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.170
But as my colleagues come closer and closer
to the opening of the factory when we need

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.080
everybody to be on time, they're going to
have less and less time.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.300
So doesn't it make sense for me to park on
the--"

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.600
&gt;&gt;female #7: Farthest end.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.600
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Right.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.020
Now, that's taking action to create value
for someone--

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.020
&gt;&gt;male #20: Else.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.020
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --else.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.670
Doesn't it sound exactly like New York City?

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:36.960
[laughter] Making the shift from a confused
culture where there's lots of different messages

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:42.250
going on, to aligning yourself, in your case
on user experience or creating value for your

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:47.330
advertisers or helping your colleague to be
more successful or having this intern's career

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.750
step forward or making this new person at
Google feel welcome.

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.190
That's taking action to create value for somebody
else.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:58.940
It is possible to engineer the development
of a culture that does that.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:03.400
I started at the beginning a little more cerebral
than when I work with most of my clients.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.680
What are the fundamental linguistic distinctions?

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.980
Well, you better have those principles worked
out.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.930
What are the standard practices?

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.500
You better have a way that people can actually
implement.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.070
What are the strategies of the companies that
do it well?

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:19.000
That's what you'll find in the book Uplifting
Service, and you all got a copy of it today.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.440
There's a fundamental methodology, a way that
we work top down with organizations and bottom

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:29.090
up to make the results actually stick, with
implementing this over time.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.080
That's section 5 in the book, called Drive.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.480
All of this you'll find at the website.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:41.190
If you just add the words "slides" at the
end of the URL, so that it becomes upyourservice.com/slides,

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:47.240
a summary set of slides of this entire presentation
are available for download for free.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:52.650
At YouTube, I'm armed and dangerous, walking
around New York City with my little flipcam

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.000
and an external microphone.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.940
I'm shooting all the time and using your wonderful
YouTube service.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.710
Thank you very much, Google.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:02.690
And of course, the book is called Uplifting
Service.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.610
You can find out more about that at upliftingservice.com.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:10.880
Before I close, I'd like to demonstrate one
more thing to you that you'll get a personal

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.880
experience.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.560
Once again, please.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.870
Say thank you to your partner.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:16.390
[audience murmurs]

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.660
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Okay, good.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.800
Now, what level-- [laughter] Good, good.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.530
What level did you just say thank you on the
six levels of service.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.600
Criminal, basic, expected, desired, surprising,
unbelievable.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.600
Talk to your partner.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.600
What level?

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.700
[audience murmurs] [laughter]

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:36.380
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: All right, come on back.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.220
Come on back.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.040
You've got it calibrated it now, right?

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.380
You've got to calibrate it.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:46.220
In your mind, once you get ready, I'm going
to ask you to step up one level higher, or,

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:50.530
if you're really enthusiastic, step up two,
and get ready to thank your partner that way,

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.820
but at a higher level.

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.960
You ready?

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.930
Ready, ready, ready, and, and, and, go.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.630
Say thank you.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:00.330
[audience loudly murmurs]

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:03.100
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Three questions to wrap up.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.310
Question number 1: could you feel a difference,
yes or no?

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:07.310
&gt;&gt;audience: Yes.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:08.310
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Good.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:10.330
Question number 2: did it feel better or worse?

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:11.330
&gt;&gt;audience: Better.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:12.330
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Better.

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:18.940
Now here's the critical question: did it feel
better when they thanked you at a higher level,

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:25.520
or did you already start feeling better when
you were getting ready to thank them?

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.670
Which one was it?

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:28.990
Where did the good feeling come?

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:32.030
Was it already when you were getting ready,
or did it happen only when they thanked you?

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.030
&gt;audience: Getting ready.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:34.030
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Right.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.030
When you were getting ready.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:41.480
So this is the amazing not only pay it forward,
but pay it straight back to yourself of committing

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.790
yourself to do something more for someone
else.

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:50.340
The moment you make the decision to do something
to help somebody else more, the first person

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.620
who gets the benefit of that is you.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.600
The energy comes up in you, and what goes
around, comes around.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.980
What goes around, comes around.

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.260
Rub your hands together, please.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.160
[rubbing noise] Clap twice.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.590
[clapping] Hands up.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:05.590
Turn to your partner.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:11.530
[clapping] No, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, why--
Hold on a second, why'd you give him a high

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.530
five?

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:13.530
[laughter] Why'd you do that?

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:15.340
Because we've already done it a couple times
before, so it's become what?

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.340
&gt;&gt;audience: Expected.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.380
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: [nasally voice] Expected.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.570
But we're committed to stepping--

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:19.570
&gt;&gt;audience: Up.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.570
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: --up.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.570
So rub your hands together.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.940
[rubbing noise] Clap three times.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.940
[clapping] Hands up.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.940
Turn to your partner.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.630
Give him a hiiiiiiiiiii you want to give him
a high five?

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:30.170
[clapping] And then, hands up, hands up, hands
up.

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:31.380
Give him a hug!

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.380
[audience murmurs]

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.470
&gt;&gt;Kaufman: Okay, I know we're not in California.

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:38.690
[laughter] Thank you very much, Googlers,
for the privilege and the pleasure of being

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:39.690
with you today here at Google.

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:39.692
Thank you.
