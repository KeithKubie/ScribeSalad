00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:02.182
- [Voiceover] So let's ask ourselves some

00:00:02.182 --> 00:00:05.480
interesting questions about
alphabets in the English language.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.199
And in case you don't remember

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:09.846
and are in the mood to count,
there are 26 alphabets.

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:13.003
So if you go, "A, B, C,
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K,

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:15.836
L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S,
T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z,"

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:20.288
you'll get, you'll get 26, 26 alphabets.

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:22.887
Now let's ask some interesting questions.

00:00:22.887 --> 00:00:24.884
So given that there are 26 alphabets

00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:26.912
in the English language, how many

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:31.315
possible three letter words are there?

00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:33.637
And we're not going to be
thinking about phonetics

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:35.317
or how hard it is to pronounce it.

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:39.226
So, for example, the word, the word ZGT

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.042
would be a legitimate
word in this example.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:47.042
Or the word, the word, the word SKJ

00:00:47.507 --> 00:00:50.147
would be a legitimate
word in this example.

00:00:50.147 --> 00:00:52.824
So how many possible three letter words

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.728
are there in the English language?

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:55.774
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:57.376
and try to think about it.

00:00:57.377 --> 00:01:00.107
Alright, I assume you've had a go at it.

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:02.122
So let's just think about
it, for three letter words

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:04.944
there's three spaces, so how many

00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:07.522
possibilities are there for the first one?

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:10.842
Well, there's 26 possible
letters for the first one.

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:13.466
Anything from a to z
would be completely fine.

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.020
Now how many possibilities
for the second one?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.738
And I intentionally ask this to you

00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:21.639
to be a distractor because
we've seen a lot of examples.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:23.287
We're saying, "Oh,
there's 26 possibilities

00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:25.958
"for the first one and maybe
there's 25 for the second one,

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.396
"and then 24 for the third,"
but that's not the case

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:31.477
right over here because
we can repeat letters.

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:33.922
I didn't say that all of the
letters had to be different.

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:38.922
So, for example, the word, the word HHH

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:43.627
would also be a legitimate word

00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:45.415
in our example right over here.

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:47.923
So we have 26 possibilities
for the second letter

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:50.639
and we have 26 possibilities
for the third letter.

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.915
So we're going to have, and
I don't know what this is,

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:55.585
26 to the third power possibilities,

00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:58.952
or 26 times 26 time 26 and you
can figure out what that is.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.895
That is how many possible three letter

00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:03.117
words we can have for the English language

00:02:03.117 --> 00:02:05.082
if we didn't care about
how to pronounceable

00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:08.541
they are, if they meant anything
and if we repeated letters.

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:10.375
Now let's ask a different question.

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:13.440
What if we said, "How many
possible three letter words

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.674
"are there if we want
all different letters?"

00:02:17.674 --> 00:02:20.940
So we want all different letters.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.168
So these all have to be different letters.

00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:27.302
Different, different
letters and once again,

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:30.739
pause the video and see if
you can think it through.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.175
Alright, so this is where
permutations start to be useful.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:36.659
Although, I think a lot
of things like this,

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.145
it's always best to reason through

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:41.753
than try to figure out if
some formula applies to it.

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:44.043
So in this situation,
well, if we went in order,

00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:46.806
we could have 26 different
letters for the first one,

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:49.075
26 different possibilities
for the first one.

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.305
You know, I'm always
starting with that one,

00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:52.248
but there's nothing special
about the one on the left.

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:54.213
We could say that the one on the right,

00:02:54.213 --> 00:02:56.899
there's 26 possibilities, well for each

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.087
of those possibilities, for
each of those 26 possibilities,

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:02.804
there might be 25 possibilities

00:03:02.804 --> 00:03:04.197
for what we put in the middle one

00:03:04.197 --> 00:03:06.333
if we say we're going to
figure out the middle one next.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:09.360
And then for each of these
25 times 26 possibilities

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.465
for where we figured
out two of the letters,

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:13.647
there's 24 possibilities
because we've already used

00:03:13.647 --> 00:03:16.914
two letters for the last
bucket that we haven't filled.

00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:19.740
And the only reason I went 26, 25, 24

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.806
is to show you there's nothing
special about always filling

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:26.155
in the left most letter or
the left most chair first.

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:28.014
It's just about, well,
let's just think in terms

00:03:28.014 --> 00:03:30.783
of let's just fill out
one of the buckets first.

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:32.362
Hey, we have the most
possibilities for that.

00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:34.800
Once we use something up,
then for each of those

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.307
possibilities we'll
have one left, one less

00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:40.790
for the next, the next bucket.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.577
And so I could do 24 times 25 times 26,

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:44.784
but just so I don't fully confuse you,

00:03:44.784 --> 00:03:46.688
I'll go back to what I have been doing.

00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:49.242
26 possibilities for the left most one.

00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:50.918
For each of those, you
would have 25 possibilities

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:53.723
for the next one that you're
going to try to figure out

00:03:53.723 --> 00:03:54.931
because you already used one letter

00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:56.092
and they have to be different.

00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:58.413
And then for the last
bucket, you're going to have

00:03:58.413 --> 00:04:01.269
24 possibilities, so this is going to be

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.853
26 times 25 times 24,

00:04:05.853 --> 00:04:07.222
whatever that happens to be.

00:04:07.222 --> 00:04:09.350
And if we wanted to
write it in the notation

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.670
of permutations, we would
say that this is equal to,

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.199
we're taking 26 things, sorry, not two p.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.328
20, my brain is malfunctioning.

00:04:18.328 --> 00:04:21.098
26, we're figuring out how
many permutations are there

00:04:21.098 --> 00:04:24.256
for putting 26 different things into

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:27.414
three different spaces

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:30.572
and this is 26, if we just blindly apply

00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:32.963
the formula, which I never suggest doing.

00:04:32.963 --> 00:04:36.642
It would be 26 factorial over 26

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:39.643
minus three factorial,

00:04:39.643 --> 00:04:43.115
which would be 26 factorial

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:45.267
over 23 factorial,

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:47.771
which is going to be
exactly this right over here

00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:51.005
because the 23 times 22 times
21 all the way down to one

00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:54.116
is going to cancel with the 23 factorial.

00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:55.973
And so the whole point of this video,

00:04:55.973 --> 00:04:58.945
there's two points, is one,
as soon as someone says,

00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:00.617
"How many different
letters could you form"

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:01.639
or something like that, you don't just

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.891
blindly do permutations or combinations.

00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:06.213
You think about well, what is
being asked in the question.

00:05:06.213 --> 00:05:09.998
Here, I really just have to
take 26 times 26 times 26.

00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:11.168
The other thing I want to point out,

00:05:11.168 --> 00:05:12.529
and I know I keep pointing it out,

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.781
and it's probably getting tiring to you,

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:18.682
is even when permutations are applicable,

00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:20.911
in my brain, at least,
it's always more valuable

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:23.186
to just try to reason through the problem

00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:25.972
as opposed to just saying,
"Oh there's this formula

00:05:25.972 --> 00:05:28.155
"that I remember from weeks or years ago

00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:31.848
"in my life that had an N
factorial and K factorial

00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:33.666
"and I had to memorize
it, I have to look it up."

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:37.696
Always much more useful
to just reason it through.
