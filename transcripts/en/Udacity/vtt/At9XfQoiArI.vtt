00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.860
Okay, now that you have a basic
understanding of Q learning,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.939
let's consider how we can turn
the stock trading problem

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.950
into a problem that Q
learning can solve.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.750
To do that we need to
define our actions,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.400
we need to define our state, and
we also need to define our rewards.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.139
Let's start here first with actions.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.090
It's actually pretty easy.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.860
We just have three actions,
buy, sell or do nothing.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.945
So let's consider how that might
play out with an actual stock, and

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:38.390
let's suppose we've already
trained our Q learner what to do.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.746
Let's see what's likely to happen.

00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:45.560
So usually what's going to happen most
frequently is that we do nothing.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.230
There will occasionally be buys and
sells, but usually nothing.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.600
Well, at least, that's my expectation,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.170
we'll have to see when we create
these learners what actually happens.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.650
So we are evaluating
the factors of the stock.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.970
In other words, we compute, say,
several technical indicators.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.600
That is our state.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.080
We consider that state and
we do nothing.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.020
So let's suppose we do nothing for

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.450
quite a long period here,
but somehow or another,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.500
after a little while, boom, something
triggers and says we should buy.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.540
So we buy the stock
here we're holding it.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.700
We do nothing, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing, and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.910
boom, our very intelligent Q learner
says, hey now is the time to sell.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.320
And we continue like that through
the rest of our time series.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.960
Let's consider now what these buys and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.020
sells, how they affect
our portfolio value.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.620
So we start out with whatever
we've got in the bank and

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.330
there's no trading for a while.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.520
Suddenly there's a buy, and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.250
then we see an increase in our
portfolio value until we hit that sell.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.890
Then nothing.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.440
Again, another buy, and a sell.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.250
Then nothing.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.820
So you see this sort
of stepped behavior.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.289
Now of course, because I was drawing
this and I wanted us to look good,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.820
I was choosing opportunistic
times to buy and sell.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.980
Your real strategy is
probably not going to be so

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.430
good, but ideally this is the kind
of thing we'd like to see.
