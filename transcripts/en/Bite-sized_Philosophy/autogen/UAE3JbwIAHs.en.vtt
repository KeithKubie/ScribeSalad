I've learned this in part from reading

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580
I've learned this in part from reading
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.980

Young's like what do you do when you get

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
Young's like what do you do when you get
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.009
Young's like what do you do when you get
married that's easy you take someone

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
married that's easy you take someone
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.629
married that's easy you take someone
who's just as useless and horrible as

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639
who's just as useless and horrible as
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.810
who's just as useless and horrible as
you are and then you shackle yourself to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
you are and then you shackle yourself to
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.590
you are and then you shackle yourself to
them and then you say we're not running

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
them and then you say we're not running
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.400
them and then you say we're not running
away no matter what happens yeah well

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
away no matter what happens yeah well
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.870
away no matter what happens yeah well
that that's perfect because then you

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
that that's perfect because then you
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880
that that's perfect because then you
don't get to run away and the thing is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
don't get to run away and the thing is
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220
don't get to run away and the thing is
is like if you can run away you can't

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
is like if you can run away you can't
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.290
is like if you can run away you can't
tell each other the truth because if you

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
tell each other the truth because if you
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880
tell each other the truth because if you
tell someone the truth about you and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
tell someone the truth about you and
 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.229
tell someone the truth about you and
they don't run away they weren't

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
they don't run away they weren't
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.540
they don't run away they weren't
listening and so if you don't have

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
listening and so if you don't have
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.010
listening and so if you don't have
someone around to count run away then

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
someone around to count run away then
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.930
someone around to count run away then
you can't tell them the truth and so

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
you can't tell them the truth and so
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.040
you can't tell them the truth and so
that's part of the purpose of the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
that's part of the purpose of the
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
know that but given our current
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.139
know that but given our current
circumstances were unlikely to find

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
circumstances were unlikely to find
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.520

to put yourself on your feet right if
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.270
to put yourself on your feet right if
you went to a party and you found mr.

run away screaming
that would indicate that he wasn't mr.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
that would indicate that he wasn't mr.
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020

you're going to shackle yourself to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
you're going to shackle yourself to
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.670
you're going to shackle yourself to
someone who's just as a as imperfect as

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
someone who's just as a as imperfect as
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.630
someone who's just as a as imperfect as
you are and then the issue is you you

you are and then the issue is you you
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.730
you are and then the issue is you you
you might be in a situation where you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
you might be in a situation where you
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.039
you might be in a situation where you
can actually negotiate because you might

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
can actually negotiate because you might
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899

some things about me that aren't going
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.520
some things about me that aren't going
so right and we're bloody well stuck

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
so right and we're bloody well stuck

so right and we're bloody well stuck
with the consequences for the next 50

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
with the consequences for the next 50
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.819
with the consequences for the next 50
years so we could we can either

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
years so we could we can either
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.910
years so we could we can either
straighten this out or we can suffer

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
straighten this out or we can suffer
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.590
straighten this out or we can suffer
through it for the next five decades and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600
through it for the next five decades and
 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450
through it for the next five decades and
you know people are of the sort that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
you know people are of the sort that
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520
you know people are of the sort that
without that degree of seriousness those

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
without that degree of seriousness those
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.920
without that degree of seriousness those

things unnamed because there's always an

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
things unnamed because there's always an
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.459
things unnamed because there's always an

know that people who live together
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.449
know that people who live together
before they're married are more likely

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
before they're married are more likely
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.550
before they're married are more likely
to get divorced not less likely and the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
to get divorced not less likely and the
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.500
to get divorced not less likely and the
for that is what exactly are you saying

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
for that is what exactly are you saying
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.670
for that is what exactly are you saying
to one another when you live with each

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
to one another when you live with each
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.470
to one another when you live with each
other just think about it well for now

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480
 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.790

trick but I'd like to reserve the right
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.790
trick but I'd like to reserve the right
to trade you in conveniently if someone

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
to trade you in conveniently if someone
 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:47.390
to trade you in conveniently if someone
bitter happens to stumble into me well

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
bitter happens to stumble into me well
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.070
bitter happens to stumble into me well
how could how could someone not be

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
how could how could someone not be
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.750
how could how could someone not be
insulted to their core by an offer like

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760
insulted to their core by an offer like
 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.550
insulted to their core by an offer like
that now they're willing to play along

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
that now they're willing to play along
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.630
that now they're willing to play along
with it because they're going to do the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
with it because they're going to do the
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.530
with it because they're going to do the
same thing with you

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
same thing with you
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.180
same thing with you

yeah yeah I know you're not going to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690
yeah yeah I know you're not going to
 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.000
yeah yeah I know you're not going to
commit to me so that means you don't

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
commit to me so that means you don't
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.100
commit to me so that means you don't
value me or our relationship above

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110
value me or our relationship above
 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.050
value me or our relationship above
everything else but as long as I get to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
everything else but as long as I get to
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.670
everything else but as long as I get to
escape if I need to then I'm willing to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
escape if I need to then I'm willing to
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.800
escape if I need to then I'm willing to
put up with that it's like that's a hell

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810
put up with that it's like that's a hell
 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.059
put up with that it's like that's a hell
of a say I mean you might think how

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069
of a say I mean you might think how
 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.070
of a say I mean you might think how
stupid is it to shackle yourself to

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
stupid is it to shackle yourself to
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.539
stupid is it to shackle yourself to
someone it's like it's stupid man

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549
someone it's like it's stupid man
 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.710
someone it's like it's stupid man
there's no doubt about that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720
there's no doubt about that
 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.930
there's no doubt about that
but compared to the alternatives it's

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940
but compared to the alternatives it's
 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.059
but compared to the alternatives it's
pretty damn good because without that

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069
pretty damn good because without that
 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.160
pretty damn good because without that
shackling there are things you will

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
shackling there are things you will
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.620
