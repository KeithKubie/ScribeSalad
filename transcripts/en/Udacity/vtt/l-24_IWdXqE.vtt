Great job going through this
lesson on jQuery events.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.780
You now know how to set up
event listeners with jQuery.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.480
You can now listen for user interaction 
and respond to those interactions.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.320
Fantastic work.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.710
So get out there and listen for
those mouse clicks, key presses, and

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.970
form submissions.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.720
Bring your pages to life and
start engaging with your users.
