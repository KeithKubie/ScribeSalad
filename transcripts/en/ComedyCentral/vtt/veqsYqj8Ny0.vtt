00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.505
ONE OF THOSE FIRST, LIKE,
BOY-GIRL PARTIES,

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:05.739
AND THERE ARE NO PARENTS THERE,

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.241
AND YOU'RE LIKE,
"COOL RANCH DORITOS?

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:09.843
COOKIE KRISP?"
I MEAN, WE'RE HAVING FUN.

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:11.011
WE'RE GOING AFTER IT.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.846
I'M LIKE 4'9".

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.882
I'M LIKE A STRAIGHT-UP
LITTLE BOY,

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.617
I GO TO TALK
TO MY FRIEND LIZZIE,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.285
WHO IS THIS GIRL
THAT I HAD A CRUSH ON.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.153
LIKE, I WAS GONNA BE LIKE,
"HEY, DID YOU READ THAT ARTICLE

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.755
IN <i>HIGHLIGHTS</i> MAGAZINE?"

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.390
AND LIZZIE IS
SITTING THERE, LOOKING AT ME,

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.658
LIKE, UGH,
THIS GUY'S THE WORST.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.361 line:0%
 
AND THIS GIRL JENNY,
WHOSE HOUSE IT WAS,

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.695 line:0%
 
COMES UP
FROM BEHIND

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.999 line:0%
 
AND PANTSES ME
BECAUSE THERE WAS THAT YEAR,

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.536 line:0%
 
LIKE, SEVENTH GRADE,
WHERE PANTSING WAS AN EPIDEMIC.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.438
SO JENNY PULLS DOWN
MY LITTLE GAP KIDS KHAKIS,

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.507
BUT HERE IS THE REAL PROBLEM,
WAS THAT I WAS ALSO WEARING

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.109
SILK BOXER SHORTS.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.044
I DON'T KNOW IF I THOUGHT
I WAS LIKE A TINY HUGH HEFNER.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.746
[jazz music]

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.080
THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE SILK

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.917
AGAINST THE SMOOTHNESS
OF MY LITTLE BOY PENIS,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.619
EVERYTHING COMES DOWN,
AND I'M JUST NOW BUCK NAKED.

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:56.156
MY LIFETIME CHILDHOOD CRUSH
LIZZIE IS STARING STRAIGHT

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.026
AT ME
AND MY TINY, LITTLE CASHEW.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.795
THE GIRL WHO PANTSED ME,
SHE'S TRAUMATIZED,

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.431
LIZZIE IS TRAUMATIZED,

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.967
I AM NOW A COMEDIAN.
