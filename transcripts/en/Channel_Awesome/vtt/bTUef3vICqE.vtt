00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.720

NC: I don't know,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.540
but we gotta keep this life-changing technology a secret,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.680
and only use it to sing songs and 
take down other competing bands.

say "Cut!" because you're not directing this.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.320
Analyst #1: Yes, the chart made that quite clear.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.040

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.280
Tamara: Yeah, this isn't really what the show is about.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.220
Analyst #2: Trust me, we worked on the Jem movie.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.880
Analyst #1: Yes, and if there's anything we've figured out, it's that people want adaptations with

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.160
'80s music, Holograms, and 
truly outrageous adventures.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.580
Malcolm: Are you sure that's not what they 
just wanted for a Jem movie?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.060
Analyst #1: I don't understand.
Can you phrase your question in the form of a chart?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.980

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.880
[loud smack]

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.820
Thank you.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.560
I mean, if this is what they think the mass 
audience wants, we should at least try it.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.420
Tamara: Have you seen the Jem movie?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.880
NC: Well, for the sake of this analogy to work, I'll say no.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.820
Malcolm: Why don't you watch it first?

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.620
NC: The original Jem and the Holograms
was a SLIGHTLY dated 80's cartoon.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.220
Just, just slightly.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.120
It centered around a singer who led a double life using technology from a supercomputer named Synergy,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.420
to use holograms in her earrings to disguise herself.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.340
It was...it was Jem...

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.120
...which is more than I can say for the movie.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.960
The film is being quickly being regarded 
as one of the worst adaptations of all time.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.180
Not only did viewers freak when they saw that

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.480
the trailer virtually had nothing to do 
with the original source material,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.680
but so few people saw it, that it was
pulled from theaters in literally two weeks.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.000
TWO WEEKS! That's faster than when we figured 
out Saddam Hussein might be a bad guy!

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.480
It was ignored by the masses, panned by the critics, 
and despised by true fans of the original show.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.880
Is it worth all the hatred?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.840
Well, spike up your hair and ignore 
that little voice in your head saying:

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.080
"This is wrong."

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.640
This is Jem and the Hologram-

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.720
Tamara: Uh, we're still here.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.020
NC: So you are.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.780
Tamara: OK...yup...see you later...OK...bye...
Malcolm: Oh, OK...yeah...have a nice review.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.120
NC: -Grams.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.900
You'll notice that this movie
was made by BH Productions,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.320
known primarily for making horror films.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.840
That's so easy, I'm just gonna give you a pass on that joke, movie.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.980
But you better have tougher material for me later.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.720
We open with performer and famed Sharknado star, Aubrey Peeples, playing Jerrica,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.160
who is making a video about how she became Jem.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.520
Jerrica: "My little sister Kimber."

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.500
"Now you know how some people
go online and overshare?"

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.240
"Every tiny little detail of her life
is just an open e-Book for everyone to see."

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.000
NC: Yeah, tell me more about how 
your sister shares everything

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.320
in this TWO HOUR video about how you became a star!

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.860
You know what, movie? I'll let this one pass too.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.440
In fact, give me the first hit. 
You can have the first hit, it's okay.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.980
[light smack]

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.800
Great, now I have to be relentless on ya!

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.900
She lives with her aunt, Molly Ringwald.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.220
No, really. Molly Ringwald is in this.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.600
I'll give you two seconds to let out a little cry.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.600
[short cry]

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.420
Okay.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.540
Who has two foster daughters and, according to Jerrica--

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.240
Jerrica: "There's only one missing piece...my dad."

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.700
NC: Because, like in all bad movies, 
dead mothers don't mean shit!

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.860
Jerrica: "He would call me his diamond 
in the rough or...his...gem."

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.860
NC (as Jerrica): "Spelled with a J.
He specifically said that every time."

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.520
NC: He's working on a device called Synergy.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.420
Yep. THAT'S the supercomputer from the show.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.200
Don't blink or you'll confuse which one is which!

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.060
And by the way, they never do say what he died of,
but by looking at his incredibly deteriorating health

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.480
you know it just had to be broad-shoulder-itis.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.360
You know, the same that I'm sure 
took her mother that doesn't exist.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.260
Jerrica: "I still feel like he's with me."

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.240
NC: Oh, by the way, that's not the title.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.220
They're just reminding you that you ARE 
watching Jem and the Holograms.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.020
You didn't wander into the wrong theater.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.020
Jerrica: "Now, I know what you're thinking: 'This many girls under one roof, recipe for disaster', right?"

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.740
"Well, if you're thinking that, that's sexist 
and you should be ashamed of yourself."

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.660
NC: Yeah, they do non-sexist things like get in
arguments about what clothes to wear.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.260
Kimber: "Every time, she's in my favorite skirt!"

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.580
[incoherent arguing]

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.220

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.560
Kimber: "I don't want to look like
a fashion refugee from 1985!"

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.880
NC: Let's just measure the frustration every 
pissed-off Jem fan must be having with, say...

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.220
a really pissed-off Jem fan with 
her hair serving as a mood ring.

Trust me, you're going to see a lot of her.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.700
But it's okay, because they solve all their problems by humming in harmony.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.100
No, really. No matter what the issue is,
that always seems to solve everything.

she's cool, too, I guess..."

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.180
Yeah...kinda screwing Kimber over
on all this, isn't he?

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.120
This isn't just playing favorites! This is putting together a league of "Screw You!"

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.540
Thankfully, Kimber wasn't in the room
when he completely forgets her existence,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.460
and Jem wraps up her quote/unquote "confession".

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.260
Jerrica: "I promised to you the truth, and a confession...of who I really am."

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.260
NC: Yeah...I was shocked this girl rock star was a girl rock star--wait, what am I supposed to learn?

00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:01.400
So, this TWO HOUR confession that apparently her bandmates were just listening quietly to the whole time

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.320
gets deleted and is never shown to a solitary soul.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.880
Not that I don't wish everything in this film could be erased, but WHAT WAS THE POINT OF ALL THAT?!

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.580
Instead, she goes on stage to pretty much
just say the exact same thing,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.760
except shorter and dressed like Data from First Contact.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.180
Jem: "Jem is anybody who has 
something that they want to express..."

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.260
"...and they need the courage
to let themselves be heard."

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:32.060
NC: Yes, share that message about being yourself...
in a film that clearly has NOTHING to do with Jem!

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.480
On top of that, Rio discovers his father's will...

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.280
Yeah...guess he died of that fatal
just-be-dead-tosis as Jem's dad...

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.580
...and it turns out he left him the company.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.480

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:56.480
So...what's the first thing he's gonna do,
now that the girls have agreed to make decisions together and always be equal?

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.180
Totally rename the band without consulting them!

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.880
Woman: "What would they like to call the band?"

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.720
Rio: "How about 'Jem and the Holograms'?"

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:07.480
NC: I figure it matches their flaky, see-through,
almost invisble personalities...

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:13.780
But after the movie's credits, Erica plots her revenge and goes to a band call The Misfits...

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.660
You wish.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.700
No, this is the rival band that always hated Jem.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.220
One of the few things they spontaneously out of nowhere wanted to make very similar to the cartoon.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.780

I'm sure you'll have PLENTY of time to talk about things.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.380
But even then, there's one more thing to talk about.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.760
I wanted to save it until the end,
because it's a pretty big deal.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.340
You're probably wondering, "Outside of giving us an insultingly weak story and characters,

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.800
explaining how not to be a corporate sellout while being one of the biggest corporate sellouts of all time,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.360
and having virtually NOTHING to do
with the show whatsoever,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.000
how can they possibly insult the fans even further?"

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:13.480
Well, you see...the makers of this movie actually offered the fans a chance to be in the movie.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.780
All they have to do is film themselves saying how much they love Jem the cartoon.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.620
John Chu: "Tell us what you love about Jem!"

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.760
"You can even post pictures of you dressed up with her."

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.180
"Whatever it is, we want to see and hear
your passion to the original Jem."

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.900
NC: A good idea...get the buzz going,
maybe play it in the end credits or something...

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.360
But that's not what they do.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.100
They take the footage of the fans saying
how much they love the cartoon,

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.940
and they edit it to look like they're talking about
the Jem from the movie.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:46.280
A movie nobody had seen by that point, 
and has little to do with the show they love.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.820
But now, it looks like they're praising the hell out of it.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.160

Jem Fan #3: "Jem inspired me!"

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.520
Jem Fan #4: "I just want to say 'thank you' for that."

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.840
NC: Wow! THAT is LOW!

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.680
"Oh, you like the cartoon?
You think she's truly outrageous?"

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.760
"Well, this is what you were talking about
the whole time!"

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.420
"Yeah! Yeah! This is Jem! You said it!"

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.420
Jem Fan #4: "...basically taught me that it's okay to be who you are, and not to be afraid..."

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.760

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.640

Well, that's not the cartoon..."

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.120
"It's THIS Jem! THIS is the Jem you felt a strong emotional bond for!"

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.180
This is like asking people to make videos
saying why they love Star Wars

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.320
and then suddenly editing it to make it look like
you're talking about The Phantom Menace!

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.600
It's not just cruel, it's a slap in the friggin' face!

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.220
What makes it even funnier is how LAZY it is!

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.040
Not only do they have the text of the cartoon
all over their stuff,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.400
not only are they dressed up
like the cartoon characters and not the movie...

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.340
...but YOU CAN SEE THE CARTOON
PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND!

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.520
Yeah! They just left that in!

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.340

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.760
even I can say...this movie's an insult!

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.980
It goes out of its way to piss you off
in every conceivable fashion.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.540
It doesn't work as a standalone film,
it doesn't work as an adaptation,

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.300
the choices make NO sense,

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.720
and it does everything in its power to make sure
the fans will HATE it.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.540
Look, I'm not gonna act like I enjoyed the stupid cartoon.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.560
We all had our shows that only existed to sell toys.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.500
I had mine, you had yours, and that's fine.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.400
But there's a definite audience that grew up with this.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.400
And while I know there has to be changes
when adapting the show to film,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.560
there's absolutely NO respect and NO love
for ANY of the people that grew up with it.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.720
Say what you want about Transformers,
but it HAD Transformers!

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.420
This has NO Jem...

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.460
...and they're strangely PROUD of that!

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.240
While I admit it is kind of funny
just what a reckless sellout it is,

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.500
it does cross a sort of line
when it's taking fans of the show

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.080
and manipulating their footage to represent something that they know they're gonna hate.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.400
It not only feels forced and stupid,
it just feels...wrong.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.960
And I can see now why you're trying to make MY movie look like Jem the cartoon!

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.060
To win back all the fans that you lost!

Hey! Doug Walker, doing the charity shout-out.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.700
This week, we are doing Direct Relief.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:52.920
This is a medical aid organization active in all 50 states, and in 70 countries,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:59.140
with a mission to improve the health and lives
of people affected by poverty or emergency situations.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:06.720
This is the first non-profit organization in the U.S. to be designated by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.200
as a verified, accredited wholesale distributor.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.720
It's among the largest medical suppliers to West Africa
in response to the ebola epidemic,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.080
the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan,
and Haiti after the 2010 quake.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.600
It's also earned a 100% fundraising efficiency rating from Forbes,

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:32.780
topping Charity Navigator's 2015 list of
"The Top 10 Best Charities Everyone's Heard Of".

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.380
And it's named by the Fast Company among
"The World's Most Innovative Companies for Non-Profit".

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.080
These are people that do wonderful work
and share amazing stories

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.780
if you go to either their site
or their YouTube page.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:50.200
Definitely check 'em out, show your support,
and help save the lives of so many people in trouble.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.900
The tiniest little bit can go a long way.
