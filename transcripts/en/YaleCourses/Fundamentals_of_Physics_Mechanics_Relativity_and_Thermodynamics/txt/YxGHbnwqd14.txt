Speaker 1:          00:00:00       So I have to leave you in the middle of something. Yeah, pretty exciting. So I'll come back and take it from there. So what does it do you have to remember from last time, you know what are the main ideas I covered? One is we took the notion of temperature for which you have an intuitive feeling and turn it into something more quantitative. So you can not only say this is harder than that, that's harder than this. You can say by how much by how many degrees. And in the end we agreed to use the absolute Kelvin scale for temperature. And the way to find the Kelvin scale, you take the gas, any gas that you like, like hydrogen or helium or low concentration and put that inside a piston and cylinder, but it occupies and volume and there's a certain pressure by putting weights on top and you take the product of p Times v and the claim is for whatever gas you take, it will be a straight line.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       Remember now this is in Kelvin. You're sending grid scale is somewhere over here. But I've shifted the origin, the Kelvin scale. So somebody here will be the boiling point of water somewhere when the freezing point of water, that may be the boiling point of water and if you took a different amount of a different gas, you will get some other life, but they will always be straight lines if the concentration is sufficiently low. In other words, it appears that pressure times volume is some constant, I don't know what the colleges c times this temperature and you can use that to measure temperature because if you not two points on a straight line, then you know that you can find the slope and then you can calibrate it the monitor than for any other value of p Times v that you get. You can come down and read your temperature. That's the preferred scale and we prefer the scale because it doesn't seem to depend on the gas that you use. I can use one that you can use another one, people in another planet who'd never heard of water. They can use the different guests, but all gases seemed to have the property, the pressure times the volume is linearly proportional with this new temperature scale measured with this new audit in an absolute zero that is really nothing to the left of this t equals zero.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Next thing I mentioned was people used to think of the theory of heat as a new theory. You know you got mechanics and all that stuff, levers and pulleys and all that. Then you had this mysterious thing called heat, which had been around for many years, but people started quantifying it by saying that it's a fluid called the calorific fluid and hot things have a lot of it and called things have less of it and when you mix them the calories, some whole flows from the heart to the cold. Then we defined specific heat law of conservation of this catalytic fluid that allows you to do some problems in calorimetry. You make so much of this with so much of that. Where will they end up? That kind of problem. So that promoted heat to a new, an independent entity, different from all of the things we have studied, but something such as that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       It is not completely alien or new concert because that seems to be a conservation law for this heat because the heat lost by the quarter Walker was the heat gained by the hot water. Sorry, he'd gained by the cold water. It was the heat loss by the hot water, so you have a conservation law. Secondly, we know another way to produce heat. Instead of saying put it on the stove, put it on the store, in which case that is something mysterious flowing from the stove into the water that he'd sit up. I totally, this is a different way. I think you can do take two automobiles, slammed him and go, this is not the most economical way to make your dinner, but I'm just telling you as a matter of principle by two ferries, slammed them into each other, take this park and put it on top and it'll heat up, but arteries will heat up.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       The question is, what happened to the Kennedy Energy of the two cars that is really gone. So in the old days we would say, well, we don't have play the law of conservation of energy because this is an inelastic collisions that was an illegal way out of the whole issue. But you realize now this calorie fluid can be produced from nowhere because there was no calorie fluid before, but slamming the two cars produces this extra heat. So that indicates that perhaps there's a relation between mechanical energy and heat energy that when mechanical energy disappears, heat energy up peers. So how do you do the conversion ratio? You know, how many calories can you get if you sacrifice one jeweler mechanical energy. So jewel did the experiment, not with cars. I mean he didn't have cars at that time. So if he did, you would have probably done it with cars.

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       He had this guy did with him, which was a little, uh, shaft with some padlets and a pulley on the top. And you let the weight go down. And I told you guys, the way it goes from here to here, the MGH laws will not be the gain in one half MV squared. Something will be missing. Keep track of the missing amount. So many jewels, but meanwhile you find this water has become hot, you find than how many calories should have gone in because we know the specific date of water, we know the rise in temperature, we know how many calories were produced and then you compare the two and you find that 4.2 jewels is equal to one calorie.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       So that is the conversion ratio of calories to Jews. One jewel, 4.2 joules of mechanical energy. So in the example of the in cars, take the one half MV squared for each car, turn it into jewels, slammed them together. If they come to arrest, you've lost all of that and then you take that and you write it as divided before 0.2 and that's how much calories you helped produced. You have to card was made of just one material it at a specific heat, then it would go up by seven temporary. You can actually predict. Okay, so today I wanted to go a little deeper into the question of where does the energy actually stored in the car? I mean, what is heat? We still don't know in detail what he does. We just said car heats up and the loss of jewels do better before point to is the gain in counties.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       Now we can answer in detail exactly what is heat. That's what we're going to talk about today. Whenever you say something is hotter, what did we mean at a microscopic level? In the old days when people didn't know what anything was made off, they didn't have this understanding. And the understanding that I'm going to give you today is based on the simple fact that everything is made up of atoms that was not known, and that's one of the greatest discoveries. In the end, everything is made of atoms. Then atoms combined to form molecules and so on. So how does that come into play for that, I want you to take the simple example, but the temperature enters that isn't the donation PV equals to some constant times temperature. Do you know what I'm talking about? Take some gas, make sure it's sufficiently tight. You would put it into this person. Measure the weights on top of it divided by the ATO to get the pressure. That's the pressure. That's the volume. The volume is the region here. Multiply the product. Then if you heat up the gas by putting it on some hot plate, you will find the product PB increases and as the temperature increases, PBS proportional duty. They want to ask what this, this proportionality constant.

Speaker 1:          00:08:02       Suppose you were doing this in the old days. That's what people did. What did we think should be on the right hand side? What is going to control this particular constant for your given experiment? You know what it might be proportional to yes, yes, I'm out of gas. That's true because I'm out of gas at zero. We think there is no pressure. When you say amount of gas as a very safe sentence, uh, because I'm on measured in by what means? By what metric? Right. Suppose you were not aware of particles then. What would you mean by amount of gas?

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       the mass. Know if you guys ever said malls, I was going to shoot you down. You're not supposed to know those things we have finally did use to put yourself back in whatever's stone ages. We wouldn't, we don't anything else. Mass would be reasonable argument. Right? What's the argument? We know that if you had some amount of gas producing the pressure and you put twice as much stuff, you think it will produce twice as much pressure. Same reason why you think the expansion of a rod is proportionally change in temperature times the starting length. So at this mass is what doing it. So it's proportional. The mass is a video. Reasonable guess. So if we put more gas into your best and you think it'll produce more pressure, that's actually correct. So let's go to that one particular sample in your laboratory that you did. So put the mass that you had there. The new should put a constant still, I don't know what you want me to call this constant c prime. This constant contain everything, but I pulled out the mass and the remaining constant I want to call [inaudible]. This is actually correct. You can take a certain gas in, it could find out what's the premise,

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       but here is what people found if you do it that way. The constant sleep prime depends on the gas you are considering. If you consider hydrogen gas, that's called that c prime for hydrogen. Somebody else puts in helium gas and you find the seat prime for helium is one fourth c prime for hydrogen. If you do carbon, it's another number c prime for carbon. You see prime for hydro then divided by 12 so eat gas has a different constant. So we conclude that yes it's the mass that decides that, but the mass has to be divided by different numbers for different gases to find the real effect that has in terms of pressure. In other words, one gram of hydrogen and one gram of helium do not have the same pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       In fact, one game of helium has to be divided by four to have the two finder's effect on pressure. So you have to think about why is it that the mass statically is not involved. Masters to be divided by a number. The, it's a nice round number four for this and fall for that. And of course people figured out there's a long story I cannot go into, but I think you all know the answer, but now, now you're allowed to fast forward to the correct answer because I really don't have the time to see how they worked it out. But from these integers and the way gasses reacted informed complicated molecules, they figure it out. What's really going on is that you're dividing by a number that's proportional to the mass of the underlying fundamental entity, which would be an Adam in some cases molecule, but I'm just going to call everything is Adam. So if things like carbon as Adam's weighed 12 times as much as things called hydrogen, then if you took some amount of carbon, you divided by the number like 12 to count the number of carbon atoms in case. Why didn't you want to count the number of hydrogen atoms so that what really you want here, it's not the mass, but the number of atoms of a given kind.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       We are certainly free to write either a mass or the number of items because the two are proportional. But the beauty of writing it this way, you write it in this fashion, but this is the new constant. K K is independent of the guests. You want to write it in the manner in which it doesn't depend on the gas, right it in terms of mass if you did, but each mass you've got to divide by a certain number. Then once you divided by the number, you can put a single concert in front, or if you want a universal constant, what you should really be counting the number of atoms or molecules. So you couldn't have written it that way until he knew about atoms and molecules and people who were let to atoms and molecules by it and looking at the way gases interact. And it's a beautiful piece of chemistry to figure it out. Really that that are entities which come in discrete units, not at all obvious. Now all days that mass comes in discrete units called Adam's, but that's what they, they used. So this is called the Boltzmann constant. The Boltzmann constant has a value of 1.4 times 10 to the minus 23 let's see jewels, Kelvin,

Speaker 3:          00:13:46       that's it. Or

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       you'll just Kelman or degrees centigrade.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       So this is the universal constant. So now what people like to do is they don't like to write the number because if you write the number in a typical situation, what's the number going to be on it? Take some random group gas, one gram, two grams, one kilogram, it doesn't matter the number you will put in there. There's some number like 10 to the 23 attended the 25 that's a huge number. So whenever a huge numbers involved, what you try to do is to measure the huge number as a simple multiple off. Another huge number, which will be our unit for measuring large numbers. For example, when you want to buy eggs, you measure in dozens and he wanted to buy paper, even want to measure written thousands, five hundreds or whatever the units they sell them. And it's a natural unit. When you want to find intergalactic distance, as you may use a light year, you use units. So that in that unit, the quantity of interest was, is some number that you can count in your heads. When you count people's height, you'll use feet because if something between one and eight let's say you don't want to use angstroms and you don't want to use millimeters. Likewise, when he wanted to simply count numbers, it turns out that's a very natural number called Avogadro's number.

Speaker 2:          00:15:18       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       Avogadro's number is six times 10 to the 23 it has no unit. It's simply a number and that's called a mall. Say more or less like a dozen. Want it to buy six times 10 to the 23 eggs. You will say, get me one mole of eggs, but more or less than just a number. It's a huge number. You can ask yourself, what's so great about this number? Why would someone think of this particular number? Why not some other number? Why not 10 to the 24 do you know what's special about this number?

Speaker 2:          00:15:59       Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       yes. If you like a mall is such that one mole of hydrogen weighs one gram and hydrogen is the simplest element. If the nucleus is just a proton and the electron mass it negligible. So this if you like, is the reciprocal of the mass of hydrogen. Other words, one over Avogadro's number,

Speaker 2:          00:16:29       just the mass of hydrogen in grams of a hydrogen atom in grams. So you basically say,

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       I want to call it this large number. So let me take one gram, which is my normal unit. You're thinking in grams. Then I ask how many hydrogen atoms? There's one gram of hydrogen contain. That's the number. That's the mall. So if you decide to measure the number of atoms you have in a given problem in terms of this number, you write it as some other small number called malls,

Speaker 2:          00:17:03       titans,

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       the number in a mall, and you are free to write it this way. If you write it this way, the new write, this n r t o is the universal gas constant times the Boltzmann constant and zero times the Boltzmann constant. That happens to be 8.3 joules per degree centigrade or per Kelvin,

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       right? The units were odd will be Pv, which is you understand energy divided by t in terms of calories. I remember this nice known number two calories per degree centigrade degrees centigrade and Calvin are the same. The origins are shifted, but when you go up at one degree in San Diego or Kelvin, you go with the same or more than temperature. So this is what they found out first because they didn't know anything about atoms and so on. But later on when you go look under the hood of what the gas is made of, if you write it in terms of the number of, if you write it in terms of the number of actual atoms, you should use the Lidl k or you can write it in terms of number of malls, in which case use

Speaker 3:          00:18:22       big r

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       and the relation between the two is simply this. If you're thinking of a gas and how many moles of gas do I have? Exactly. One gram of hydrogen would be one more. Then you will use our, if you've gone right down to fundamentals and say how many items do I have a new put that here you would multiply it by this very tiny number.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       No. You start with this law and you asked the following question. On the left hand side is the quantity p Times v or the right hand side? I have an rt but let me write it now as an Katie, you guys should be able to go back and forth between writing in terms of number of moles or the number of atoms. You like this because all numbers here will be small of order. One artist a number like what? Eight in some units and it will be one or two malls here. This and it will be huge number like 10 to the 23 k will be a tiny number, like 10 to the minus 23 I think in terms of atoms, that's what you do. Big Numbers, small constants of think of malls, small numbers, I mean moderate numbers and moderate value of constantly. We want to ask ourselves, is that a microscopic basis for this equation? In other words, do we, once you believe in atoms, do we understand why that is a pressure at all in a gas? That's what we are going to think about now. So for this purpose we will take a cube of gas.

Speaker 3:          00:20:04       It is,

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       this is a cube of site l by El by l,

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       Inside this as guests and has got some pressure and I want to know what's the value of the pressure you got? Ask yourself why is that pressure? Remember I told you what pressure means. If you take this face of the cube for example, it's got to be nailed down, but the other phases, otherwise it does come flying out because the gas is pushing you out. The pressure is the force on this face divided by area. So somebody inside is trying to get out. Those guys are the molecules or the atoms and what they're doing is constantly bouncing off the wall and every time this one bounces on a wall, it's momentum changes from that to the other one. So who's changing the momentum of the wall? Changing the momentum is reversing that. For example, if you bones head on and go back, your momentum is reversed.

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       That means you push the wall with some force in the wall, pushes you back with the opposite force is the force that you exerted on the wall that I'm interested in. I wanted to find the force on the wall. Say this particular phase, you can find the pressure on any phase. It's going to be the same answer. I'm going to take the shaded faced. Find the pressure on it. No. If you want to ask, what is the force exerted by me on anybody? I know the forest is rate of change of momentum

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       because that is d by Dt of Mv and Msa constant and that just DVD t we just at me, I'm just using the old f equals m a but I'm writing it is rate of change the momentum. No, I have an molecules are an Adams randomly moving inside the box. Each center's own direction. Suffering collisions with the box bouncing off, uh, like a billiard ball would at the end of the pool table going to another wall and doing it. That's a very complicated problem. So we're going to simplify the problem. The simplification is going to be, we're going to assume that one third of the molecules are moving from left to right. One third are moving up and down and one third are moving in and out of the blackboard. If Batali make an assumption that the molecules have simply moving into three primary directions, of course you will have to give equal number. It needs directions, nothing in the gas that favors how does onto the vertical. In reality, of course, you must admit the fact they move in all directions, but the simplified derivation happens to give all the right physics. I'm going to use that. So an over three molecules are going back and forth between this wall and this wall. I'm showing you the side view. The wall itself, it looks like this.

Speaker 1:          00:22:54       The molecule just got back and forth. Next assumption, all the molecules at the same speed I'm going to call me. That also is a gross and crude description of the problem, but I'm going to do that anyway and see what happens. So now you ask yourself the following question. Take one particular molecule. When it hits the wall and it bounces back, it's momentum changes from MV the minus MD. Therefore the change in momentum is to MV.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       How often does that change take place? You guys should think about that first. How often will collision take place? Once you hit the wall here, you got to go the other wall and come back. So you've got to go a distance to l and you're going at a speed v. The time it takes you to l over be the belt that be over. Delta t is two l divided by V that gives me and B squared over l. That is the force due to one molecule. That's the average force. Realize it's not a continuous forest. Monica hit the wall. That's a little four 16th between the two. Then there's nothing. Then you wait till it comes back and hits a wall again. If that were the real, if that were the only thing going on, what you would find is the wall once the time has no pressure and suddenly it has a lot of pressure and then suddenly nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       But fortunately, this is not the only molecule that are roughly 10 the 23 guys pounding themselves against the wall. So at any given instant, even if returned the minus five seconds, that'd be a large number of molecules colliding. That's the way the forest will appear to be steady rather than a shotgun noise. It looked very steady cause somebody at other, we'll be pushing against the wall. So if you ask, know how many molecules, this is the force due to one molecule before, it's due to all of them will be an over three times and B squared over there and over three because of the end molecules, a third of them were moving in this direction. You realize the other two directions are parallel to the wall. They don't apply force on the wall to apply a force in the wall. You gotta be moving perpendicular to the wall.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       But example, if the plates that walls are coming out of the blackboard moving in and out of the blackboard doesn't produce a force in this wall that produces the force and the other two phases. So as far as any one set of faces is concerned in one plane, only the motion orthogonal talking to that is going to contribute. That's why you have an over three little bit almost done. That's the average force. If you want, I can denote average by some f bar. Then what about the average pressure? The average pressure is the average force divided by the area of that phase f over l square. That gives me an over three M v squared over l cubed. Oh, this is very nice because LQB just the volume of my box. So I take the Lq, which is ego, the volume of my box, and I send it to the other side, right it as PV equals and over three M v squared. This is what the microscopic theory tells

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       you. Microscopic data says if your molecules have all have a single speed that moving randomly in space so that a third of them are moving back and forth against that wall and this wall. Then this is the product PB. Experimentally you find Pv is equal to n k t so you've compared the two expressions and outcomes. One of the most beautiful results which is that NV squared over two is three over to Katie. Oh that guy deserves a box cause look what it's telling you. It's a really profound formula. It tells you for the first time real microscopic meaning of temperature. What you and I call the temperature of a gas is simply up to these factors. Three over two k simply the candidate energy of the molecules. That's what temperature is. If you've got a gas and you put your hand into the furnace and it hot, the temperature you're measuring is directly the kinetic energy of the molecules.

Speaker 1:          00:27:55       That is a great insight into what temperature means. Remember, this is not true. If t is measured in centigrade, if t but measured in Centigrade I freezing point of water, MV squared would vanish, but that's not what's in play. You should be measured from absolute zero. It also tells you why absolute zero is absolute. As you call your gas, the kinetic energy of molecules are decreasing and decreasing and decreasing, but you cannot go below not moving at all. Right? That's the lowest possible. Kennedy, Kennedy. That's why it's absolute zero. At that point, everybody stops moving. That's why you have no pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       No. These results that are modified by the laws of quantum mechanics, but we don't have to worry about that now in the classical physics is actually correct to say that when the temperature goes to zero, all motion Caesar's, Oh, this is the picture that I want you to bear in mind when you say temperature. Absolutely. Temperature is a measure of molecular agitation more precisely up to the constant k three over two k. The kinetic energy of a molecule is the absolute temperature. That's part I gas. If it took a solid and you say, what happens when I heat the solid Bellis got a question. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:29:12       Just out of curiosity, why did they said divide both sides by two? Just it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       You would divide by two because one half MV squared is a family at a quantity, namely Kennedy. Granted that's what you divide by two not the thing to notice is that every gas, whatever is made off at a given temperature as a given Kennedy energy, because the Kennedy energy per molecule on the left hand side is dependent absolute temperature and nothing else. So at certain degrees, like 300 Kelvin hydrogen Kennedy going to do to be the same carbon Kennedy energy, but also be the same. The Kennedy Kennedy will be the same, not the velocity. The carbon atom is heavier. It'll be moving slow, but at that temperature in order to have the same candidate again, so all molecules, all gases at a given temperature, all I'll atoms, let me say, I'd give given temperature engages farm will have the same Kennedy got it. No. If you have a solid, what's the different between the gas into a solid and a gas? The Adams said moving anywhere they want in the box in a solid, every atom has a place. If you take a two dimensional solid, the atoms look like this,

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       they form a lattice or an array. That's because you will find out that this is more advanced stuff that every atom plants itself in a potential that looks like this. You imagine on the ground you make these hollows low points. The low potential, high point high potential. Obviously if you put a bunch of objects here, they will sit at the bottom of these little concave holds. You've dug in the ground at zero degrees, absolute all items that sit at the bottom of that allotted positions. That'd be a solid at zero temperature, so in a solid, everybody has a location. I've shown you one dimensional solid, but you can imagine a three dimensional solid where in a lattice of three dimensional points there's an assigned place for [inaudible] and it sits there. If you heat up that solid. Now what happens is these guys start vibrating. Now here is where your knowledge of simple harmonic motion to come into play.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       When you take a system in equilibrium, it'll execute simple harmonic motion. If you give it a real kick, if you put it on top of a hot plate, the atoms in the hot plate, we'll bump into these guys and start the movie. They will start vibrating. So a hot solid is one in which the atoms that making more and more violent isolations around their assigned positions, the hit the more and more and more. Eventually you start doing this, you go all the way from here to here. That is nothing to prevent you from rolling over to the next site. Once you jumped the fence and take up a bunch of houses, okay, all hole in the ground, you're living in a hole in the ground. You as you get agitated, you're able to do more and more oscillation silicon rollover to the next house. Once that happens, all hell breaks loose because you don't have any reason to stay where you are. You start going everywhere. What do you think that is?

Speaker 1:          00:32:31       Pardon me? That's melting. That's the definition of melting. Nothing is when you can leap over this potential barrier, potential energy barrier, go to the next site. The next side is just like this site. If you can jump that fence, you can jump this one. You go everywhere and you melt. That's the process of melting. And once you have a liquid, atoms don't have a different location. Now between the liquid and a solid, uh, this is, this is clear, different but in liquid and the vapor is more subtle. So I don't want to go into that. But at some point, uh, liquids, if you look at a liquid locally, it will look very much like a solid, the sense that interrupt tomic spacing just very tightly constrained in liquid, a solid. If I know I'm here, I know if I go 100 times the basic lattice spacing, there'll be another person sitting there that's called a long range order in the liquid. I cannot say that liquid. I can say my, I'm here locally. The environment around me is known. But if you go a few hundred miles, I cannot tell you are precise location. If some mother Adam will be there or not. So we sell liquid, a short rain position, a lottery, but not long grain daughter and a gas has no auditor at all. If I tell you there's a gas molecule here, I cannot tell you about anybody else's. We, nobody has any assigned location.

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       Okay, so this is the big city should have off temperature temperatures, agitated motion, either motion in the vicinity of where you're told to sit. You feel it in a solid motion all over the box with more than more candidate candidate. The next thing in this category teacher is that certainly not true. That third of the molecules are moving back and forth. We know that's a joke, right? Right now I'm in this room. There's no reason on earth. Third of the molecules are doing this and others are doing. That's an approximation had moving in random directions. So if we really got the stomach for it, you should do a pressure calculation in which you assume the molecules of random velocities sprinkled in all directions and after all the hard work turn said, you will get exactly this answer. So that's one thing I didn't want her to.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       What's something I should point out to you is the following. So supplies, they give you a gas at 300 Kelvin. You go and you take this formula literally and you calculate from it a certain one half MV squared. If you knew the mass of the items says hybrid and we know the mass of hydrogen, then you find the velocity and you say, okay, this man tells me that anytime a cat, a hydrogen atom, it'll have this velocity at 300 Kelvin if I have a random direction. But he tells me that the velocity squared, take the square root of that. That's the velocity it seems to us in a unique velocity to each temperature. Well, that's not correct. Not only are the molecules moving in random directions, they're also moving with essentially all possible velocities. In fact that a many, many possible velocities and this velocity I'm getting in this formula is some kind of average velocity or the most popular one are the most common one. So if you'd really go to a gas and you had the ability to look into it and see what each velocity, what's the probability that I get that velocity? The pics that I have given you is the probability is zero except that this one magical velocity controlled by the temperature, but the real graph looks like this.

Speaker 1:          00:35:48       It has a certain peak. I likes to have a certain value. So if you had even know enough about statistics, you know there's a most probable value, there's medium, there's a mean value that our different definitions, they will all vary by factors of water one but the average Kenetech energy will obey this condition. Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:36:06       got it. Great. In their gaps,

Speaker 1:          00:36:08       I, it's not really a Gaussian because if I draw the nature of this curve, it looks like B square you to the minus M v squared over two k. T that's the graph I'm trying to dry here. So it look like a ghost into the vicinity of this, but it's kind of skewed. It's forced to vantage of the audition and it's not peaked at the equal to zero real a Gaussian peaks. At this point would be some metric is not symmetric advantage to see it. An advantage does infinity. This is called the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution. You don't have to remember it. Any names that just the detailed property of what's happening in a gas, so a temperature does not pick a unique velocity, but it picks this graph. If you vary your temperature, look at what you have to do. If you change the number t here, if you doubled the value of t, that means you, if you double the value of bees where here and there, the graph will look the same for every temperature there is a certain shape.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       Do go to your temperature. It'll look more or less the same, but it may be peaked at a different velocity if you go to higher temperature, no, this is another thing I want to tell you. If you took a box containing, not atoms but just radiation, other words go inside a pizza oven, take out all the air, but the oven is still hot and the walks or the almond not radiating electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation comes in different frequencies and you can ask how much energy is contained in every possible frequency range. You know, each frequency is a color, so you know that. So how much energy is in the red, how much is in the blue. That graph also looks like this. That's a more complicated law called the plaque distribution. That law also has a shape, completely determined by temperature

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       is what happens. The ship is determined by temporary that as well as the mass of the molecules. In the case of radiation, it determined fully by temperature and the velocity of light. You give me a temperature and I will draw you another one of these roughly bell shaped curves. As you heat up the furnace, the shape will change. So again, our temperature for radiation means a particular of energies at each frequency for a gas. That means our distribution of velocities. No, that is, has anybody seen that in the news lately or have heard about this?

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       Pardon me?

Speaker 1:          00:38:55       I bought this particular graph. What radiation? The probability at each frequency of finding radiation of that frequency in a furnace of some temperature. T

Speaker 2:          00:39:06       yes,

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       no, but in current news in the last few years, what people did was the following is one of the predictions of the Big Bang theory that the universe was formed some 14 and a half billion years ago and at the early stages the temperature of the University of some incredibly high degrees than acid expanded the universe schooled and today at the current size it has got a certain average temperature which is a remnant of the big bang and that temperature means that is we are sitting in a furnace up the big bang, but the furnace, the school, the lock over the billions of years, the temperature of the universe is, I don't three degrees Kelvin and the way you determine that is you point your telescope in the sky, of course you're going to get light from this star, you're going to get late from that. Start ignoring all the pointy things and look at the smooth background and age should be the same in all directions and plot that radiation and noticed they use satellites to plot that and you get a perfect fit for this kind of furnace.

Speaker 1:          00:40:20       Radiation are called blackbody radiation and you read the temperature by taking that graph and fitting into a graph like this, but there'll be a temperature in the case of light. This won't be velocity squared but there'll be the frequency square, but read off the temperature that'll make this work and that's what gives you 3.1 or something. You get three degrees Kelvin. In fact, the data point for that, if you've got that in your lab and you will be definitely busted for forging your data because it's a perfect fit. The blackbody radiation, one of the most perfect fits to the black body radiation is the background radiation for the Big Bang and there's isotropic meaning. It's the same in all directions and this is one of the predictions of the big bang is that there'll be the remnant of the black body radiation. Again, it tells you that's a sense in which the, if you go to intergalactic space, that is your temperature, that's the temperature to get for free. They're all living in that heat. Pat At three degrees. You want more heat, you got to light up your furnace, but this is everywhere in the universe that heat left over from creation.

Speaker 2:          00:41:25       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       that's a very, very interesting subject. No Lot of new physics is coming out by looking at just that black body radiation because the radiation that's coming to your, I left those stars long ago, so what do you see today is not what's happening today is what happened long ago when the radiation left that part of the universe. Therefore we can actually tell something about the universe, not only now but earlier periods and that's the way in which we can act. Will you tell whether the universe is saying yes expanding or not expanding or is it accelerating in its expansion? Or you can even say once it was decelerating and nobody's accelerating, all that information comes by being able to look at the radiation from the big bang. What for you guys? I think the most interesting thing is that when you od in thermal equilibrium and you are living in a certain temperature, then the radiation in your world and the molecules and atoms in your work, we'll have a distribution of frequencies and velocities given by that universal graph. Now in our class, we will simplify life and replace this graph with the huge peak at a certain velocity by pretending everybody's at that velocity, we will treat the whole gas as separate representative by single average number. So when someone says find the velocity of molecules, they parking board the average velocity, you know statistically that is the distribution of answers and an avid dance. Here's the average is what you wouldn't you and I have to know, namely one half MV squared is three half skatey on average.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       Okay? No, I'm going to study in detail. They're more than Amex. So the system, I'm going to study Islam only one. We all study, which is an ideal gas sitting inside at Vista,

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       It's got a temperature is about a pressure and it's got a volume and I'm going to plot here pressure and volume and I'm going to put it dot and that's my gas. The state of my gas is summarized by where you put the dot everybody. Dot. Here is a possible state of equilibrium for the guests. Remember the gas, if you look at the under the hood, it's made up of 10 to the 23 molecules. The Real, real state of the gas is obtained by saying giving me 10 to the 23 locations and tender the tender that the velocities accordingly. Newton, that's the maximum information you can give me a board. The gas right now because with that and Newton's laws, I can predict the future, but when you study thermodynamics, you don't really want to look into the details. You want to look at gross macroscopic properties and there are two that you need pressure and volume.

Speaker 1:          00:44:20       You might say, what about temperature? Why don't they have a third axis for temperature? Why is that also not a property? Yes, for sure. Yeah, because PV equal to and Katie, I don't have to give you tea if I know pnb rather an independent thing you can pick, you can pick P and B independently. You cannot pick tea. Let me tell you, by the way, Pv was NKT is not a universal law. It's a law that you applied to dilute gasses, but we are going to just study only dilute ideal gas. Ideal gas is one in which the atoms and molecules are so far apart that they don't feel any forces between each other unless they collide.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       So here's my gas sitting here. Now what I do, I had a few weights on top of it three ways. I suddenly pull out one weight, throw it out. What do you think will happen? But I think this gas will now shoot up. It'll Bob up and down a few times. Then after a few seconds or a fraction of a second, it'll settle down, but the new location but settled down. I mean after a while I will not see any macroscopic motion. Then the gas has a new pressure and a new volume. It's gone from being there to being there.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       What about in between? What happened in between starting and finishing points? You might say, look, if it went, if it was here in the beginning it was there later. It must have followed some path. Not really. Not In this process because if you do it very abruptly but suddenly throwing out one third of the weights, that's the period when the piston rushes up. When the gas is not in equilibrium. By that I mean there is no single pressure you can associate with the gas. The bottom, the gas doesn't even know the top is flying off is that the old pressure in the top of the gas is at low pressure. So different parts of the gas at different pressure. We don't call that equilibrium. So the dot representing the system moves up the graph, it's off, it's off the radar and only when it is finally settled down, the entire gas can make up its mind on what it pressured wants to be.

Speaker 1:          00:46:46       We put it back here so we have a little problem that we have this equilibrium states, but when you try to go from one to another, you fly off the map, so you want to find a device by which you can stay on the PB diagram as you change the state of the gas. That brings us to the notion of what's called a quasi static process. It's a quasi static process is trying to have it both ways in which you want to change the state of the gas and you don't want it to leave the PB diagram. You want it to be always at equilibrium. So what do you really want to do is not put in three big fat blocks like this, but instead take a guess where you have many, many grains of sand. They can produce the pressure though to move one grain of sand that most a tiny bit and very quickly settles down.

Speaker 1:          00:47:37       It is again true during the tiny bit of settling down. You didn't know what it was doing, but you certainly named it at the second location. Then we'll one brain at a time. Then you get a picture like this and you can see where this is going or you can make the grain smaller and smaller and smaller and not a mathematical sense. You can then form a continuous line. That is to say you perform a process that leaves the system arbitrarily close to equilibrium, meaning give it enough time to readjust to the new pressure settled down to the new volume that take another grain and another brain and in the spirit of calculus you can make these changes vanishing that you can really then say it did this. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       Pardon me? Yes, such a process. Processes also called a, you can call it quasi static, but one of the features of that, it is reversible. You got to be a little careful. When you say reversible, what we mean by reversible is if I took off a grain of sand and it came from here to the next doc and I put the grain back, it'll climb back to where it was. So you can go back and forth on this, but now that's an idealized process because if you had a friction, if you had any friction between the piston and the walls, then if you took out the grain and it went up, you've put the grain back, it may not come back to quite where it is because some of the frictional losses you will never get back. You cannot put Humpty dumpty back. So most of the time processes are not reversible.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       Even if you do them slowly, if there is friction. So it's assumed it's a completely frictionless system cause if that is friction, that is some heat that goes out somewhere and some energy is lost somewhere and we cannot bring it back if took a frictionless piston and on top of it it very, very slowly you can follow this graph. That's the kind of thermodynamic process we're talking about. In the old days when I studied a single particle in the x, y plane, I just said the guy who goes from here to here to there, that's very easy to study and there is no restriction on how quickly or how fast it moved particles. That is no matter how quickly they move for the thermodynamic system, you cannot move them too fast because they are extended and you're giving the huge gas a single number called pressure, so you cannot change one part of the gas with waiting for all of them to communicate and readjust and achieve a global value for the new pressure and you can move gradually that way it takes time to drag along tender the 23 particles as if they are the single number two numbers characterizing them.

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       So we'll be studying processes like this. Now this is called a state is the state and one is the state. every.here. That is a state. No. In every state of the system I'm going to define a new variable, which is called, maybe I'll start fresh quantity calls you. We'd stand for the internal energy off the gas. Internal energy is simply the Kennedy energy of the gas molecules, solids and liquids. There's more complicated formula for the gas. Internal energy is just the kinetic energy. And what is that? It is three halves, k t, four molecule times n, I'm sorry, three halves and Cape. Uh, and yeah, three halves Katie. Times that Audrey can write it as three halves and our teeth.

Speaker 3:          00:51:24       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:26       but NRT is Pv. Can alternate date is three house PVC. Internal Energy's the three halves. PV. That means at a given point in the PV diagram, you have a certain internal energy. If you're there, that's your internal energy. Take three halves a Pv, and that's the energy and that's literally the kinetic energy of all the molecules in your box. So now I'm ready to write down what's called the first law of thermodynamics.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       That talks about what happens if you make a move in the PV plant from one place to another place to go from one place to another place. Your internal energy will change from u one to u two. Let's call it delta. You,

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       you want ask what causes the internal energy of the gas to change. So you guys think about it now. Oh that you know all about what's happening in the cylinder. You can ask how will I change the energy? Well if you wanted to attend the energy of a system that are two ways you can do it. One is you can do work on the gas. Other thing is you can put the gas on a hot plate cause if you put it on a hot plate, we know it's going to get hotter. It gets harder, temperature goes up. If the temperature goes up, the internal energy goes up. There are two ways to channel the energy of a gas. The first one we call heat input.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       That just means put it on something harder and let the thing heated up. Temperature would go up. Notice that the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on the temperature. That's something very, very important. I mentioned that every time I teach the subject and some people forget and lose a lot of points needlessly. So I would say it once more with feeling energy of an ideal gas. Depends only on the temperature. The temperature is not changed. Energy has not changed. So probably to remember that for what I do later. So the change of the gas, this cylinder full of better, put some weights on top and I've got gas in sight. It can change either because I did, I put in some heat are the gas, did some work.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       By that I mean if the gas expands, like pushing out against the atmosphere, then eat this. Doing the work in Delta w is the work done by the gas? That's where it comes to the minus sign because it's the work done by the gas. If you do work, you lose energy. So what's the formula for work done? Let's calculate that. If you've got a piston, here is the force times the distance, but the force is the pressure times the area at times the distance. Now you guys should know enough geometry to nor the ADF, the Piston Times, the distance it moves is the change in the volume we can write. It is p times DV. That leads to this great law. Let me write it in a new blackboard because we are going to be playing around with that law. This is law number one. The change in the internal energy of a system is equal to Delta Q. Minus P. Delta V. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       What does it express? It expresses the law of conservation of energy. It says if the energy goes up either because you push the piston or the piston pushed you, then you decide what the overall sinus [inaudible] on a hot plate we are not equating putting it on a hot plate is also equivalent to giving good energy because we identify heat as simply entered. So if you took the piston and you nailed the piston so it cannot move and you put it on a hot plate PDV part we'll manage because there is no delta B. That's the way of heating it is called Delta Q. Another thing you can do is you can terminally isolate your piston so no heat can flow in and out of it and they can either have the volume increase or decrease if the gas expanded. Delta v is positive and the PDLT minus PW is negative and the Delta you will be negative. The gas bill lose energy. That's because the molecules are beating up on the piston and moving the piston. I remember applying a force doesn't cost you anything. What if the point of application moves you do work and who's going to pay for the gas? It will pay for it through it. Lots of internal energy. Conversely, if you push down on the Gas Delta v will be negative and this will become positive in the energy of the gas would go up.

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       So there are two ways to change the energy of these molecules. In the end, all you want is one of the molecules to move faster than before. One is to put them on a hot plate where that are fast moving. When they collated the slow moving molecules, typically the of and sort of more faster and the fast and sort of more slower and therefore they'll be transfer of Kennedy, Canada out of any push the piston down, you can show when a molecule collides with the moving piston, it will actually gain energy. So that's how you do work to, this is the first law.

Speaker 3:          00:56:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       So let us know, calculate the work done in a process. We had a gas goes from here to here on an isothermal.

Speaker 3:          00:57:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:01       ISOTHERM is a graph of given temperature, so this is a graph. Pete Times would be equal to constant because PB [inaudible] and our tea, if t is constant, PV is a constant. It's the rectangle of hyperbola. The product of the x and y coordinates is constant. So when the x coordinate advantage the way we'll go to infinity, white and advantages x, we'll go to it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:27       so you want to take your gas photo right from here to here throughout instead of certain temperature t what work is done by you? That's the video. Nice interpretation. The work done by you is the integral of PDD, but what does integral PDV that's p and that's DV. PDB is that shaded region. In other words, if it just right PDB, it makes absolutely no sense. If you go to a mathematician and say, please do the integral for me, can the mathematician do this? What's the, what's coming in the way of the math addition actually doing the integral? What do you have to not really do an integral, you have to know the function. If we just said p we'll say maybe piece constant with guess I'll pull it out of the integral but for this problem, because Pv is n r t and t you say constant PE is an r t divided by V and that's the function of the that you would need to do the integral and if you did that you will find is and our t all of them are constants that come over to the integral DV over v integrate from the initial volume.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       The final volume, you guys know this is a logarithm, the log of upper minus log of low but is the log of the ratio. This gives me an r t log be two over v one so we have done about first work calculation when the gas goes on an isothermal trajectory from start to finish, from volume to volume v to the work done. This is the work done by the gas. You can all see that gas is expanding and that's equal to the shaded region.

Speaker 2:          00:59:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       By the way, I mentioned it. No, I don't want to distract you, but suppose later on I make it go backwards like this. Part of the way the work done on the going backwards part is this area, but with a minus sign. I hope you'll understand if you go to the right, the Ada is considered positive. If you go to the left area is considered negative. If you do the integral and put the right limits, you'll get the right answer, but geometrically the area under the graph in the PB diagram is the work done. If you're moving the direction of increasing wallet, if you will decrease the volume. For example, if you just went back from here, area looks the same but the work done is considered negative. You don't have to think very hard. If you do the calculation going backwards, you'll get log of the one over v two they'll automatically be the negative of a log of p two over B one but geometrically the area under the graph is the work. If you're going to the right, yes.

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       Let's turn to the second stage.

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       Oh, this one. This will be a graph PV equal to essentially a constant. So you take your gas, you see how many malls that are, you know are, you know the temperature. You promise not to change the temperature so you, we'll move on a trajectory so that the product PB never changes. And in any x, y plane, if the product, if you draw a graph that the product x y doesn't change, you'll have this shape contract time that or hyperbola it just means whenever one increases, the other should decrease keeping the product constantly. That's why P is proportional, the recipe [inaudible] of the, and you do the intake integral. Very good. So this is now a, the work done by the gas. What is the heat input? The heat input is the change in internal energy minus the work that uh, let me see. The law was Delta U is equal to Delta Q minus Delta w yeah, let's go back to this law.

Speaker 2:          01:01:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       In this problem. Delta w is what I just calculated and our tea, whatever log be two over B one what is Delta Q? How much heat has been put into this gas? How do I find that?

Speaker 2:          01:01:51       Pardon me? Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       for the heat and put you mean? Yeah, you can use MC, Delta t but you don't have to do any more work. By that I mean you don't have to any more celebration. What can you do with this equation to avoid doing further calculations? Do you know anything else?

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       Yes. This is what I told you. It says fact that people not constantly remember, but you must, this gas did not change its temperature. Go back to the equation number. Whatever I wrote down, you equal three halves and rt or something. He doesn't change. Doesn't change. That mean the initial temporary initial internal energy. And finally, internally the are the same because initial templates and final temperature the same, but this guy has to be zero. That mean Delta Cube the same as Delta W in this particular case?

Speaker 2:          01:02:48       Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       Uh, when you say Mc Delta t you got to be careful what formula you want to use.

Speaker 2:          01:03:00       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       I'll tell you why you cannot use simply use MC, Delta t if you've got a solid and you use MC Delta t that is correct because when you hit the solid, the heat you put in goes into heating up the solid. In the case of a gas, you can maybe let's ask the following question. His question is the following. You're telling me you put heat into a gas right and you say temperature doesn't go up. How can that possibly be? I always thought when I put heat into something then printed it goes up. That's because you were thinking about a solid red. If you put in heat, it's got to go somewhere and of course the temperature goes up. What do you think is happening to the gas here? Think of the Piston and weight combination. When I want to go along this path from here to here.

Speaker 2:          01:03:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:52       You can ask yourself where does the heat input and where is the change in energy and why is that an oil change in temperature? If you take a piston like this, if you wanted to increase the volume, you can certainly take off a grain of sand, right? If you took the grain of sand and the piston will move up, it will do work in that actually it will cool down, but that's not what you're doing. You are keeping it on a hot plate at a certain temperature so that if it tries to cool down heat flows from below to about maintaining the temperature. So what the gas is doing in this case is taking heat energy from below and going there and working against the atmosphere about it, texting with one hand and gives out to the other without changing his energy.

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       So when you were starting to specify kid, which is my next topic, you've got to be a little more careful when you talk about your specific keeps up gasses. And I'll tell you why. There is no single thing called specifically for our guests that are many, many definitions, the depending on the circumstance. But I hope you understand in this case you got to visualize this. It's not enough to draw diagrams and rob pictures. What did I do to the cylinder to maintain the temperature and yet let it expand. Expansion is going to demand work on part of the gas. That's going to require a loss of energy unless you in energy from below. So what I've done is I take green after green so that the pressure drops in the volume increases, but the slight expansion would have cooled it slightly. But the reservoir from below brings it back to the temperature of the reservoir. So you prop it up in temperature. So we draw the picture by saying the gas went from here to here and we usually drop picture like this and say he'd float into the system during the process. All right, now we'll come to this question that was raised about specific heat. No specific Keith, you always say is Delta Q over Delta, t uh, over Delta t divided by the mass of the substance. Now we turned, so for a gas you want it is seen that what you want to count is not the actual mass with the malls.

Speaker 3:          01:06:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       Because we have seen at the level of the ideal gas law, the energy is controlled by not simply the mass pipe by the mall cause every molecule gets a certain number of energy, namely three half scape t I knew he just wanted to count the number of molecules or the number of malls. Now there are many, many ways in which you can pump in heat into a gas and heat it up and see how much heat it takes. Well let's agree that we will take one more from no one and not one kilogram knock one kilo graph. We'll try. We'll find out if you do it that way. The answer doesn't seem to depend on the gas. That's the first thing. Take them all off some gas and call the specific key. Does the energy needed to raise the temperature of one mall by one degree? So this should not be em. They shouldn't be the number of malls. So if it take one mole, you can say, okay one mole of gas I was told has energy you equals three halves are t because it was three halves and our tea. ButN is one more.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       No, you want to put in some heat and you really want the Delta Q over Delta t so I remind you the Delta Q is dealt to you. Let's be Delta beef.

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       The heat input into a gas is the candy, the energy plus p Delta v that just from the first law. So if I'm going to do by Delta Q by Delta t that's the problem here. Did you allow the volume to change or did you not follow the volume to change? That's going to decide what the specific heat is. In other words, you've been a solid is heated. It expands at a tiny amount. We don't worry about the work done by the expanding solid against the atmosphere. What for the gas when you heated, the volume changes so much that the worker does against the external world is non negligible. Therefore the specific is dependent on what you allow the volume term to do. So that is one definition of specific. He'd called CV. CV is the one at constant volume.

Speaker 1:          01:08:28       You don't let the volume change. In other words, you take the piston and you clamp it. Now you're pumping heat from below by putting it on a hot plate, all the heat goes directly to internal energy. None of that is lost in terms of expansion. The Delta v Zero in that case, Delta Q over Delta t add constant volume. We don't know that in this fashion, a constant volume. This term is gone and it just becomes belt you over. Delta t that's very easily done. They'll tell you what Delta t is three over two R.

Speaker 3:          01:09:06       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       so the specific Keith of a gas at constant volume is three over two are when I started solids, I never bothered about constant volume because the change in the volume of a solid is so negligible. When there's heat it up, it's not worth specifying that it was a constant volume process, but for the gas it's going to matter, but there's constant volume or not. Then there's a second specific Keith people like to define that then follows. You take this piston, you have some gas at some pressure you pump in some heat but he don't clamp the piston. The Piston expand any way it wants at the same pressure. For example, if we're being pushed down by the atmosphere, you would let the person move up if it wants to maintaining the same pressure. Well, if it moves up a little bit then that it correctly creation is the heat that you put in is the change in internal energy plus p times Delta v where now p is some constant pressure. Say the atmospheric pressure. Delta v is the change in volume. So Delta you needed now will be more because you're pumping and heat from below and you're losing energy about because you're letting the gas expand because you are letting the pressure be controlled from the outside at some fixed value. So now Delta Q, this delta, you will be three over to our Delta t.

Speaker 1:          01:10:33       Now, what's the change in p times? Delta v here's where you should know your calculus. That p Times Change v is the same as change in Pv. If p is a constant, right? I remember long back when I did rate of change, the momentum is DVT of envy. It's m times Dvdt. So M doesn't change. You can take it inside the change, but now we use PV equals Rt. I'm talking about one more PV equals Rt. That's a change in the quantity. Rt is art as a constant as our times delta t so I put in here are times Delta t.

Speaker 1:          01:11:11       This is the delta Q at constant pressure. So the specific either constant pressure is Delta Q over Delta t keeping the pressure of constant. You divide everything by Delta t you get three over two r plus another r which is fire over to ours. So the thing you have to remember, what I did in the end is that a gas doesn't have a single specific heat. You could just say put in some heat and telling me how many calories I need to raise the temperature. That's not enough. You have to tell me whether in the interim the gas was fixed dinners, volume or changes volume or obey or some other condition. The two most popular conditions people consider are either the volume cannot change or the pressure cannot change, the volume cannot change. Then the change in the heat you put in goes directly to internal energy from the first law of thermodynamics. That gives you the specific heat of three over two r. If the pressure cannot change, you get five over two are you can see CP is bigger than CV because when you let the Piston expand, then not all the heat is going to hit the gas. Some of it is dissipated on top by working against the atmosphere. Then notice that I've not told you what gas it is.

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       That's where the specific heat, but mall is the right thing to think about because then the answer does not depend on what particular guests you took. There's hydrogen and helium. They all have the same specific heat per mall. They won't have the same specific hip per gram, right? Because one gram of helium and one gram of hydrogen don't have the same number of moles, so you have to remember that we're talking about more. Final thing I have to caution you. Very, very important. This is for a monarch atomic guests. This is for a gas who's Adam is the gas itself. It's a point. It's only energy is kinetic energy that are diatomic gases, but two of them join together. They can form a dumbbell or something. Then the energy of the dumbbell has got two parts as you learned long ago. It can rotate around some axes and we can also move in space.

Speaker 1:          01:13:35       Then the internal energy has also got two parts. Energy do do motion of the center of mass and energy due to rotation. Some molecules also vibrate the lots of complicated things, but if you've got only one guy, one Adam, whatever, his masters, it cannot rotate around itself and it cannot vibrator on itself, so those energies all disappear. So we have taken the simplest one of a mano atomic gas against whose fundamental entities? A single atom rather than a complicated molecule. That's all you are responsible for. I'll just say one thing, CP over CV. I wanted to mention it before you run off to do your homework. I don't ever comes out. It's called gamma. That's five third for a monotonic. Yes. You can just take the ratio of the numbers. If in some problem you find gamma is not five thirds, do not. Panic just means it's a gas, which is not monoatomic. He was not monitored Tommy. These numbers don't have exactly those values. We don't have to go beyond that. We just have to know this ratio. Gamma is five thirds in the simplest case, but in some problem somewhere in your life. Let me get a gamma, which is not fight this.
