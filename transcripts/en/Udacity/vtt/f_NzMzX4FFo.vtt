&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi I'm Sandra D'souza. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I'm Chris Aiden. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Welcome to class, I love

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:09.293
math and I can't wait to show the wonders of algebra with you. I've been

00:00:09.305 --> 00:00:13.622
teaching math for over 7 years and this is a totally new experience for me as it

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:18.429
is probably for you. I hope you're as excited as I am about what's to come. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:22.317
This course is broken into 12 units. Each unit consists of lessons with a series

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.508
of videos. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You will find interactive questions within these videos, as well

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.328
as practice problems at the end of each lesson. The purpose of these questions

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.463
is not to test your intelligence, it's to make you think. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here's an example

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:38.520
of what you can expect. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which of these do you think successful students do?

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.416
