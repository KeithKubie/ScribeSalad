that global businesses really have taken

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190
that global businesses really have taken
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.160
that global businesses really have taken

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.009
this responsibility upon them that
doesn't mean that this is a general

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019
doesn't mean that this is a general
 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.880
doesn't mean that this is a general
picture but again I feel that business

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890
picture but again I feel that business
 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.639

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.590
have been a key driver have been an
important driver in setting this

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600
important driver in setting this
 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.670

that it can be done and it's worthwhile

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010
that it can be done and it's worthwhile
 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.890

from it they can't survive they can't
develop without that for example another

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320
develop without that for example another
 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.170

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.310
they work with it and I'm quite sure
when they do that and they come in the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320
when they do that and they come in the
 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.090
when they do that and they come in the
last few years and really to promote

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100
last few years and really to promote
 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.699

out there among customers and interest

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930
out there among customers and interest
 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.009
out there among customers and interest
about costumers to do so and it's part

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019
about costumers to do so and it's part
 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.280
about costumers to do so and it's part
of their position in society that they

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290
of their position in society that they
 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.069
of their position in society that they
adopt this kind of strategies so these

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079
adopt this kind of strategies so these
 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.539
adopt this kind of strategies so these
are small things example and a worldwide

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549
are small things example and a worldwide
 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.440
are small things example and a worldwide
example but they are united in the same

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450
example but they are united in the same
 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.390
example but they are united in the same
approach and same understanding up that

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
approach and same understanding up that
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.020
approach and same understanding up that
sustainability is a core issue a

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030
sustainability is a core issue a
 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.150
sustainability is a core issue a
necessary issue for any business who

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160
necessary issue for any business who
 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.610
necessary issue for any business who
wants to stay in business and want to be

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620
wants to stay in business and want to be
 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.130
wants to stay in business and want to be
sustainable business themselves so I'm

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140
sustainable business themselves so I'm
 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.030
sustainable business themselves so I'm
quite sure that a lot of companies

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040
quite sure that a lot of companies
 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.360
quite sure that a lot of companies
we follow that path

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370
 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.240
I think that business should collaborate

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
I think that business should collaborate
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.940
I think that business should collaborate
in win their value chains because in

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950
in win their value chains because in
 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.320
in win their value chains because in
like the example of is with Walmart here

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330
like the example of is with Walmart here
 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.390
like the example of is with Walmart here
you have me accept that in the value

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400
you have me accept that in the value
 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.619

change the different business partner in

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629
change the different business partner in
 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.839
change the different business partner in
the value chain they be part of it so

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849
the value chain they be part of it so
 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.460
the value chain they be part of it so
this is a very very important part where

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
this is a very very important part where
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.099
this is a very very important part where
business can they collaborate that if

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109
business can they collaborate that if
 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.640
business can they collaborate that if
they have a huge company say this is our

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650
they have a huge company say this is our
 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.010
they have a huge company say this is our
strategy that's what we want to do then

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
strategy that's what we want to do then
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.150
strategy that's what we want to do then
they have to adopt the strategy to the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160
they have to adopt the strategy to the
 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.860
they have to adopt the strategy to the
whole value chain and they are fine sure

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870
whole value chain and they are fine sure
 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.020
whole value chain and they are fine sure
that the value chain the whole value

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030
that the value chain the whole value
 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.870
that the value chain the whole value
chain is based on sustainable issues and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880
chain is based on sustainable issues and
 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.930
chain is based on sustainable issues and
you can see that Unilever I know will do

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940
you can see that Unilever I know will do
 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.300
you can see that Unilever I know will do
that

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310
that
 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.490
that
become and they work with sustainable

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500
become and they work with sustainable
 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.680
become and they work with sustainable
sustainability as part of their value

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690
sustainability as part of their value
 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.080
sustainability as part of their value
chain and this is a very important part

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090
chain and this is a very important part
 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.279
chain and this is a very important part
it's very important example because this

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289
it's very important example because this
 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.400
it's very important example because this
example tells me that if one company

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410
example tells me that if one company
 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.270
example tells me that if one company
really can document this is a very

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280
really can document this is a very
 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.909
really can document this is a very
necessary element in our business

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919
necessary element in our business
 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.520
necessary element in our business
strategies they can only do that if

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530
strategies they can only do that if
 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.850
strategies they can only do that if
there is if the same approach is

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860
there is if the same approach is
 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.940
there is if the same approach is
followed by the only other parts of the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950
followed by the only other parts of the
 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.589
followed by the only other parts of the
chain and and therefore this is the only

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599
chain and and therefore this is the only
 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.260
chain and and therefore this is the only
way you could be credible because if you

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270
way you could be credible because if you
