00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.460
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Welcome to the first
Walter D. Meyers Award Ceremony

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.920
for Outstanding Children's
Literature.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.230
My name is Ellen Oh, and I am
honored to be the President and CEO

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.010
of We Need Diverse Books.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.510
[ Cheering ]

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.620
[ Applause ]

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.800
Although the We Need Diverse
Books organization is less

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.420
than two years old, the idea
behind it is not a new one.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.320
There have been many
advocates championing the need

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.000
for diverse books in children's
literature for decades.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.640
We walk in the footsteps of giants.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.260
All that we do builds upon the
life work of authors, teachers,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.630
librarians, editors, advocates,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.430
many of whom are sitting
right here in this room.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.590
But it was Mr. Myers
last [inaudible] piece

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.400
in the New York Times where other
people of color in children's books

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.730
that became the catalyst for the
We Need Diverse Books campaign.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.310 position:56%
A rallying cry that brought together
advocates from all over the country.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.450
And the world responded with
a loud and collective roar

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.740
that could not be ignored.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.640
I am so honored to be here today
to celebrate Mr. Myers legacy

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.120 position:56%
by recognizing a new generation of
outstanding authors and their books.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.640
And I am proud and
grateful to have Mrs. Myers

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.160
and Christopher Myers here to be
a part of this momentous event.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.960
Thank you so much.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.380
[ Applause ]

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.130
Also with us today are some
of the important people

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.880
in Water Dean Myers life,
like Miriam Altshuler,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.310
his long time agent and his editors
FBA, Medina Griffin [phonetic],

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.230
Andrea Davis Pigmey [phonetic],
and Rosemary Brosman [phonetic],

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.530
and Barbara Marcus [phonetic],

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.040
who most recently published
his Random House books

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.180
and was his marketer over
his scholastic books, too.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.730
So, thank you for coming
to Washington,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.310
D.C. also to celebrate with us.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.270
And, of course, I have to
say that we wouldn't be

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.270
in this beautiful room if it wasn't
for our friends here at the Library

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.520
of Congress, all the wonderful
staff at the Young Reader's Center

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.110
and the Center for the Book,
most particularly, John Cole,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.970
Karen Jaffey [phonetic], and
Kaheem Mohammad [phonetic].

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.880
Now, I have the great
pleasure of introducing you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.240
to the acting Librarian
of Congress, David Mao.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.880
David Mao oversees
the entire library

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.960
and its various service units to
ensure that the library service

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.650
to Congress and the American
people are provided effectively.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.670
He previously served as
deputy Librarian of Congress

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.850
and the 23rd law Librarian
of Congress, too.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.150
So, please welcome David Mao.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.350
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Thank
you so much, Ellen,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.650
and good morning to all of you.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.020
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.820 position:56%
I'm very happy to be able to be here

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.520
for this very special
occasion today.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.010
Our nation's diversity, of course,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.370
is one of the greatest
strengths that we have here.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.710
And so I think that diversity
should be reflected in all

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.040 position:56%
of the books that our children read.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.640
Now, the Library of Congress
we're, as you probably know,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.520
the world's largest
library and we have what we

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.130
like to call our Universal
Collection.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.180
And it's universal in that
we not only have books,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.920
but we have a variety of other
materials, including films,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.500
photographs, manuscripts, sound
recordings, just to name a few.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.980 position:56%
In our children's collection, alone,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.720 position:56%
we have more than 500,000 children's
books and other related items.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.480
Now, these books are on
every subject imaginable.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.730
And we welcome visitors to
our Young Reader's Center

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.330
so that they can touch, read,
and really enjoy these materials.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.690
And so I'm really delighted today
that the Young Reader's Center,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.930
which is administered by
the Library Congress Center

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.720
for the Book is a sponsor
for this event.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.540
And you heard of our very
wonderful, Dr. John Cole,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.250
who has led the Library
Congress Center for the Book

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.790
for very many, many years.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.370
And so thank you, John, for
making arrangements for this.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.990
Now, since 2008 the Librarian
of Congress has also appointed

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.940
and offered to serve as the
Library's national ambassador

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.460
for young people's literature.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.890
And this person, he or she,

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.120 position:56%
travels around the country promoting
literacy and raising awareness

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.630
of its impact on the education
and the development and betterment

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.340
of the lives of young people.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.560
So, we are very, very fortunate
to have Walter Dean Myers serve

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.460
as that ambassador
from 2012 to 2013.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.860
His platform was, Reading
Is Not Optional.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.880 position:56%
And so this newly established Walter
Award highlights the importance

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.970
of publishing books
in which children

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.510
of all backgrounds
can see themselves

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.000
and honor Walter's
commitment to literacy.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.300
And we're also very delighted

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.250
that we can have our very first
ambassador with us, Jon Scleszka,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.600
who is sitting here in
the front row to be here

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.930
to celebrate this important award.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.890
I want to thank We Need
Diverse Books for its work

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.790
in promoting the best
in children's literature

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.150
and for recognizing Walter
Dean Myers for his devotion

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.610
to writing books that enrich
the lives of young people

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.680
and for his outreach to
a population at risk.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.550
And it's now my pleasure to
introduce Dhonielle Clayton,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.220
Chief Operating Officer
of We Need Diverse Books.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.860
She's the co-chair of the
Walter Award judge's panel.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.570 position:56%
Dhonielle, who is an author herself,
is also co-founder of Cake Literary,

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.610 position:56%
a boutique book development company.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.510
So, please join me in
welcoming Dhonielle Clayton.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:05.270
[ Applause ]

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dhonielle Clayton: I'm
absolutely thrilled to be here today

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.390
with my co-chair, Kathy Weinberg
[phonetic] representing the

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.540
inaugural Walter Award
judging committee.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.270
The 11 member committee
had the pleasure

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.780
of reading young adult novels
that followed characters

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.050
through perilous worlds,
their first heartbreaks,

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.380
and the search for
their true selves.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.570
But three submissions stood out.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.720
It's hard to get 11 people
to agree on anything,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.890
but these three special
books kind of rose to the top

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.520
and were unmistakable in
their emotional resonance.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.400
As the committee discussed
these books, I also test them

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.170
out in my own library
with my students.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.460
I gave them copies, especially
to my most spirited ones,

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.120
the ones that say,
"Oh, I hate to read."

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.800 position:56%
And then something magical happened,
they started to get in trouble

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.300
in class because they
wouldn't stop reading

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.580
and transition to class work.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.650
They had fallen into
these three books

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.170
and I think that's the
most important quality.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.090
And the judges got it right.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.640
And when I saw them reading
those books, I knew that

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.390
and I knew our committee
was on the right path.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.390
And someone who knows kids
really well that I want

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.680
to introduce is Jon Scleszka.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.130
He's the first ever
national ambassador

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.980
for young people's literature
by the Librarian of Congress

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.590
and the Children's Book Council.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.730
As the ambassador, Scleszka toured
the country to raise awareness

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.530
about the importance of
children's literature

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.840
and his books were also stolen
in droves from my library.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.990
So, I think he's the most
important person to come

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.670
up here and talk about it.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.470
Thanks.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:46.350
[ Applause ]

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.650
&gt;&gt; Jon Scleszka: Wow!

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.950
I don't think I've ever had

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.410
that compliment before,
but I'll take that.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.560
[ Laughter ]

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.910 position:56%
Walter told me when I first met him,

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.580
maybe it wasn't the first time
I met him, but it's this thing

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.970
that just hit me like a
lightning bolt when I met Walter,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:07.070
and he said what became the
end of his essay in the times.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.820
It is, "We need to do work."

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.030
And that thing just felt
like it got chiseled

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.780
in my soul when he told it to me.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:21.730
It was a moment that I think has
got us where we are right now,

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.820
which is the most exciting thing.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:29.360
'Cause Walter was a guy who
was not that much of a talker.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.630
I mean, he could do the talk, but
I loved him for being the doer.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.480
He was the guy who
actually did things.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.250
He's the guy who changed
my life when we talked

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.970
about being the ambassador,
going places.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.970
And we did the usual places like
to be on T.V. with Martha Stewart,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.790
maybe not such a great thing.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.160
A little entertaining,
but Walter said,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.770
"You know where we're
supposed to be?

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.550
In schools, they never
see an author.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.880
We're supposed to be
in the prisons."

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.510
And he would go to those places.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.770
He got me into those places.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.070
And it just shook me.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.640
It was like, these are both like
the most inspirational places

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.920
and the most heartbreaking
all rolled into one.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.040
And it's the work we're doing
right now, which is so exciting

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.750
because we're making a difference.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.330
And this is the difference
we need to make.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.920
I kind of love that this
is Walter still living.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.800
This is him right now, right here.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.100
How great is the [inaudible]?

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.400
Just name him Walter.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.510
When I heard that I said, "Oh,
man, give me some of that."

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.040
[ Laughter ]

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.070
And I know that he influenced
the lives of these guys.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.090
I know when Jason and
Brendan had been around,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.390
they did the same thing.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.690
They've been into prisons here.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.820
They've been into the
schools that never see us.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.370
And we're that possibility
just by walking in.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.800
And I think that's what
Diverse Books is going to be all

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.830
about in the best way,
despite what we're reading

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.190
in the newspapers everyday
about some people's hand size.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.330
Please, dear God, let's not --
I'm sorry I even mentioned that.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.690
Let's not think about that ever.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.010
Too late, I just planted that.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.310
[ Laughter ]

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.840
That's bad.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.240
But we got to go better.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.540
We gotta go positive.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.260
It's up to us to change things.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.790
We are the leaders now.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.800
We'll show people how it's done.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.370
We'll all follow what
Walter told us to do.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.900
So, I just want to
leave you with that.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.200
Let's hear from the winners here.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.000
Congratulations you guys.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.290
[ Applause ]

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.150
This is so exciting.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.780
And I'll just leave you with that.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.480
We need to do work.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.190
Let's do that.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.490
All right, who gets to talk next?

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.320
Let's send somebody else over here.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.580
John Cole, do we need
to hear from you?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.510
Chris. How about some from Chris?

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:53.100
[ Cheering ]

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.730
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers:
How are you guys doing?

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.260
So, what does it mean
then to do the work?

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.370
I'll try to get off
here soon because I want

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.860
to see the [inaudible] concept.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.040
[ Laughter ]

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.340
What does it mean to do the work?

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.890 position:56%
You know, you're in this place,
this institution, it's so beautiful,

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.330
it's so peaceful, as
so many libraries are.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.120
These like places of peacefulness.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.330
And I've spent years
trying to think, "Well,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.930
why are libraries so
calm in that way?"

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:28.410
And I realized that it's because
on all the shelves, in every book,

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:35.470
is a fight, that there's
an argument being had.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.350
And really it's got
to be peaceful in here

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.490
because we are surrounded
by arguments.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.050
We are surrounded by fights.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.220
And those fights are a gift to us.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.110
These are the fights that
our nation was built on.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.700
This kind of -- have you ever
read the Federalist papers?

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.860
You see these intense arguments as
to how we should know the nation.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.040
Our nation is built on fights.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.370
So, don't, for a moment, see
yourself in this beautiful,

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:12.010 position:56%
beautiful, peaceful institution,
but imagine yourself on fight night.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.310
[ Laughter ]

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.380
Imagine yourself in
a room full of fans

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:25.780
and blood thirsty savage wanters,
people who want to see blood.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.460
Because this is who we are
amongst, we are fighters.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.660
Everybody here in this room
is a fighter of some sort.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:39.090
Imagine the weigh-in,
imagine the crowd,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:44.410
imagine my father who
loved a good fight.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.230
When we fight, we're
asking questions.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.700
We're asking important questions.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.460
And this is not a straw dog
fight of imagined enemies.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.700
No, we have real questions and real
respected opponents that we want

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.540
to have discussions with,
that we want to engage with.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.910
We want to try to change
minds and hearts.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.540
That's what a real fight is about.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.680
And that's what every
one of these authors,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.270
every one of these librarians,
every one of these teachers,

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:20.260
every one of these publishers,
this is what we do, we fight.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.690
We fight for things we believe in.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.990
We ask questions.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.140
We ask, "What does it mean to be
behind barbed wire at Manzanar?"

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.470
"What does it mean to
perform at a Yiddish theatre

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.530
in the lower east side and
listen to jazz records at night?"

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.520
We ask, "What does it mean
to protest in Ferguson?"

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.820
That's what the work
that John was mentioning.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.550
That's what it looks like.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.850
It looks like these fights.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:51.490
What does it mean to be in a tiny
boat as it comes up on the shore

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.480
on the beginning of the new
life in the United States?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.040
What does it mean to hear the first
bricks being thrown a stonewall

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.710
and hear your name in
the crash of the glass?

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.250
We are fighters here.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:10.640
And this is where the fights
happen in our exchange of ideas,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.440
in the discussions that we have.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.800
And so whether you're fighting
an acquisitions committee to say,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.200
"This book needs to be published."

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.660
Whether you're fighting to
get books into the hands

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.470
of children and you're a librarian.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:35.130
Whether you're WNDB fighting to
have more fights in the world

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:40.210
to have access to the
arena of fighting.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.780
Whether you're an author of
fighting a stack of words

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.230
to get in the right order.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.980
I know a little bit about fights.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.530
I watched dad fight.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:57.050 position:56%
I fight. And I'm so excited to be
part of this fight, this discussion.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.910
And I'm excited to
honor the fighters

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.510
that have fought a good
fight in these books.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:15.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.340
So, yeah, so let's get that going.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.850
The first person we would like
to honor is Margarita Engle.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.150
You talk about a fight.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.450
You talk about wings.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.750
You talk about a fight
of two cultures.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:29.030
Cultures fighting inside us and
how much that gives us, that fight,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.570
that battle inside us, which is, in
the end, the most important fight.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.710
You have Cuba.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.510
You have the United States.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.640
You have the -- what could
be imagined as a fight,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.300
but it's really a liberation
because all of these discussions

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.700
in the end yield liberation
for us all.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.580
And so, Margarita Engle, for
"Enchanted Air: Two Cultures,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.510
Two Wings, a Memoir", thank you.

I am so incredibly grateful
to We Need Diverse Books.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.020
Sorry. I'm not -- I'm down here.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.110
I forgot. I forgot I was
here in the race of giants.

[ Laughter ]

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.360

and the whole [inaudible] Simon and
Schuster publishing team, thank you,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.440
and to the Library of
Congress for hosting us.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.020
In his how to book, "Just Write",

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.780
Walter Dean Myers instructed,
"Be brave."

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.340
Writing a memoir does
require courage

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.200
because childhood memories
can be excruciating.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.930
And bringing them back
to life is terrifying.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.900
Showing them to strangers
is especially intimidating.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.720
Showing them to family
members is even scarier.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.330
That is precisely why
this honor means so much

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.150
because being misunderstood
is a writer's worse nightmare.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.820
And being understood
is the greatest joy.

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:24.930
I wrote "Enchanted Air" at a time
when there was no public glimmer

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:30.490
of hope for renewed relations
between my parents' homelands.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:35.390
During the same week when
advanced review copies arrived

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.710
on my doorstep, President
Obama announced the fall

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.460
in cold war hostility.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.310
I promised I wouldn't cry.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.830
I take it back.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.040
[ Laughter ]

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.290
My childhood memories
written as a plea for peace

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.680
and reconciliation were
suddenly transformed

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.400
into a song of gratitude.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.570
And I'll tell you why I wrote
them as a plea for peace

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:07.950
because I thought no U.S. President
would ever have the courage

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.170
to make peace with Cuba.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.440
And I wrote it for children
because I thought, "Well,

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.470
maybe one of these
little people will grow up

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.770
and be courageous enough."

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.970
I hope it is a book that will
not just speak to Latinos

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.800
with their wide variety of
reasons for being able to visit,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.220
Abuelita y los primos, but also
to readers from other backgrounds

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.840
who might feel like a bridge
or a storm for any reason.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.930
But instead of the poem about
how I felt a bridge of the storm,

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.470
or a storm, I've decided to
read, "Refuge" on page 54

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.080
because we're in this
amazing library.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.100
And this poem tells how
I came to be a writer.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:19:00.080
We first took time right after my
family was interrogated by the FBI

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:07.370
for receiving phone calls and
mail from my grandmother in Cuba.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.630
The ugliness of war
photos and the uncertainty

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:15.410
of TV news joined the memory of
FBI questions to make me feel

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.870
like climbing into my own secret
world, books are enchanted.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.160
Books help me travel.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.340
Books help me breathe.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.510
When I climb a tree,
I take a book with me.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:33.620
When I walk home from school, I
carry my own poems inside my mind

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.370
where no one else can
reach the words

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.920
that are entirely,
completely forever mine.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.920
I hope Enchanted AIR might help to
inspire some young people to write

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.130
about their own lives and their
own feelings, and to find refuge.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:57.260
When I was a teenager it was
easier for a U.S. citizen to walk

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:03.000
on the moon than to
visit relatives in Cuba.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.090
Today it's not front page news
because peace is rarely celebrated

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:16.560
by the 21st century media, but
yesterday direct mail service

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.200
between Cuba and the U.S. resumed
after more than half a century.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.770
And on Monday President Obama
will go to Havana [inaudible]

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.510
around a U.S. president
was courageous.

[ Applause ]

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.950
And I'm especially happy that
he's going to do ordinary things

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.160
in Havana, like attend
the baseball game

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.920
and treat a neighboring
country as a friend.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.980

y Gracias a Dios.

fight that so many of us have grown

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.200
up knowing about, but
give us new perspectives.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.330
There's the fight within someone,
you know, and for me growing up,

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:15.470
Malcolm was that paragon of
somebody who was brave enough

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.310
to fight with themselves.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:21.320
There's one part towards the end
of the book where they give a list

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.510 position:56%
of names, and this moment of saying,
"I need to choose my own name."

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.410
That is the biggest fight.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.580
That is one of the fights that
we're excited to participate in.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:37.770
And so we're very, very
honored to honor Kekla Magoon

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.510
and Ilyasah Shabazz for "X".

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:54.210
[ Applause ]

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.190
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: Well, first
to Walter Dean Myers family.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.490
God bless you.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.530
He continues to inspire
me personally,

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.430
and I would imagine Ilyasah,
but she can speak for herself.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.980 position:56%
To We Need Diverse Books, God bless
you for even recognizing these books

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:15.070
and the importance of acknowledging
the diversity in our country.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.510
I mean, this is the
melting pot of all nations.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:25.850
To Candlewick, what a phenomenal
group of people to work with.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:30.940
It's such an honor
to be in this place.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.510 position:56%
To be fellow, I don't know if you're
fellow, I mean, to the winners.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.060
[ Laughter ]

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.480
Congratulations.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.730
You know, a long time
ago, I was in [inaudible]

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.800
with a lot of young girls.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.540
And I said, "Hey, where
do you want to go?"

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.980
They wanted to go to Barnes &amp;
Noble, when Barnes &amp; Noble was big.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.410
And so I said, "Okay.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.310
Yeah." So we go to
Barnes &amp; Noble and I said,

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.920
"Pick out whatever book you want."

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.250
And they brought these books
to me and I looked at them,

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.800
and I had young girls of color,
and it was very difficult for me

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.730
to buy a book for them because I
wanted them to open up the book

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:11.190
and see themselves in it, and have
a nice reflection of themselves.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.300
And so I set out to
write a children's book.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.910
And then my father's young journey,

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.900
his adolescent journey
was so misunderstood.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.250
He came from a family of activists.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.740
They instilled specific values
in him that he could grow up

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:33.530
and become this, you
know, great humanitarian

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.130
that would circle the globe, just
in his 30's, a very young man.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.050 position:56%
Circle the globe in his 60's searing
for solutions to the unit condition

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:46.160
that would want to afflict any
kind of trauma, psychological pain,

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.780 position:56%
challenge to expel our brother just
because of this color in their skin.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.820
So, you know, I thought that his
life was such an inspiration,

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.250
not only to myself and my
family, but to so many young men

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.020
in adolescence in that
they could read a book

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.490
and find themselves in it.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.850
And that it would celebrate
their leadership,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.950
their purpose, their lives.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:13.430
And so I was so fortunate
and I searched high and low

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.410
for so many different co-writers.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:21.080
And I came across this amazing
woman, this amazing sister,

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.470
and we were able to do, you know,

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.730
I think a pretty good
job, and well, obviously.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.030
Right.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.330
[ Laughter ]

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.770
With "X" the novel, I
think it's just, you know,

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:36.080
so important that our young
people recognize the power

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.850
that -- their individual power.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.520
That they recognize
their leadership.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.360
That they recognize
all of the things

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.780
that will help our country be
the best that it can possibly be.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.170
So, I personally am so happy
and honored, and I thank you

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.300
so much for this [inaudible].

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.670
[ Applause ]

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.970
&gt;&gt; Ilyasah Shabazz: Hello.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.360
I guess the first thing is,
thank you for choosing me

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.660
to work with you all on this.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.280
It was so exciting to
have this opportunity,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.580
and a little bit daunting to have
the opportunity to try to think

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.750
from the perspective of someone
like Malcolm X who has helped us

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.230
as a leader and a humanitarian,
and he's celebrated

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.100
and remembered 50 years
after his death.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.130
And so that, you know, that task
is a little bit daunting, you know,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.140
and quite an honor to be a part of.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.680
One of the things we ran up
against in pitching the book

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.010
and selling the book
was the question of,

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.330 position:56%
"Why do you need this story", right.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.130
We all know Malcolm X's story,

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.900
but we don't all know Malcolm X's
story, which is another story.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.200
But we know what happens, right?

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.580
We know how it turns out.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.070
We know who he becomes, you
know, why do we need something

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.710
that looks inside his head
when he was a young man.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.760
And, you know, where
is the suspense, right?

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.620
Where is the pretension, right,
in that story, because we know it

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.240
so well as a society in theory.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.930
But one of the things
we talked a lot

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.250
about as we were working
was it's easy

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.850
to tell the story from
hindsight, right.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.120 position:56%
It's easy to look back and say, "Oh,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.720
you know Malcolm X was
this great humanitarian.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.120
He was perhaps destined to
be that, and we don't know."

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.320
But when he was 14 he had no idea,
right, who he was going to become.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.070
He had no idea what
was next for him.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.920
And he was making choices
based on the fact

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.560
that everything felt really
screwed up, everything was scary.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.370
His family was being destroyed
by all sorts of things,

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:25.820
including institutional racism.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.610
And he was up against things
he didn't understand and he had

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.190
to make choices in
that moment and in

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.670
that space not knowing
what was going to happen

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.770
for him and his life later.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.230
And that, I think, is a
message that we really wanted

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.580
to be included in this book.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.580
That every young person when you're
14, and everything is screwed up,

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.910
like that doesn't mean that that's
going to be the rest of your life.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.210
You can make choices.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.510
You have power.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.390
You have the ability
to decide, "Okay.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.660
This is what it is today and this
is what's tomorrow is going to be."

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.780 position:56%
And so to be able to look at a story
about Malcolm for every young man

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.900
to look at, the choices that
he was making at that time,

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.500
but they're not the best
choices all the time, right.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.840
And to say,"Okay.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.410
Look at how he turned out, right.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.710
What if I can do something?

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.330
What if I can decide tomorrow I'm
going to step up and be a person

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.160
who makes change in the world?"

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.730
That is something that, you know,
kids don't always hear, right,

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.220
that you have power, that
you can make choices,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.160
that you can change your world.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.460
And so, that was, you know,

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.970
what we hope readers
will take from the book.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:24.810
And, you know, I hope that,
you know, people will continue

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.690
to read it and celebrate it
and learn more about him.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.660
I hope it's a gateway for people
to learn about his life and work

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.560
and messages that he, you
know, spoke 50 years ago

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.030
that are extremely relevant to
our world today, unfortunately.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.090
We definitely had an amazing
team working with us [inaudible].

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:43.080 position:56%
Our editor, Andrea Compa
[phonetic] is brilliant as a reader,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.480
and an editor ,and as a
colleague, and friend.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.160
And our publicist Jamie Tan
[phonetic] has been amazing

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.700
at getting us exposure for the book
and getting us out into the world

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.500
to talk about it and share it.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.870
And we love the cover of the book.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.310 position:56%
And so we want to give a little
shout out to Matt Roscher [phonetic]

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.980
who designed our book cover.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.380
We get a lot of compliments on it.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.680
It's pretty exciting.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.000
But everyone at Candlewick worked
together to bring this book

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.400
to life and make it what it is.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.150
And so we're really grateful to
be a part of that and to be here.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.480
And thank you especially, of
course, to We Need Diverse Books

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.130
for honoring the book, for creating
this award, for allowing people

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.990
to have an opportunity to come
together to demand what we need

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:25.630
for readers, and to be a voice
for change because, you know,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.930
it's not always one person.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.940
It has to be a community
that comes together.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.370
We look at the heroes.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.240
We look at the Malcolm X's
and the Martin Luther King's,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.540
the people who sit at the podium,

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.790
and that's not what's
interesting about what they did.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.320
What's interesting about what they
did is how they inspired many,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.620
many people to stand up.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.420
And so we have that,
our work and the work

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.250
of We Need Diverse Books can
keep doing that for our children

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.620
and for readers everywhere.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.420
Thank you so much.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:58.280
[ Applause ]

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.380
&gt;&gt; You know I just want to say,
sometimes when our young people are

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.010
in pain, right, they don't
make the best decisions.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.690
And that's what happened
to my father.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.990
He was in pain.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.550
His father was gone,
his mother was gone.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:14.410
His teacher told him that he was
an "N" word and there was no one

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.170
to say, "No, no, no, you're okay.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.470
You're great."

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.200 position:56%
We need the adults around us, right.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.850
When we're in pain, we don't say,

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.730
"I'm going to go get
the best education."

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.070
Usually when we're in
pain, sometimes we say,

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.370
"I'm going to go have a drink.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.290
I'm going to go smoke a cigarette.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.890
I'm going to go do something
that's self-destructive."

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:38.140
So, I cannot say how important it
is that we need all of the adults,

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.120
all of us forward thinkers,
smart, beautiful adults

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.770
to really invest in
all of our children.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.070
I cannot say that enough.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.870
So thank you.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:31:19.130
[ Applause ]

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.790
&gt;&gt; What Ilyasah says is so correct.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.880
You know, with so many kids in pain
and there's this thing of like,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.200
they have these fights inside them.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.650
They have these arguments
going on about who they can be,

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:37.210
who they will be, who
they want to be.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:41.140
And history has this
way of giving --

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:47.220
making the fights that go on
inside us happen outside of us.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.270
These last few years, of course,
in the rise of Black Lives Matter,

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.890
we see a fight that is essential

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:58.100
to American identity happening
all across the country.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:05.180
And I'm really excited and proud to
announce the winning Jason Reynolds

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:11.700
and Brendan Kiely for "All
American Boys" of the first Walter

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.680
that articulates that
fight in a very open way

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.280
on both sides of the equation.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.330
This is a place full of fights.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.690
This is a place full of
conversations and they have it

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:28.600 position:56%
in a book, and gave that book to the
world, and we're very, very excited.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.510
Congratulations.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:44.040
[ Applause ]

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.840
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:54.530
[ Applause ]

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:59.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: So, one thing
I've learned in our process together

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.370
that I didn't know before is
that I am Type A, and I have --

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:09.010
I have written down some
words from my journey.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.310
[ Laughter ]

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.830
But so, I just want to -- I want
to say a few thanks and I want

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:20.980 position:56%
to say a couple of words, especially
given the idea that I love this idea

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.010
that these books are fights.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:27.930
And I really appreciate the
idea that we need to model

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.660
that fight for young people.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.970
And I just really admire that.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:36.070
And this is a tremendous honor
to be here with everyone.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.420
And for "All American Boys" to
be recognized in the company

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.710
of these two powerful books,

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.620
to be part of the We Need
Diverse Books movement

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.160
that I admire very much.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.030
For the book to garner
an award whose very name

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.850
and family fill this room
with a legacy of artistic

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.860
and socially conscious
vision and integrity.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.220
This is truly humbling.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:02.040
And a word like gratitude just
falls short of how I feel.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.540 position:56%
I want to thank the award committee,

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:10.320
the executive team,
and everyone at WNDB.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.030
I almost said that.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.770
But for the recognition
of this book.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.620
Wow! I'm going to do it again, too.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:26.190
And for the magnitude of the
work you all do everyday.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.780
I also want to thank everyone
at SNS for the hard work it took

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:33.480
to put this book together and get
it out on shelves in record time.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.150
And for all the work
that is still going

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.570
on to remind folks why
this book is important.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.440
I especially want to thank
Justin Chandiff [phonetic]

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.490
for his eagerness to
make this book a reality

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.920
and Caitlyn Dewey [phonetic],
the third writer of this book

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.860
who saw the sculpture in
the stone and knew how

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.040
to guide our hands to get it there.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.370
And most importantly, I want
to thank Jason for trusting me

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:01.810
and a friendship for which
I will forever be grateful

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.080
because as we always say,
"If the friendship is a bust,

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.130
then the whole book and
everything we fought for

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.400
and cared for is also a bust."

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.380
And "All American Boys"
is not a bust.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.760
It is the single most important
thing I have been a part

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.300
of in my career, just

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.500
as your friendship is the
single most important friendship

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.980
in my career.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.780
I say career because my final
thank you is to my wife,

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.080
Jessie Chafee [phonetic]
whose friendship

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.510
and love are the most
important in my life.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.100
[ Laughter ]

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:38.860 position:56%
But I'll just say this, that in
"All American Boys", at first Quinn,

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.030
the white boy, runs
away from the violence

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.400
or the injustice that he witnesses.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.690
He runs away because as he
begins to process any of it,

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.200
he may have to make
significant changes in his life.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.840
The system of law enforcement is
unjust, but how can those of us

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.160
who have the privilege to ignore
this ugly reality expect a system

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.740
that is unjust to change
if we don't make the leap

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:10.810
to make the necessary changes
we must make in ourselves?

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:15.180
This is one of the most dangerously
powerful aspects of privilege,

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.250
the privilege to look away,
to choose not to engage.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:24.390
There's dangerous power in
choosing to not tell a story.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.540
The reason we must say
Black Lives Matter,

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.670
and the reason we must
say it everyday,

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:35.990
is because there are already
too many missing people,

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:40.170
Tamir Rice [phonetic],
Sandra Bland, Michael Brown.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.740
And we cannot let their
stories go missing, too.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.630
We cannot.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.760
And Quinn, a person of privilege,

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.370
must tell another part
of the story, too.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:57.420 position:56%
We cannot have an institution that's
systemically disenfranchises people

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.900
without also empowering others

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.380
to systematically benefit
from that injustice.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:07.360
Or put another way, an
institution that historically

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.850
and systematically excludes some
voices, necessarily empowers others

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:18.770
to be systematically included,
or put more bluntly, published.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:23.540
So, I say this with love
because I want to --

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.200
I want love to beat and hone in
my old, weathered, warn heart,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.420
it's like an old Celtic skin drum.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.030
That's my Irish background.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.040
[ Laughter ]

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.420
And so I say this with
a spirit of trying

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.180
to call us in, not call us out.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:44.010
Just as the statistics clearly
expose the injustice in the world

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.760
of law enforcement, the
numbers are starkly apparent

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.310
in book publishing, too.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.040
We need more diverse --
a more diverse workforce.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.900
A more diverse array of book
reviews and books reviewed.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:59.560 position:56%
And a much larger pool of diverse
authors getting published regularly.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:05.170
WNDB and others are calling
for this institutional change

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.240
and we should all support them.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.910
Institutions are made up of
individuals, many of whom are

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:16.960
like Quinn, like me,
people with privilege.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.410
And I look to them
to partner with WNDB

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:24.250
and change their institutions
from within.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.760
We cannot run away
or turn our heads,

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.080
or hope that someone
else will handle it.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.860
It's on us, too.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.790
White folk like me, straight folk
like me, able-bodied folks like me,

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.260
[inaudible] gendered folks like me.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.980
This is how we join a powerful
movement WNDB is leading

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.580
in the industry.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.880
We listen.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.020
We partner and listen.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.280
We listen some more and
then we get out there

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.920
and help make the change we
know in our hearts must come.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.170
So, I thank everybody at WNDB for
this award, for the recognition

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.430
and support of all American boys,
and I thank them and cheer them

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.760
for their bravery, their
leadership, and their vision.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.480
Thank you for pushing the world of
publishing to become its best self.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.280
Thank you.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:19.140
[ Applause ]

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.650
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
So, it's interesting.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:27.010
I've been thinking a lot
about, sort of, obviously,

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.640
about diversity leading
up to this award.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:37.900
And usually when we talk about
diversity, we talk about sort

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.060
of what we see in the landscape.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.930
When we look out into the
world, what do we see.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.230
When we look onto our bookshelves

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.390
in this particular
context, what do we see?

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.800
But I feel like there's
another part of diversity

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.350 position:56%
or even whenever we're thinking
about anything outside or ourselves,

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.110
I think it's always necessary
to take a moment to think

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.440
about [inaudible] ourselves.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.570
And so I've been thinking a
lot about who I am lately,

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:00.870
perhaps this quarter life.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:04.300
Some sort of quarter life
crisis thing happening.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:09.020
But I've been really trying to
hash out, like who it is that I am.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:15.600
What it is that I stand
for and what makes up me.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.010
And I -- everyday I'm realizing
more and more that I am an amalgam

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.570
of the people that I've met.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:27.010
That I'm an amalgam of the
experiences that I've had.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:31.140
That I am, you know, pieces
of my mother, who is here.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:35.510
And everybody who knows me knows,
you all know she's in the room

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.280
[ Applause ]

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.880
You know, pieces of my mother.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:44.520
I mean, my mother, you know, she
gave me sort of the sense of pride,

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.800
both kinds of pride, you
know, the kind that sometimes

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.250
to a fault keeps me
from asking for help.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:55.690
And the kind that allows me to
put my chest out a little bit

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:59.920
and hold my head up and walk the
earth like I'm God's child, right.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.520
Walk the earth like
I'm Isabel's child.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.090
And my father, who I don't
talk about much, you know,

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:10.810
I have pieces of him, you
know, his fearlessness.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.070
A man in the 60's and
70's who was covered

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.460
in tattoos, which was unheard of.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.550
A man who has always taken
his life by the reigns

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:24.800
and done whatever he wants to
do, whenever he wants to do it.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.960
My best friend in the world
is here and I would be remiss

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.010
if I didn't say something to
him and he would let me know.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.310
[ Laughter ]

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:33.270
My dear friend Ann Anisia
[phonetic] I've known for 30 years.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.800
And I think about him
and how I'm amalgam.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.560
And he's part of that
amalgam, you know.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.350
A friendship for my entire life.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.490
We are so different.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.710
Two totally different people who
have forged a friendship based

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:49.810
on respect and love even as we've
grown into our individual selves,

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.490
not always seeing eye-to-eye,

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:58.390 position:56%
but always connecting heart-to-heart
no matter what, forever and ever.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:02.050
To my first husband --

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.090
[ Laughter ]

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:05.390
-- Brendan here.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.010
I'm sorry, Jessie --

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.310
[ Laughter ]

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.610
to have to share him.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.320
You know, but I tell people
all the time that, you know,

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.300
I come from a family,
especially my mother.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.540
I come from a family, my
mother is from the south,

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:21.250
our household was rooted
and steep in our culture.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.210
I'm very proud of that.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.350
But it's an incredible experience
to work and stand next to a person

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.660
who is outside of that cultural
community and look at him and know

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.090
for a fact that he is the best
of what humanity has to offer.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.010
It's a good thing.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.930
Even my mother who in finding
out that I was writing this book

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.010
with him, and I'm going to
put your business out there.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.310
[ Laughter ]

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.610
But he already knows.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:43.940
The first thing she said
was, "Who is this guy?

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.740
What's going on?"

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.390
[ Laughter ]

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:50.000 position:56%
The scars of the south heavy on her.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.590
And then she started reading the
book and she called me and said,

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.560
"Now, let me get this straight,
did you write all of Rashad

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.490
and he wrote Quinn or did
he write some of Rashad?"

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.060
And I said, "No, I
wrote all of Rashad."

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.530
And she said, "Oh, okay, I
was getting ready to say,

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.060
ain't no way that he
could have known --

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.110
[ Laughter ]

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.760
And I was like, "Yeah, you know."

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.320
And then at the end of the book she
calls me and she says, "You know,

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.610
Jason, I'm just so
proud of Brendan."

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:13.910
Which is funny.

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.010
Which is funny in that she
didn't say she was proud of me.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.310
[ Laughter ]

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:19.610
But it's powerful -

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.910
[ Laughter ]

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.840
-- in the sense that she
came full circle, right.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.350
Brendan was into the
circle of trust now.

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:28.820
I'm an amalgam of the
people that I've met

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.330
and the places that I've been.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.990
I'm an amalgam of all
these young people that --

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.720
the young people that are locked
away in juvenile detention centers

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.480
that none of you ever
have to think about.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:44.690
The ones who are doing 18, 19
year sentences at 15 years old.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:48.470
The ones who come to me when I'm
there and ask me, "Mr. Jason,

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.760
they all keep telling
me I have to change.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.060
They all keep telling me I have

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.420
to make different decisions
with my life.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.010
But every decision I've ever made,

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.390
I've made because I thought
it was the right decision."

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:00.100
For the little girl in Philly.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.360
When Brendan and I were in
Philadelphia, who came to me

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.540
and said, "Mr. Jason, has
there ever been a moment

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.800
where you just wish you could
change the color or your skin?"

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.250
She's there.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:13.070
For the young lady in Germany
who I met two days ago who said,

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.220
"Mr. Jason, do you know
what it's like to know

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.220
that every single person in
the world when they think

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.000
of Germany they only
think of Hitler?"

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.280
And for me to in that moment
wish that that little girl

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.850
in Philly could know that
little girl in Germany

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.800
because they're the same.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.010 position:56%
They're experiencing the same thing.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:33.240
I'm an amalgam of the
people that I've met.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.300
You know, Chris Myers, my --

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.660
people know we have a
very tight relationship

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.960
and I'm grateful for him.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.710
He's fueled my curiosity in a way
that not any human being has ever.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:53.230
I've learned so much about refugee
boats and African billionaires,

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:57.030
and Vietnamese embroidery artists.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.050
[ Laughter ]

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.060
I mean he knows everything.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.110
[ Laughter ]

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:04.410
Everything.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.530
To the young people
that I met in Tucson.

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.230
To Michael Brown and his family.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.670
I'm an amalgam of all
of these things.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:14.370
And what I've learned after
thinking about all of this,

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.500
is I realized that the diversity
that we have to be discussing

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.980
as we discuss the diversity
that is existing on the outside,

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.170
is that there's also the fact that
we need to have as many stories

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:26.780
as possible to appeal to the
diversity on the inside of us,

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.810
each and every one
of us individually.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.110
I am not [inaudible].

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:34.050
There isn't one kind of me.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:37.880
I am all of the people, an
amalgam of the people that I've met

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.060
and the experiences that I've had.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:45.960
My hope, and I know WNDB's hope,
is that I can write as many books

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.550
as I can, not for any solo book
to serve as some sort of mantle

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:54.810
for some young person, but so that
a collection of books can serve

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:58.850
as a metaphor for who they
are sliver by sliver, right.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.950
That you can like all the
things and do all the things.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.900
That you can like french fries
and really fancy restaurants.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:09.000
That you can like to wear
a suit and Jordans, right.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.050
That you can like the
south and the city.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:13.500
And that that's okay.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.650
So that someday when they're my age
they can look at their libraries,

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.730
they can look at their
collections, they've had a lifetime

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.770
with literacy, and they can say,

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:23.610
"All of these books are
the representation of me.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:25.260
All of them."

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.740
No matter how different
they may seem.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.440
Each and every one of
them has a portion of me.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.570
That's my new purpose as of last
night thinking about these things.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.010
My new goal --

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.310
[ Laughter ]

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.280
-- is to shift it a little bit.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.990
So with that, I'd like
to say thank you to WNDB

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.850
for all of your hard work.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:48.540
You guys have shown me an
insurmountable amount of love.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.750
To the Library of Congress,
thanks for having us.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.250
This is awesome.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:57.300
And to the Committee,
thank you all very much.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.540
To Caitlyn and Elena, these are --

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.700
Caitlyn is my editor
and Elena is my agent.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.160
They're the ones who
get to see me the way

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.730
that only my family gets to see me.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.460
The ones who know that most of
the time I'm extremely anxious.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.500
I have terrible insecurities
around this work.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.000
And they're the ones
who get to guide my hand

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.080
and believe in me regardless.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.860
And to everyone else,
I just say thank you.

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.970
My mother needs to know that
as I move around the world,

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:24.940
there are people who got
me, people who love me.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.510
So, thank you.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:48:04.150

a picture with Margarita.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.170
We're going to have to reenact.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.580
[ Laughter ]

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.180
We're getting better.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.960
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle:
It's pretty embarrassing

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.760
that I didn't know
there were [inaudible].

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:41.510
[ Laughter ]

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:52.100
[ Applause ]

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.900
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: Um --

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.040
[ Laughter ]

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.680
I'm brought back to a day maybe
about four years ago when --

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.840
four or five years ago, Pop
and I would meet in the city

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.690
of [inaudible] most
Saturday's and go

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:11.280
to the flea market
and go through things.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.040
And I had been wanting him
to meet Jason for a long time

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.290
because Jason was my boy and we
talked a lot about publishing

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:24.460
and wanting to see this -- to
make a space, to have these fights

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:29.440
that we had together in the world.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:35.010
And at that point, Jason had
a job, a [inaudible] job.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:36.310
[ Laughter ]

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:40.100
And I brought my Pop into the store
and my Pop in his kind of stiff,

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.720
but loving way said,
"Well, you know,

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.360
you're willing to do the work?"

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.660
You know, that kind of thing.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.220
[ Laughter ]

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:53.640
And, you know, I flash forward
to today, to this thing,

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.680
which I know he would
have laughed at.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.090
He would be like, "What you
gonna call it, the Walter?"

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:00.170
[ Laughter ]

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:01.470
That didn't roll off the tongue.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:04.300
I don't know if I need to be --

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.230
and I'm happy to see that
we're all here doing the work.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:12.340
I'm happy to see how much
Jason is doing the work,

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.460
and Brendan is doing the
work, and Kekla, and Rita,

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.850
and Ilyasah, WNDB, the publishers.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.150
We are doing the work.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.040
We are having these fights.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.600
We're having them respectfully
and lovingly and it's exciting

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.970
to be here doing the
work with you all.

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:34.250
And lastly, I'd like
to introduce John Cole,

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:36.530
someone who has been doing
the work for quite some time.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:40.510
I remember I met you with
Pop about a 107 years ago.

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:43.040
[ Laughter ]

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.490
No, I'm 107.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:46.510
You must be, I don't know.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.080
[ Laughter ]

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.670
So, John Cole, the director
of the Library of Congress,

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:54.490
Center for the Book,
and chair of the Library

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:58.790
of Congress Literacy Awards
Program, and great advocate

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:03.470
of American letters and literature,
goodness in so many ways.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.310
So, again, we thank you.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:09.470
We thank you all for doing the
work, for having the fights,

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.050
for having them in a real way

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.880
so we can have these
discussions more and more.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.740
I know that the next time I have
breakfast with Jason he's going

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.010
to say, "Man, you know I
killed that speech, right?"

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.310
[ Laughter ]

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:22.610
I'm going to be like,
"Yeah, you did.

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:25.010
You did." But I'm going to find
something to fight with him about.

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:26.400
[ Laughter ]

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.700
John Cole.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.500
Thank you.

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:34.040
[ Applause ]

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.360
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well,
thank you, Chris.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.010
I have been at the Library
of Congress a long time.

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.310
[ Laughter ]

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:44.520
Not quite 109 years, but I've
also written about the library

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.670
and I'm always looking for
wonderful new descriptions,

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:49.130
and now I have a new one,

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:53.010
the Library of Congress
is a prizefighting ring.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:54.310
[ Laughter ]

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.870
A place for these fights to take
place that we're talking about.

00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:00.860
We're very honored to be
able to be part of this.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.230
And I have thank you's for all
of you for the work you're doing.

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:09.210 position:56%
And I'm very pleased that through
the work of the Library of Congress,

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:13.270 position:56%
particularly the Center for the
Book, and the Young Reader's Center,

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:18.480
which is part of the Center for the
Book, which was created in 2009.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.080
It took us a long time.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.900
It took us 100 years to figure
out, actually, that the Library

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:29.180
of Congress needed its own
place for young readers,

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.800
for dealing with people
under the age of 16.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.150
One bit of history, when
this building opened in 1897,

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:40.560
this wonderful inspirational
building, it's wonderful

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.010
to have an inspirational program
in this wonderful building.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:47.710
The first Librarian of
Congress had the idea

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:51.640
for a juvenile library
when this place opened.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.890
He died after a year and a half.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:57.010 position:56%
He had nothing to do with this idea.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:58.310
[ Laughter ]

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:02.000
But in the meantime, this
was 1897 the building opened,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.340
John Russell Young died in 1899.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:09.240
In the meantime, the District of
Colombia public library opened

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.300
and it's a wonderful place, but it
gave the next librarian an excuse

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.240
for not having a juvenile library.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:21.140
And he said, "That's all taken
care of by the DC public library.

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:24.240
So long. I'm doing
my wonderful thing."

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.580
And it took 100 years,
until 2009, with the support

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:31.910
of Daniel Borsin [phonetic] --
James Billington [phonetic],

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:37.950 position:56%
who is the Librarian of Congress to
create a special place for people 16

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.020
and under as long as they
had an adult with them,

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:43.170
which actually is a great advantage

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:45.500
because it makes us a
family literacy center

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:50.260 position:56%
in this beautiful set of three
rooms, which I hope you've all seen,

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.490
in this beautiful building.

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.760
And that is a way that
we have been able

00:53:54.760 --> 00:54:00.210
to use the Young Reader's Center
as a way to get into the fight,

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:04.250 position:56%
to bring the Library of Congress and
the three sources that is prestige,

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:07.660
into the world of young
people's literature

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.350
in an absolutely direct way.

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:14.800 position:56%
And what you've done, and what
we've done together with this award,

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.070
and with getting it launched
at the Library of Congress,

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:21.930
is helping the Library
of Congress in its fight.

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:26.100
Its fight to show that that young
people's literature is the world

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.200
that we should be involved in
directly and it makes sense,

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:34.350
and it would even make sense to
Thomas Jefferson, who had the idea

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:37.780
of opening the Library of
Congress, not just to Congress,

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:41.870
but to the nation so it
was available to everybody.

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:44.600
But the secret is, which
doesn't go in my history books,

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.650
it's the wrong side of the
statement, is we weren't open

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:50.220
to everyone, you had to be over 16.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.710
And that started back when
we were in the Capitol.

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:58.450
So, we are together, part
of a history not only

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:01.260
for this wonderful world
of diversity that's coming

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.370
through publishing and writers,
but also for the Library

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:10.920
of Congress being a partner with
us is helping the broader cause

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.370
and really helping American
culture and literature

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:20.130
and its recognition be part
of this wonderful institution.

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.090
It is inspirational.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:26.150
We now go to another
inspirational part of the Library

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.820
of Congress for our reception.

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.080
And I just want to mention
that as you walk down the hall,

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.010
our members room, we're going
to be in a very special room,

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.470 position:56%
which is the one facing the Capitol,

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:41.470
and that's where the members
of Congress could come.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:45.430 position:56%
And it's really kind of a kick
because this side of the building --

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:49.510
first of all, the building is so
magnificent because it was built

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:55.480
between 1886 and 1897 when we
were flexing our cultural muscle,

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.220
and we wanted American
writers to be recognized.

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:03.400
We wanted to out Europe Europe
in the building, and we did,

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.240
but we also wanted to
honor American writers.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.270
And so as you walk out into the
great hall, we're going to walk

00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.540 position:56%
down this hallway filled with muses.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.190
So, the fancy, the gold is here
on the side facing Congress.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:19.770
That's the way it was
in 1897 when we opened.

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:22.570
We're going to go down the
hall of the [inaudible].

00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:27.070
Each hall has a different
them and field of knowledge.

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:30.550
And so the nine muses are
painted and there's poetry

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.260
by Alexander Pope in the hall.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:37.510
Then we go through the great
reading -- the great main hall,

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:40.240
the great hall, and that's
where if you look up,

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.400
you'll see names of writers.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.970
On the top, it's all
European and world writers,

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:49.650
you come down a level, you get
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:55.270
you get American historian,
George Bancroft.

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:59.660
And then the final stop before
we move into the Member's Room,

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:03.630 position:56%
which is the most fancy room because
that was the members of Congress

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:07.650
and we're part of the legislative
branch, is the hall of poetry,

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:11.030
and there we really got
the tough part of the fight

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:14.240
that was probably going on
that we don't know about.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.880
And instead of just an
occasional American, we split it

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.760
and half the poets in
the ceiling are European

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.740
and half of them are Americans.

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:27.410 position:56%
And that's the only way I think that
Walt Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe got

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:31.940 position:56%
into that ceiling because they were
not popular authors among the people

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:36.630
who built the Library of Congress,
and in that part of our culture.

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:40.730
Then we'll be in the Member's Room
and it's an inspirational room

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:42.490
for an inspirational day.

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:44.810
I congratulate the winners.

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:48.700
I'm so proud of the Library,
the Center for the Book,

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:53.660
for bringing this and combining
with you for this wonderful day.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:58.220
And please let's enjoy ourselves
pretending like for a half a --

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.520
a couple -- an hour we're
members of Congress.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.820
Thanks so much.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.620
It's been a wonderful day.

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:15.160
