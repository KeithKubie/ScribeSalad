00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.320
Despite her future successes, Nancy Wake had
humble beginnings.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.129
She was born in Wellington, New Zealand in
1912, but her family moved to Sydney, Australia

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.490
when she was almost two and she grew up there.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.460
A Maori midwife delivered her and, at the
time of her birth, allegedly pointed at a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.860
fold of skin on her head and said, “’This
is what we call a kahu, and it means your

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.700
baby will always be lucky.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.390
Wherever she goes, whatever she does, the
gods will look after her.”

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.390
Her childhood didn’t appear to be very lucky.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.640
When she was four, just a few short years
after the move to Sydney, her father left

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.680
on a trip to the United States and never returned.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.030
This left her frazzled mother to look after
six children, of whom Wake was the youngest.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.940
She was constantly butting heads with her
mother and, at the age of sixteen, she left

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.450
home to work as a nurse.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.080
She might have continued working independently
in Sydney had it not been for the unexpected

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.489
inheritance of £200 (about £11,500 today)
from her aunt which allowed her to seek out

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.489
adventure.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.640
Arriving in London in 1932, she started a
course in journalism.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.000
Her new career took her to Paris, where she
lived for a year reporting on the situation

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.200
in Europe as well as the rise of Nazism.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.240
However, she had time for fun, too, and took
full advantage of Parisian nightlife.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.610
Soon, the girl from humble beginnings had
charmed Henri Fiocca, a French millionaire.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.350
They married shortly after the start of World
War II and she moved into his mansion in Marseilles.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.759
Wake was a working woman, however, and despised
the Nazis.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.009
She could not abide sitting back while they
marched into France.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.099
As such, she joined up with the local Resistance
movement, acting as a courier.

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:42.679
She became an invaluable part of the Resistance
movement, carrying important messages from

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.280
one resistance group to another.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.240
It took the Nazis a while to figure out they
were being duped by a beautiful, outwardly

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.869
flirtatious woman, but when they did, they
hunted her fiercely, eventually even putting

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.590
a 5 million franc bounty on her head.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920
However, the Gestapo wasn’t able to catch
Wake.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.350
Whenever they seemingly had her cornered,
she managed to slip away unnoticed.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.719
Because of this, they called her “the White
Mouse.”

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.209
She was very nearly captured once, in an incident
that saw bullets whistling past her ears,

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.770
but she managed to make it over the Pyrenees
by herself, once again evading capture.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.030
Talking about her close calls, she said, “I
never had time to worry.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.250
And I have to admit, though some people won’t
believe me, I was never afraid.”

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.200
From Spain she made her way to Britain, where
she trained for sixteen weeks with the Special

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.970
Operations Executive.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.640
At the end of this intense training, she was
something of an expert in explosives, hand-to-hand

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.530
combat, and weaponry.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.530
She was ready for her first mission: to assess
resistance groups in France and let London

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.200
know what each group needed in terms of munitions.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.210
We all know that war was largely a “man’s”
game back then, though, and despite parachuting

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.340
into the forests of l’Auvergne to carry
out her duties, she was met with many resistance

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.780
fighters who couldn’t believe that Britain
had sent in a woman for this job.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.920
They refused to treat her with respect—that
is, until she challenged the leaders to drinking

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.400
contests which she nearly always won (in true
Australian form.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.550
Later, she mentioned that she liked to consume
at least six gin and tonics a day).

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.010
In doing so, she was able to take some 7000
resistance partisans under her wing.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.010
When D-Day arrived, Wake commanded her “troops,”
organizing them to fight against the German

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.220
soldiers rushing to reinforce their fellows
at Normandy.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.470
She and the resistance fighters blew up bridges
and wrecked trains, narrowly escaping capture.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.430
As if all of that wasn’t enough, Wake also
killed a German sentry with her bare hands

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.380
to prevent him from alerting the rest of the
men that an attack was in full swing.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.180
Later, they liberated Vichy which had been
in the hands of collaborationists.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.260
It soon became clear that the Allies were
going to win the war.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.750
Allowed into a recently liberated Paris, Wake
and her friends found themselves at the British

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.780
Officers Club acting a bit rowdy.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.030
The waiter serving them boldly proclaimed
that he would rather be serving German soldiers

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.950
than put up with them for another moment.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.670
An angry Wake told him exactly how she felt
by “knocking him senseless with a right-hook.”

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.240
A fellow waiter came running with a shot of
brandy to revive the poor man.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.670
Nancy grabbed the shot instead, drained it,
and said “Merci” before walking out the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.670
door.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.300
After the war, Wake was decorated with medals
from the United States, Britain, and France.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.920
It was sixty years before she would be granted
medals from her native Australia and New Zealand

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.630
because she hadn’t served with the Australian
forces during the war.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.650
In subsequent years, she was offered Australian
medals but systematically refused them.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.669
At one point, she said,

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.789
‘The last time there was a suggestion of
giving me [an Australian medal], I told the

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.470
government they could stick their medals where
the monkey stuck his nuts.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.129
The thing is if they gave me a medal now,
it wouldn’t be given with love so I don’t

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.389
want anything from them.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.699
They can bugger off!

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.819
However, Australia did eventually make her
a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2004;

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.110
in 2006, she was granted an RSA Badge in Gold
from New Zealand.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.550
It wasn’t until the war ended that she learned
her husband, Henri, had been captured by the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.810
Gestapo in 1943.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.719
He was grilled about her whereabouts but refused
to say anything that might lead them to her.

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.319
He also refused to say anything about her
activities.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.449
For his attempt to save her, he was executed.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.449
Wake always blamed herself for his death,
adding that “Henri was the love of my life.”

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.490
In her later years, she returned to Sydney
with her second husband, RAF pilot and former

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.360
prisoner of war John Forward.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.460
She tried several times to run for politics
with the Liberal Party of Australia, but was

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.500
never elected.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.380
Nevertheless, she and her husband were quite
happy, living together in Sydney until he

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.580
died in 1997.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.710
In 2001, at the age of 89, she packed up and
moved back to London.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.169
Wake suffered a heart attack in 2003, but
she kept on fighting until 2011 when, at the

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.289
age of 98, she passed away following a chest
infection.

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.509
She lived to see her story memorialized in
books, TV, and movies.

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.169
The character of Charlotte Gray in the book
by the same name by Sebastian Faulks, which

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.629
was later turned into a movie with the title
character played by Cate Blanchette, is based

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.430
on the exploits of Nancy Wake and other female
operatives during World War II.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.319
After her death, Wake was cremated and her
ashes were scattered in France near the mountains

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:07.740
where she fought with 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.130
the Resistance.
