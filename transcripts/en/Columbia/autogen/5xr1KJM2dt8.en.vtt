by the conservator and given multiple
 

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.040
by the conservator and given multiple
linings this is important because of

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.050

painting on fragile silk such as this

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:48.940
painting on fragile silk such as this
 

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.420
painting on fragile silk such as this
one always will remain sensitive to

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:51.430
one always will remain sensitive to
 

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:54.180
one always will remain sensitive to
changes in humidity so that the humidity

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:54.190
changes in humidity so that the humidity
 

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:56.849
changes in humidity so that the humidity
is very dry it can contract with too

00:53:56.849 --> 00:53:56.859
is very dry it can contract with too
 

00:53:56.859 --> 00:53:58.620
is very dry it can contract with too
much humidity of expense and this could

00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:58.630
much humidity of expense and this could
 

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:01.670
much humidity of expense and this could
even cost tearing or very serious damage

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680
even cost tearing or very serious damage
 

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.230
even cost tearing or very serious damage
so the multiple linings that the

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240
so the multiple linings that the
 

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.450
so the multiple linings that the
conservator applied will help it to

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:06.460
conservator applied will help it to
 

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.220
conservator applied will help it to
withstand fluctuations as much as

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:08.230
withstand fluctuations as much as
 

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:09.190

so that's that we're seeing it before

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:11.690
so that's that we're seeing it before
 

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:14.410
so that's that we're seeing it before
application to the panel here so after

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:14.420
application to the panel here so after
 

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.089
application to the panel here so after
the stage that we're seeing this is a

00:54:16.089 --> 00:54:16.099
the stage that we're seeing this is a
 

00:54:16.099 --> 00:54:18.970
the stage that we're seeing this is a
during treatment photograph after this

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:18.980
during treatment photograph after this
 

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.039
during treatment photograph after this
new silk quarters needed to be applied

00:54:21.039 --> 00:54:21.049
new silk quarters needed to be applied
 

00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:23.079
new silk quarters needed to be applied
and then the painting could be adhered

00:54:23.079 --> 00:54:23.089
and then the painting could be adhered
 

00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:24.670
and then the painting could be adhered
to the panel that I've just described

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680
to the panel that I've just described
 

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:31.950

so wonderfully talked about in ensuring
 

00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:48.440
so wonderfully talked about in ensuring
the in painting and how much you want to

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:48.450
the in painting and how much you want to
 

00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:50.510

cover and how much you want to show when

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520

viewers see this

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:52.110
viewers see this
 

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:54.410
viewers see this
what kind of work has been done and then

what kind of work has been done and then
 

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.960

we're often not trained to think about
 

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.420
we're often not trained to think about
the mounting because it's not really

it's only when you go to museums we've

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660
it's only when you go to museums we've
 

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.690
it's only when you go to museums we've
seen their exhibitions that they're

mounting in the frame becomes much more
 

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.590

or in the books that you look at

frame and then the opportunity is often
 

01:00:58.359 --> 01:01:01.440
frame and then the opportunity is often
excluded which makes it then harder to

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:01.450
excluded which makes it then harder to
 

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.809
excluded which makes it then harder to
sort of decide what you want to do and

01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:03.819
sort of decide what you want to do and
 

01:01:03.819 --> 01:01:05.160
sort of decide what you want to do and
so then going back and doing the

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:05.170
so then going back and doing the
 

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:07.289
so then going back and doing the
research and thinking about the

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:07.299
research and thinking about the
 

01:01:07.299 --> 01:01:10.470
research and thinking about the
paintings again the one image that I

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480
paintings again the one image that I
 

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.849
paintings again the one image that I
found on live from the southern

01:01:11.849 --> 01:01:11.859

friends and devices so I don't actually

01:01:19.079 --> 01:01:19.089
friends and devices so I don't actually
 

01:01:19.089 --> 01:01:22.079
friends and devices so I don't actually
you know what it's its current frame and

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:22.089
you know what it's its current frame and
 

01:01:22.089 --> 01:01:24.059
you know what it's its current frame and
mountain looks like and this one that's

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:24.069
mountain looks like and this one that's
 

01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:27.150

in Korea isn't it going on home museum

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160
in Korea isn't it going on home museum
 

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.120
in Korea isn't it going on home museum
and this is in amount some sort of

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:30.130
and this is in amount some sort of
 

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:31.980
and this is in amount some sort of
mounting with the frame so that gives us

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:31.990
mounting with the frame so that gives us
 

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:34.260
mounting with the frame so that gives us
a better clue and types of mounting

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:34.270
a better clue and types of mounting
 

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:36.079
a better clue and types of mounting
techniques that are used for his works

01:01:36.079 --> 01:01:36.089
techniques that are used for his works
 

01:01:36.089 --> 01:01:38.730
techniques that are used for his works
and then I thought we can do a little

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:38.740
and then I thought we can do a little
 

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.410
and then I thought we can do a little
bit of thought process the thought

01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:40.420
bit of thought process the thought
 

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.230
bit of thought process the thought
experiment because this painting was

01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240
experiment because this painting was
 

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.279
experiment because this painting was
painted in 1934 in Kuwait on in 1924

01:01:47.279 --> 01:01:47.289
painted in 1934 in Kuwait on in 1924
 

01:01:47.289 --> 01:01:49.230
painted in 1934 in Kuwait on in 1924
although he's the first painter to have

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240
although he's the first painter to have
 

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.000
although he's the first painter to have
been trained in western painting

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:51.010
been trained in western painting
 

01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:54.630
been trained in western painting
techniques and oils in 1925 he decides

01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640
techniques and oils in 1925 he decides
 

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.279
techniques and oils in 1925 he decides
that when it comes back to Korea in this

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:56.289
that when it comes back to Korea in this
 

01:01:56.289 --> 01:01:58.859
that when it comes back to Korea in this
in Korea that he wants to now only paint

01:01:58.859 --> 01:01:58.869
in Korea that he wants to now only paint
 

01:01:58.869 --> 01:02:02.809
in Korea that he wants to now only paint
with traditional inks and we sort of

01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819
with traditional inks and we sort of
 

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:06.059
with traditional inks and we sort of
abandoned his Western oil painting kind

01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:06.069
abandoned his Western oil painting kind
 

01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:08.069
abandoned his Western oil painting kind
of materials and with that then you can

01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079
of materials and with that then you can
 

01:02:08.079 --> 01:02:11.190
of materials and with that then you can
think oh is a traditional mounting more

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200
think oh is a traditional mounting more
 

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.319
think oh is a traditional mounting more
appropriate for this type of painting

01:02:13.319 --> 01:02:13.329
appropriate for this type of painting
 

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.730
appropriate for this type of painting
and so this is sort of the thought

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:14.740
and so this is sort of the thought
 

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.380
and so this is sort of the thought
experiment that I'm showing here is that

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:16.390
experiment that I'm showing here is that
 

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:18.870
experiment that I'm showing here is that
I just superimpose the koi don't

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880
I just superimpose the koi don't
 

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.700
I just superimpose the koi don't
painting in what would be more of a

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:20.710
painting in what would be more of a
 

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:22.890
painting in what would be more of a
traditional mounting style for st.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:22.900
traditional mounting style for st.
 

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.930
traditional mounting style for st.
Vincent's chosen period painting and you

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:24.940
Vincent's chosen period painting and you
 

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.700
Vincent's chosen period painting and you
can see how very different the

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:26.710
can see how very different the
 

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.890
can see how very different the
experience would be if they're mounting

01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:28.900
experience would be if they're mounting
 

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.720
experience would be if they're mounting
this this way versus the what we see

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:30.730
this this way versus the what we see
 

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.210
this this way versus the what we see
right here so you do see how the frame

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:33.220
right here so you do see how the frame
 

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:36.000
right here so you do see how the frame
really affects the way people view and

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:36.010
really affects the way people view and
 

01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:36.600
really affects the way people view and
interact

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:36.610

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:39.600
interact
objects and then but me in the end

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:39.610
objects and then but me in the end
 

01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:42.540
objects and then but me in the end
decided to keep I shouldn't even have

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:42.550
decided to keep I shouldn't even have
 

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.830
decided to keep I shouldn't even have
this picture I should just keep on

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:43.840
this picture I should just keep on
 

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.630
this picture I should just keep on
pointing obviously the bedroom this is

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640
pointing obviously the bedroom this is
 

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.150
pointing obviously the bedroom this is
not the reproduction and one of the

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.160
not the reproduction and one of the
 

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.220
not the reproduction and one of the
reasons behind me decided to keep it in

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:53.230
reasons behind me decided to keep it in
 

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:56.010
reasons behind me decided to keep it in
this thing the same style of framing and

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:56.020
this thing the same style of framing and
 

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.920
this thing the same style of framing and
mounting that that it was in before is

01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:58.930
mounting that that it was in before is
 

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:01.260
mounting that that it was in before is
because we've found the record that had

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:01.270
because we've found the record that had
 

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:03.780
because we've found the record that had
come into the collection in the 1930s so

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:03.790
come into the collection in the 1930s so
 

01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:07.020
come into the collection in the 1930s so
this older style excuse me that the the

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:07.030
this older style excuse me that the the
 

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.180
this older style excuse me that the the
original frame and the mountain was

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:09.190
original frame and the mountain was
 

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:11.580
original frame and the mountain was
therefore age-appropriate or heiress

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:11.590
therefore age-appropriate or heiress
 

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:15.560
therefore age-appropriate or heiress
appropriate because we knew that it was

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:15.570
appropriate because we knew that it was
 

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.720
appropriate because we knew that it was
maybe not from 1934 but it was actually

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:18.730
maybe not from 1934 but it was actually
 

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:21.030
maybe not from 1934 but it was actually
from the 30s so this really reflects the

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:21.040
from the 30s so this really reflects the
 

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.300
from the 30s so this really reflects the
framing styles of that period so we

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:24.310
framing styles of that period so we
 

01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:25.500
framing styles of that period so we
thought instead of trying to do

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:25.510
thought instead of trying to do
 

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.360
thought instead of trying to do
something maybe that would be completely

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:27.370
something maybe that would be completely
 

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.790
something maybe that would be completely
might be beautiful but not actually

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:29.800

accurate we decided to keep with the
 

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.370
accurate we decided to keep with the
mounting and the frame and then if you

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:35.380
mounting and the frame and then if you
 

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.470
mounting and the frame and then if you
do look back at some of these older this

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480
do look back at some of these older this
 

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.840
do look back at some of these older this
is these are some newspapers of the

exhibitions like Professor Kim had had
 

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:49.590
exhibitions like Professor Kim had had
shown and you do see that their frames

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:49.600
shown and you do see that their frames
 

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.840
shown and you do see that their frames
were you so it wasn't that during this

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:51.850
were you so it wasn't that during this
 

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:52.410
were you so it wasn't that during this
time period

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:52.420
time period
 

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.000
time period
obviously this frames weren't using

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:54.010

there's only this traditional style so
it gives us in hanging these time

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:58.810
it gives us in hanging these time
 

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:01.200
it gives us in hanging these time

about color so now we have to make
 

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:19.380
about color so now we have to make
choices about what kinds of colors would

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:19.390
choices about what kinds of colors would
 

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.530
choices about what kinds of colors would
be appropriate and therefore it makes me

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:22.540
be appropriate and therefore it makes me
 

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:23.850
be appropriate and therefore it makes me
think about not only do have to be

that might not be appropriate and
 

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:53.010
that might not be appropriate and
suitable for actually the current state

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:28.560
brought the tone down a little bit so
that it would actually be a better sort

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:28.570
that it would actually be a better sort

as brilliant with that
 

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.750
as brilliant with that
because it's a better appearing for the

because it's a better appearing for the
 

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.460
because it's a better appearing for the
current state at me so they didn't have

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:43.470

now and and so that was the reasons
 

01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:58.550
now and and so that was the reasons
behind what has now become this

01:05:58.550 --> 01:05:58.560

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800
as I said this is the only dated from
 

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.740
as I said this is the only dated from
1930s and so he kind of shows I think

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.410
it

01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:11.420
it
 

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.620
it
you talk we mentioned these words

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:13.630
you talk we mentioned these words
 

01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:25.330
you talk we mentioned these words
repetition

01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:25.340
 

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:40.979
okay I when I meant Dido

01:15:40.979 --> 01:15:40.989
 

01:15:40.989 --> 01:16:34.320
so I applied the theory

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:34.330
 

01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:36.300
if you have additional questions we can

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:36.310
if you have additional questions we can
 

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:37.920
if you have additional questions we can
certainly you can ask them at the

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:37.930
certainly you can ask them at the
 

01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:54.370
certainly you can ask them at the
reception

01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:54.380
 

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.460
it usually occur according to the travel

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:57.470
it usually occur according to the travel
 

01:16:57.470 --> 01:17:02.080
it usually occur according to the travel
journeys you mean in 1930s or during the

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:02.090
journeys you mean in 1930s or during the
 

01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:27.959
journeys you mean in 1930s or during the
Chosun dynasty

01:17:27.959 --> 01:17:27.969
 

01:17:27.969 --> 01:17:33.090
so they can office tornado garment and

01:17:33.090 --> 01:17:33.100
so they can office tornado garment and
 

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:40.839
so they can office tornado garment and
stations this way as you can

01:17:40.839 --> 01:17:40.849
stations this way as you can
 

01:17:40.849 --> 01:17:43.419
stations this way as you can
so there is like not one way of the

01:17:43.419 --> 01:17:43.429
so there is like not one way of the
 

01:17:43.429 --> 01:17:46.300
so there is like not one way of the
point but you can take up making gun

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:46.310
point but you can take up making gun
 

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:49.120
point but you can take up making gun
around to our Beckenbauer kingdom so
