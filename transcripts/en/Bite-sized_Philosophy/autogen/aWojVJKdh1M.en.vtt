they sold these things and I don't think
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410
they sold these things and I don't think
they'd changed the style since 1890 and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
they'd changed the style since 1890 and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.740
these monsters so we went outside the
gym through some doors like school doors

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
gym through some doors like school doors
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.380

we went outside the gym into the
 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.670
we went outside the gym into the
exercise yard I guess and we were

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
exercise yard I guess and we were
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.080

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.070
wandering along and he was talking to me
and he seemed like it kind of an

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080
and he seemed like it kind of an
 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.290
and he seemed like it kind of an
innocuous guy and then the psychologist

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
innocuous guy and then the psychologist
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.730
innocuous guy and then the psychologist

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.890
back and so which was kind of a relief
and so I went into his office and he

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900

was so interesting was that he was so
 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.900
was so interesting was that he was so
innocuous right because what you'd hope

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910
innocuous right because what you'd hope
 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.430
innocuous right because what you'd hope
is that someone like that would be very

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
is that someone like that would be very
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.760
is that someone like that would be very
much unlike you let's say and certainly

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770
much unlike you let's say and certainly
 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.560
much unlike you let's say and certainly
wouldn't be like someone innocuous that

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570
wouldn't be like someone innocuous that
 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.390
wouldn't be like someone innocuous that
you'd met what you'd want is that the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400
you'd met what you'd want is that the
 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.070
you'd met what you'd want is that the
guy would be like you know half were

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
guy would be like you know half were
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.960
guy would be like you know half were
wolf and half vampire so you could just

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970
wolf and half vampire so you could just
 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.280
wolf and half vampire so you could just
tell right away that he was a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
tell right away that he was a
 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.470
tell right away that he was a
cold-blooded killer but no he was this

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
cold-blooded killer but no he was this
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.800
cold-blooded killer but no he was this
sort of ineffectual little guy who was

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810
sort of ineffectual little guy who was
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.360
sort of ineffectual little guy who was
certainly not ineffectual if you gave

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
certainly not ineffectual if you gave
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.020
certainly not ineffectual if you gave
him a revolver in the upper hand and so

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030
him a revolver in the upper hand and so
 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.850
him a revolver in the upper hand and so
so that made me think that made me think

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860
so that made me think that made me think
 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.890
so that made me think that made me think
a lot about the relationship between

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
a lot about the relationship between
 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.590
a lot about the relationship between
being innocuous and and being dangerous

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600
being innocuous and and being dangerous
 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.210
being innocuous and and being dangerous
and then another thing happened I met

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
and then another thing happened I met
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.970
and then another thing happened I met
another guy out there and then a week or

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980
another guy out there and then a week or
 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.890
another guy out there and then a week or
two later I heard that he and a friend

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900
two later I heard that he and a friend
 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.550
two later I heard that he and a friend
of his had held another guy down and

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560
of his had held another guy down and
 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.770
of his had held another guy down and
pulverized his left leg with a lead pipe

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780
pulverized his left leg with a lead pipe
 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.610
pulverized his left leg with a lead pipe
like just pulverized it and the reason

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620
like just pulverized it and the reason
 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.840
like just pulverized it and the reason
for that was that they thought that he

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850
for that was that they thought that he
 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.260
for that was that they thought that he
was a snitch and maybe he was and at

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270
was a snitch and maybe he was and at
 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.790
was a snitch and maybe he was and at
that time I did something different

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800
that time I did something different
 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.710
that time I did something different
instead of being shocked and horrified

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720
instead of being shocked and horrified
 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.510
instead of being shocked and horrified
by that although I certainly was I

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520
by that although I certainly was I
 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.420
by that although I certainly was I
thought how in the world could you do

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430
thought how in the world could you do
 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.860
thought how in the world could you do
that because I didn't think I could do

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
that because I didn't think I could do
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.260
that because I didn't think I could do
that I didn't think that I thought that

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270
that I didn't think that I thought that
 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.610
that I didn't think that I thought that
there was a qualitative distinction

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
there was a qualitative distinction
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.240
there was a qualitative distinction
between me and those people and so I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250
between me and those people and so I
 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.550
between me and those people and so I
spent about two weeks trying to see if I

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
spent about two weeks trying to see if I
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.910
spent about two weeks trying to see if I
could figure out under what conditions I

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920
could figure out under what conditions I
 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.740
could figure out under what conditions I
could do that like what kind of

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750
could do that like what kind of
 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.479
could do that like what kind of
psychological transformation I would

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489
psychological transformation I would
 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.340
psychological transformation I would
have to undergo to be able to do that

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350
have to undergo to be able to do that
 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.680
have to undergo to be able to do that
and so that was a meditative exercise

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690
and so that was a meditative exercise
 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.900
and so that was a meditative exercise
let's say and it only took about ten

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910
let's say and it only took about ten
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.469
let's say and it only took about ten
days

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479
days
 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.930
days
for me to realize that not only could I

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940
for me to realize that not only could I
 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.340
for me to realize that not only could I
do that that it would be a hell of a lot

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350
do that that it would be a hell of a lot
 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.840
do that that it would be a hell of a lot
easier than I thought it would be and

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850
easier than I thought it would be and
 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.820
easier than I thought it would be and
that's sort of where that wall between

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830
that's sort of where that wall between
 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.559
that's sort of where that wall between
me and what Jung described as the shadow

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569
me and what Jung described as the shadow
 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.189
me and what Jung described as the shadow
started to fall apart and that also was

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199
started to fall apart and that also was
 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.409
started to fall apart and that also was
very useful because I started to wreck I

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419
very useful because I started to wreck I
 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.719
very useful because I started to wreck I
started to treat myself as somewhat

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729
started to treat myself as somewhat
 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.400
started to treat myself as somewhat
different entity because I hadn't been

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410
different entity because I hadn't been
 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.290
different entity because I hadn't been
aware up to that point you know cuz I

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300
aware up to that point you know cuz I
 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.330
aware up to that point you know cuz I
thought I was a good guy and there's no

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340
thought I was a good guy and there's no
 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.920
thought I was a good guy and there's no
reason for me to think that because

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930
reason for me to think that because
 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.180
reason for me to think that because
you're not a good guy unless you've

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190
you're not a good guy unless you've
 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.740
you're not a good guy unless you've
really made a bloody effort to be a good

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750
really made a bloody effort to be a good
 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.129
really made a bloody effort to be a good
guy

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139
guy
 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.589
guy
you're just not it's not easy and so

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599
you're just not it's not easy and so
 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.990
you're just not it's not easy and so
you're probably a moderately bad guy and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000
you're probably a moderately bad guy and
 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.210
you're probably a moderately bad guy and
that's a long ways from being an

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220
that's a long ways from being an
 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.790
that's a long ways from being an
absolutely horrible guy but it's also a

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800
absolutely horrible guy but it's also a
 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.680
absolutely horrible guy but it's also a
long ways from being a good guy and so

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690
long ways from being a good guy and so
 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.360
long ways from being a good guy and so
but I had a little more respect for

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370
but I had a little more respect for
 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.010
but I had a little more respect for
myself after that because I also

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020
myself after that because I also
 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.279
myself after that because I also
understood that there was a monstrous

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289
understood that there was a monstrous
 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.520
understood that there was a monstrous
element to the human psyche that that

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530
element to the human psyche that that
 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.879
element to the human psyche that that
you needed to respect and that was part

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889
you needed to respect and that was part
 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.680
you needed to respect and that was part
of you that you should regard yourself

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690
of you that you should regard yourself
 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.600
of you that you should regard yourself
in some sense as a loaded weapon it's

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610
in some sense as a loaded weapon it's
 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.670
in some sense as a loaded weapon it's
very useful around children to regard

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680
very useful around children to regard
 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.170
very useful around children to regard
yourself as a loaded weapon because

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180
yourself as a loaded weapon because
 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.610
yourself as a loaded weapon because
around children you are a loaded weapon

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620
around children you are a loaded weapon
 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.999
around children you are a loaded weapon
and the terrible experiences that many

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009
and the terrible experiences that many
 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.409
and the terrible experiences that many
children have with their parents are

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419
children have with their parents are
 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.050
children have with their parents are
testament to that
