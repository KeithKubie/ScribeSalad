00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.260
People claim aphrodisiacs come in a variety
of colors and flavors… or DO THEY?!

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.960
How you doin', I'm Trace.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.130
This is DNews.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.130
The idea of an aphrodisiac has been tantalizing
the human imagination for hundreds of years:

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.779
Cobra blood, Tiger penis, components of whale
vomit -- we’ll try pretty much anything

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.340
in search of just the right sexy substance
to turn us on.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.710
Unfortunately, even after centuries of trying,
there’s no compelling evidence that any

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.050
of them could be responsible for more than
just placebo effect.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.850
By definition, an aphrodisiac is something
-- often thought to be a food or drug -- that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.850
raises libido or sexual desire.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.020
The creation of desire by consuming something
makes it sound like a love potion, right?

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.770
Arousal, desire, and motivation for sex are
the result of a complicated chemical system

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.170
composed of many parts.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.719
So being “turned on” means that something
or someone activated the right balance of

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.590
brain chemicals to drive sexual desire -- that’s
not easy to do with a food, potion, or pill.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.380
According to the FDA, there are is no such
thing as an aphrodisiac drug.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.880
In fact, earlier this year they released a
document that stated “Labeling claims for

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.149
aphrodisiacs for [over the counter] use are
either false, misleading, or unsupported by

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.340
scientific data.”

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.389
The best we can do are prescription drugs
like Viagra and Addyi, which are used for

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:25.840
the treatment of sexual dysfunction.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.389
But the studies show that while viagra can
be effective for patients who are experiencing

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:34.569
sexual problems, it doesn’t produce sexy
feelings in people who don't have a problem

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:35.569
getting it up.

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:36.819
Aphrodisiac, it ain't.

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.380
And for women, who are often ignored in academic
studies of sexual behavior, there’s no data

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.859
on non-prescription use of these drugs at
all.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.369
But outside of the pharmaceutical realm, what
about household or street items claiming to

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.310
make me wanna leave the one I'm with, and
start a new thing with you…

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.899
Science ruins the mood there as well.

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.950
In fact, a review in Pharmacognosy Review
concludes that none of the many dozens of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.789
herbal so-called aphrodisiacs used in Eastern
and tribal medicines are 100-percent safe

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.499
to use, nor proven to work in humans.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.459
Another study in Sexual Medicine Reviews of
more common aphrodisiacs for Western cultures

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.269
was similarly unmoved.

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.269
Chocolate?

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.269
Nope.

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.030
It's correlated with increases in serotonin,
but not connected to libido.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.030
Oysters?

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.030
Nah.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.519
They have zinc, which is good for producing
testosterone, but don't increase libido.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.519
Honey?

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.969
There are no studies on its successful effects
-- and 'Mad Honey' found in Eastern Europe

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.909
and the Middle East can cause a tingle in
the vagina, but that's just a toxin called

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.170
grayanotoxin, which can cause heart issues.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.970
Tingles are not equal to libido.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.970
Spanish Fly?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.260
It causes irritation of the urethra -- the
tube inside the penis, because Spanish Fly

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.220
comes from ground up blister beetles, which
literally cause blisters.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.819
The blisters are thanks to another toxin called
cantharidin… also not libido, more like…

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.819
viagra.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.370
It might give men an erection, but erections
aren't equal true arousal or desire.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.859
There are many, many studies on these substances,
but each comes back with words like, "promising"

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.249
or simply call out the failure of safety,
or rigorous scientific controls.

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.870
In the end there is no evidence to support
the effectiveness of chemical aphrodisiacs

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.120
or sexy foods, but when it comes to sex…
that doesn't actually matter!

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.700
There may still be a scientific reason you
feel turned on after, for instance, eating

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.079
oysters: there is scientific evidence that
visual stimuli can have a powerful effect

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.310
on sexual arousal.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.190
So, a snack of oysters or bananas which physically
resemble sexual organs may be enough to do

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.190
the trick.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.090
Or visiting a Georgia O'Keefe gallery?

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.750
On top of that, there's of course the placebo
effect, one of our favorite things… like,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.319
in some cases, sexual desire is connected
to social status … which is why it's not

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.200
a surprise that rich people are thought of
as more attractive.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.170
But status can also be connected to something
like oysters, which are pricey, or hard-to-obtain

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.980
exotic material like penises of endangered
animals or Spanish fly… meaning, simply

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.150
thinking some substance is rare might make
you feel a certain way and you get all hot

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.150
and bothered.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.060
The mind, apparently, is the only known aphrodisiac.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.799
We would like to thank our sponsor Kay Jewelers
for helping us make this episode.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.329
For 100 years, every kiss begins with Kay.

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.549
And look, if you really want to increase sexual
desire… maybe you should just go dance.

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.550
Quit being such a downer and get on the dance
floor!

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.270
Science says it helps and here's why.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.490
What do you think about aphrodisiacs?
