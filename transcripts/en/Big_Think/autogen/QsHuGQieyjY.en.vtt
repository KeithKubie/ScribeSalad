cheaper and cheaper it means that within
a 10 year period of time it means that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
a 10 year period of time it means that
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.009
a 10 year period of time it means that
that genomics will cost maybe just about

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019
that genomics will cost maybe just about
 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.590

a thousand dollars and that will be the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
a thousand dollars and that will be the
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.349

that we'll be able to scan millions of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
that we'll be able to scan millions of
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.139
that we'll be able to scan millions of
genomes with a computer and that can

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
genomes with a computer and that can
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.919

create a revolution in how we

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929
create a revolution in how we
 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.020
create a revolution in how we
numerically analyze genes for example

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

let's say we have a million old people

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369
let's say we have a million old people
 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.969
let's say we have a million old people
and a million young people we sequence

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
and a million young people we sequence
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.920
and a million young people we sequence
the genes of old people we sequence the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
the genes of old people we sequence the
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.240
the genes of old people we sequence the
genes of young people because all of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
genes of young people because all of
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.900
genes of young people because all of
them have a cd-rom and we subtract that

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910
them have a cd-rom and we subtract that
 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.900
them have a cd-rom and we subtract that
allows you to isolate where aging takes

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910
allows you to isolate where aging takes
 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.450
allows you to isolate where aging takes
place specifically which genes are

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
place specifically which genes are
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.750
place specifically which genes are
damaged in the aging process think of a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760
damaged in the aging process think of a
 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.450
damaged in the aging process think of a
car where it is aging take place in a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
car where it is aging take place in a
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.660
car where it is aging take place in a
car well the engine why because that's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
car well the engine why because that's
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.580
car well the engine why because that's
where combustion takes place that's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
where combustion takes place that's
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.280
where combustion takes place that's
where we have the gum of a depositing

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
where we have the gum of a depositing
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.370
where we have the gum of a depositing
and soot buildup in the engine because

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
and soot buildup in the engine because
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.260
and soot buildup in the engine because
that's where oxidation takes place well

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
that's where oxidation takes place well
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.760
that's where oxidation takes place well
where does oxidation take place in a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
where does oxidation take place in a
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.610
where does oxidation take place in a
cell the mitochondria the mitochondria

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620
cell the mitochondria the mitochondria
 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.500
cell the mitochondria the mitochondria
is the engine of the cell so we now know

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510
is the engine of the cell so we now know
 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.380
is the engine of the cell so we now know
where ageing takes place and by scanning

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
where ageing takes place and by scanning
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.970
where ageing takes place and by scanning
the genes we'll be able to look at the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980
the genes we'll be able to look at the
 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.830
the genes we'll be able to look at the
genes of the mitochondria and be able to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
genes of the mitochondria and be able to
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.570
genes of the mitochondria and be able to
repair some of those genes and that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580
repair some of those genes and that
 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.600
repair some of those genes and that
could open up a whole new realm of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
could open up a whole new realm of
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.840
could open up a whole new realm of
biology in other words biology will be

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
biology in other words biology will be
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.540
biology in other words biology will be
reduced to computer science

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550
