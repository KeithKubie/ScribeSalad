00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.390
 Let's say someone stops you on the street 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.150
 and says, "Decide fast! 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.520
 73 plus an empty space is 57. 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.170
 How much is the empty space? " 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.200
 There are several ways to find an answer. 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.840
 The empty place is actually what you need to add 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.620
 to 57 to get 73. 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.270
 This is the difference between 57 and 73. 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.620
 It can also: 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.890
 "Ok, let me start at 57." 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.940
 I will do so in my mind. 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.780
 I'll start with 57 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.450
 and I will add such numbers, 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.169
 that I get nice rounds until I get to 73. 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.820
 So I'll start with 57, I'll say, "Let me think. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.590
 I can easily get to 60 by adding 3. " 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.150
 That's how I get 60. 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.989
 And from 60 to 73 I can tell that I have to add 13. 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.250
 It is easy to think in mind. 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790
 Or I'll add 10 to get to 70. 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.820
 And then I'll add another 3. 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.720
 But I have already decided: 60 plus 13. 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.449
 Yes, this is 73. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.140
 Therefore, this whole thing is now 73. 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.700
 How much did I add to 57 to solve the problem? 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.350
 So 16. 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.660
 So, 16 plus 57 is equal to 73. 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.190
 But there are other ways to solve it. 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.300
 You can say, "Yes! 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.620
 The empty space is actually the difference between 73 and 57. " 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.460
 This can be written as 73 minus 57 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.259
 is equal to an empty space. 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.000
 This will give you the same value. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.900
 You will get 16. 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 There are many ways to calculate it. 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.290
 But that's the way I would try 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.970
 to deal with the task in my mind. 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.590
 Let's take a few more examples. 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.200
 This is very, very fun. 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.650
 So, say, someone 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.790
 they stop in the street 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.200
 and says, "Decide fast! 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.339
 94 minus blank space 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.870
 is equal to 57. " 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.990
 That means: "How much do I have to get out of 94, 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.660
 to get 57? " 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.420
 Okay, I'll decide the same way, 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.620
 as this time I will pull out, 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.350
 I will draw numbers with which 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.620
 is believed easily in the mind until he reaches 57. 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.400
 And that's exactly how I'll calculate it in my mind. 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.220
 I'll start from 94. 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.650
 And I'll get 4 to get to 90. 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.590
 So here is 90. 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.520
 Let's think. 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.400
 Then I'll get 20 to get 60. 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.720
 I do not want to get less than 57. 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.520
 So I'll get 20, 90 minus 20. 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.900
 No, I'll actually get 30 to get 60. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.290
 So I can get 30 now. 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.970
 So, 90 minus 30 will be 60. 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.790
 Then getting from 60 to 57 is quite easy. 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.769
 I just have to get another 3. 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.739
 60 minus 3 will be 57. 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.190
 And how much did I get out? 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.200
 I took 4, 30 and 3. 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.420
 Let's see now. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.950
 I took out ... 34, 37. 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.100
 I pulled out 37, right. 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.869
 But here's another way to solve. 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.850
 You can say, "Yes! 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.750
 37 is the difference between 94 and 57. " 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.390
 So, you can think about it. 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.600
 If I started 57, how much should I add, 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.940
 to get to 94? 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.200
 And you can apply exactly 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.210
 the method from the last task where ... 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.900
 Here I will add 3. 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.940
 If he adds 3, I'll get 60; then if I add 30, I'll get 90. 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.750
 And then, if I add 4 more, I'll get 94. 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.880
 So I added 37. 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.609
 Of course, there are other ways to solve this, 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.450
 especially if you have a handwriting sheet. 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.750
 But this is the way I will solve in my mind, 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.850
 if someone stops me in the street 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.370
 and asked me to solve these tasks. 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.910
 Now let's resolve one more. 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.549
 Let's solve another problem. 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.620
 Let's see where there is free space. 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.720
 So let's say someone asked, 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.600
 "We have the following: 36 equals an empty space 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.800
 minus 41. " 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.700
 So let's think, "It is given, 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.390
 that 36 is the difference 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.990
 between the empty space and 41. " 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.100
 And another way is to think that 36 plus 41 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.169
 will be equal to an empty space. 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.599
 You can apply this on the numerical axis. 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.390
 If it is not quite clear that 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.150
 these two expressions are the same, 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.940
 then draw a numeric axis here. 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.620
 And then it is given ... 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.200
 "We will start with an unknown number. 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.390
 We start with an unknown number. 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.650
 This is our empty place. 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.490
 We'll get 41. 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.970
 We take 41 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.140
 and we reach 36. " 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.200
 This is the same as saying: 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.940
 "If we start at 36 and we have to add 41, 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.620
 we will go back to our empty place here. " 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.190
 Then how much is 36 plus 41? Well, 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.000
 let us collect the units first. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 We have 6 units plus 1 unit. 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.620
 That's 7 units. 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.140
 And then we have 3 decades plus 4 tens, 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.610
 which is 7 decades, or 77. 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.810
 So that's 77. 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.350
 And we're ready.
