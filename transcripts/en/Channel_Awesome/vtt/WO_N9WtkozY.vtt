Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.260
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.240
I'm here in Oak Park, Illinois,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.840
where we are witnessing the largest gathering in Illinois, if not the United States,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.960
of Harry Potter fans, who have all gathered here together,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.960
to celebrate the release of the new Harry Potter book:

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.240
"Harry Potter and the Dorky Hallows".

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.180
Er-uh, "Deadly Hallows".

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.680
[Still wrong bro, it's "Deathly Hallows"]

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.520
Literally thousands of children, parents, and very lonely adults

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.500
have come out here to see

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.020
what J. K. Rowling has farted up this time.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.040
Harry:
Exactly.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.180
Now I know what you're thinking:

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.820
"How is this a nostalgic event?"

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
Well, when you think about it, there's actually a lot of nostalgia value here.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.360
Years from now, children are gonna be looking back at this cherished day

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.960
and be asking one question:

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.880
"Why did I wait hours in line for a book that I am most likely gonna sell at a garage sale?"

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.580
(“Double Trouble” from Prisoner of Azkaban plays):
♪Double, double, toil and trouble♪

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.220

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.720
Alright, so what exactly is your job here tonight?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.200
-Making sure that everyone's in the right line, in the right place,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.920
and that nobody's fighting over their spot.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.320
-Have any brawls, fights broken out yet?
-We’ve had some... arguments!

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.000
-No, I mean, you know, BRAWLS?
-No brawls, no fists! No, no fists.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.580
-You haven't had to break out the Harry bats?
-No, no, no Harry bats.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.640
Do you HAVE Harry bats?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.760
*laughs* I hope not!

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.980
*Double Trouble plays*

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.580
They actually have a Potter's Butter Beer.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.620
Because nothing celebrates the release of a children's book...

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580
...like getting plastered off your ass!

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.220
*Double Trouble continues*

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.120
This is Griff, this is a baby griffin.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.240
It's actually my daughter's...

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.840
NC: That's your daughter?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.100
Nononono, *laughs*, this is not my daughter.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.740
NC: Oh, okay! I was gonna say, 'cause the father musta... hahaha, yeah!

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.760
Well, uh... we won't go into that.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.280
Hagrid:
You’re meddlin’ in things that ought not to be meddled in!

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.560
NC: Does he bite at all?
-Oh, no, no. He’s young.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.280
NC: AGHAGHAGHAGH!! GET THE—

Everybody's dressed up here.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.780
I haven't seen so many wizards and fairies...

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.800
...since last year's Gay Pride Parade.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.460
Now, there's a rumor going around

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.000
that you're actually the son of Mary Poppins and Where's Waldo.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.620
What do you think about that?

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.540
Harry:
SHUT UP!

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.340
NC:
This is a very exciting stage production that they’re doing, it’s called, uh…

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.260
"Harry Potter and the Winding Up of the Electric Cord".

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.820
As you can see...

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.220
...he's a method actor.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800
Snape:
Fame isn’t everything.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.780
So I gotta ask you, um...

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.960
What poor sheep died to give you that beard?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.880
*thinks "this fricking guy"*

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.420
I have, uh, some Harry Potter Jelly Beans.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.240
The funny thing about Harry Potter Jelly Beans is that—I'm not kidding—

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.600
there's a vomit-flavored bean in here.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.460
Which I find kind of ironic, because really, eating ANY of these jelly beans

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.280
creates kind of a vomiting sensation.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.240
Hagrid:
Looks like he’s gonna be sick!

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.520
*retches*

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.840
Okay, what bathroom rug gave up its life to give you that beard?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.340
*thinks "don't make me kill you"*

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.180
Alright, so I'm here with the very first people in line for the Harry Potter book.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.920
Now, how long have you guys been here?

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.280
-Yeah.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.420
Hagrid:
Codswallop!

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.800
*laughter*

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.280
Gandalf! Thank God, look, these, uh, these Harry Potter people are a little WOOHOO!

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.460
How's it goin'? How's Frodo?

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.960
Gandalf:
Oh, he's doing very well, very well.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.300
How's him and Sam? How's the... you know?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.920
You saw the movie, come on! I mean, him and Sam were...

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.640
Gandalf:
He’s in the Grey Havens.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.760
Is that what they're calling it? The "Grey Havens"?
-Yeah, yeah.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.480
Gandalf:
One fantasy land to another fantasy land—

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.720
Did Gandalf wear glasses?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.080
Hagrid:
No more questions!

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.320
I have to admit, I admire you that, you know, you'd wait here for a whole...

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.620
thirteen minutes and everything...

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.660
NC: Scoot over, scoot over…
-I will KILL you!

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.640
...yeah, alright.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.080
First one to get the book!

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.660
NC: Is he gonna turn me into a toad?

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.200
Yeah, let's go before he shoots us.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.140
*Road Runner beeps, zooms off*

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.320
I'm here at the end of the line for the Harry Potter book...

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.180
these are the poor, unfortunate people who will most likely NOT get a book...

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.020
...because they are the last in line.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.220
But you're lucky, 'cause I have something very special for you:

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.460
These are, uh, Harry Potter CliffNotes.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.420
Now they usually go for about a thousand, but you know, I like you guys, you look very straightforward.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.500
So, um, I'll give them to you for, uh, two thousand...

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.420
...and, uh, your first-born child.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.240
Alright, alright, SECOND-born child.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.560
I'll take it.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.560
SUCKERS!

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.280
*Benny Hill theme*

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.220
Alright, so I'm here with the Mugglenet.com people, am I right?

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.820
You guys talk about all sorts of, uh, theories and conspiracy theories

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.860
about Harry Potter and so on, so forth, correct?
-Correct.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.800
Did Harry cause 9/11?

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.280
Is he responsible for the War in Iraq?

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.200
That means yes, that means yes.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.560
Harry caused the War in Iraq!

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.920
E-mail them—that address, right there—e-mail it to 'em, send angry letters!

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.900
I am? Wait, get a shot of his mouth.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.800
NC: *high-pitched* Harry caused the War in Iraq!

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.620
See? You heard it right here, you heard it right here!

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.800
Yeah, they're CliffNotes. You want 'em?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.740
I'll sell 'em to you for a thousand... pennies.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.360
Hagrid:
That’s top secret, that is.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.500
Well, it's about 10 minutes until the books are about to be released...

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.120
...let's go look at the lines!

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.600
♪Eye of newt and toe of frog♪

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.960
♪Wool of bat and tongue of dog♪

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.020
♪Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting♪

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.960
That was the line for the books that were NOT reserved.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.040
This is the line for the books that ARE.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:56.120
*Also sprach Zarathustra (2001 theme) plays*

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.540
It's like ten times longer! I mean, what the hell?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.180
It's RESERVED!

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.740
Isn't that the idea of reserving a book, so you don't HAVE to stand in line?

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.340
Is that some kind of, like, Hogwarts logic? I mean, it makes no sense!

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.460
I think it's because Americans are proud of waiting in line.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.640
I don't know why, we just get a sick thrill out of it.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.480
Standing in one spot is not hard.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.740
Anyone can do it. I can do it. Watch!

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.920
You see?

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.880

I shouldn’t have said that.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.000
Alright, it's two minutes to the Harry Potter book.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I don't know if there's anything, really, to be excited about.

*crowd cheers*

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.300
They seem to be excited. We'll just see how it goes.

I was just... vocalizing my disgust for the entire thing, it's just totally revolting, but uh...

Here it is, here's the copy! "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows".
