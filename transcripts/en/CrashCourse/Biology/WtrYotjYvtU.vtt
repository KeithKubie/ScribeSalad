00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.770
One of the coolest and
most important things

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.910
that our bodies do is maintain
this thing called homeostasis,

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.240
the regulation of a
stable internal environment,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.430
no matter where we are
or what we're doing.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.650
After all, we put our bodies
through a lot every single day:

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.860
We're always adding food
and liquid and chemicals,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.490
and we're constantly
changing temperature

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.789
and our levels of activity,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.929
but our bodies can roll with it.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.329
It's like, no big deal for them.

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.900
All of our organ systems have some
hand in maintaining homeostasis.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.130
I mean, it's basically the
thing that makes us not dead.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.599
But the excretory system,
aka the urinary system,

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.870
which includes the kidneys,
the ureters, the bladder,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.300
and the urethra, is the star
quarterback of the homeostasis team

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.059
That's because
your excretory system

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.350
is responsible for maintaining
the right levels of water

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
and dissolved substances
in your body.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.120
This is called osmoregulation,
and it's how our bodies

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.660
get rid of the stuff we don't
need, like the byproducts

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.609
of metabolizing food, while also
making sure we don't get dehydrated.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.219
It's the body's greatest balancing
act, and your body is doing

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.219
it right now, and all the time,
as long as you're not dead.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.829
As with other organ systems
we've talked about,

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.790
not all excretory systems in the
animal kingdom are created equal.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.799
Different animals excrete
waste different ways

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.240
based on their evolutionary history
what environments they live in,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.250
and what their hobbies
and interests are.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.860
These factors all influence
how an animal regulates water,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.439
and most metabolic waste
needs to be dissolved

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.350
in water in order to be excreted.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.229
The problem is, a main byproduct
of metabolizing food is ammonia,

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.259
which comes from breaking down
proteins, and it's pretty toxic.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.219
So, depending on how much water
is available to an animal

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.780
and how easy it is for the
animal to lug a bunch of water

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.600
around inside it, animals
convert this ammonia

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.530
into either urea or uric acid.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.630
Mammals like us, as well as
amphibians, and some marine animals

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.170
like sharks and sea turtles,
convert ammonia into urea,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.420
a compound made from combining
ammonia and carbon dioxide,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.689
in their livers.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.920
The advantage of urea is
its very low toxicity.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.280
It can hang out in your
circulatory systems for a while

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.750
with no ill effects.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.280
But you have to have
some extra water available

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.660
to dissolve it and get rid of it.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.929
This isn't such a
tall order, really,

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.610
I mean peeing isn't a huge
inconvenience, I mean, is it?

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.620
It's not for me anyways.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.420
Well, it would be, though,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.680
if you a bird or an insect or a
lizard livings in the desert.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.090
Animals that have to be
light enough to fly

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.080
or don't have a bunch of
spare water hanging around,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.950
convert ammonia into uric
acid, which can be excreted

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.430
as a kind of paste, so not
a lot of water is needed.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.920
You've seen bird poop.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.890
If you haven't taken a close
look, next time, do that.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.260
Just look.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.730
The white stuff in the
bird droppings is actually

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.090
the uric acid-y pee and the
brown stuff is the poop.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.970
So, now that we've established
what is and what is not bird poop,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.610
let's get down to the
brass tacks of how humans

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.459
get all of this urea out of our
blood and into our toilets.

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.420
The excretory system
starts with the kidneys,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.650
the organs that do all
the heavy lifting,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.430
from maintaining those levels
of water and dissolved materials

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.480
in our bodies to controlling
our blood pressure.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480
And even though they
do an amazing job,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.640
I'm not bad-mouthing
your kidneys here,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.090
the way that they
do it is frankly

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.569
a little bit janky and inefficient.

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.709
They start out by filtering
out a bunch of fluid

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.980
and the stuff dissolved in
the fluid out of your blood,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.569
and then they basically
re-absorb 99% of it back

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.390
before sending that 1% on its
way in the form of urine.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.299
Seriously, 99% gets re-absorbed.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.390
On an average day, your kidneys
filter out about 180 liters

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.120
of fluid from your blood,
but only 1.5 liters of that

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.330
ends up getting peed out.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.689
So most of your excretory system
isn't dedicated to excreting

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.500
it's dedicated to re-absorbing.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.810
But the system works,
obviously, I'm still alive.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.000
So we can't argue with that.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.849
Now it is time to get into
the nitty gritty details

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.250
of how your kidneys do all
this, and it's pretty cool.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.390
But there's lots of weird
words. So get ready.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.909
Your kidneys do all this
work using a network

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.330
of tiny filtering structures
called nephrons.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.750
Each one of your mango-sized
kidneys has about a million of them

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.060
If you were, don't do this,
but if you were to unravel

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.010
all of your nephrons and
put them end to end,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.680
they would stretch
over 80 kilometers.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.829
This is where all the
crazy action happens,

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.579
so to understand how they work,
we're just going to follow

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.489
the flow, from your
heart to the toilet.

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.900
Blood from the heart enters the
kidneys through renal arteries,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.659
and just so you know, whenever
you hear the word "renal"

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.240
it means you're dealing
with kidney stuff.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.880
As the blood enters, it's forced
into a system of tiny capillaries

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.020
until it enters a tangle of porous
capillaries called the glomerulus.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.950
This is the starting point
for a single nephron.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.640
The pressure in the
glomerulus is high enough

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.270
that it squeezes some of
the fluid out of the blood,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.630
about 20% of it,
and into a cup-like

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.030
sac called the Bowman's capsule.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.670
The stuff that's squeezed
out is no longer blood,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.540
it is now called filtrate.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.660
It's made up of water, urea,
some smaller ions and molecules

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.860
like sodium, glucose
and amino acids.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.000
The bigger stuff in your
blood, like the red blood cells

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.200
and the larger proteins,
they don't get filtered.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.460
Now the filtrate is
ready to be processed.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.500
From the Bowman's capsule,
it flows into a twisted tube

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.390
called the proximal
convoluted tubule,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.660
which means "the tube near the
beginning and that is all wind-y."

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.940
WHY ARE WE SO BAD AT NAMING THINGS?!

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.360
Anyways, this is the first of two
convoluted tubules in the nephron.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.230
And these, along with other
tubules we're talking about,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.270
are where the
osmoregulation takes place.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.290
With all kinds of tricked
out, specialized pumps

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.640
and other kinds of active
and passive transport,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.760
they re-absorb water
and dissolved materials

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.230
to create whatever balance
your body needs at the time.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.080
In the proximal tubule,
it's mainly organic solutes

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.270
in the filtrate that are reabsorbed
like glucose, and amino acids,

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.280
and other important stuff that
you want to hang on to.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.260
But it also helps to re-capture
some sodium, potassium

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.980
and water we're going to want later.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.930
From here, the filtrate
enters the Loop of Henle,

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.560
which is a long, hairpin-shaped
tubule that passes through

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.200
the two main layers of the kidney.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.470
The outermost layer
is the renal cortex,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.990
that's where the glomerulus,
bowman's capsule,

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.460
and both convoluted tubules
are, and the layer beneath

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.440
that is the renal medulla,
which is the center of the kidney.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.870
"Cortex," by the way,
is Latin for tree bark,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.150
so whenever you see it in
biology, you know that it's

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.400
the outside of something.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.430
"Medulla," on the other hand,
meaning narrow or pith,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.860
so you know that it's the inside.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.570
Just to help you
remember this stuff.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.220
But, before we take a
tour of this amazing loop

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.400
I have to do a couple of things.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.500
First, go pee.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.750
Because this is...you know.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.510
And second, a Biolo-graphy!

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.620
So I'll be right back!

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.100
The Loop of Henle was discovered
by 19th century German physician

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.630
and anatomist Friedrich
Gustav Jakob Henle.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.500
I'm pretty sure he was one of
those guys that you can't gross out

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.530
since he spent most of his
career dissecting kidneys,

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.710
eyeballs, and brains.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.750
And also seemed to be a
huge fan of mucus and pus.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.620
He was by far the most important
anatomist of his time.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.080
His three-volume Handbook of
Systematic Human Anatomy

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.690
was recognized as the
definitive anatomy textbook

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.870
of its day and was famous for
its exquisite attention

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.400
to detail and its intricate,
even beautiful, illustrations.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.600
Not only did Henle
discover the Loop of Henle,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.920
arguably the linchpin of
kidney function in mammals,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.490
he was an early adopter
of the wildly unpopular

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.910
germ theory of disease.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.440
His student Robert Koch is
considered one of the founders

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.740
of microbiology, and
the two worked together

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.580
to formulate the
Henle-Koch Postulates,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.620
which today remain the four
conditions that must be met

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.590
to establish a causal relationship
between a microbe and a disease.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.400
Henle taught the world so much
about the human body that there are,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.060
right now, in you, no fewer
than 9 features that bear his name.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.310
From the Henle's fissures
between the muscle fibers

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.940
of your heart to
the Crypts of Henle,

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.750
which are microscopic pockets
in the whites of your eyes.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.910
Also the name of my
Cradle of Filth cover band.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.530
Alright, so, review time.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.680
We've squeezed some filtrate
out of the blood, and re-absorbed

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.930
some of the important organic
molecules we want to keep.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.130
But most of the re-absorption
action happens here,

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.630
in the Loop of Henle, which does
three really important things.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.000
One, it extracts most of the
water that we need from

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.440
the filtrate as it
travels down to the medulla.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.180
Two, it pumps out the
salts that we want to keep

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.790
on the way back
up to the cortex.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.590
And three, in the
process of doing all that,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.350
it makes the medulla hypertonic,
or super salty relative

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.600
to the filtrate.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.710
Creating a concentration gradient
that will allow the medulla

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.360
to draw out even more water
one last time from the filtrate,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.450
before the final journey
to the toilet begins.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.860
It's complicated and,
again, kinda janky,

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.020
but it's what allows us
mammals to create urine

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.390
that's as concentrated as
necessary, using only

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.830
the amount of water that our
bodies can spare at the time.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.450
So first, filtrate starts going
down the loop, and the thing

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.060
to know here is that the membrane
is highly permeable to water,

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.190
not so much to salt or
anything else, mainly water.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.510
Now, compared to the filtrate,
the tissue of the medulla

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.220
is already pretty salty.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.640
And as the filtrate processes,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.260
the surrounding tissue
becomes increasingly hypertonic

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.659
the farther down you go,
the saltier it gets.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.630
So, applying everything
we've learned about osmosis,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.760
you know that as the
filtrate moves along,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.800
it loses more and more
water through the membrane.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.810
By the time the filtrate
gets to the bottom of the Loop,

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.270
it's highly concentrated.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.940
Now the filtrate enters
the ascending end of the Loop,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.060
and here it's basically
the same but in reverse.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.630
The membrane is NOT permeable to
water, and instead it's lined with

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.110
channels that transport ions like
sodium, potassium and chlorine.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.400
And because the filtrate is so
concentrated now, it's actually

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.990
hypertonic compared to the
fluid outside in the medulla.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.510
So as it ascends, huge amounts
of salts start flowing out of the

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.280
filtrate, which makes the
renal medulla really,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.530
really, really salty.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.640
This salty medulla also creates
a concentration gradient

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.290
between the medulla and the
filtrate which we're going to need

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.320
in the final step of pee-making.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.190
But first! Once the filtrate
is back up in the cortex

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.350
and out of the loop, it enters the
second of our convoluted tubules,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.140
called the distal convoluted tubule,
or "farther-away curly tube."

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.540
While the first tubule
worked mostly on reabsorbing

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.650
the organic compounds
in the filtrate,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.730
here the focus is on
regulating levels of potassium,

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.400
sodium, and calcium.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.510
This work is mainly done
by pumps and hormones

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.590
that regulate the
reabsorption process.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.390
By the time it's done,
we've finally taken everything

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.940
we want to keep out of the
filtrate, so now it's mainly

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.610
just excess water, urea
and other metabolic waste.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.940
This stuff all gets dumped
into collecting ducts

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.250
that channel it back down to the
center of the kidney, the medulla.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.130
And remember, the medulla
is super-salty, right?

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.960
Now more hormones kick in that
tell the collecting ducts

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.700
how porous to make their membranes.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.770
If the membranes are
made very porous,

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.740
more water is absorbed into the
medulla, which makes the urine

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.720
yes, we can start
calling it urine now

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.260
even more concentrated.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.150
And here's a fun fact: If you've
ever had one drink too many,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.640
you might've noticed that
you start to pee a lot,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.960
and your pee is clear.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.400
That's because alcohol interferes
with these hormones

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.390
especially one called
anti-diuretic hormone which tells

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.560
the collecting ducts to be
very porous so that you

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.900
reabsorb most of the water.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.340
With those hormones all
confused and out of commission,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.090
you just starting peeing
out all kinds of water,

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.960
which also means you're
getting dehydrated,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.200
which means you're officially on a
one-way trip to Hangover City.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.650
So, now you know why that happens.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.880
Now at this point, the
urine leaves both kidneys

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.080
and flows down to the urinary
bladder by tubes called ureters.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.610
Once in the bladder, the
urine just sits around,

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.310
waiting for us to decide when
it's time to find a bathroom.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.630
And when that time comes, a little
sphincter muscle relaxes

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.090
and releases the urine from
the bladder into a tube

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.100
called the urethra, which empties
out wherever you point it.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.030
So that's how your
excretory system works!

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.560
And that's basically how it
works for most mammals,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.820
although some modifications
are made based on, again,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.000
where they live and what they do.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.540
For instance, kangaroo rats,
which are tiny and adorable

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.480
and live in the desert, have
the most concentrated urine

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.960
of any animal anywhere, because
it can't spare the water.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.610
So it has a very, very long
Loop of Henle that reabsorbs

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.370
most of the water
from the filtrate.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.740
On the other end of the
spectrum, we have the beavers,

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.950
who have very short Loops of
Henle, because they're like,

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.350
"Water reabsorption,
schmater reabschmorption.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.730
Do you see what I do all day?"

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.980
And so now you know the
true origins of pee.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.850
