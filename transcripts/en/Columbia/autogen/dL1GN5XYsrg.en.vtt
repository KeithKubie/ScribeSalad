but just briefly my work is really about

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300
but just briefly my work is really about
 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.630
but just briefly my work is really about
light it's all about understanding the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640
light it's all about understanding the
 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.249
light it's all about understanding the
phenomenology of light primarily

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
phenomenology of light primarily
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.430
phenomenology of light primarily
daylight but also artificial light and I

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
daylight but also artificial light and I
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.240
daylight but also artificial light and I
became involved in working with light as

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
became involved in working with light as
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.400
became involved in working with light as
a medium basically in the late 1960s

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
a medium basically in the late 1960s
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.790
a medium basically in the late 1960s
when is it school and that basically led

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
when is it school and that basically led
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.300
when is it school and that basically led
me into glass as a material to capture

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
me into glass as a material to capture
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.040
me into glass as a material to capture
and manifest and sort of explore

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
and manifest and sort of explore
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.259
and manifest and sort of explore
qualities of light and information

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
qualities of light and information
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.109
qualities of light and information
basically that the content of light in

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
basically that the content of light in
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.429
basically that the content of light in
the work that I did so a lot of the work

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
the work that I did so a lot of the work
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200
the work that I did so a lot of the work
I under start to show you a few projects

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
I under start to show you a few projects
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.260
I under start to show you a few projects
which in the late 60s and 70s we're

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
which in the late 60s and 70s we're
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.020
which in the late 60s and 70s we're
really film projects that explored a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
really film projects that explored a
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450
really film projects that explored a
phenomenon of light and how you might

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
phenomenon of light and how you might
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580
phenomenon of light and how you might
capture a phenomenon that you would see

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
capture a phenomenon that you would see
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.389
capture a phenomenon that you would see
in nature synthesize it and establish it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
in nature synthesize it and establish it
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.950
in nature synthesize it and establish it
as something you would experience in an

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
as something you would experience in an
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.389
as something you would experience in an
urban environment how you sort of

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
urban environment how you sort of
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.340
urban environment how you sort of
connect people as Richard were saying

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
connect people as Richard were saying
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.930
connect people as Richard were saying
how you connect people to a very

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
how you connect people to a very
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720
how you connect people to a very
richness of urban life where nature

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
richness of urban life where nature
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849
richness of urban life where nature
exists around us but we tend to not

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
exists around us but we tend to not
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.310
exists around us but we tend to not
observe it or see it so my work really

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
observe it or see it so my work really
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.830
observe it or see it so my work really
goes very much in the direction of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
goes very much in the direction of
 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.219
goes very much in the direction of
having people understand the richness of

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
having people understand the richness of
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.679
having people understand the richness of
an urban context and what architecture

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
an urban context and what architecture
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.490
an urban context and what architecture
can do to explore that amplify it and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
can do to explore that amplify it and
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.310
can do to explore that amplify it and
sort of sustained a different sense of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
sort of sustained a different sense of
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.429
sort of sustained a different sense of
our lives with an urban environment and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
our lives with an urban environment and
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.700
our lives with an urban environment and
as Martha was saying I've also can sort

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
as Martha was saying I've also can sort
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.760
as Martha was saying I've also can sort

technical glass company which you may be
aware of and I started working for them

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
aware of and I started working for them
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.929
aware of and I started working for them
in the 1970s on a lot of photosensitive

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
in the 1970s on a lot of photosensitive

glasses glasses that respond to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
glasses glasses that respond to
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.910
glasses glasses that respond to
different wavelengths of light and I've

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
different wavelengths of light and I've
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.980
different wavelengths of light and I've
continued to work with them today and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
continued to work with them today and
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.300
continued to work with them today and
we're currently working on a lot of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
we're currently working on a lot of
 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.980
we're currently working on a lot of
glasses which I'll talk about later but

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
glasses which I'll talk about later but
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.410
glasses which I'll talk about later but
all of these classes today which are

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
all of these classes today which are
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.050
all of these classes today which are
used for all of our cellphones and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
used for all of our cellphones and

literally thinner glasses now that are

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
literally thinner glasses now that are
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.490
literally thinner glasses now that are
much thinner than this piece of paper

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
much thinner than this piece of paper
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.940
much thinner than this piece of paper
and are hundreds of times stronger than

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
and are hundreds of times stronger than
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.370

the glass were familiar with

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380
the glass were familiar with
 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.470
the glass were familiar with
and they're currently glasses that you

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480
and they're currently glasses that you
 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.200
and they're currently glasses that you
can roll up roll up the glass comes at a

all these different aspects of glass

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430
all these different aspects of glass
 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.150
all these different aspects of glass
that you couldn't necessarily explore in

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160
that you couldn't necessarily explore in
 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
that you couldn't necessarily explore in
conventional types of classes but I'll

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170
conventional types of classes but I'll
 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.140
conventional types of classes but I'll
talk about that a little bit but I would

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
talk about that a little bit but I would
 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.680
talk about that a little bit but I would
introduce you to my own work and how it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690
introduce you to my own work and how it
 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.990
introduce you to my own work and how it
has basically I guess sort of morphed

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000
has basically I guess sort of morphed
 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.140
has basically I guess sort of morphed
over the years from work done in the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150
over the years from work done in the
 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.210
over the years from work done in the
early 1970s I'm just going to touch on

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220
early 1970s I'm just going to touch on
 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.800
early 1970s I'm just going to touch on
one or two of these to give you a sense

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810
one or two of these to give you a sense
 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.490
one or two of these to give you a sense
of where I come from conceptually in

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500
of where I come from conceptually in
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.210
of where I come from conceptually in
work but I basically studied chemistry

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220
work but I basically studied chemistry
 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.610
work but I basically studied chemistry
and had a great interest in biology and

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620
and had a great interest in biology and
 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.410
and had a great interest in biology and
chemistry together so a lot of the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420
chemistry together so a lot of the
 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.150
chemistry together so a lot of the
film's deal with events you see in

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160
film's deal with events you see in
 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.640
film's deal with events you see in
nature and this happened to be a small

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650
nature and this happened to be a small
 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.160
nature and this happened to be a small
River in Puget Sound you know this is

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
River in Puget Sound you know this is
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.280
River in Puget Sound you know this is
done 35 years ago almost 40 years ago a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290
done 35 years ago almost 40 years ago a
 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.260
done 35 years ago almost 40 years ago a
small river in Puget Sound where a

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270
small river in Puget Sound where a
 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.030
small river in Puget Sound where a
friend of mine was doing his PhD work

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040
friend of mine was doing his PhD work
 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.460
friend of mine was doing his PhD work
and they manage different genetic

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470
and they manage different genetic
 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.140
and they manage different genetic
strains of salmon that release them into

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150
strains of salmon that release them into
 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.370
strains of salmon that release them into
the river and then he obviously come

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380
the river and then he obviously come
 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.620
the river and then he obviously come
back and the idea here was that over the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630
back and the idea here was that over the
 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.840
back and the idea here was that over the
river you'd build scaffolding over the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850
river you'd build scaffolding over the
 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.580
river you'd build scaffolding over the
river and then a series of cameras that

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590
river and then a series of cameras that
 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.110
river and then a series of cameras that
would look down into the surface of the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120
would look down into the surface of the
 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.600
would look down into the surface of the
river and then you would take that

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610
river and then you would take that
 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.730
river and then you would take that
series of films and then you would

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740
series of films and then you would
 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.560
series of films and then you would
project them basically in a museum or in

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570
project them basically in a museum or in
 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.590
project them basically in a museum or in
a gallery so you walk into the museum

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600
a gallery so you walk into the museum
 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.810
a gallery so you walk into the museum
basically on the floor our fragments of

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820
basically on the floor our fragments of
 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.390
basically on the floor our fragments of
that river with the fish is you sir see

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400
that river with the fish is you sir see
 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.920
that river with the fish is you sir see
here Sam and moves through one film

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930
here Sam and moves through one film
 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.750
here Sam and moves through one film
frame through darkness at the next film

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760
frame through darkness at the next film
 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.220
frame through darkness at the next film
friend external brain so you have a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230
friend external brain so you have a
 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.890
friend external brain so you have a
sequential capture of migration

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900
sequential capture of migration
 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.570
sequential capture of migration
basically the notion of migration sort

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580
basically the notion of migration sort
 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.860
basically the notion of migration sort
of moving through the museum and what

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870
of moving through the museum and what
 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.780
of moving through the museum and what
interests me I guess about these these

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790
interests me I guess about these these
 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.380
interests me I guess about these these
phenomenon and when you observe them is

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390
phenomenon and when you observe them is
 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.590
phenomenon and when you observe them is
that the content of things we look at is

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600
that the content of things we look at is
 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.470
that the content of things we look at is
much broader than we

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480
much broader than we
 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.620
much broader than we
we tend to our eye tends to narrow down

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630
we tend to our eye tends to narrow down
 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.460
we tend to our eye tends to narrow down
to very familiar things and this

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470
to very familiar things and this
 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.560
to very familiar things and this
basically sort of discounts a lot of

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570
basically sort of discounts a lot of
 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.420
basically sort of discounts a lot of
information is around us so I'm very

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
information is around us so I'm very
 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.600
information is around us so I'm very
interested in how we recapture the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610
interested in how we recapture the
 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.390
interested in how we recapture the
wealth of content that exists in the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400
wealth of content that exists in the
 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.280
wealth of content that exists in the
world around us and bring your attention

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290
world around us and bring your attention
 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.189
world around us and bring your attention
to those specific things so this is just

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199
to those specific things so this is just
 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.110
to those specific things so this is just
a little way of sort of demonstrating

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120
a little way of sort of demonstrating
 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.659
a little way of sort of demonstrating
what this project was was about the sort

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669
what this project was was about the sort
 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.680
what this project was was about the sort
of the river the movement of the fish

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690
of the river the movement of the fish
 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.740
of the river the movement of the fish
over the river but by shooting the film

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750
over the river but by shooting the film
 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.290
over the river but by shooting the film
and then you change the timing of the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300
and then you change the timing of the
 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.820
and then you change the timing of the
film slightly instead of running the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830
film slightly instead of running the
 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.640
film slightly instead of running the
film at the conventional speed you print

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650
film at the conventional speed you print
 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.250
film at the conventional speed you print
the images so they repeat each other and

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260
the images so they repeat each other and
 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.140
the images so they repeat each other and
they hold themselves a little bit longer

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150
they hold themselves a little bit longer
 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.210
they hold themselves a little bit longer
while you begin to realize that the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220
while you begin to realize that the
 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.210
while you begin to realize that the
image isn't necessarily just looking

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220
image isn't necessarily just looking
 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.529
image isn't necessarily just looking
through the surface of the water and

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539
through the surface of the water and
 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.390
through the surface of the water and
seeing the fish but if you change the

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400
seeing the fish but if you change the
 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.820
seeing the fish but if you change the
timing that same film image all of a

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830
timing that same film image all of a
 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.189
timing that same film image all of a
sudden reveals the fact that you're

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199
sudden reveals the fact that you're
 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.050
sudden reveals the fact that you're
looking at an absolutely perfect image

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060
looking at an absolutely perfect image
 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.810
looking at an absolutely perfect image
of the sky reflected in the surface so

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820
of the sky reflected in the surface so
 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.520
of the sky reflected in the surface so
it's really taking the surface of water

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530
it's really taking the surface of water
 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.730
it's really taking the surface of water
and the information that's seen through

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740
and the information that's seen through
 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.740
and the information that's seen through
the water the information that exists on

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750
the water the information that exists on
 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.969
the water the information that exists on
the surface of the water and the

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979
the surface of the water and the
 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.500
the surface of the water and the
information is reflected off the surface

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510
information is reflected off the surface
 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.839
information is reflected off the surface
of the water so oftentimes use this idea

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849
of the water so oftentimes use this idea
 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.140
of the water so oftentimes use this idea
of water as a corollary to glass that

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150
of water as a corollary to glass that
 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.839
of water as a corollary to glass that
glass is a material that has content

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849
glass is a material that has content
 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.089
glass is a material that has content
reflected on its surface content within

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099
reflected on its surface content within
 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.950
reflected on its surface content within
it and content through it so the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960
it and content through it so the
 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.200
it and content through it so the
material has a capacity to inform us in

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210
material has a capacity to inform us in
 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.900
material has a capacity to inform us in
a much richer way than we tend to

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910
a much richer way than we tend to
 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.690
a much richer way than we tend to
acknowledge and this is a project done

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700
acknowledge and this is a project done
 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.330
acknowledge and this is a project done
about ten years later for a family in

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340
about ten years later for a family in
 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.520
about ten years later for a family in
California that had a very extensive art

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530
California that had a very extensive art
 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.070
California that had a very extensive art
collection and there's a small River on

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080
collection and there's a small River on
 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.529
collection and there's a small River on
their property and they had a bridge

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539
their property and they had a bridge
 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.240
their property and they had a bridge
that would lead you over the small River

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250
that would lead you over the small River
 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.370
that would lead you over the small River
and an a commissioned me to do this

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380
and an a commissioned me to do this
 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.230
and an a commissioned me to do this
bridge for them and the idea here is

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240
bridge for them and the idea here is
 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.900
bridge for them and the idea here is
that you cross out onto this glass

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910
that you cross out onto this glass
 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.719
that you cross out onto this glass
platform then you move along this glass

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729
platform then you move along this glass
 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.520
platform then you move along this glass
platform to the other shore of the river

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530
platform to the other shore of the river
 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.550
platform to the other shore of the river
so that moment in time when you're

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560
so that moment in time when you're
 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.140
so that moment in time when you're
crossing the river isn't necessarily

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150
crossing the river isn't necessarily
 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.810
crossing the river isn't necessarily
just going from side to side but extends

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820
just going from side to side but extends
 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.659
just going from side to side but extends
your experience of that particular

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669
your experience of that particular
 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.230
your experience of that particular
ecology or invite

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240
ecology or invite
 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.510
ecology or invite
so this glass platform is really

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520
so this glass platform is really
 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.480
so this glass platform is really
suspended over the surface of the river

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490
suspended over the surface of the river
 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.040
suspended over the surface of the river
the idea is that the light comes down

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050
the idea is that the light comes down
 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.920
the idea is that the light comes down
hits the river reflects back up so the

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930
hits the river reflects back up so the
 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.520
hits the river reflects back up so the
glass platform which is translucent

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530
glass platform which is translucent
 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.770
glass platform which is translucent
carries with it the image of the the

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780
carries with it the image of the the
 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.439
carries with it the image of the the
water itself so the the idea here is how

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449
water itself so the the idea here is how
 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.999
water itself so the the idea here is how
and this is really sort of to show you

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009
and this is really sort of to show you
 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.740
and this is really sort of to show you
one or two of these projects it's sort

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750
one or two of these projects it's sort
 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.830
one or two of these projects it's sort
of how I tried to move from doing work

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840
of how I tried to move from doing work
 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.960
of how I tried to move from doing work
in the art world primarily which is a

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970
in the art world primarily which is a
 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.450
in the art world primarily which is a
very limited audience to how you move

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460
very limited audience to how you move
 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.520
very limited audience to how you move
out of that into the architectural world

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530
out of that into the architectural world
 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.800
out of that into the architectural world
which is where I originally studied how

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810
which is where I originally studied how
 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.499
which is where I originally studied how
do you build things permanently that can

00:06:58.499 --> 00:06:58.509
do you build things permanently that can
 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.899
do you build things permanently that can
capture in a conceptual way sort of a

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:00.909
capture in a conceptual way sort of a
 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:03.120
capture in a conceptual way sort of a
richness of our environment so the

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130
richness of our environment so the
 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.770
richness of our environment so the
notion here is that you walk on this

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780
notion here is that you walk on this
 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.800
notion here is that you walk on this
glass platform you've basically

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810
glass platform you've basically
 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.059
glass platform you've basically
extracted the surface of the water and

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:09.069
extracted the surface of the water and
 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:10.320
extracted the surface of the water and
made that the surface that you're

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330
made that the surface that you're
 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.050
made that the surface that you're
walking on and by just using slightly

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060
walking on and by just using slightly
 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.540
walking on and by just using slightly
reflective panels of glass they say

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550
reflective panels of glass they say
 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.809
reflective panels of glass they say
basically superimpose reflected images

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:18.819
basically superimpose reflected images
 

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.339
basically superimpose reflected images
of the landscape around you so the

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:20.349
of the landscape around you so the
 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:22.439
of the landscape around you so the
bridge actually sort of consolidates the

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449
bridge actually sort of consolidates the
 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.080
bridge actually sort of consolidates the
landscape on the one hand and that also

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.090
landscape on the one hand and that also
 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.640
landscape on the one hand and that also
sort of lifts this quality the water

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650
sort of lifts this quality the water
 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.620
sort of lifts this quality the water
below it so it's a way of how do you

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.630
below it so it's a way of how do you
 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.499
below it so it's a way of how do you
create environments where all of a

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:31.509
create environments where all of a
 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:33.480
create environments where all of a
sudden you begin understand these

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490
sudden you begin understand these
 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.010
sudden you begin understand these
elements there around you in a very

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.020
elements there around you in a very
 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.480
elements there around you in a very
different way you sort of build a new

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:36.490
different way you sort of build a new
 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.570
different way you sort of build a new
new experience or new environment so

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580
new experience or new environment so
 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.879
new experience or new environment so
other projects done about that same time

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:41.889
other projects done about that same time
 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:43.770
other projects done about that same time
and this is perhaps a little more

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:43.780
and this is perhaps a little more
 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.790
and this is perhaps a little more
conventional is a small project done for

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800
conventional is a small project done for
 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.589
conventional is a small project done for
a client out in the Midwest and this is

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599
a client out in the Midwest and this is
 

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:55.350
a client out in the Midwest and this is
a the only the only desire on the

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360
a the only the only desire on the
 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.450
a the only the only desire on the
clients part that he would be built at

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:57.460
clients part that he would be built at
 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.860
clients part that he would be built at
this is a chapel it's sort of a small

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:58.870
this is a chapel it's sort of a small
 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.360
this is a chapel it's sort of a small
chapel that's part of a seminary and the

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.370
chapel that's part of a seminary and the
 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.520
chapel that's part of a seminary and the
only desire we had was to maintain

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:05.530
only desire we had was to maintain
 

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.680
only desire we had was to maintain
totally clear views of the nature

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:07.690
totally clear views of the nature
 

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.719
totally clear views of the nature
outside so you'd sit in the building

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:09.729
outside so you'd sit in the building
 

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:11.129
outside so you'd sit in the building
look out at this very beautiful

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:11.139
look out at this very beautiful
 

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:13.800
look out at this very beautiful
landscape and the trees you would have

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:13.810
landscape and the trees you would have
 

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.649
landscape and the trees you would have
been happy with that but I wanted to try

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:16.659
been happy with that but I wanted to try
 

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:19.469
been happy with that but I wanted to try
to figure out a way to do more than just

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479
to figure out a way to do more than just
 

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:21.059
to figure out a way to do more than just
have a clear glass window but how you

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:21.069
have a clear glass window but how you
 

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:22.800
have a clear glass window but how you
would sort of animate the space so

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:22.810
would sort of animate the space so
 

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.140
would sort of animate the space so
you're looking through the window and

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:25.150
you're looking through the window and
 

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.750
you're looking through the window and
the window is about 12 meters tall it's

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:27.760
the window is about 12 meters tall it's
 

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.339
the window is about 12 meters tall it's
quite a tall window there's single

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:29.349
quite a tall window there's single
 

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:31.620
quite a tall window there's single
single pieces of glass and run the full

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:31.630
single pieces of glass and run the full
 

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.020
single pieces of glass and run the full
height and then there are these panels

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.030
height and then there are these panels
 

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.210
height and then there are these panels
of glass which are roughly that

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:36.220
of glass which are roughly that
 

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.950
of glass which are roughly that
dimension that's stiffen these vertical

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:37.960
dimension that's stiffen these vertical
 

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.320
dimension that's stiffen these vertical
pieces so you look at it nature beyond

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:40.330
pieces so you look at it nature beyond
 

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.390
pieces so you look at it nature beyond
and there's sort of this overlay of

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:42.400
and there's sort of this overlay of
 

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.150
and there's sort of this overlay of
another layer of glass in front of it

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160
another layer of glass in front of it
 

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.570
another layer of glass in front of it
and basically what happens is sunlight

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:48.580
and basically what happens is sunlight
 

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.060
and basically what happens is sunlight
comes in portion of the light is

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.070
comes in portion of the light is
 

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.500
comes in portion of the light is
reflected portion of the light is

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:52.510
reflected portion of the light is
 

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.950
reflected portion of the light is
transmitted and you end up with this

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:55.960
transmitted and you end up with this
 

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.710
transmitted and you end up with this
idea that the light basically occupies

00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720
idea that the light basically occupies
 

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.870
idea that the light basically occupies
the space it comes in and sort of

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880
the space it comes in and sort of
 

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.820
the space it comes in and sort of
dominates and takes over the space and

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:02.830
dominates and takes over the space and
 

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.000
dominates and takes over the space and
what's happening here is that as you

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.010
what's happening here is that as you
 

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.950
what's happening here is that as you
have clouds in the sky basically that

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:07.960
have clouds in the sky basically that
 

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.870
have clouds in the sky basically that
image is brought in and projected on the

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880
image is brought in and projected on the
 

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.790
image is brought in and projected on the
wall so you actually see clouds moving

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:11.800
wall so you actually see clouds moving
 

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.630
wall so you actually see clouds moving
our birds and then when the trees have

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640
our birds and then when the trees have
 

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.890
our birds and then when the trees have
like summer and fall when you see those

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:16.900
like summer and fall when you see those
 

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.810
like summer and fall when you see those
leaves moving that image is projected

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:18.820
leaves moving that image is projected
 

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.210
leaves moving that image is projected
down in so in a way it's connected to

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.220
down in so in a way it's connected to
 

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.970
down in so in a way it's connected to
film it's a bit cinematic in that sense

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:23.980
film it's a bit cinematic in that sense
 

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.490
film it's a bit cinematic in that sense
that's bringing abstracted qualities of

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:26.500
that's bringing abstracted qualities of
 

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.830
that's bringing abstracted qualities of
nature into the space and you observe

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:28.840
nature into the space and you observe
 

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.510
nature into the space and you observe
them in a very different way than you

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:30.520
them in a very different way than you
 

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.580
them in a very different way than you
would otherwise and of course the

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:32.590
would otherwise and of course the
 

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.350
would otherwise and of course the
dynamic of daylight is you walk in here

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360
dynamic of daylight is you walk in here
 

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.990
dynamic of daylight is you walk in here
sometimes it might not be anything on

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000
sometimes it might not be anything on
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.180
sometimes it might not be anything on
the wall or there might be just very

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.190
the wall or there might be just very
 

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.340
the wall or there might be just very
subtle pieces of this for all of a

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:41.350
subtle pieces of this for all of a
 

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.890
subtle pieces of this for all of a
sudden hold image appears or disappears

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:42.900
sudden hold image appears or disappears
 

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.810
sudden hold image appears or disappears
so this is great sort of dynamic and I

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:45.820
so this is great sort of dynamic and I
 

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.360
so this is great sort of dynamic and I
think that that's fundamentally what

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:48.370
think that that's fundamentally what
 

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.890
think that that's fundamentally what
interests me there's a quality of

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:49.900
interests me there's a quality of
 

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.440
interests me there's a quality of
animation that we lose but we need to

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:52.450
animation that we lose but we need to
 

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.440
animation that we lose but we need to
somehow reintroduce and then secondarily

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:55.450
somehow reintroduce and then secondarily
 

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.440
somehow reintroduce and then secondarily
is this this concept which is something

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:58.450
is this this concept which is something
 

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.240
is this this concept which is something
you'll see in most all the work we do is

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.250
you'll see in most all the work we do is
 

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.450
you'll see in most all the work we do is
that the window is no longer a single

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:03.460
that the window is no longer a single
 

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.100
that the window is no longer a single
piece of glass but you've taken that

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.110
piece of glass but you've taken that
 

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.590
piece of glass but you've taken that
idea of boundary boundary condition

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600
idea of boundary boundary condition
 

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.360
idea of boundary boundary condition
between exterior environment and

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:09.370
between exterior environment and
 

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.400
between exterior environment and
interior environment you've expanded

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.410
interior environment you've expanded
 

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.930
interior environment you've expanded
that boundary so you have an

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:12.940
that boundary so you have an
 

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.310
that boundary so you have an
interstitial zone that reinterprets the

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320
interstitial zone that reinterprets the
 

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.600
interstitial zone that reinterprets the
relationship between exterior

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:18.610
relationship between exterior

longer glass as a transparent material
 

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.770
longer glass as a transparent material
that's abstract basically glass

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:25.780
that's abstract basically glass
 

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.270

Mauer work is really just the opposites

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:41.300
Mauer work is really just the opposites

Mauer work is really just the opposites
about how does the glass device or

about how does the glass device or
 

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.240
about how does the glass device or
structure or material clearly define the

differentiation between interior and
 

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.180
differentiation between interior and
exterior there is a richness of

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.190
exterior there is a richness of
 

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.769
exterior there is a richness of
differentiation it's not the same it's

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:53.779
differentiation it's not the same it's
 

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.360
differentiation it's not the same it's
not the same interior as it is outside

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.370
not the same interior as it is outside
 

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.910
not the same interior as it is outside
so you have a way of doing that so some

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920
so you have a way of doing that so some
 

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.499
so you have a way of doing that so some
of these projects are very simple again

00:10:59.499 --> 00:10:59.509
of these projects are very simple again
 

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:01.900
of these projects are very simple again

it's downtown near Lincoln Center it was

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.430
it's downtown near Lincoln Center it was
 

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.300
it's downtown near Lincoln Center it was
just a wall on a building a brick

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.310
just a wall on a building a brick
 

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.540
just a wall on a building a brick
building and the neighborhood or the

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:13.550
building and the neighborhood or the
 

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.300
building and the neighborhood or the
community group was very upset about

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:16.310
community group was very upset about
 

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.980
community group was very upset about
this new building that was built and

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:17.990
this new building that was built and
 

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.780
this new building that was built and
then we were ultimately sort of

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:19.790
then we were ultimately sort of
 

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.129
then we were ultimately sort of
commissioned to come up with something

00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:21.139
commissioned to come up with something
 

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.249
commissioned to come up with something
that would change that quality that

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:24.259
that would change that quality that
 

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:25.629
that would change that quality that
people would experience in a fairly

00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639
people would experience in a fairly
 

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:28.480
people would experience in a fairly
dense urban area more residential area

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:28.490
dense urban area more residential area
 

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.670
dense urban area more residential area
instead of this large blank brick wall

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680
instead of this large blank brick wall
 

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.220
instead of this large blank brick wall
so what you're looking at is a glass

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:33.230
so what you're looking at is a glass
 

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.379
so what you're looking at is a glass
surface it's actually a glass that's

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:35.389
surface it's actually a glass that's
 

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:37.840
surface it's actually a glass that's
used on solar collectors and then these

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:37.850
used on solar collectors and then these
 

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.790
used on solar collectors and then these
are glass fins that extend off the

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800
are glass fins that extend off the
 

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.379
are glass fins that extend off the
surface perpendicularly so you have a

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:41.389
surface perpendicularly so you have a
 

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:43.840
surface perpendicularly so you have a
background glass and the glass fin that

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:43.850
background glass and the glass fin that
 

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.759
background glass and the glass fin that
extends off the surface and it's very

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:45.769
extends off the surface and it's very
 

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:49.840
extends off the surface and it's very
static as a structure of course but if

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:49.850
static as a structure of course but if
 

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.210
static as a structure of course but if
you look at it at any time of the day or

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:52.220
you look at it at any time of the day or
 

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.460
you look at it at any time of the day or
any time of the year it's completely

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:54.470
any time of the year it's completely
 

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.259
any time of the year it's completely
different like this is the same moment

00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:56.269
different like this is the same moment
 

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:58.629
different like this is the same moment
in time this is looking at it from one

00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639
in time this is looking at it from one
 

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:00.129
in time this is looking at it from one
direction and that's looking at it from

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:00.139
direction and that's looking at it from
 

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:02.139
direction and that's looking at it from
another direction so it's the idea

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:02.149
another direction so it's the idea
 

00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:04.540
another direction so it's the idea
building a what we would refer to as a

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:04.550
building a what we would refer to as a
 

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.990
building a what we would refer to as a
responsive surface it's a surface that

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000
responsive surface it's a surface that
 

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.509
responsive surface it's a surface that
responds to you meaning your place your

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519
responds to you meaning your place your
 

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:12.370
responds to you meaning your place your
your position within that immediate

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:12.380
your position within that immediate
 

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.319
your position within that immediate
urban context and the position of the

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:14.329
urban context and the position of the
 

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:16.720
urban context and the position of the
Sun so it's always it's always that

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:16.730
Sun so it's always it's always that
 

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.610
Sun so it's always it's always that
dynamic between where's the source of

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:18.620
dynamic between where's the source of
 

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.620
dynamic between where's the source of
light and where are you in relationship

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:20.630
light and where are you in relationship
 

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.269
light and where are you in relationship
so it's something different every time

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279
so it's something different every time
 

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:25.629
so it's something different every time
you look at it and it also is designed

00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639
you look at it and it also is designed
 

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:30.040
you look at it and it also is designed
to this is critical in a city it's

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.050
to this is critical in a city it's
 

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.530
to this is critical in a city it's
obviously blocked many hours of the day

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:32.540
obviously blocked many hours of the day
 

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.540
obviously blocked many hours of the day
there's no light available to it in

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:34.550
there's no light available to it in
 

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.069
there's no light available to it in
terms of direct light so this is

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079
terms of direct light so this is
 

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:37.749
terms of direct light so this is
actually in an afternoon where the light

00:12:37.749 --> 00:12:37.759
actually in an afternoon where the light
 

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:39.490
actually in an afternoon where the light
is actually the Sun is beyond it it's

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:39.500
is actually the Sun is beyond it it's
 

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.299
is actually the Sun is beyond it it's
technically in shadow but it picks up on

00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:43.309
technically in shadow but it picks up on
 

00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:44.860
technically in shadow but it picks up on
different qualities of light and then it

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:44.870
different qualities of light and then it
 

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.030
different qualities of light and then it
projects light

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040
projects light
 

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.910
projects light
down into the street so often times it

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920
down into the street so often times it
 

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.519
down into the street so often times it
will animate the street so you get these

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:50.529
will animate the street so you get these
 

00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:55.060
will animate the street so you get these
effects which are say light coming off

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.070
effects which are say light coming off
 

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.949
effects which are say light coming off
of a building that might be four or five

00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959
of a building that might be four or five
 

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:59.019
of a building that might be four or five
blocks away it's just a random piece of

00:12:59.019 --> 00:12:59.029
blocks away it's just a random piece of
 

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.749
blocks away it's just a random piece of
light that hits the surface we see this

00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:01.759
light that hits the surface we see this
 

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:03.100
light that hits the surface we see this
all the time in the city but it's

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:03.110
all the time in the city but it's
 

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.350
all the time in the city but it's
normally it hits a brick wall tore his

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360
normally it hits a brick wall tore his
 

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.230
normally it hits a brick wall tore his
cement and it's not anything remarkable

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240
cement and it's not anything remarkable
 

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.879
cement and it's not anything remarkable
but as soon as it hits a surface like

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:09.889
but as soon as it hits a surface like
 

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:11.139
but as soon as it hits a surface like
this all of a sudden create something

00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:11.149
this all of a sudden create something
 

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:14.259
this all of a sudden create something
very dynamic and the idea of the wall

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:14.269
very dynamic and the idea of the wall
 

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:17.079
very dynamic and the idea of the wall
here is I guess best exhibited there

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:17.089
here is I guess best exhibited there
 

00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:22.240
here is I guess best exhibited there
which was this idea of the flat wall not

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:22.250
which was this idea of the flat wall not
 

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.980
which was this idea of the flat wall not
having any sort of dimension to it and

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:23.990
having any sort of dimension to it and
 

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.809
having any sort of dimension to it and
sort of suggesting that it's a it's

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:25.819
sort of suggesting that it's a it's
 

00:13:25.819 --> 00:13:28.150
sort of suggesting that it's a it's
actually just this sheer surface but as

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160
actually just this sheer surface but as
 

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.740
actually just this sheer surface but as
you can see what happens it looks like

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:29.750
you can see what happens it looks like
 

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.509
you can see what happens it looks like
the fin the idea of the fin was that the

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519
the fin the idea of the fin was that the
 

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.480
the fin the idea of the fin was that the
fin would go to the glass service then

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:34.490
fin would go to the glass service then
 

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.550
fin would go to the glass service then
it appears if it's extending back into

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560
it appears if it's extending back into
 

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.059
it appears if it's extending back into
some other space behind it so the the

00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:40.069
some other space behind it so the the
 

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.879
some other space behind it so the the
wall tends to set up this idea that

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:42.889
wall tends to set up this idea that
 

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:45.100
wall tends to set up this idea that
there's occupied space or other space

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.110
there's occupied space or other space
 

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.439
there's occupied space or other space
dimensional space behind it so these are

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:47.449
dimensional space behind it so these are
 

00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:49.360
dimensional space behind it so these are
just you know just a few collections

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:49.370
just you know just a few collections
 

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.250
just you know just a few collections
small projects that demonstrate

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:51.260
small projects that demonstrate
 

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.110
small projects that demonstrate
different ways working with light and

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120
different ways working with light and
 

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.240
different ways working with light and
then this is something down Washington

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.250
then this is something down Washington
 

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.019
then this is something down Washington
DC I've done about 10 years ago but it's

00:13:59.019 --> 00:13:59.029
DC I've done about 10 years ago but it's
 

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:03.009
DC I've done about 10 years ago but it's
a very good example of something that

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:03.019
a very good example of something that
 

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:04.629
a very good example of something that
we're trying to get a better

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639
we're trying to get a better
 

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:07.480
we're trying to get a better
understanding of and execute projects

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:07.490
understanding of and execute projects
 

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.379
understanding of and execute projects
more in a more informed way this is a

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:11.389
more in a more informed way this is a
 

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:14.949
more in a more informed way this is a
building built for a large sort of law

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959
building built for a large sort of law
 

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:17.939
building built for a large sort of law
firm and the architects had designed a

00:14:17.939 --> 00:14:17.949
firm and the architects had designed a
 

00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:22.329
firm and the architects had designed a
atrium space which had a skylight that's

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:22.339
atrium space which had a skylight that's
 

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:25.750
atrium space which had a skylight that's
about 20 meters long and about 3 meters

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760
about 20 meters long and about 3 meters
 

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.809
about 20 meters long and about 3 meters
wide and the space itself is about 50

00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:28.819
wide and the space itself is about 50
 

00:14:28.819 --> 00:14:31.750
wide and the space itself is about 50
meters tall so very narrow slot very

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760
meters tall so very narrow slot very
 

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.449
meters tall so very narrow slot very
deep space in the building with offices

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:34.459
deep space in the building with offices
 

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:36.759
deep space in the building with offices
looking into it obviously those

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:36.769
looking into it obviously those
 

00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:38.769
looking into it obviously those
dimensions effectively mean you're going

00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:38.779
dimensions effectively mean you're going
 

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:41.920
dimensions effectively mean you're going
to get light from 1130-2 1230 like in

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:41.930
to get light from 1130-2 1230 like in
 

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.300
to get light from 1130-2 1230 like in
the noon time to get a little bit of

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:43.310
the noon time to get a little bit of
 

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.879
the noon time to get a little bit of
light coming and that's it so this is a

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:45.889
light coming and that's it so this is a
 

00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:48.429
light coming and that's it so this is a
device or structure that we built which

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:48.439
device or structure that we built which
 

00:14:48.439 --> 00:14:50.170
device or structure that we built which
made out of glass as a center piece of

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:50.180
made out of glass as a center piece of
 

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.259
made out of glass as a center piece of
glass that's relatively narrow at the

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:53.269
glass that's relatively narrow at the
 

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:55.389
glass that's relatively narrow at the
bottom and then it goes up to about

00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399
bottom and then it goes up to about
 

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:57.250
bottom and then it goes up to about
three meters in diameter at the top so

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:57.260
three meters in diameter at the top so
 

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.210
three meters in diameter at the top so
it's a glass

00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220
it's a glass
 

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.079
it's a glass
inside of a fabric structure and what

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:04.089
inside of a fabric structure and what
 

00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:07.730
inside of a fabric structure and what
we're doing here is on the roof is a

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740
we're doing here is on the roof is a
 

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.329
we're doing here is on the roof is a
heliostat obviously a tracking mirror

00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339
heliostat obviously a tracking mirror
 

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:14.180
heliostat obviously a tracking mirror
it's not so large you know it's maybe

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:14.190
it's not so large you know it's maybe
 

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.389
it's not so large you know it's maybe
you know the mirrors may be this big you

00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399
you know the mirrors may be this big you
 

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:20.610
you know the mirrors may be this big you
know not much bigger than a maybe half

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:20.620
know not much bigger than a maybe half
 

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.790
know not much bigger than a maybe half
of that window over there the Sun it

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800
of that window over there the Sun it
 

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.009
of that window over there the Sun it
tracks the Sun sunlight it then hits a

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:26.019
tracks the Sun sunlight it then hits a
 

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:27.540
tracks the Sun sunlight it then hits a
secondary mirror and then the secondary

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:27.550
secondary mirror and then the secondary
 

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.579
secondary mirror and then the secondary
mirror drops the light down inside the

00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:29.589
mirror drops the light down inside the
 

00:15:29.589 --> 00:15:34.110
mirror drops the light down inside the
cylinder so what's happening is the

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120
cylinder so what's happening is the
 

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.690
cylinder so what's happening is the
glass it's a special glass that has a

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:36.700
glass it's a special glass that has a
 

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.600
glass it's a special glass that has a
particular prismatic surface on it so

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:39.610
particular prismatic surface on it so
 

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.310
particular prismatic surface on it so
we're dropping the light down into the

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:41.320
we're dropping the light down into the
 

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.199
we're dropping the light down into the
cylinder over roughly 40 meters and the

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:46.209
cylinder over roughly 40 meters and the
 

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:47.970
cylinder over roughly 40 meters and the
glass the light is falling at about two

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:47.980
glass the light is falling at about two
 

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.440
glass the light is falling at about two
degree angles it comes down so light

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:49.450
degree angles it comes down so light
 

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.319
degree angles it comes down so light
hits the glass and it's refracted out so

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:52.329
hits the glass and it's refracted out so
 

00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:53.910
hits the glass and it's refracted out so
you're taking the light and you're

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920
you're taking the light and you're
 

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.980
you're taking the light and you're
constantly over that full dimension

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:55.990
constantly over that full dimension
 

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.630
constantly over that full dimension
you're bending the light and projecting

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:57.640
you're bending the light and projecting
 

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.240
you're bending the light and projecting
it out and you see the light on the

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:00.250
it out and you see the light on the
 

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.910
it out and you see the light on the
glass itself you see the light on the

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:02.920
glass itself you see the light on the
 

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.829
glass itself you see the light on the
fabric that's around it and then you see

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839
fabric that's around it and then you see
 

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.240
fabric that's around it and then you see
the light that's passed through it and

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:06.250
the light that's passed through it and
 

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.519
the light that's passed through it and
you see it again on the wall and the

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:08.529
you see it again on the wall and the
 

00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:10.170
you see it again on the wall and the
principal here and this is just

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:10.180
principal here and this is just
 

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.220
principal here and this is just
something that I think we all need to

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.230
something that I think we all need to
 

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.139
something that I think we all need to
learn more about is that if you think of

00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:16.149
learn more about is that if you think of
 

00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:18.180
learn more about is that if you think of
that it's just one small window it's

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:18.190
that it's just one small window it's
 

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.310
that it's just one small window it's
basically just maybe two-thirds the size

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320
basically just maybe two-thirds the size
 

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.990
basically just maybe two-thirds the size
of that one window that's all the light

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000
of that one window that's all the light
 

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.860
of that one window that's all the light
we have but you're actually then using

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:25.870
we have but you're actually then using
 

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.829
we have but you're actually then using
it to illuminate a huge space and it's

00:16:28.829 --> 00:16:28.839
it to illuminate a huge space and it's
 

00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:30.509
it to illuminate a huge space and it's
only an example of saying that we don't

00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519
only an example of saying that we don't
 

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.400
only an example of saying that we don't
know how to use the light there's so

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:32.410
know how to use the light there's so
 

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.740
know how to use the light there's so
much intensity in sunlight your eye

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:34.750
much intensity in sunlight your eye
 

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.519
much intensity in sunlight your eye
tends to close and it creates very high

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:38.529
tends to close and it creates very high
 

00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:40.439
tends to close and it creates very high
contrast and all that so then we're not

00:16:40.439 --> 00:16:40.449
contrast and all that so then we're not
 

00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:42.750
contrast and all that so then we're not
really using that sunlight very well but

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:42.760
really using that sunlight very well but
 

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.300
really using that sunlight very well but
if you have a way of distributing it and

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.310
if you have a way of distributing it and
 

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.939
if you have a way of distributing it and
having the light fall on multiple

00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:47.949
having the light fall on multiple
 

00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:49.980
having the light fall on multiple
surfaces you all of a sudden the

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:49.990
surfaces you all of a sudden the
 

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.630
surfaces you all of a sudden the
perception is there's an enormous amount

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:51.640
perception is there's an enormous amount
 

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.120
perception is there's an enormous amount
of light so it's just a principle that

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.130
of light so it's just a principle that
 

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.050
of light so it's just a principle that
we think is something we need to work

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.060
we think is something we need to work
 

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.200
we think is something we need to work
more aggressively on buildings and this

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:01.210
more aggressively on buildings and this
 

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.550
more aggressively on buildings and this
of course is at the very bottom of the

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560
of course is at the very bottom of the
 

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.850
of course is at the very bottom of the
space and we were obviously not able to

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:05.860
space and we were obviously not able to
 

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.440
space and we were obviously not able to
use all the light anyway so that you're

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:07.450
use all the light anyway so that you're
 

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.810
use all the light anyway so that you're
still getting you know very high amounts

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:09.820
still getting you know very high amounts
 

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.130
still getting you know very high amounts
of light at the bottom that you haven't

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:11.140
of light at the bottom that you haven't
 

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.960
of light at the bottom that you haven't
you haven't quite used so there's an

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:12.970
you haven't quite used so there's an
 

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.880
you haven't quite used so there's an
example about how daylight works and

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:14.890
example about how daylight works and
 

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.040
example about how daylight works and
then this is a I'm sure showing you a

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.050
then this is a I'm sure showing you a
 

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.560
then this is a I'm sure showing you a
range of things just maybe get you to

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:19.570
range of things just maybe get you to
 

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:21.180
range of things just maybe get you to
think about light and a different way

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:21.190
think about light and a different way
 

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.430
think about light and a different way
than you typically do this is a project

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:23.440
than you typically do this is a project
 

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.670
than you typically do this is a project
for the olympics in sydney australia and

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:26.680
for the olympics in sydney australia and
 

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.400
for the olympics in sydney australia and
the olympics were all about reclaiming

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:29.410
the olympics were all about reclaiming
 

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.860
the olympics were all about reclaiming
industrial landscapes like an old oil

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:31.870
industrial landscapes like an old oil
 

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.110
industrial landscapes like an old oil
refinery and steel yard right outside of

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120
refinery and steel yard right outside of
 

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.680
refinery and steel yard right outside of
Sydney on the harbour and they wanted to

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:37.690
Sydney on the harbour and they wanted to
 

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.390
Sydney on the harbour and they wanted to
reclaim that for the Olympic Park and

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400
reclaim that for the Olympic Park and
 

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.700
reclaim that for the Olympic Park and
turn it into a public park afterwards so

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:41.710
turn it into a public park afterwards so
 

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.470
turn it into a public park afterwards so
the whole project was about reclaiming

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480
the whole project was about reclaiming
 

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.280
the whole project was about reclaiming
toxic land reclaiming water sources that

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.290
toxic land reclaiming water sources that
 

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.930
toxic land reclaiming water sources that
had been contaminated all these things

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:48.940
had been contaminated all these things
 

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.420
had been contaminated all these things
and they wanted people to realize that

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:51.430
and they wanted people to realize that
 

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.940
and they wanted people to realize that
what had been gone what they've gone

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:53.950
what had been gone what they've gone
 

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.160
what had been gone what they've gone
through to reclaim this whole space so

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.170
through to reclaim this whole space so
 

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.470
through to reclaim this whole space so
we we wanted to try to use this idea of

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480
we we wanted to try to use this idea of
 

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.290
we we wanted to try to use this idea of
water and water vapor in the sense that

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:01.300
water and water vapor in the sense that
 

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.750
water and water vapor in the sense that
we know that the water is evaporating at

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760
we know that the water is evaporating at
 

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.120
we know that the water is evaporating at
the surface from bodies of water or even

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.130
the surface from bodies of water or even
 

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.280
the surface from bodies of water or even
from the ground that water's then going

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:08.290
from the ground that water's then going
 

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.500
from the ground that water's then going
up into the air microscopically

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:10.510
up into the air microscopically
 

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.750
up into the air microscopically
condenses into clouds and then obviously

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760
condenses into clouds and then obviously
 

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.210
condenses into clouds and then obviously
sort of comes back down but creating a

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:15.220
sort of comes back down but creating a
 

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:21.090
sort of comes back down but creating a
synthetic cloud what we did here is this

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.100
synthetic cloud what we did here is this
 

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.570
synthetic cloud what we did here is this
goes down into a tidal stream here's the

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:24.580
goes down into a tidal stream here's the
 

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.700
goes down into a tidal stream here's the
main bridge you entered the Olympic Park

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:26.710
main bridge you entered the Olympic Park
 

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.590
main bridge you entered the Olympic Park
on this bridge you go over this tidal

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.600
on this bridge you go over this tidal
 

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.870
on this bridge you go over this tidal
stream we're taking the water from the

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880
stream we're taking the water from the
 

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.580
stream we're taking the water from the
stream and filtering and pumping it up

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:32.590
stream and filtering and pumping it up
 

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.440
stream and filtering and pumping it up
these mass which you can see i'll just

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:37.450
these mass which you can see i'll just
 

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.880
these mass which you can see i'll just
show you the mass come across they

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:38.890
show you the mass come across they
 

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.490
show you the mass come across they
create a threshold that everybody walks

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:41.500
create a threshold that everybody walks
 

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.080
create a threshold that everybody walks
through so you've creating this cloud

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.090
through so you've creating this cloud
 

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.540
through so you've creating this cloud
that sort of floats across here and then

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:45.550
that sort of floats across here and then
 

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.920
that sort of floats across here and then
there's another device in the distance

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:46.930
there's another device in the distance
 

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.120
there's another device in the distance
there which I'll explain to you in a

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.130
there which I'll explain to you in a
 

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.970
there which I'll explain to you in a
moment which is also a heliostat and

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:50.980
moment which is also a heliostat and
 

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.740
moment which is also a heliostat and
this is what we're trying to do we're

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:52.750
this is what we're trying to do we're
 

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.230
this is what we're trying to do we're
trying to create essentially like a

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240
trying to create essentially like a
 

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.180
trying to create essentially like a
mirage like how do you in the middle of

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.190
mirage like how do you in the middle of
 

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.000
mirage like how do you in the middle of

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.010
the day under a bright blue sky direct
 

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.820
the day under a bright blue sky direct
Sun how do you create forms

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:02.830
Sun how do you create forms
 

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.539
Sun how do you create forms
space so people sort of see it so these

these these broad beams of light just in

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:17.980
these these broad beams of light just in
 

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.490
these these broad beams of light just in

the middle of the day appears in the sky
and it has a lot to do with filtration I

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:22.539
and it has a lot to do with filtration I
 

00:19:22.539 --> 00:19:25.230

mean if this is a regular mirror you

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240
mean if this is a regular mirror you
 

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.630
mean if this is a regular mirror you
wouldn't see this because its all full

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640
wouldn't see this because its all full
 

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.880
wouldn't see this because its all full
spectrum light if you bounce back full

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:29.890
spectrum light if you bounce back full
 

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.470
spectrum light if you bounce back full
spectrum light your eye doesn't see it

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480
spectrum light your eye doesn't see it
 

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.240
spectrum light your eye doesn't see it
but if you filter the light we're

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.250
but if you filter the light we're
 

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.590
but if you filter the light we're
letting all the blue light go through

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600
letting all the blue light go through
 

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.029
letting all the blue light go through
and we're only bouncing back yellow

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039
and we're only bouncing back yellow
 

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:38.340
and we're only bouncing back yellow
light so your eyes very sensitive to

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:38.350
light so your eyes very sensitive to
 

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.080
light so your eyes very sensitive to
yellow and all of a sudden you see it

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.090
yellow and all of a sudden you see it
 

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.659
yellow and all of a sudden you see it
and we're taking that whole thing into

00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:42.669
and we're taking that whole thing into
 

00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:44.789
and we're taking that whole thing into

of installing couple these mass the top

00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:47.409
of installing couple these mass the top
 

00:19:47.409 --> 00:19:51.299
of installing couple these mass the top
part of the mass the top 5 meters is for

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:51.309
part of the mass the top 5 meters is for
 

00:19:51.309 --> 00:19:52.710
part of the mass the top 5 meters is for
the misting system and then this is the

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720
the misting system and then this is the
 

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.350
the misting system and then this is the
mirror which is about a half a kilometer

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360
mirror which is about a half a kilometer
 

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.669
mirror which is about a half a kilometer
away up on its own mast and what happens

00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679
away up on its own mast and what happens
 

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:02.100
away up on its own mast and what happens
is this basically the mass create this

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.110
is this basically the mass create this
 

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.789
is this basically the mass create this
synthetic cloud overhead Sun comes down

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799
synthetic cloud overhead Sun comes down
 

00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:07.350
synthetic cloud overhead Sun comes down
hits the mirror a lot of the lights

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360
hits the mirror a lot of the lights
 

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.549
hits the mirror a lot of the lights
going through the mirror but the yellow

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559
going through the mirror but the yellow
 

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:10.049
going through the mirror but the yellow
light is sort of being bounced back so

00:20:10.049 --> 00:20:10.059
light is sort of being bounced back so
 

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:11.779
light is sort of being bounced back so
all of a sudden overhead you get these

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:11.789
all of a sudden overhead you get these
 

00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:14.159
all of a sudden overhead you get these
ribbons of light that sort of appear

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:14.169
ribbons of light that sort of appear
 

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:17.039
ribbons of light that sort of appear
overhead and it's obviously the first

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:17.049
overhead and it's obviously the first
 

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.600
overhead and it's obviously the first
principle is simply that the light is

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:18.610
principle is simply that the light is
 

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.250
principle is simply that the light is
always around us the light is always

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:20.260
always around us the light is always
 

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.009
always around us the light is always
there only when it hits the surface to

00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:23.019
there only when it hits the surface to
 

00:20:23.019 --> 00:20:25.409
there only when it hits the surface to
you acknowledge it right so it's there

00:20:25.409 --> 00:20:25.419
you acknowledge it right so it's there
 

00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:27.659
you acknowledge it right so it's there
so that's all about the presence of

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:27.669
so that's all about the presence of
 

00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:29.370
so that's all about the presence of
light and the surface upon which it

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:29.380
light and the surface upon which it
 

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.379
light and the surface upon which it
falls that makes it a way it makes you

00:20:31.379 --> 00:20:31.389
falls that makes it a way it makes you
 

00:20:31.389 --> 00:20:33.409
falls that makes it a way it makes you
aware of it so this is really all about

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419
aware of it so this is really all about
 

00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:35.850
aware of it so this is really all about
weather conditions like occasionally

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:35.860
weather conditions like occasionally
 

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.710
weather conditions like occasionally
there makes this sort of form sometimes

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720
there makes this sort of form sometimes
 

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.840
there makes this sort of form sometimes
they're like localized sometimes this

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:39.850
they're like localized sometimes this
 

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.430
they're like localized sometimes this
beam of light will be two kilometers

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440
beam of light will be two kilometers
 

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.529
beam of light will be two kilometers
long it's like a solid bar of life it

00:20:43.529 --> 00:20:43.539
long it's like a solid bar of life it
 

00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:45.060
long it's like a solid bar of life it
goes for about two kilometers and just

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.070
goes for about two kilometers and just
 

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.180
goes for about two kilometers and just
sort of see it in sky overhead so it's

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.190
sort of see it in sky overhead so it's
 

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.399
sort of see it in sky overhead so it's
it's the same principle obviously that's

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:50.409
it's the same principle obviously that's
 

00:20:50.409 --> 00:20:51.570
it's the same principle obviously that's
happening back here and the clouds

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:51.580
happening back here and the clouds
 

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.600
happening back here and the clouds
beyond it Suns coming down it's

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:54.610
beyond it Suns coming down it's
 

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.980
beyond it Suns coming down it's
illuminating the top of the cloud the

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:55.990
illuminating the top of the cloud the
 

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.600
illuminating the top of the cloud the
cloud so dense that the light can't get

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:57.610
cloud so dense that the light can't get
 

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:58.950
cloud so dense that the light can't get
through and therefore it appears to be

00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960
through and therefore it appears to be
 

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.470
through and therefore it appears to be
dark underneath so we're basically just

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480
dark underneath so we're basically just
 

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.029
dark underneath so we're basically just
taking that instead of sunlight coming

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039
taking that instead of sunlight coming
 

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:04.289
taking that instead of sunlight coming
down we're sort of bringing it

00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:04.299
down we're sort of bringing it
 

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:06.490
down we're sort of bringing it
projecting it horizontally

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:06.500
projecting it horizontally
 

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.790
projecting it horizontally
and that's at sunset it looks looks

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:09.800
and that's at sunset it looks looks
 

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.120
and that's at sunset it looks looks
quite different at sunset and then so

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:13.130
quite different at sunset and then so
 

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.070
quite different at sunset and then so
anyway those are arranged things we do a

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080
anyway those are arranged things we do a
 

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.390
anyway those are arranged things we do a
lot of those types of projects because

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400
lot of those types of projects because
 

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.440
lot of those types of projects because
they're great and fun and sort of fun to

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:20.450
they're great and fun and sort of fun to
 

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.820
they're great and fun and sort of fun to
explore them and do the development on

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:21.830
explore them and do the development on
 

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.890
explore them and do the development on
them and they let you look at different

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:23.900
them and they let you look at different
 

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.200
them and they let you look at different
phenomenon in a more experimental way

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.210
phenomenon in a more experimental way
 

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.350
phenomenon in a more experimental way
and then we do a lot of work on

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.360
and then we do a lot of work on
 

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.310
and then we do a lot of work on
buildings all over the world this is the

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320
buildings all over the world this is the
 

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.050
buildings all over the world this is the

original building was built 1928 new

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:38.510
original building was built 1928 new
 

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.630
original building was built 1928 new
building was done with Foster and we do

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640
building was done with Foster and we do
 

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.970
building was done with Foster and we do
a lot of work with Foster I worked on

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:42.980
a lot of work with Foster I worked on
 

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.140
a lot of work with Foster I worked on
his very first building a Hong Kong

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.150
his very first building a Hong Kong
 

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.440
his very first building a Hong Kong
Shanghai Bank a million years ago but we

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:47.450
Shanghai Bank a million years ago but we
 

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.860
Shanghai Bank a million years ago but we
were asked to take that this is the

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:50.870
were asked to take that this is the
 

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.870
were asked to take that this is the
historic building facade here it's a

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880
historic building facade here it's a
 

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.340
historic building facade here it's a
section through the building you're

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:54.350
section through the building you're
 

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.840
section through the building you're
looking at the Stork facade on eighth

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:55.850
looking at the Stork facade on eighth
 

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.180
looking at the Stork facade on eighth
Avenue and then the beginning of the new

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:58.190
Avenue and then the beginning of the new
 

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.300
Avenue and then the beginning of the new
tower behind it is how how you bring

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:01.310
tower behind it is how how you bring
 

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.400
tower behind it is how how you bring
people into that original entry up to

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:03.410
people into that original entry up to
 

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.860
people into that original entry up to
the new Lobby so we worked on

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:05.870
the new Lobby so we worked on
 

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.380
the new Lobby so we worked on
establishing these large skylights in

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:08.390
establishing these large skylights in
 

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.230
establishing these large skylights in
the space and then primarily design this

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240
the space and then primarily design this
 

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.660
the space and then primarily design this
element here which is made out of glass

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:13.670
element here which is made out of glass
 

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.730
element here which is made out of glass
it's a glass wall it's three stories

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:15.740
it's a glass wall it's three stories
 

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.340
it's a glass wall it's three stories
high and the escalators come up through

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:18.350
high and the escalators come up through
 

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.730
high and the escalators come up through
it but it's linked to sort of the

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:21.740
it but it's linked to sort of the
 

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.860
it but it's linked to sort of the
management the cooling systems of the

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:23.870
management the cooling systems of the
 

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.690
management the cooling systems of the
building we take the rain water off the

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:25.700
building we take the rain water off the
 

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.420
building we take the rain water off the
roof we bring it down it's stored below

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:28.430
roof we bring it down it's stored below
 

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.390
roof we bring it down it's stored below
this surface and it's chilled the

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400
this surface and it's chilled the
 

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.670
this surface and it's chilled the
chilled water is sort of brought up and

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:33.680
chilled water is sort of brought up and
 

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.170
chilled water is sort of brought up and
then run over the surface so chilled

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:35.180
then run over the surface so chilled
 

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.060
then run over the surface so chilled
water is very cold waters run over that

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.070
water is very cold waters run over that
 

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.830
water is very cold waters run over that
surface and it creates a whole

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840
surface and it creates a whole
 

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.500
surface and it creates a whole
convection current in the space and the

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:41.510
convection current in the space and the
 

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.990
convection current in the space and the
humidity basically condenses on that

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000
humidity basically condenses on that
 

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.450
humidity basically condenses on that
cold water surface so you're using water

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:46.460
cold water surface so you're using water
 

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.000
cold water surface so you're using water
as a dehumidification system and cooling

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.010
as a dehumidification system and cooling
 

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.610
as a dehumidification system and cooling
system in the lobby so on one hand it's

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:51.620
system in the lobby so on one hand it's
 

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.740
system in the lobby so on one hand it's
a cooling system secondarily you're

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:53.750
a cooling system secondarily you're
 

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.780
a cooling system secondarily you're
taking all this daylight and much like a

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:55.790
taking all this daylight and much like a
 

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.400
taking all this daylight and much like a
periscope you're taking this bright

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:57.410
periscope you're taking this bright
 

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.650
periscope you're taking this bright
light bringing it down and bouncing it

00:22:59.650 --> 00:22:59.660
light bringing it down and bouncing it
 

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.790
light bringing it down and bouncing it
out to the street so when you're on the

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:00.800
out to the street so when you're on the
 

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.320
out to the street so when you're on the
street you look into the building

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.330
street you look into the building
 

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.200
street you look into the building
instead of seeing a dark volume or dark

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.210
instead of seeing a dark volume or dark
 

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.030
instead of seeing a dark volume or dark
lobby it's a very bright surface and it

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.040
lobby it's a very bright surface and it
 

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.660
lobby it's a very bright surface and it
brings you in so the way we just work

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:10.670
brings you in so the way we just work
 

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.110
brings you in so the way we just work
with cast glass here these are machine

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120
with cast glass here these are machine
 

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.080
with cast glass here these are machine
graphite molds and pouring the glass

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.090
graphite molds and pouring the glass
 

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.130
graphite molds and pouring the glass
these big casting

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:18.140
these big casting
 

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.810
these big casting
they're like there may be that long and

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:19.820
they're like there may be that long and
 

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.180
they're like there may be that long and
that's thick they're basically prisms

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:22.190
that's thick they're basically prisms
 

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.880
that's thick they're basically prisms
and then those prisms are laid up into

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:24.890
and then those prisms are laid up into
 

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.000
and then those prisms are laid up into
this wall system and below this is so

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.010
this wall system and below this is so
 

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.090
this wall system and below this is so
chilled water system underneath there

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.100
chilled water system underneath there
 

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.320
chilled water system underneath there
and then when you walk in this way to

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:32.330
and then when you walk in this way to
 

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.510
and then when you walk in this way to
Caesar walk in it's acting as a

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520
Caesar walk in it's acting as a
 

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.490
Caesar walk in it's acting as a
periscope so by looking at that surface

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:36.500
periscope so by looking at that surface
 

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.480
periscope so by looking at that surface
you're actually looking at the light

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:37.490
you're actually looking at the light
 

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.370
you're actually looking at the light
that's directly overhead and then the

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:39.380
that's directly overhead and then the
 

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.650
that's directly overhead and then the
water is running over that cooling the

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:41.660
water is running over that cooling the
 

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.380
water is running over that cooling the
space but the water also serves the

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:44.390
space but the water also serves the
 

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.720
space but the water also serves the
purpose of the population of this

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:46.730
purpose of the population of this
 

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.810
purpose of the population of this
building is about 3,500 people you know

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:49.820
building is about 3,500 people you know
 

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.430
building is about 3,500 people you know
so there's that many people coming and

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440
so there's that many people coming and
 

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.490
so there's that many people coming and
going a very large dining area upon the

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:54.500
going a very large dining area upon the
 

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.530
going a very large dining area upon the
supper floor suits at times you have big

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:56.540
supper floor suits at times you have big
 

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.750
supper floor suits at times you have big
high populations of people than very few

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760
high populations of people than very few
 

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.350
high populations of people than very few
people so the water flow is actually

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360
people so the water flow is actually
 

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.020
people so the water flow is actually
choreographed the number of people so

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.030
choreographed the number of people so
 

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.970
choreographed the number of people so
you'd be greater cooling when there's

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:06.980
you'd be greater cooling when there's
 

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.320
you'd be greater cooling when there's
greater numbers of people you need the

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:08.330
greater numbers of people you need the
 

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.300
greater numbers of people you need the
white noise to sort of cancel out the

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:10.310
white noise to sort of cancel out the
 

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.030
white noise to sort of cancel out the
sound in a space at that same time so

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:13.040
sound in a space at that same time so
 

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.830
sound in a space at that same time so
it's always considered this whole

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840
it's always considered this whole
 

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.510
it's always considered this whole
flowing surface next you as you go up

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520
flowing surface next you as you go up
 

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.170
flowing surface next you as you go up
and down so this is something that we do

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:20.180
and down so this is something that we do
 

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.440
and down so this is something that we do
a lot of and and and really try to seek

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:23.450
a lot of and and and really try to seek
 

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.000
a lot of and and and really try to seek
out projects to do these types of things

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.010
out projects to do these types of things
 

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.030
out projects to do these types of things
where it's combining sort of them the

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:28.040
where it's combining sort of them the
 

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.100
where it's combining sort of them the
maintenance issues of the building by

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:30.110
maintenance issues of the building by
 

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.900
maintenance issues of the building by
how do you cool the building how do you

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:31.910
how do you cool the building how do you
 

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.490
how do you cool the building how do you
change qualities of acoustics in the

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:33.500
change qualities of acoustics in the
 

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.750
change qualities of acoustics in the
building how do you do the light

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760
building how do you do the light
 

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.340
building how do you do the light
qualities and building how does

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:36.350
qualities and building how does
 

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.140
qualities and building how does
something which in one hand just as very

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:38.150
something which in one hand just as very
 

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.170
something which in one hand just as very
beautiful object or sculpture in itself

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:41.180
beautiful object or sculpture in itself
 

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.260
beautiful object or sculpture in itself
but how do you overlay on that something

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.270
but how do you overlay on that something
 

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.410
but how do you overlay on that something
that's a little richer and more you know

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:47.420
that's a little richer and more you know
 

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.840
that's a little richer and more you know
it's more of a giving opportunity within

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:49.850
it's more of a giving opportunity within
 

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.210
it's more of a giving opportunity within
the building and that's not dissimilar

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:52.220
the building and that's not dissimilar
 

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.690
the building and that's not dissimilar
to this project which I hope you may get

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:55.700
to this project which I hope you may get
 

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.030
to this project which I hope you may get
down to see this today but this is a

Trade Center site we began working on

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120
Trade Center site we began working on
 

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.990
Trade Center site we began working on
this in October actually just a

afterwards that would collapse but to
 

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.770
afterwards that would collapse but to
build two big buildings here familiar

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:14.780
build two big buildings here familiar
 

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.580

with her behind it they came down you

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:18.590
with her behind it they came down you
 

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.680
with her behind it they came down you
probably read about this building when

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:20.690
probably read about this building when
 

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.710
probably read about this building when
those big buildings came down around it

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720
those big buildings came down around it
 

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.830
those big buildings came down around it
the original building here had a lot of

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840
the original building here had a lot of
 

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.290
the original building here had a lot of
diesel fuel storage in the building it

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:29.300
diesel fuel storage in the building it
 

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.770
diesel fuel storage in the building it
had the New York City emergency response

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:32.780
had the New York City emergency response
 

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.660
had the New York City emergency response
headquarters was in the building and the

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:34.670
headquarters was in the building and the
 

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.120
headquarters was in the building and the
FBI and the CIA all of those agencies

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:37.130
FBI and the CIA all of those agencies
 

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.160
FBI and the CIA all of those agencies
were in the building and they had an

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:39.170
were in the building and they had an
 

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.810
were in the building and they had an
enormous amount of fuel storage because

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:40.820
enormous amount of fuel storage because
 

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.550
enormous amount of fuel storage because
they had offline generators so they

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:42.560
they had offline generators so they
 

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.170
they had offline generators so they
could just operate regardless of what

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:44.180
could just operate regardless of what
 

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.540
could just operate regardless of what
else was happening but the lower this is

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:46.550
else was happening but the lower this is
 

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.310
else was happening but the lower this is
particularly of interest perhaps to you

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320
particularly of interest perhaps to you
 

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.070
particularly of interest perhaps to you
the lower sixth floors of the building

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080
the lower sixth floors of the building
 

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.860
the lower sixth floors of the building
originally was a power substation so the

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:53.870
originally was a power substation so the
 

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.200
originally was a power substation so the
power coming into the city came into the

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:56.210
power coming into the city came into the
 

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.800
power coming into the city came into the
substation and then above the substation

00:25:59.800 --> 00:25:59.810
substation and then above the substation
 

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.590
substation and then above the substation
had these big transfer trusses so the

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600
had these big transfer trusses so the
 

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.240
had these big transfer trusses so the
building's collapse Billy came down

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:04.250
building's collapse Billy came down
 

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.560
building's collapse Billy came down
everybody got out of the built building

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:05.570
everybody got out of the built building
 

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.320
everybody got out of the built building
safely but at the diesel fuel in that

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:08.330
safely but at the diesel fuel in that
 

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.510
safely but at the diesel fuel in that
original building caught on fire

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520
original building caught on fire
 

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.950
original building caught on fire
eventually softened the trusses and then

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960
eventually softened the trusses and then
 

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.280
eventually softened the trusses and then
they building collapsed on itself so it

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:15.290
they building collapsed on itself so it
 

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.470
they building collapsed on itself so it
was a much bigger building than the the

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480
was a much bigger building than the the
 

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.730
was a much bigger building than the the
two towers and in terms of square

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:18.740
two towers and in terms of square
 

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.950
two towers and in terms of square
footage but the reason this building was

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960
footage but the reason this building was
 

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.140
footage but the reason this building was
built so quickly is that they had to get

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:23.150
built so quickly is that they had to get
 

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.270
built so quickly is that they had to get
this power substation up and operational

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:25.280
this power substation up and operational
 

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.060
this power substation up and operational
as quickly as possible because all the

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.070
as quickly as possible because all the
 

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.800
as quickly as possible because all the
power for the road Trade Center site and

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:29.810
power for the road Trade Center site and
 

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.780
power for the road Trade Center site and
much of the power for downtown Manhattan

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:31.790
much of the power for downtown Manhattan
 

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.640
much of the power for downtown Manhattan
came through this building so this is

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:33.650
came through this building so this is
 

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.530
came through this building so this is
the this is the you know this is many

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:35.540
the this is the you know this is many
 

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.820
the this is the you know this is many
years later this is like 2004 after all

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:39.830
years later this is like 2004 after all
 

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.260
years later this is like 2004 after all
the excavation work and the new

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.270
the excavation work and the new
 

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.450
the excavation work and the new
foundations coming up this is basically

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:43.460
foundations coming up this is basically
 

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.210
foundations coming up this is basically
the power substation so the lower eight

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.220
the power substation so the lower eight
 

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.770
the power substation so the lower eight
floors of the building is basically

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:47.780
floors of the building is basically
 

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.550
floors of the building is basically
solid concrete box and it has five big

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:51.560
solid concrete box and it has five big
 

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.680
solid concrete box and it has five big
transformers on the north side and five

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:53.690
transformers on the north side and five
 

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.990
transformers on the north side and five
on the south side and the lobby is

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000
on the south side and the lobby is
 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.540
on the south side and the lobby is
basically shoehorned between the

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:58.550
basically shoehorned between the
 

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.630
basically shoehorned between the
substation and these are big

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640
substation and these are big
 

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.720
substation and these are big
transformers these are you know almost

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:04.730
transformers these are you know almost
 

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.790

are like they come in by boat they come

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:08.690
are like they come in by boat they come
 

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.430
are like they come in by boat they come
in by barge and they're put in here and

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440
in by barge and they're put in here and
 

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.930
in by barge and they're put in here and
so we were involved we have hired by the

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:13.940
so we were involved we have hired by the

that we were charged with the

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640
that we were charged with the
 

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.830
that we were charged with the
development of whole exterior of the

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840
development of whole exterior of the
 

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.740
development of whole exterior of the
building so the first order of business

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:23.750
building so the first order of business
 

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.810
building so the first order of business
was like you have a concrete power

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:25.820
was like you have a concrete power
 

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.180
was like you have a concrete power
substation in that center of downtown

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:28.190
substation in that center of downtown
 

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.430

Manhattan that whole part of the city's
going to change its going to be more of

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:31.670
going to change its going to be more of
 

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:32.950
going to change its going to be more of
a cultural center it's going to be a

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960
a cultural center it's going to be a
 

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.840
a cultural center it's going to be a
more active pedestrian environment that

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:34.850
more active pedestrian environment that
 

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.360
more active pedestrian environment that
it used to be so this building had to be

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:37.370
it used to be so this building had to be
 

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.180
it used to be so this building had to be
something better than what you would

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:40.190
something better than what you would
 

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.820
something better than what you would
conventionally think our con Edison

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:42.830
conventionally think our con Edison
 

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.330
conventionally think our con Edison
friends would provide so we were hired

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:45.340
friends would provide so we were hired
 

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.740
friends would provide so we were hired
both by the building developer and by

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:47.750
both by the building developer and by
 

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.720
both by the building developer and by
the power company to develop the whole

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:49.730
the power company to develop the whole
 

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.370
the power company to develop the whole
exterior of the building so this part of

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:51.380
exterior of the building so this part of
 

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.680
exterior of the building so this part of
the building which is where the

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:53.690
the building which is where the
 

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.710
the building which is where the
transformers are had to be fifty percent

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720
transformers are had to be fifty percent
 

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.190
transformers are had to be fifty percent
open for natural ventilation and then we

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200
open for natural ventilation and then we
 

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.530
open for natural ventilation and then we
needed to come up with a concept that

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:02.540
needed to come up with a concept that
 

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.620
needed to come up with a concept that
would allow us to develop an idea so the

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:05.630
would allow us to develop an idea so the
 

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.840
would allow us to develop an idea so the
whole notion of the entire tower is

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:07.850
whole notion of the entire tower is
 

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.290
whole notion of the entire tower is
about light so there's two surfaces

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:11.300
about light so there's two surfaces
 

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.120
about light so there's two surfaces
there's an exterior surface of the tower

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.130
there's an exterior surface of the tower
 

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:15.520
there's an exterior surface of the tower
and then just set back from that

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:15.530
and then just set back from that
 

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.620
and then just set back from that
external surface is another surface

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:17.630
external surface is another surface
 

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.170
external surface is another surface
which is about eight inches back so both

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:20.180
which is about eight inches back so both
 

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.140
which is about eight inches back so both
of those surfaces are meant to capture

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.150
of those surfaces are meant to capture
 

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.480
of those surfaces are meant to capture
qualities of light that are unique to

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:24.490
qualities of light that are unique to
 

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.580
qualities of light that are unique to
Manhattan or New York qualities of light

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:27.590
Manhattan or New York qualities of light
 

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.580
Manhattan or New York qualities of light
downtown Manhattan and the idea here is

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:30.590
downtown Manhattan and the idea here is
 

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:34.030
downtown Manhattan and the idea here is
these are a company that we began to

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:34.040
these are a company that we began to
 

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.970
these are a company that we began to
work with two that may actually make

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:36.980
work with two that may actually make
 

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.530
work with two that may actually make
mining equipment they've never done

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:38.540
mining equipment they've never done
 

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.200
mining equipment they've never done
architectural project before and water

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:41.210
architectural project before and water
 

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.060
architectural project before and water
filtration systems but we began

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.070
filtration systems but we began
 

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.650
filtration systems but we began
developed this system where there's a

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:44.660
developed this system where there's a
 

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.300
developed this system where there's a
outer surface of these heavier stainless

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:49.310
outer surface of these heavier stainless
 

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.090
outer surface of these heavier stainless
steel ribs prisms and then there's an

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:52.100
steel ribs prisms and then there's an
 

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.250
steel ribs prisms and then there's an
inner surface of these these prisms and

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:54.260
inner surface of these these prisms and
 

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:59.020
inner surface of these these prisms and
those panels would then be put up onto

00:28:59.020 --> 00:28:59.030
those panels would then be put up onto
 

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.750
those panels would then be put up onto
the building and in the daytime the

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760
the building and in the daytime the
 

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.970
the building and in the daytime the
daylight wing would interact with this

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:03.980
daylight wing would interact with this
 

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.830
daylight wing would interact with this
outer surface and you would get effects

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840
outer surface and you would get effects
 

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.230
outer surface and you would get effects
like that and then at nighttime it would

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240
like that and then at nighttime it would
 

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.270
like that and then at nighttime it would
interact with the inner surface so in

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:10.280
interact with the inner surface so in
 

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.450
interact with the inner surface so in
the daytime you tend to see these other

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:13.460
the daytime you tend to see these other
 

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.120
the daytime you tend to see these other
surfaces this is the base of the

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.130
surfaces this is the base of the
 

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.320
surfaces this is the base of the
building coming up and some of the

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:17.330
building coming up and some of the
 

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.180
building coming up and some of the
earlier earlier panels going on the

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:19.190
earlier earlier panels going on the
 

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.430
earlier earlier panels going on the
building but you end up with this I mean

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440
building but you end up with this I mean
 

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.880
building but you end up with this I mean
you end up with a skin that works on the

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:24.890
you end up with a skin that works on the
 

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.450
you end up with a skin that works on the
principle of your eye typically when

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:28.460
principle of your eye typically when
 

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.370
principle of your eye typically when
your eye looks at something

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:30.380
your eye looks at something
 

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.560
your eye looks at something
it looks at the brightest surface and

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:32.570
it looks at the brightest surface and
 

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.020
it looks at the brightest surface and
then your eye tends to let's stop at

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:35.030
then your eye tends to let's stop at
 

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.510
then your eye tends to let's stop at
that surface it doesn't really challenge

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520
that surface it doesn't really challenge
 

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.390
that surface it doesn't really challenge
you to see beyond that surface so the

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:40.400
you to see beyond that surface so the
 

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.550
you to see beyond that surface so the
daytime you sort of see the surface and

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:42.560
daytime you sort of see the surface and
 

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.310
daytime you sort of see the surface and
by rotating the prisms slightly on the

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320
by rotating the prisms slightly on the
 

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.200
by rotating the prisms slightly on the
surface it's basically just reflecting

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.210
surface it's basically just reflecting
 

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:49.810
surface it's basically just reflecting
two slightly different views there's

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:49.820
two slightly different views there's
 

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.120
two slightly different views there's
nothing this is just about reflected

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.130
nothing this is just about reflected
 

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.220
nothing this is just about reflected
light and then diffusing it slightly so

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:54.230
light and then diffusing it slightly so
 

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.450
light and then diffusing it slightly so
it's not a mirror it's just slightly

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:55.460
it's not a mirror it's just slightly
 

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.190
it's not a mirror it's just slightly
less than the mirror so you get this

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200
less than the mirror so you get this
 

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.980
less than the mirror so you get this
sort of quality of light in the daytime

00:29:59.980 --> 00:29:59.990
sort of quality of light in the daytime
 

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.010
sort of quality of light in the daytime
and then at nighttime we're illuminating

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.020
and then at nighttime we're illuminating
 

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.170
and then at nighttime we're illuminating
the inner surface of the screen so

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:05.180
the inner surface of the screen so
 

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.320
the inner surface of the screen so
inside behind that outer surface are LED

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:08.330
inside behind that outer surface are LED
 

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:10.270
inside behind that outer surface are LED
lights that illuminate that inner screen

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:10.280
lights that illuminate that inner screen
 

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.150
lights that illuminate that inner screen
so you see the nighttime view there so

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.160
so you see the nighttime view there so
 

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.180
so you see the nighttime view there so
the principle is simply the wall is 50%

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:16.190
the principle is simply the wall is 50%
 

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.950
the principle is simply the wall is 50%
opens if you walk up to this you look

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960
opens if you walk up to this you look
 

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.380
opens if you walk up to this you look
right through it but by lighting the

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:20.390
right through it but by lighting the
 

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.420
right through it but by lighting the
outer surface with daylight you think

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:22.430
outer surface with daylight you think
 

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.680
outer surface with daylight you think
that's the surface of the building

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:23.690
that's the surface of the building
 

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.390
that's the surface of the building
letting the inner surface you think

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:25.400
letting the inner surface you think
 

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.710
letting the inner surface you think
that's the building and you never your I

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720
that's the building and you never your I
 

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.980
that's the building and you never your I
never looks back to see the Transformers

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:29.990
never looks back to see the Transformers
 

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.890
never looks back to see the Transformers
behind it so here you have a view of

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:32.900
behind it so here you have a view of
 

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.840
behind it so here you have a view of
that on the outside and it's linked up

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:34.850
that on the outside and it's linked up
 

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.790
that on the outside and it's linked up
to a series of cameras that are

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:36.800
to a series of cameras that are
 

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.890
to a series of cameras that are
activated by people so the light

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:38.900
activated by people so the light
 

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.570
activated by people so the light
actually sort of tracks the movement of

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:40.580
actually sort of tracks the movement of
 

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.360
actually sort of tracks the movement of
people on the building and that's the

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:43.370
people on the building and that's the
 

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.230
people on the building and that's the
base of the building so it's all about

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240
base of the building so it's all about
 

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.390
base of the building so it's all about
working with daylight on the exterior of

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:49.400
working with daylight on the exterior of
 

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.980
working with daylight on the exterior of
the building it obviously has to deal

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:50.990
the building it obviously has to deal
 

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:52.780
the building it obviously has to deal
with issues of blast I mean the

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:52.790
with issues of blast I mean the
 

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.730
with issues of blast I mean the
Transformers exploding protecting the

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:54.740
Transformers exploding protecting the
 

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.020
Transformers exploding protecting the
pedestrian so it doesn't come out of the

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.030
pedestrian so it doesn't come out of the
 

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.760
pedestrian so it doesn't come out of the
street so it has all those overlays to

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:57.770
street so it has all those overlays to
 

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.710
street so it has all those overlays to
it and then the main entry of the

00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720
it and then the main entry of the
 

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.770
it and then the main entry of the
building this is the first building to

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:02.780
building this is the first building to
 

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.920
building this is the first building to
go up in downtown Manhattan and it's

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:05.930
go up in downtown Manhattan and it's
 

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.710
go up in downtown Manhattan and it's
actually what it is like the first leads

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720
actually what it is like the first leads
 

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.870
actually what it is like the first leads
silver building in the city but being

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880
silver building in the city but being
 

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.360
silver building in the city but being
the first building after nine eleven

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:13.370
the first building after nine eleven
 

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.520
the first building after nine eleven
there was an enormous amount of concern

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:15.530
there was an enormous amount of concern
 

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.340
there was an enormous amount of concern
as you might imagine about well people

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:18.350
as you might imagine about well people
 

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.770
as you might imagine about well people
can occupy big buildings again or not or

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:20.780
can occupy big buildings again or not or
 

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.390
can occupy big buildings again or not or
what do you do with a big building the

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:22.400
what do you do with a big building the
 

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.030
what do you do with a big building the
same location is it gonna be a sense of

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:24.040
same location is it gonna be a sense of
 

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.320
same location is it gonna be a sense of
whatever fear about being in the

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:26.330
whatever fear about being in the
 

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.850
whatever fear about being in the
building and then dirt is everybody

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:27.860
building and then dirt is everybody
 

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:28.810
building and then dirt is everybody
going to want the buildings would be

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:28.820
going to want the buildings would be
 

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.490
going to want the buildings would be
more closed and sense of security

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:30.500
more closed and sense of security
 

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.140
more closed and sense of security
through use of more concrete or

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:32.150
through use of more concrete or
 

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.920
through use of more concrete or
something but the principle that we were

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:34.930
something but the principle that we were
 

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.480
something but the principle that we were
working with here is how you provide the

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:37.490
working with here is how you provide the
 

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.240
working with here is how you provide the
highest level of secure

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:39.250
highest level of secure
 

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.820
highest level of secure
but nobody actually knows it so you keep

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:42.830
but nobody actually knows it so you keep
 

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.230
but nobody actually knows it so you keep
the building's they appear to be as open

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240
the building's they appear to be as open
 

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.800
the building's they appear to be as open
as possible and as Dale it as possible

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:46.810
as possible and as Dale it as possible
 

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.510
as possible and as Dale it as possible
and as welcoming as possible but this

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:49.520
and as welcoming as possible but this
 

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.090
and as welcoming as possible but this
whole wall system that's here and the

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:52.100
whole wall system that's here and the
 

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.790
whole wall system that's here and the
entries is all designed for very very

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:54.800
entries is all designed for very very
 

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.700
entries is all designed for very very
high blacks like truckload glass and you

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:57.710
high blacks like truckload glass and you
 

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.890
high blacks like truckload glass and you
can see these are cable systems the

00:31:59.890 --> 00:31:59.900
can see these are cable systems the
 

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.230
can see these are cable systems the
whole system is built on cables that

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240
whole system is built on cables that
 

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.230
whole system is built on cables that
allow for the force of a instantaneous

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240
allow for the force of a instantaneous
 

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.600
allow for the force of a instantaneous
explosion that that sort of wave of

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:07.610
explosion that that sort of wave of
 

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.460
explosion that that sort of wave of
force that comes off at the cable is

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:09.470
force that comes off at the cable is
 

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.440
force that comes off at the cable is
allowed or allowed to move the glass

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:11.450
allowed or allowed to move the glass
 

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.510
allowed or allowed to move the glass
panels actually slip and then on the

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:13.520
panels actually slip and then on the
 

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.310
panels actually slip and then on the
return they come back into position so

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320
return they come back into position so
 

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.650
return they come back into position so
the whole wall is built around

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:16.660
the whole wall is built around
 

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.420
the whole wall is built around
absorption of energy rather than pure

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:19.430
absorption of energy rather than pure
 

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.940
absorption of energy rather than pure
resistance of energy and then you go

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:21.950
resistance of energy and then you go
 

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.100
resistance of energy and then you go
into the building and then there's a

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.110
into the building and then there's a
 

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.900
into the building and then there's a
second wall there's another wall that

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:25.910
second wall there's another wall that
 

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.240
second wall there's another wall that
you'll see inside the building which was

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:28.250
you'll see inside the building which was
 

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.650
you'll see inside the building which was
a collaboration with an artist named

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:29.660
a collaboration with an artist named
 

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:33.100
a collaboration with an artist named
Jenny Holzer which has these tax led

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:33.110
Jenny Holzer which has these tax led
 

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.500
Jenny Holzer which has these tax led
texts on a surface and this again is

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:35.510
texts on a surface and this again is
 

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.350
texts on a surface and this again is
actually another blast wall that

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360
actually another blast wall that
 

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.970
actually another blast wall that
protects the elevator core of the

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:39.980
protects the elevator core of the
 

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.040
protects the elevator core of the
building so this is again like where we

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:42.050
building so this is again like where we
 

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.780
building so this is again like where we
get involved in something where it's

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:43.790
get involved in something where it's
 

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.570
get involved in something where it's
obviously an aesthetic goal but it's

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:46.580
obviously an aesthetic goal but it's
 

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.070
obviously an aesthetic goal but it's
overlaid with many other levels of

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080
overlaid with many other levels of
 

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.080
overlaid with many other levels of
concern whether its energy issues or

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:53.090
concern whether its energy issues or
 

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.060
concern whether its energy issues or
security issues but you don't want

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:55.070
security issues but you don't want
 

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.720
security issues but you don't want
people to recognize that as an overt

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:57.730
people to recognize that as an overt
 

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.010
people to recognize that as an overt
sort of effort it's just sort of put

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:00.020
sort of effort it's just sort of put
 

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.560
sort of effort it's just sort of put
into the system so that's the lobby part

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:02.570
into the system so that's the lobby part
 

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.870
into the system so that's the lobby part
of the building how that you'll see and

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880
of the building how that you'll see and
 

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.200
of the building how that you'll see and
then that's the overall building but the

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:08.210
then that's the overall building but the
 

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:11.740
then that's the overall building but the
other principle or point I just wanted

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:11.750
other principle or point I just wanted
 

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.060
other principle or point I just wanted
to make in this innocent in this brief

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:13.070
to make in this innocent in this brief
 

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:16.590
to make in this innocent in this brief
talk is that in working with light and

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600
talk is that in working with light and
 

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.360
talk is that in working with light and
when you're building buildings in the

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:19.370
when you're building buildings in the
 

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.890
when you're building buildings in the
city large scale buildings you're

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:20.900
city large scale buildings you're
 

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.430
city large scale buildings you're
obviously occupying a slice of a public

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440
obviously occupying a slice of a public
 

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.010
obviously occupying a slice of a public
resource I mean if you think of daylight

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:27.020
resource I mean if you think of daylight
 

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.290
resource I mean if you think of daylight
as a public resource buildings are

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:29.300
as a public resource buildings are
 

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.970
as a public resource buildings are
constantly occupying that public

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:30.980
constantly occupying that public
 

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.400
constantly occupying that public
resource so how does the building sort

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:33.410
resource so how does the building sort
 

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.250
resource so how does the building sort
of provide some return for that

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:36.260
of provide some return for that
 

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.710
of provide some return for that
occupancy and normally we always think

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720
occupancy and normally we always think
 

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.260
occupancy and normally we always think
about buildings for the occupant like

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:41.270
about buildings for the occupant like
 

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.180
about buildings for the occupant like
you've privatized the public resource

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:43.190
you've privatized the public resource
 

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.070
you've privatized the public resource
you have daylight we all deal with

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080
you have daylight we all deal with
 

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.610
you have daylight we all deal with
daylight for the occupied space

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:47.620
daylight for the occupied space
 

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.510
daylight for the occupied space
improving that work environment of

improving that work environment of
 

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.470
improving that work environment of
course that's what we're trying to do

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480
course that's what we're trying to do
 

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:50.760

make that a better environment for work

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:52.330
make that a better environment for work
 

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.390
make that a better environment for work
but simultaneously there needs to be a

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:54.400
but simultaneously there needs to be a
 

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.560
but simultaneously there needs to be a
reciprocal responsibility to provide

00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:58.570
reciprocal responsibility to provide
 

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.930
reciprocal responsibility to provide
light to the public and serve engaged

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:00.940
light to the public and serve engaged
 

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.600

the exterior of the building so the

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080
the exterior of the building so the
 

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.159
the exterior of the building so the
principle on this building was very

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:08.169
principle on this building was very
 

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:10.050
principle on this building was very
large lights of clear glass that run

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:10.060
large lights of clear glass that run
 

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.550
large lights of clear glass that run
floor to ceiling and in fact they go

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560
floor to ceiling and in fact they go

beyond the floor this little detail that
we developed where you're looking at a

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:15.610
we developed where you're looking at a
 

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:17.610
we developed where you're looking at a
section of the building this is what's

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:17.620
section of the building this is what's
 

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.770
section of the building this is what's
referred to as the spandrel section of

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:19.780
referred to as the spandrel section of
 

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.820
referred to as the spandrel section of
the building this is the structure of

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:20.830
the building this is the structure of
 

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.080
the building this is the structure of
the building where you have all your

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.090
the building where you have all your
 

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.840
the building where you have all your
steel and some of your sprinklers all of

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:24.850
steel and some of your sprinklers all of
 

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.520
steel and some of your sprinklers all of
that this would be the ceiling of one

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:26.530
that this would be the ceiling of one
 

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.169
that this would be the ceiling of one
office floor the glass comes right to

00:34:28.169 --> 00:34:28.179
office floor the glass comes right to
 

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.480
office floor the glass comes right to
the ceiling and starts down that glass

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:30.490
the ceiling and starts down that glass
 

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.120
the ceiling and starts down that glass
comes down it goes right past the floor

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:33.130
comes down it goes right past the floor
 

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.530
comes down it goes right past the floor
slab it's sealed at the back of the

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:34.540
slab it's sealed at the back of the
 

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.070
slab it's sealed at the back of the
floor slab comes down and overhangs the

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080
floor slab comes down and overhangs the
 

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.750
floor slab comes down and overhangs the
spandrel and then we've curved this

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760
spandrel and then we've curved this
 

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.940
spandrel and then we've curved this
spandrel panel at the back slightly so

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:41.950
spandrel panel at the back slightly so
 

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:44.760
spandrel panel at the back slightly so
it's actually like a slight lens and

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:44.770
it's actually like a slight lens and
 

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.060
it's actually like a slight lens and
then at the base what we've done is

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.070
then at the base what we've done is
 

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.340
then at the base what we've done is
introduced a reflector so conventionally

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:50.350
introduced a reflector so conventionally
 

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:51.630
introduced a reflector so conventionally
when you're looking up in a building

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:51.640
when you're looking up in a building
 

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.060
when you're looking up in a building
like this is looking at the spandrel

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.070
like this is looking at the spandrel
 

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.159
like this is looking at the spandrel
section it's like a slightly corrugated

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:56.169
section it's like a slightly corrugated
 

00:34:56.169 --> 00:34:58.380
section it's like a slightly corrugated
surface as you might imagine on the

00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:58.390
surface as you might imagine on the
 

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.630
surface as you might imagine on the
corrugation the sunlight the sunlights

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640
corrugation the sunlight the sunlights
 

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.580
corrugation the sunlight the sunlights
obviously hitting the top but what

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:02.590
obviously hitting the top but what
 

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.810
obviously hitting the top but what
you're looking at from the street is

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:03.820
you're looking at from the street is
 

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.060
you're looking at from the street is
actually the shadowed part of it and

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:06.070
actually the shadowed part of it and
 

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.320
actually the shadowed part of it and
this is like one of the phenomena if you

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:07.330
this is like one of the phenomena if you
 

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.210
this is like one of the phenomena if you
look in New York Times building it's one

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:09.220
look in New York Times building it's one
 

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.770
look in New York Times building it's one
of the phenomena why it appears darker

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:10.780
of the phenomena why it appears darker
 

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.850
of the phenomena why it appears darker
it's actually you're looking at the

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:11.860
it's actually you're looking at the
 

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.340
it's actually you're looking at the
surface that's getting back to you the

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:14.350
surface that's getting back to you the
 

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.720
surface that's getting back to you the
light from the ground rather than the

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:15.730
light from the ground rather than the
 

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.510
light from the ground rather than the
light from the Sun but the taking this

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.520
light from the Sun but the taking this
 

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.160
light from the Sun but the taking this
idea of what's in the shadow of the

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.170
idea of what's in the shadow of the
 

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.900
idea of what's in the shadow of the
corrugation we actually introduce a

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:21.910
corrugation we actually introduce a
 

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.750
corrugation we actually introduce a
reflector at the sill the light comes

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760
reflector at the sill the light comes
 

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.490
reflector at the sill the light comes
down and it bounces back up so we've

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:26.500
down and it bounces back up so we've
 

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.820
down and it bounces back up so we've
actually put blue light back up into the

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:29.830
actually put blue light back up into the
 

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.760
actually put blue light back up into the
shadow and the rationale for that is

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:32.770
shadow and the rationale for that is
 

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:36.810
shadow and the rationale for that is
that the blue light basically fills this

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:36.820
that the blue light basically fills this
 

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.750
that the blue light basically fills this
whole day lighting reflector and this is

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760
whole day lighting reflector and this is
 

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.400
whole day lighting reflector and this is
something you don't see on the building

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:41.410
something you don't see on the building
 

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.110
something you don't see on the building
because it's out it's outside and not

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:43.120
because it's out it's outside and not
 

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.820
because it's out it's outside and not
visible from below but there is this

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:44.830
visible from below but there is this
 

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.860
visible from below but there is this
blue reflector that runs around every

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:46.870
blue reflector that runs around every
 

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.440
blue reflector that runs around every
floor and the principle is that a blue

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:49.450
floor and the principle is that a blue
 

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.320
floor and the principle is that a blue
light when you look at the building

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:51.330
light when you look at the building
 

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.000
light when you look at the building
basically merges with the blue of the

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.010
basically merges with the blue of the
 

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.670
basically merges with the blue of the
sky around it so what is the structure

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:56.680
sky around it so what is the structure
 

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.000
sky around it so what is the structure
is given the same lighting level and

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.010
is given the same lighting level and
 

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.470
is given the same lighting level and
quality of light with the sky

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480
quality of light with the sky
 

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.290
quality of light with the sky
so it disappears often times then the

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:04.300
so it disappears often times then the
 

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.609
so it disappears often times then the
glass panels just look like they're

00:36:05.609 --> 00:36:05.619
glass panels just look like they're
 

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:08.010
glass panels just look like they're
floating down to get these cassettes of

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:08.020
floating down to get these cassettes of
 

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.109

daylighting reflectors just light up so

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200
daylighting reflectors just light up so
 

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.710
daylighting reflectors just light up so
you have in the upper part of the

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720
you have in the upper part of the
 

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.359
you have in the upper part of the
building you have the outer glass layer

00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:18.369
building you have the outer glass layer
 

00:36:18.369 --> 00:36:19.770
building you have the outer glass layer
which is giving you some of this

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:19.780
which is giving you some of this
 

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.320
which is giving you some of this
reflective quality here and then you

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:22.330
reflective quality here and then you
 

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:24.150
reflective quality here and then you
have this curved reflector which is sort

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160
have this curved reflector which is sort
 

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.250
have this curved reflector which is sort
of the sky-plane behind it so you have

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:26.260
of the sky-plane behind it so you have
 

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.530
of the sky-plane behind it so you have
that same dimension and as you come down

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:28.540
that same dimension and as you come down
 

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.730
that same dimension and as you come down
to the base of the building as I showed

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:29.740
to the base of the building as I showed
 

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.740

daylight and in their screen we're

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200
daylight and in their screen we're
 

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.470
daylight and in their screen we're
sleeping with our official light so the

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480
sleeping with our official light so the
 

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.240
sleeping with our official light so the
whole building has a dimension to it

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:39.250
whole building has a dimension to it
 

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.060

that's all about light striking multiple

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.070
that's all about light striking multiple
 

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:43.950
that's all about light striking multiple
surfaces and therefore the building

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960
surfaces and therefore the building
 

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.109
surfaces and therefore the building
becomes much richer it's no longer just

00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119
becomes much richer it's no longer just
 

00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:48.120
becomes much richer it's no longer just
a model of monolithic surface and it

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:48.130
a model of monolithic surface and it
 

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:52.440
a model of monolithic surface and it
takes on a more positive sort of quality

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:52.450
takes on a more positive sort of quality
 

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.960
takes on a more positive sort of quality
of light in the neighborhood and then

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:54.970
of light in the neighborhood and then
 

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.170
of light in the neighborhood and then
I'll just conclude quickly with this

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:58.180
I'll just conclude quickly with this
 

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.349
I'll just conclude quickly with this
last project which is thinking about

00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359
last project which is thinking about
 

00:37:01.359 --> 00:37:04.349
last project which is thinking about
light in a very different way where

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359
light in a very different way where
 

00:37:04.359 --> 00:37:05.720
light in a very different way where
you're working say in the Middle East

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:05.730
you're working say in the Middle East
 

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.980
you're working say in the Middle East
where you have enormous amount of light

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:07.990
where you have enormous amount of light
 

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.190
where you have enormous amount of light
of course and then how you bring those

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200
of course and then how you bring those
 

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.230
of course and then how you bring those
late levels down to a reasonable level

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.120
actually almost 20 meters below ground
so you're safe for us 60 feet below

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.130
so you're safe for us 60 feet below
 

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.280
so you're safe for us 60 feet below
ground how do you make that field day

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:05.290
ground how do you make that field day
 

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.530
ground how do you make that field day
lit how do you get people that are that

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:07.540
lit how do you get people that are that
 

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.090
lit how do you get people that are that
far below ground to feel like they're

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:09.100
far below ground to feel like they're
 

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.190
far below ground to feel like they're
connected to the landscape of nature and

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200
connected to the landscape of nature and
 

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.170
connected to the landscape of nature and
the quality is of light so we have these

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:13.180
the quality is of light so we have these
 

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.480
the quality is of light so we have these
courtyards outside that bring in light

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:15.490
courtyards outside that bring in light
 

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.430
courtyards outside that bring in light
and there's they're all grown plant

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440
and there's they're all grown plant
 

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.960
and there's they're all grown plant
so you have a sense of greenery along

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:18.970
so you have a sense of greenery along
 

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:20.970
so you have a sense of greenery along
here and then there's a water element

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:20.980
here and then there's a water element
 

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.010
here and then there's a water element
that runs along the whole walkway that

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:23.020
that runs along the whole walkway that
 

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.839
that runs along the whole walkway that
allows sunlight to come through it and

00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:24.849
allows sunlight to come through it and
 

00:40:24.849 --> 00:40:27.750
allows sunlight to come through it and
then animate that whole lower lower

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760
then animate that whole lower lower
 

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.190
then animate that whole lower lower
space so little sections of that new

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200
space so little sections of that new
 

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.079

buildings and equipment coming up all

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:34.089
buildings and equipment coming up all
 

00:40:34.089 --> 00:40:38.339
buildings and equipment coming up all
the way up into the space and and that

00:40:38.339 --> 00:40:38.349
the way up into the space and and that
 

00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:40.410
the way up into the space and and that
was that entry below ground and then for

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:40.420
was that entry below ground and then for
 

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.589
was that entry below ground and then for
the building's themselves above ground

00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599
the building's themselves above ground
 

00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:45.210
the building's themselves above ground
as I said wanting to build buildings out

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:45.220
as I said wanting to build buildings out
 

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.980
as I said wanting to build buildings out
of entirely out of just not even

then framed them or house them in these

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200
then framed them or house them in these
 

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.400
then framed them or house them in these
shading pavilions and we developed two

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:58.410
shading pavilions and we developed two
 

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.770
shading pavilions and we developed two
different configurations one shading

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:01.780
different configurations one shading
 

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.359
different configurations one shading

the building 11 elevation for those two

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160
the building 11 elevation for those two
 

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.089
the building 11 elevation for those two
exposures then a different shading

00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:15.099
exposures then a different shading
 

00:41:15.099 --> 00:41:16.530
exposures then a different shading
system for the north south which can be

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:16.540
system for the north south which can be
 

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.430
system for the north south which can be
much more open but the principle here is

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440
much more open but the principle here is
 

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.750

with these extrusions which I'll show

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760
with these extrusions which I'll show
 

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.510
with these extrusions which I'll show
you these are ceramic extrusions as the

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520
you these are ceramic extrusions as the

you these are ceramic extrusions as the
sunlight comes down and then it's design

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800
sunlight comes down and then it's design
 

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.319
sunlight comes down and then it's design
in such a way that it has a slight curve

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:28.329
in such a way that it has a slight curve
 

00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:31.230
in such a way that it has a slight curve
inside so the light hits on the outside

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240
inside so the light hits on the outside
 

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.660
inside so the light hits on the outside
and then the light bounces back and then

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:33.670
and then the light bounces back and then
 

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.280
and then the light bounces back and then
illuminates the inner surface so the

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:35.290
illuminates the inner surface so the
 

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:37.710
illuminates the inner surface so the
outer wall basically is taking or

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720
outer wall basically is taking or
 

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.450
outer wall basically is taking or
actually sloped a little bit taking the

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:39.460
actually sloped a little bit taking the
 

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.609
actually sloped a little bit taking the
light and bouncing it back on itself so

00:41:41.609 --> 00:41:41.619
light and bouncing it back on itself so
 

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:43.470
light and bouncing it back on itself so
when you're in the building the whole

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480
when you're in the building the whole
 

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.540
when you're in the building the whole

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:45.550
what you would think would be shadow or
 

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:48.059
what you would think would be shadow or
shaded is actually all illuminated with

00:41:48.059 --> 00:41:48.069
shaded is actually all illuminated with
 

00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:50.370
shaded is actually all illuminated with
very soft light and then you have this

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:50.380
very soft light and then you have this
 

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.870
very soft light and then you have this
phenomenon that happens which is

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880
phenomenon that happens which is
 

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.970
phenomenon that happens which is
demonstrated here is even though you

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:53.980
demonstrated here is even though you
 

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.190
demonstrated here is even though you
don't see what's outside is completely

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:56.200
don't see what's outside is completely
 

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.870
don't see what's outside is completely
blocked you don't have a direct vision

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880
blocked you don't have a direct vision
 

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.180
blocked you don't have a direct vision
you can actually see the shape of trees

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:00.190
you can actually see the shape of trees
 

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.069
you can actually see the shape of trees
and the color of trees and all of that

00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079
and the color of trees and all of that
 

00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:04.920
and the color of trees and all of that
soar in so it's again it's again a way

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:04.930
soar in so it's again it's again a way
 

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.710
soar in so it's again it's again a way
of trying to constantly engage people

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720
of trying to constantly engage people
 

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.650
of trying to constantly engage people
with landscape and qualities of nature

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:10.660
with landscape and qualities of nature
 

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.160
with landscape and qualities of nature
around you but just invent a way that

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.170
around you but just invent a way that
 

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:16.079
around you but just invent a way that
first and foremost protects you from the

first and foremost protects you from the
 

00:42:16.089 --> 00:42:19.050
first and foremost protects you from the
intensity of the light but still keeps

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:19.060
intensity of the light but still keeps
 

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.160

South elevation which you can obviously

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:21.430
South elevation which you can obviously
 

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.849
South elevation which you can obviously
see through that has a sort of an

00:42:23.849 --> 00:42:23.859
see through that has a sort of an
 

00:42:23.859 --> 00:42:26.430
see through that has a sort of an
unusual profile to it as well which does

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440
unusual profile to it as well which does
 

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.240
unusual profile to it as well which does
the same thing

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:27.250
the same thing
 

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:31.440
the same thing
and then there's oftentimes shaded areas

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:31.450
and then there's oftentimes shaded areas
 

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.990
and then there's oftentimes shaded areas
between the glazed areas so there's

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000
between the glazed areas so there's
 

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.560
between the glazed areas so there's
shaded cooler walking areas around the

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:37.570
shaded cooler walking areas around the
 

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.980
shaded cooler walking areas around the
outsides of the buildings and this is

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:40.990
outsides of the buildings and this is
 

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.870
outsides of the buildings and this is
walking under trellis area up into that

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880
walking under trellis area up into that
 

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.990
walking under trellis area up into that
below ground passage and you look you're

looking through the passage at the
 

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.620
looking through the passage at the
beginning and it continues off your left

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:49.630
beginning and it continues off your left
 

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.210
beginning and it continues off your left
here and you can see people walking on

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:51.220
here and you can see people walking on
 

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.860
here and you can see people walking on
the old paths up above there so you got

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:52.870
the old paths up above there so you got
 

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.960
the old paths up above there so you got
people walkin it to two different

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:54.970
people walkin it to two different
 

00:42:54.970 --> 00:43:00.890
people walkin it to two different
elevations and when you're in that space

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900
 

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.300
you sort of end up with this sort of

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:03.310
you sort of end up with this sort of
 

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:04.890
you sort of end up with this sort of
quality of light and the light is coming

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:04.900
quality of light and the light is coming
 

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.770
quality of light and the light is coming
in because we have this water element

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:07.780
in because we have this water element
 

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.020
in because we have this water element
overhead with light coming down that's

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.030
overhead with light coming down that's
 

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.090
overhead with light coming down that's
the diffused glass wall of the tunnel

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:12.100
the diffused glass wall of the tunnel
 

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.950
the diffused glass wall of the tunnel
with these courtyards that are sort of

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960
with these courtyards that are sort of
 

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:19.020
with these courtyards that are sort of
intermittent along the walkway so here

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.030
intermittent along the walkway so here
 

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.090
intermittent along the walkway so here
it is the glass so this is a little bit

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:21.100
it is the glass so this is a little bit
 

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.470
it is the glass so this is a little bit

hadn't really thought of this but if you

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:34.570
hadn't really thought of this but if you

hadn't really thought of this but if you
go back in the mechanical room which is

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:36.850
go back in the mechanical room which is
 

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.030
go back in the mechanical room which is
where the pumps are all that you can

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040
where the pumps are all that you can
 

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.770
where the pumps are all that you can
actually look right through it and we

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:40.780
actually look right through it and we
 

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:41.790
actually look right through it and we
said well this is like pretty

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800
said well this is like pretty
 

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.290
said well this is like pretty
spectacular so looking at all this water

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:43.300
spectacular so looking at all this water
 

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.210
spectacular so looking at all this water
coming down but nobody sees it except

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:45.220
coming down but nobody sees it except
 

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.460
coming down but nobody sees it except
the maintenance people so we actually

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:47.470
the maintenance people so we actually
 

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.920
the maintenance people so we actually
sort of then designed this whole system

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:49.930
sort of then designed this whole system
 

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.660
sort of then designed this whole system
so that you're down below you can look

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:51.670
so that you're down below you can look
 

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.730
so that you're down below you can look
up you actually the water's running over

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:53.740
up you actually the water's running over
 

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.320
up you actually the water's running over
the surface the Sun comes through the

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:55.330
the surface the Sun comes through the
 

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.050
the surface the Sun comes through the
water so that whole space is sort of

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060
water so that whole space is sort of
 

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:01.530
water so that whole space is sort of
animated by qualities of lights so these

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:01.540
animated by qualities of lights so these
 

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.730
animated by qualities of lights so these
are the other space you come out of that

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:02.740
are the other space you come out of that
 

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.950
are the other space you come out of that
below ground passage up into these new

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960
below ground passage up into these new
 

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.080
below ground passage up into these new
spaces that's sort of the quality of

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:07.090
spaces that's sort of the quality of
 

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.360
spaces that's sort of the quality of
light on that completely shaded surface

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:09.370
light on that completely shaded surface
 

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:13.950
light on that completely shaded surface
that you can see there and just give you

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960
that you can see there and just give you
 

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.120
that you can see there and just give you
a little sense of some of these spaces

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:15.130
a little sense of some of these spaces
 

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.350
a little sense of some of these spaces
so I guess just this last slide so just

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:19.360
so I guess just this last slide so just
 

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.920
so I guess just this last slide so just
in summary you know as architects and

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:22.930
in summary you know as architects and
 

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.220
in summary you know as architects and
designers I think that we do we do a lot

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:26.230
designers I think that we do we do a lot
 

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.410
designers I think that we do we do a lot
of work with as I said with Corning

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:28.420
of work with as I said with Corning
 

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.750
of work with as I said with Corning
Glass Works and

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760
Glass Works and
 

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.770
Glass Works and
we've done a lot of work with little bit

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:31.780
we've done a lot of work with little bit
 

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.210
we've done a lot of work with little bit
ax we've done a lot of thermo take

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:33.220
ax we've done a lot of thermo take
 

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.610
ax we've done a lot of thermo take
plants that are designed just for peak

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:35.620
plants that are designed just for peak
 

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.830
plants that are designed just for peak
production you know in Texas in Arizona

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:37.840

when everything those peak hours they

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:39.700
when everything those peak hours they
 

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.420
when everything those peak hours they
just are used only for two o'clock to

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:42.430
just are used only for two o'clock to
 

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:43.830
just are used only for two o'clock to
five o'clock in the afternoon that come

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:43.840
five o'clock in the afternoon that come
 

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.990
five o'clock in the afternoon that come
online but I think that this opportunity

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000
online but I think that this opportunity
 

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.990
online but I think that this opportunity
that glass currently is sort of offering

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000
that glass currently is sort of offering
 

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.790
that glass currently is sort of offering
with these very very thin glasses there

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800
with these very very thin glasses there
 

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.010
with these very very thin glasses there
are ways of introducing much higher

00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.020
are ways of introducing much higher
 

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.440
are ways of introducing much higher
technologies into the glass as a thin

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:01.450
technologies into the glass as a thin
 

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:03.630
technologies into the glass as a thin
film than there ever would have been on

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640
film than there ever would have been on
 

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.400
film than there ever would have been on
these thicker types of glasses the same

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:05.410
these thicker types of glasses the same
 

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.400
these thicker types of glasses the same
way we use glass today and we apply

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:08.410
way we use glass today and we apply
 

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.740
way we use glass today and we apply
coatings to it like loi coatings or

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:10.750
coatings to it like loi coatings or
 

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.930
coatings to it like loi coatings or
highly reflective coatings or you know

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:12.940
highly reflective coatings or you know
 

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.760
highly reflective coatings or you know
any type of instrumentation coatings to

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:14.770
any type of instrumentation coatings to
 

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:16.320
any type of instrumentation coatings to
it the glass is simply serving as a

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:16.330
it the glass is simply serving as a
 

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:18.990
it the glass is simply serving as a
substrate but with thin film glasses

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000
substrate but with thin film glasses
 

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.610
substrate but with thin film glasses
today which I said are you know

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:20.620
today which I said are you know
 

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.340
today which I said are you know
literally the thickness of the paper you

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:23.350
literally the thickness of the paper you
 

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:24.980
literally the thickness of the paper you
can actually introduce much higher

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:24.990
can actually introduce much higher
 

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.960
can actually introduce much higher
technologies to it for instance one of

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:27.970
technologies to it for instance one of
 

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.520
technologies to it for instance one of
the things we're working on right now is

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:29.530
the things we're working on right now is
 

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:32.040
the things we're working on right now is
relative to healthcare issues is that

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:32.050
relative to healthcare issues is that
 

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.940
relative to healthcare issues is that
you can include silver halide in the

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:35.950
you can include silver halide in the
 

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:38.820
you can include silver halide in the
glass composition itself and those types

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:38.830
glass composition itself and those types
 

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.820
glass composition itself and those types
of chemicals basically kill bacteria and

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:41.830
of chemicals basically kill bacteria and
 

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:43.290
of chemicals basically kill bacteria and
viruses so you can actually produce a

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:43.300
viruses so you can actually produce a
 

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.270
viruses so you can actually produce a
glass a super thin film glass that would

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280
glass a super thin film glass that would
 

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.720
glass a super thin film glass that would
be bonded to like all surfaces and doors

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:48.730
be bonded to like all surfaces and doors
 

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.670
be bonded to like all surfaces and doors
everything all the all these things

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680
everything all the all these things
 

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.670
everything all the all these things
would be made out of glass today and

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680
would be made out of glass today and
 

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.920
would be made out of glass today and
would prevent sort of the spread of

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:55.930
would prevent sort of the spread of
 

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.050
would prevent sort of the spread of
bacteria and viruses so there's a huge

00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:58.060
bacteria and viruses so there's a huge
 

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.240
bacteria and viruses so there's a huge
opportunities for things as simple as

opportunities for things as simple as
 

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.790
opportunities for things as simple as
that for these thin film glasses but for

architecture similarly you can introduce

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:05.590
architecture similarly you can introduce
 

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:08.640
architecture similarly you can introduce
very sophisticated luring systems

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:08.650
very sophisticated luring systems

other things that you would never been
 

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.150
other things that you would never been
able to afford to do previously so

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.160
able to afford to do previously so
 

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.670
able to afford to do previously so
there's a big transformation which will

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680
there's a big transformation which will
 

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.130
there's a big transformation which will
probably take you know another 10 years

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:20.140
probably take you know another 10 years
 

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.900
probably take you know another 10 years
actually happen because there's no

industry out there that can actually
 

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.260
industry out there that can actually
deal with these thin glasses so it's so

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:25.270
deal with these thin glasses so it's so
 

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.900
deal with these thin glasses so it's so

these new glasses it's totally different

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720
these new glasses it's totally different
 

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.600
these new glasses it's totally different
than the current industry and how you

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:35.610
than the current industry and how you
 

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.100
than the current industry and how you
begin to introduce that and how that can

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:37.110
begin to introduce that and how that can
 

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:40.490
begin to introduce that and how that can
contribute to you no buts or power

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500
contribute to you no buts or power
 

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.870
