00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.790
Brian, tell the judges
about your weapon.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.880
I really like
how it turned out.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.170
I was able to put a few
of my own personal touches

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.790
on the handle.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.460
The five stars represent the
smiths in the competition.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.170
Matt, tell us
about your blade.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.330
I had a rough time this week.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.710
I broke it on day three
in my own testing,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.120
but I had 14 hours left.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.710
I made a blade I'm pretty proud
of out of some [inaudible]

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.920
spring.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.250
All right, gentlemen.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.250
This is my favorite part
of this competition.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.250
Up first, the kill test.
Doug?

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.170
[music playing]

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.330
Bladesmiths, to see
what kind of lethal damage

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.420
your weapons will do,
we'll take your sword

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.920
and deliver hacks and
slashes on this big carcass.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.830
Brian, you're up first.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.710
Are you ready for this?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.380
Absolutely.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.250
I really like how
the blade turned out,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.080
but I'm super nervous.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.670
Depending on where you
hit that blade, you know,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.250
it can always snap apart.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.420
[music playing]

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.830
Phew.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.210
All right.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.460
Brian, let's talk
about your blade.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.290
First up, your edge
is razor sharp.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.960
It lacerated easily through
bones, through the spine.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.750
The one issue here is that
you have a very blocky handle.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.250
Aside from that, it will kill.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.960
Good job.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.960
Thanks.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.620
Matt, ready to chop?

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.540
I've been ready.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.880
Let's do this.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.790
MATT: I'm really nervous.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.710
But as long as this blade
doesn't wrap around in a circle

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.750
and hug this pig,
I'm in good shape.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.960
[music playing]

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.000
OK, Matt.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.670
Its balance and weight is
very forward for a chopper.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.830
But your edge is sharp enough
to lacerate into the carcass.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.670
It did chop the spine.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.620
It did chop bone.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.830
This will kill.
- Thank you.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.080
Gentlemen, this
is a strength test.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.330
To test the strength and
durability of your edge,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.500
I'm going to chop into
these huge logs 10 times.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.460
Remember, this test is all about
what happens to your weapons,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.250
and not what
happens to the logs.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.000
Brian, you're up first.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.920
Are you ready?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.620
I think so, yeah.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.620
All right.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.500
[music playing]

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.040
Well, Brian, your
edge held up perfectly.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.960
There's no bending, no
warping, just still razor sharp

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.290
all the way down.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.620
Man, it was fun to swing.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.670
Well done.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.790
Thank you.
Matt, you're up.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.620
Are you ready?

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.210
Give it a try.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.500
I'm a little anxious that
it's going to kink or bend.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.170
Don't chip, don't break,
don't chip, don't break.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.000
[music playing]

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.380
Ah.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.080
Well, Matt, there's
so much forward weight

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.040
that it actually bent that way.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.170
On the plus side, your
edge held up beautifully.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.040
I mean, there's no problems
with that edge at all.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.670
It's still very sharp.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.920
But this [inaudible] in
it, it's significant.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.710
[music playing]

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.000
Bladesmiths, you both brought
in some pretty extraordinary,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.830
historic weapons.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.380
But in this arena
of competition,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.040
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.960
Brian, congratulations.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.460
You are the new "Forged
in Fire" champion.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.120
Thank you.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.380
Matt, unfortunately, your
blade did not make the cut.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.290
Matt, your blade
is impressive.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.620
We saw that it could kill.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.540
But unfortunately,
in the strength test,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.080
it took a significant bend,
and it's for that reason

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.620
we have to let you go.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.920
I understand.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.120
Matt, please
surrender your golok.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.290
Even with losing,
at the end of the day,

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.290
I don't feel like I really
lost because I went way

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.620
further than I ever expected.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.120
I don't know enough
about it yet that I

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.170
can make that perfect blade.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.170
So you know, I'll keep learning.
