00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.950
One of the unique opportunities you have
in this program is the opportunity to

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.080
prepare for your courses in advance.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.740
Most of our classes make all
the materials available at udacity.com.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.800
So if you're not sure if you're ready
for a course, you can preview it there

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.290
and decide if you're actually
ready to take that course.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.000
They also provide readiness
questions on the program website.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.490
You can use those to evaluate whether or
not you're ready for the course, and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.384
what you need to brush up on in
order to get ready for the course.

00:00:20.384 --> 00:00:22.937
Some classes involve things
like C programming or

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:25.986
linear algebra that you may not
have seen in several years.

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:28.589
So you want to give yourself a chance to
refresh yourself on those things before

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:29.440
you take those courses.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.180
Use the materials available to you to
decide what classes you're ready to take

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.270
and what you need to do to get ready for
those classes.
