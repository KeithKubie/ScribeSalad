00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.470
 
well I think the answer is that we can't

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480
well I think the answer is that we can't
 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.090
well I think the answer is that we can't
live well without living grain we've

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100
live well without living grain we've
 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.250
live well without living grain we've
come to the point where we have we have

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260
come to the point where we have we have
 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.290
come to the point where we have we have
stretched our resources to the to the

stretched our resources to the to the
 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.220
stretched our resources to the to the

coming with such with enough time and so
now it has reached the stage where we

now it has reached the stage where we
