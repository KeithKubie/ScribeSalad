00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.850
When it comes to sex, we are - in theory - living
in wildly liberated times.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.790
So you’d think it would easy to feel at
ease owning up to certain sorts of sexual desires.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.040
But for most of us, the world doesn’t actually
feel that generous about fetishes.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.720
It’s very tricky to talk about many of the
things that turn us on - especially with our partners.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.290
Our fetishes can seem deeply weird, perverse
or politically incorrect.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.320
So we stay quiet.
And it is not only the reactions of others

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.880
which cause us anxiety. We might at times
ourselves worry there’s something a bit wrong with us.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.780
To get more confident, we should get philosophical
about sex and ask: what do our fetishes  really mean? 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.480
Why do we even have them?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.100
The good news is that the things that turn
us on are in fact really very logical and

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.150
hardly ever simply odd or twisted.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.730
Here is how it works:
Every fetish or sexual obsession is really

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.110
an imagined erotic solution to a real world
anxiety.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.200
Let’s look at some very common turn ons
through this theory:

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.340
People in uniforms are for many of us a major turn on, especially doctors, nurses, firemen and pilots.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.380
Tellingly, erotic websites are full of uniforms

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.139
What’s going on?

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:28.819
As so often with turn-ons, uniforms are exciting
because there is an underlying anxiety around them.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.299
How many times we’re belittled by people
in uniform: ignored by a busy doctor,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.200
made to feel like lowly fools by the heroic fireman, intimidated by the pilot…

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.420
Authority is frequently hostile to us and
frustrates our desires.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.440
But in sex, we can reverse this situation.
Here uniforms can be invited into our games.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.539
The uniform still stands for authority.
But now authority has moved to our side, paying

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.299
us exactly the right kind of attention.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.189
The pilot, far from being impassively at the
controls, is thrilled to be here with us,

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.449
she is no longer a stern-faced controller
of the Airbus A380, but our collaborator and friend.

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:11.780
The busy sensible doctor is no longer just
stern and responsible, only interested in

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.050
blood sugar levels and kidney functions: he
wants us to have fun.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.970
A real world ideal is being sketched in sex:
we’re being invited to imagine what authority

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.610
might like if it helped rather than hindered
us, reassured rather than intimidated us.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.810
Sex is hinting at a utopia where strength,
organisation, neatness and order would be

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.770
there to make us feel more at ease, more relaxed
and truer to ourselves.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.700
We are taught from a young age that we must
become independent. We live in an individualistic

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.680
culture that constantly vilifies dependence
and pushes us towards an ideal of solitary maturity.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.780
But some of us are excited by something very
different: the idea of submission, of being

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.120
totally passive, perhaps becoming someone’s
slave, surrendering all autonomy and just

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.070
letting another person do everything and anything
to us.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.920
Being a ‘slave’ means that someone else
will know exactly what we should do, will

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.700
take full responsibility, will take choice
away from us.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.780
This is curiously nice, because we’re not
surrendering to any old person, we’re surrendering

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.180
to someone who is good and kind and interested
in our pleasure. The delight we take in surrender

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.620
reveals how hard it is always to have to be
in control - how much we long for someone

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.720
else to take charge fully sometimes, as a
relief from the pressures of daily life.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.560
In the real world so many crucial tasks actually
depend on one’s capacity not to be daunted

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.850
by suffering. Taking on the masochistic role
rehearses - in erotic play - a fundamental

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.870
idea, that of being good at suffering, of
being willing and able (and even at time eager)

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.320
to “take it”: to be strong because one
has invited someone to call one a stupid bastard or a bitch.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.840
It’s a common feature of all sexual fantasies
that they do not – of course – genuinely

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.490
solve the problems from which they draw their
excitement. But we shouldn’t worry if the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.980
fantasy fails to solve the problem in reality.
What we’re looking for here is simply a

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.800
way of explaining and sympathising with the
desire and the erotic relief.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.919
We’re not generally allowed to be very bossy
with anyone. In our hearts, we might like

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.639
to be very demanding and insistent. We might
like to enforce absolute obedience on all

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.040
those who defy us. But we know how bad it
is to be too strict and tyrannical. We have

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.400
to go gently - all the time.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.800
But in a sexual game, our will to dominate
can be let loose. Someone puts themselves

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.600
in our hands and asks that we do with them
as we please. What a deep honour!

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.400
 They allow us to shout, bully and order us around - as
we otherwise never dare to.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.400
And now the commands are met only with delight.
You can be as strong, harsh and insistent

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.620
as you like, safe in the knowledge that the
other person is going to be just fine.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.200
Why can it be such a turn on to do it outside?
In a park, an elevator, or the toilets behind the party...

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.780
Again, it’s to do with healing a wound from
daily life.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.710
Normally, we sense that we have to be guarded,
on our best behaviour: out there in the elevators,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.870
public plazas, shopping centres, garage forecourts
of the world. Even nature is seen as quite

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.389
hostile – a cold, dangerous place where
enemies may set upon us.

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.550
But in the sex games we play outside, we can
prove that the public realm is not as threatening

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.030
as we had supposed. We can behave as we’d
like. Show our desires, and survive. And if

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.810
other people disapprove, that can’t stop
us, we’re strong enough to disregard them.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.050
Public sex civilises the wilderness and the
lonely formal places of the city.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.050
It lets us feel more at home in the world.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.220
One can analyse almost any so-called fetish
and find similar structures: an anxiety and

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.700
a corresponding solution, to which an erotic
charge has become connected.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.450
Looked at like this, sexual scenarios can
be explained to ourselves – and, crucially

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.389
to other people in our lives – in fairly
rational, sensible terms.

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.389
Ee can explain how our fear
of being responsible became oppressive, and

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:07.490
therefore why we enjoy being put in a dog
collar. Or why we were afraid of authority,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.270
and therefore what fun it is to be examined
by a doctor in bed.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.320
By talking like this, we can hope that sexual
tastes will become less a little shameful

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.790
and a little less threatening – and our
erotic games in their own way, a lot more

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.590
logical and sane.
