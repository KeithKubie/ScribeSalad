BRYAN CHRISTY: The hunting

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.867
held out one place as the gold
standard for trophy hunting,

00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:07.500
a place they say
big game hunting is

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.767
honest and killing saves lives.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.066
I set my coordinates
for Southern Zimbabwe,

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.533
the same country where Cecil was
shot and killed not long ago.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.800
According to a Safari
Club International study,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.367
more than 18,000 hunters
from around the world

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:27.767
spend upwards of $325 million
on hunting in Africa yearly.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.767
These are some of the most
iconic animals on the planet.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:40.834
So seeing them shot
may be difficult for me

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:43.100
and more difficult is
likely to be hanging

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.934
around the actual people who
have chosen to bring tens

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:50.333
of thousands of dollars to
kill animals here and bring

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.767
them back as trophies.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:54.266
I'm not sure how I'm
going to react to that.

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.934
And I'm not sure
how I feel about it.

00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:01.533
Bubye Valley Conservancy is a
massive privately owned area.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.633
They invited me to observe a
trophy hunt, where I would meet

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.266
their team to better
understand conservation

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.400
through the eyes of a hunter.

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:16.166
At Bubye Valley, trophy
hunters have a menu

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.033
of animals to choose from.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:19.900
The price for a zebra
or a giraffe hunt

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.533
is approximately $8,000.

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.834
A cape buffalo
hunt runs $20,000.

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:29.433
A leopard hunt can cost
as much as $28,000,

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:35.867
and a lion hunt costs
$100,000 per cat.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:38.667
It is because of this money
that outfits like Bubye Valley

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:42.734
claim they pay back into
a conservation system.

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:44.133
What are we looking for?

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:48.700
Came here primarily for cape
buffalo and eland and kudu.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.567
What made you
choose those three?

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:53.166
And then I had just gotten out
of the Marine Corps, just about

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.767
33 years old, and
saw "Out of Africa"

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:58.233
and the big cape buffalo
herds that they had,

00:01:58.233 --> 00:01:59.300
and I looked at those.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.367
So it's been a long pursuit.

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:02.233
I mean, my god, half my life.

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:03.533
I'm finally here.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:05.166
There are a lot of
lions in this area.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.367
- OK.
- OK.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:08.633
So you want to take a leak
or anything like that,

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:12.033
don't go wandering off.

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:15.333
You don't have
to warn me twice.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.900
There's way too many.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.300
We've offered to send 200
lions anywhere in the world.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.467
You know, it's just
anybody who wants them.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:23.266
That's amazing.

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:24.133
Maybe pay for transport.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:25.233
We'll give them.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:28.400
And there are no takers.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.567
BRYAN CHRISTY: But BVC clearly
didn't do all they could

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.266
to find a home for the lions.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:34.433
They gave an interview
for a British newspaper

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.166
and sent out a couple of emails.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:40.500
But I can't conclude their
outreach was exhaustive.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.266
Blondie Leathem, General
Manager of Bubye Valley,

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:47.200
thinks about conservation
in different terms-- land.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.400
How much land do you have?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.166
It's about 3,200
square kilometers.

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.500
So it's the size of maybe
Rhode Island in the United

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.633
States, a whole state.

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:55.433
Yeah.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:56.834
That's right.

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:58.500
BRYAN CHRISTY: Before it
was a hunting Conservancy,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.867
Bubye Valley was a cattle
ranch, and wildlife

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:02.867
was denied access to the land.

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:05.400
Ranching nearly pushed the
endemic animal populations

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.000
to the brink until
the Conservancy

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.266
came in and reintroduced
the native wildlife.

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.934
BLONDIE LEATHEM: About 10
years into the Conservancy,

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:16.367
we had enough
animals that we could

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:18.400
take-- the hunting
actually covered

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.633
all of the running costs.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.867
Americans looking at this
and saying, you know what?

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:22.934
I'm against hunting.

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.834
Why should you be
permitted, in a world

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:30.200
where lions are diminishing,
to continue to hunt lions?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.533
If we didn't hunt lion,
we wouldn't have lion.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:36.700
You've got 850,000 acres
dedicated to wildlife, one

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.500
of the highest lion densities.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.600
It is funded by hunting.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.533
You take away the hunting,
there is no alternative way of

00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:46.300
funding an operation this size.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.533
It would have to
revert back to cattle.

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:52.767
Then it will be more
vulnerable for resettlement.

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:54.300
So it's a no-brainer.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.333
