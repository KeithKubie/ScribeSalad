WOLF WEBER: All right.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.996
Good morning.

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:14.900
Welcome to this edition
of Authors at Google.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.070
My name is Wolf Weber.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.106
I'm a long time Googler, and I'm
happy to introduce our speaker

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:21.420
today, Whit Mitchell.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.552
Whit was my freshman coach
in rowing in college.

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:27.753
And we recently had
our college reunion,

00:00:27.753 --> 00:00:29.150
and we kind of all reconnected.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.712
And Whit was inspired--
by this time,

00:00:32.712 --> 00:00:34.470
he had become an
executive coach,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.680
and he was inspired by some
of the professional paths

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.640
that we've had in our lives.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.600
And we all kind of
reconnected on that.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.740
And he ended up writing
a book about it.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.709
And so here's Whit
Mitchell-- Working in Sync.

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:45.750
WHIT MITCHELL: Wonderful.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.860
Thank you, Wolf.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.850
So my executive coaching career
started on June 16, 1962,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.480
when I was eight years old,
on the banks of the Thames

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.655
River in New
London, Connecticut.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:00.780
I just didn't know that
that's when it would start.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.210
My grandfather took me to
the Harvard-Yale crew race,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.477
which is the oldest
intercollegiate event

00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:08.810
in the country-- older than
football, baseball, anything

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.430
else.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.790
That Harvard-Yale crew race was
rowed on Lake Winnipesaukee--

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.780
1852.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.826
Yale won by a couple lengths.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.200
But my grandfather took me to
this Yale-Harvard crew race

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920
in New London, Connecticut,
and we showed up

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.080
on the finish line that was a
bluff raised above the Thames

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.580
River, and we drove in.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.316
There were lots of cars there.

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:31.940
And he took me out
at the age of eight,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.360
and he gave me the
binoculars, and he

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.860
said look four miles
down the river.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.110
So as I looked
four miles away, we

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.840
could see a flotilla of boats.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.427
And back in the early '60s,
crew was a very big sport.

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:44.260
In fact, there's another
book out now called

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.710
"The Boys in the Boat."

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.150
And it was thousands
and thousands

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.540
of spectators used to
show up for crew races,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.510
and this was the
case on that day.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.180
Four miles downstream, he showed
me you could see a crimson

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.660
and a blue boat-- oarsmen
in the boat getting ready--

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.250
lined up for a four-mile row.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.820
And what he told
me was these boats

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.340
would take about 20 to 25
minutes to get upstream.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.820
And sure enough, at 6
o'clock, the gun went off.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.830
And there was a train
with bleachers in it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.920
that was loaded with spectators.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.490
And the train would follow
the race all the way up.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.310
And as they followed the race
up, the announcer on the train

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.860
would call the race.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.270
So I had never seen
this sport before,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.280
but it sounded-- he
made it exciting.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.680
So Harvard's ahead by a seat.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.639
Yale's ahead by a seat.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.638
Through the first mile,
through the second mile,

00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:31.770
through the third mile--
and they came into view,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.490
and I could see the
water splashing,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.040
and I could see
the backs arching,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.740
and I could see how much
energy and power was

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.094
being exhibited by these guys.

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:41.510
And at the last
couple of strokes,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.980
Yale pulled ahead
and won by a second,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.580
which is about that much.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.090
What happened next
changed my life

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.410
and is probably why
I'm standing here.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.930
My grandfather
said watch closely,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.190
and he gave me the binoculars.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.140
And what they did was they
pulled these two boats

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.640
together.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.000
The oars are 12 feet long,
so to pull two boats together

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.392
takes a bit of jimmying.

00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:00.850
But they pulled
the boats together,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.080
and the Harvard guys
took their shirts off,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.320
and they reached across to
the Yale counterpart who

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.281
won, shook his hand,
gave them the shirt,

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:09.280
and then they separated.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.155
And the Harvard guys
rowed back bare-chested,

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:15.310
and the Yale guys row back
with their Harvard award.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.490
The humility, the
courage, the teamwork,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.230
the work ethic that went into
racing four miles upstream

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.880
and losing by this much
made an impression on me

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.859
at the age of eight.

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.400
And I said, boy, is
that all you have

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.100
to do to win a free t-shirt?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.630
That was sort of my mentality
at the age of eight.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.820
But what impressed me
was the sportsmanship

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.387
and how they rowed against these
guys and pulled this together.

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:44.470
I went back to that race
four or five years later,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.845
and then went on
to high school--

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:48.680
a small school in Connecticut
that had 150 boys,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.300
and 100 of us went out for crew.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.680
The rest went out for
baseball and tennis.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.310
We won every race
for four years.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.780
So I was really
interested in this sport

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.230
and became passionate about
wanting to do more of it.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.989
I went to the University
of New Hampshire.

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.530
And I'm lying in
bed the first night,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.410
and I saw in the
school newspaper--

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.614
it said "crew club meeting 7
o'clock at the Memorial Student

00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:10.280
Union building."

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.010
It was 7 o'clock.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.030
I hopped in my car,
and I got there.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.070
60 or 70 people in the
room-- as a club sport.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.940
And the fellow
standing up in front

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.870
started describing what
was going to happen.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.839
Come down to the boathouse,
and here's what it is.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.880
They were all new people.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.240
None of them had rowed before.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.910
So I had had enough of rowing.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.510
And I walked up to them
at the end of the event,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.097
and I said I'd be
happy to help out.

00:04:31.097 --> 00:04:31.680
He said great.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.020
Show up tomorrow.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.710
So I showed up the
next day, and people

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.419
had recruited another
10 or 12 people.

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.210
There were probably 60
or 70 people there--

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.224
college students.

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:40.890
So I walked up and I
said, "Remember me?

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.064
I was there last night."

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:42.980
And he said, "Oh yeah.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.969
We got together after you left.

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.010
We've got a job for you."

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.750
I said "Great.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.010
What is it?"

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.130
He said, "You're going
to be the head coach."

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.490
And I was a freshman.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.310
And I argued with him
for 5 or 10 minutes,

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.770
and then I relented,
and I said, "Great.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.603
We'll give it a go."

00:04:55.603 --> 00:04:58.750
So 70 people-- and I went
out every day in the launch

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.850
and coached 60 or 70 people
until we had some people

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.910
graduate and they helped me out.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.630
But again, my passion, my
excitement for coaching--

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.770
of which I'm now an
executive coach-- really

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.050
came from that experience.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.777
That, to me, was an
extraordinary learning.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:21.360
And I want you to think about
an extraordinary learning you've

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.506
had in your own life.

00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:24.880
Just think about
it for a minute.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.380
Was it something that you read?

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.650
Because we learn
a lot by reading.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.620
Was it something you heard, like
Martin Luther King's speech?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.830
Or was it something you did--
an experience that you had?

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.390
Yes.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.040
Yes.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.154
And those experiences stay here.

00:05:44.154 --> 00:05:45.820
So what I'd like to
do is just-- there's

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.319
blank piece of paper
on your chair--

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.366
is go through a learning--
doing it by an experience.

00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:53.240
So I'm going to give
you six different pieces

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.825
of instruction, and
just follow me along,

00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:57.200
and then we'll
see what we learn.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.620
There's paper on the chairs.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.590
So here's the instructions.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.260
Take the paper and
fold it in half.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.560
Tear off the upper
right-hand corner.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:31.300
Fold it in half again, and tear
off the lower left-hand corner.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.050
Fold it in half one
last time, and tear off

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.060
the upper left-hand corner.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.860
Once you've completed all
six pieces of instruction,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.240
just unfold it and hold
it up above your head,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.675
and look around, and
look at the people.

00:07:02.675 --> 00:07:05.050
So if you hold it in front of
yourself, you can't see it.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.841
So just hold it up.

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:06.900
Look around.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.120
And let's see
whose are the same.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.620
Go ahead.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.270
You can hold those up.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.085
That's perfect.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.680
So what do you see?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.485
Any two the same?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.050
So you work here every day.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.000
You go to meetings every day.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.141
What's the analogy here?

00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:28.140
You go to a meeting, and
you listen clearly what

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.980
the instructions are.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.438
Or you have a meeting, and you
give out clear instructions.

00:07:31.438 --> 00:07:33.180
And a week later you
come back thinking,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.650
I thought I was pretty clear,
and you get one of these,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.880
and you can't figure it out.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.100
55% of what listeners
believe have

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.560
to do with your
presentation, your hands,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.600
your facial expressions.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.750
38% have to do with
the tone, and 7%

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.430
have to do with the words.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.490
So why do you think
whenever I walk in a place,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.406
they go, there's a problem
with communication.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.664
So that's a quick experience.

00:07:57.664 --> 00:07:58.830
But look at the differences.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.913
What I'd like to do is
zero in on the differences.

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:03.540
We each tore-- six
of us, seven of us.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.810
Each one was different.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.560
My encouragement would
be to find somebody

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.643
in the audience that had
something very different,

00:08:09.643 --> 00:08:12.440
have a cup of coffee with them,
and find out what they heard

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.920
and what the differences were.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.170
How can you maximize differences
here in the work that you do?

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.890
Put the two sheets
together, and see

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.230
if it makes a whole sheet again.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.400
But what could we
do here at Google

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.790
to maximize our differences?

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.080
Walking across to a different
department, research

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.180
and development, going to sales,
working with other people,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.809
getting people out and finding
out what do I need-- what could

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.980
I learn from you to make
me a better employee here.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.380
What I'd like you to
do-- this is an event.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.550
It's the Olympic gold medal
event in London in 2012

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.980
for the women.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.220
And the USA made the final.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.152
They're in lane three.

00:08:51.152 --> 00:08:52.610
It's going to be
fun to watch this,

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.100
but here's how I
want you to look

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.540
at it-- through
a different lens.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.830
I want you to come
up with one or two

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:05.880
key characteristics of why
this team is so extraordinary.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.130
So as I said, you can
see USA in lane three.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.010
It's the finals.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:09.844
It's London.

00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:11.510
We're not going to
watch the whole race.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.120
I've cut it up a little bit.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.380
But key in not just on
enjoying the race but what

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.310
makes them so good,
so extraordinary,

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.290
at a world-class level.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.330
So in rowing, for those
of you that don't know,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.500
when you start, you start
with very short strokes

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.530
to get the boat moving.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.980
There's a ton of weight
that you have to get moving.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.901
Each guy is about 200
pounds-- 8 plus the coxon.

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.400
And once you get it going, you
just lengthen the strokes out

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.744
and sort of settle in, because
it's about a six-minute race.

00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:41.160
So you've got to
save some energy.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.712
But you can already see there's
a couple of boats out ahead.

00:09:43.712 --> 00:09:45.420
And yet, these are
the best in the world.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.930
They all look like they're
doing the same thing,

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.460
but there's one-- and you
can think about Google.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.530
Why are you the
best in the world?

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.220
What is it if you did 5%
better could you get faster at?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.310
So there's 2000 meters.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.770
This is the first 500 meters.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.820
You can see that USA up top
is ahead already-- Canada

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.290
close behind,
Netherlands close behind.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.470
But again, it's fun
to watch, but focus in

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:15.630
on what do you think they did as
far as recruiting, development,

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.340
and getting them to be the best.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.940
You can't get much
better than that.

00:10:31.594 --> 00:10:33.260
In the sport of rowing,
for those of you

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.720
that don't know a lot
about it, the coach

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.160
looks at the different aspects--
the different expertise

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.020
of the people and puts them in
different seats in the boat.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.910
The person that is facing you
with their back is the coxon.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.970
Their job is to steer.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.471
They have little
cords next to them,

00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:48.094
and they want to
steer a straight shot.

00:10:48.094 --> 00:10:50.110
You can see buoys, so
it's not too hard to do.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.092
But they're also looking
at the other crews,

00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:54.550
and they're giving
some information

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.610
to the crew that's rowing
about the crews next to them.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.372
That's their job-- the strategy.

00:11:00.372 --> 00:11:02.330
The next person in the
boat that they're facing

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.455
is called the stroke, and
they really set the pace.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:05.455
They're the pace setter.

00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:07.621
So in a mile run, you'd
want them right next to you.

00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:09.870
They're setting the pace
for the rest of the people.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.579
And the person right
behind him is also

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:13.870
sort of on the other side of
the boat setting the pace.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.453
The people in the
middle of the boat--

00:11:15.453 --> 00:11:18.060
the fellow that introduced
me before, Wolf-- he

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.060
was right in the middle.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.287
I wanted the big,
strong guys right

00:11:21.287 --> 00:11:23.370
in the middle of the boat,
called the engine room.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.690
Just pull hard.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.600
Technically, I wasn't as
interested in-- but pull hard.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.760
And here they have 1,500 meters,
so they're-- 500 meters to go

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.880
before they finish.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.360
I'll let you watch the finish.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.760
Key in on some attributes
or characteristics

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.460
that make extraordinary teams.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.220
Canada is not going to
let us get away with this.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.899
So as you get close
to the finish,

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:52.690
they're going to raise
the stroke level up.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.120
Just like you get close
to the last quarter mile

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.067
in a mile run, you're
going to pick it up.

00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:59.150
So they're putting everything
they've got into it,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.570
and yet they're still
rowing exceptionally well,

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.340
and they're extremely
tired right now.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.290
Their heart rates are close
to 200 beats a minute.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.154
And the Canadians are
right here in the white.

00:12:11.154 --> 00:12:13.320
And we have good competition
with the Canadian women

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.260
in soccer and hockey
and in rowing as well.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.370
And these women are big.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:27.900
They're 6' 0," 6' 2," 180, 185.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.060
The coaches are on
those bikes on the side.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.060
So they're taking some
notes, but at this point,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.268
there are no more notes this.

00:12:33.268 --> 00:12:34.640
This is the gold medal, or not.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.830
So here comes Canada.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.460
So they've saved
something for the end,

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.320
but there's the finish.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.810
The part I love is right here.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.830
So there it is.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.950
That's how tired they are, and
yet they rowed so beautifully.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.360
So I'd like you to think about
one or two characteristics

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.810
of extraordinary teams.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.050
What comes to mind as you
think about that race?

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.080
This is the part of the group
participation part of the talk.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.600
What comes to mind when you
think of extraordinary teams?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.280
What did that coach do
to make them so good?

00:13:15.766 --> 00:13:16.770
AUDIENCE: Focus?

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.120
WHIT MITCHELL: So focus on what?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.609
AUDIENCE: On the gold?

00:13:19.609 --> 00:13:21.400
WHIT MITCHELL: Their
focus was a gold medal

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.270
from the time they
started a year earlier.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.520
So focus and agreed upon goals.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.845
Same in business?

00:13:27.845 --> 00:13:28.460
Yeah.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.920
We want to know
where we're headed.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.960
We want to know
what the focus is.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.300
Where are we headed
in this department?

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:32.880
What's the goal?

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.580
What's the vision?

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.290
What's the mission?

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.623
Are we headed in that direction?

00:13:35.623 --> 00:13:36.391
What else?

00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:37.890
AUDIENCE: They kept
their composure.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.806
So when Canada was kind
of inching up on them,

00:13:39.806 --> 00:13:41.929
it seemed like they
just [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:41.929 --> 00:13:43.970
WHIT MITCHELL: So think
about that in leadership.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.350
When stress starts to come
up, when the market starts

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.320
to change, when things are not
as we plan-- like where are

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.210
they coming from-- when
you've worked for leaders,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.530
how do they handle that stress?

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:56.560
What do they do well?

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.643
What could they do better?

00:13:57.643 --> 00:13:59.230
What else?

00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.915
Yeah?

00:13:59.915 --> 00:14:01.160
AUDIENCE: They're in sync.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.240
WHIT MITCHELL: So they're rowing
in sync-- working in sync,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.790
so to speak.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.754
Yeah, rowing in unison.

00:14:04.754 --> 00:14:06.420
So they know what the
other one's doing,

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.680
and they know they
can't just stop.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.600
Well, I've had enough of this.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.430
I think I'll just stop.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.888
I mean, you get an
oar in the back,

00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:12.670
so you don't do that very often.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.700
I came up with three
words thinking about it

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.242
that all end in "ing."

00:14:17.242 --> 00:14:18.200
There's the gold medal.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.408
The gold medal is the highest
form of accountability,

00:14:20.408 --> 00:14:22.786
and you hear that
word a lot in work.

00:14:22.786 --> 00:14:24.160
We need to hold
them accountable.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.326
I'd like to change the
mindset and say, what are you

00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:27.855
doing to hold
yourself accountable.

00:14:27.855 --> 00:14:30.230
But here are the three words
I use-- connecting, knowing,

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.590
and winning.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.549
Connecting has to do with
building deeper relationships.

00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:36.340
Who do you know that
you work with that you

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.230
need to connect at a different
level or a deeper level with?

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.850
And if you did, work
would get better.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.400
Work would get more--
we'd put more out.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.686
Knowing is knowing about me.

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:48.810
And some of you aren't old
enough to remember this,

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.380
but Ed Koch, who was
the mayor of New York,

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.338
he used to walk through
the streets of New York

00:14:52.338 --> 00:14:56.310
as he was campaigning, and
he'd say how am I doing.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.750
How many leaders do you know
that walk around and say

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.690
how am I doing?

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.931
I want to know.

00:15:00.931 --> 00:15:03.430
And then we're able to give
them safe, constructive feedback

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.980
to get better.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.104
That may be happening here.

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:05.900
I don't know.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.830
But getting to know self
is extremely important.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.220
And the last is winning.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.470
So they went for a gold medal.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.835
They spent a year
training for that,

00:15:12.835 --> 00:15:14.376
and they've got it
around their neck.

00:15:14.376 --> 00:15:16.730
Winning has to do with
developing key results that

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.710
reflect superior
performance in your work.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.290
It's not just the
job description--

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.080
other duties as assigned.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.070
But do you have three
to five key results

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.444
that you're zeroed
in on-- focused on--

00:15:27.444 --> 00:15:28.360
to get the gold medal?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.619
So let's go into
that a little deeper.

00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:33.160
Connecting-- my background at
the University of New Hampshire

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.350
was exercise physiology.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.225
And each year, I'd go
to the American College

00:15:36.225 --> 00:15:38.550
of Sports Medicine
annual meeting.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.360
This year it was in
Indianapolis, Indiana--

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.680
the year that-- I'm
referring to a story.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.379
So I walked in a little late.

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:47.420
They started with a dinner
at 7 o'clock at night.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.390
The first night you get
there, everybody arrives.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.098
You go to dinner.

00:15:50.098 --> 00:15:51.212
It's a big awards dinner.

00:15:51.212 --> 00:15:52.670
And I walked in,
and all the tables

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.350
were full except for the
one nearest the door.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.933
There were two empty seats, so
I jumped on one of those seats.

00:15:56.933 --> 00:15:59.450
They brought the salad.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.760
They add the water-- talking
to the guy next to me.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.710
There's an empty seat.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.220
We're about halfway through
the salads, and the door opens.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.890
And I can see the
light coming in.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.020
And I look around,
and there's a guy

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.150
standing there that looks
homeless-- big beard, big hat,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.870
scruffy clothes, boots sort
of dirty, scruffy pants.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.581
And I'm thinking to myself,
this guy's got life figured out,

00:16:20.581 --> 00:16:21.330
and he's homeless.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.640
He knows if he shows up
here every night at 7:10

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.181
when the dinners
start getting served

00:16:25.181 --> 00:16:28.360
and there's an empty
seat, he can go sit down.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.700
So I'm thinking, he's
going to sit next to me.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.310
So sure enough, in
the door he comes.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.518
The door closes, and he's
headed right for our table,

00:16:34.518 --> 00:16:36.790
and he sits down
right next to me.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:41.246
And I do one of these, and start
talking to the guy next to me.

00:16:41.246 --> 00:16:42.620
I couldn't do it
for much longer.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.310
So after five minutes, I
turn to him and I said, "Hi,

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.270
my name is Whit.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.870
What's your name?"

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.730
He said, "My name's Joe."

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.660
Sure.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.570
"Joe, what are you doing here?"

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.930
He said, "I'm the keynote
speaker tomorrow."

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.690
So I started talking to Joe.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.330
Turns out that Joe was the
keynote speaker the next day.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.550
His name is Joe Redington.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.869
Joe Redington is the founder
of the Iditarod sled dog race.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.630
He started it.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.640
And he was there to
speak about the exercise

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.359
physiology of
training sled dogs.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.650
And we sat there
for three hours.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.770
He had a card he gave me.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.630
You go like this, and it
was-- three-dimensionally,

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.060
you can see the dogs
running the cart.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.609
It was fascinating.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:22.410
It was from Alaska.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.240
He'd just flown in.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.250
He'd just landed from Alaska.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.130
He didn't need to
get dressed up.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.921
He was the keynote.

00:17:25.921 --> 00:17:27.084
He was fascinating.

00:17:27.084 --> 00:17:28.500
The next day, 90
minutes he talked

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.166
about how he trained
dogs on treadmills.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.540
This was back in the '80s.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.610
Fascinating guy.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.680
However, the point
of the story is

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.750
who's the Joe
Redington in your life?

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.030
We all have them.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.350
Who am I not talking to
that I should talk to,

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.960
that I should connect with, that
I should find out more about?

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.390
So connecting-- I'm going
to do a little activity.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:47.850
You can just raise your hands.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.580
Again, I like to have
experiential things

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.800
because we just decided
that that's good to learn.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.550
If you've done this,
just raise your hand.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.990
We can look around, learn
something about you.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.210
You haven't done this yet.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.720
Wait.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.410
Here we go.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.521
Have you done that?

00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:01.020
So have you ever
ridden an elephant?

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.122
Whereabouts?

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:03.574
AUDIENCE: In Nepal.

00:18:03.574 --> 00:18:04.490
WHIT MITCHELL: So see?

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.454
So I'd want to know
more about that.

00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:08.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.765
WHIT MITCHELL: In India?

00:18:09.765 --> 00:18:14.750
Have you ever eaten two pints
of Ben &amp; Jerry's in one sitting?

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.000
We live about an hour south
of Ben &amp; Jerry's, so a lot

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.500
of people in here that
would raise their hands.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.211
Visited all seven continents?

00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:21.960
Anybody done that?

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.060
Six?

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.780
Yeah?

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.940
Again, so you're a traveler.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.716
Yeah.

00:18:27.716 --> 00:18:30.090
So again, connecting-- how
can we connect with each other

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.490
and learn something
new about each other?

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.629
So afterwards, I'd want
to find out where he went.

00:18:33.629 --> 00:18:34.420
What was Asia like?

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.670
What was Africa like?

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.960
What was South America like?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.220
Can speak four or
more languages?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.720
Yeah.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.402
What are the four?

00:18:43.402 --> 00:18:46.604
AUDIENCE: I speak Russian,
Japanese [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:46.604 --> 00:18:47.770
WHIT MITCHELL: Good for you.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.940
Yeah.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.091
So I'd want to know
more-- connecting.

00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:52.340
We work with people every day.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.180
We don't know these things.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.870
How about this?

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.710
No?

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.100
I've come close--
hasn't quite gone in.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.200
How about driven a car
over 100 miles an hour?

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.080
Yeah, Wolf.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:03.695
Yeah.

00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:05.860
And what kind of car was that?

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.360
AUDIENCE: Every car
I've ever owned.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.510
WHIT MITCHELL: Yeah, there.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.210
Written a book?

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.220
How many want to write a book?

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.390
So Wolf raised his hand.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.280
There's just six, seven people.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.270
He raised his-- he's done it.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.960
I've done it.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.700
Talk to me.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.530
What's that like?

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.240
Man, it was great.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.000
My English teacher
would not have said,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.950
Whit, go write a book.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.790
He just wouldn't have said that.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.450
But when I gave my
idea about these guys

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.864
that I'd coached in 1983 and
how we can transfer sports

00:19:33.864 --> 00:19:35.780
analogies to business
success-- these guys are

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.430
successful-- my publisher
said, Whit, just

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.601
write from your heart.

00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:41.100
Write from what you
know about crew.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.970
Write from your passion.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.470
So talk to Wolf.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.290
Attended an Olympic Games?

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.850
Anybody ever been to one?

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.045
Which one?

00:19:49.045 --> 00:19:50.380
AUDIENCE: LA-- '84.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.752
WHIT MITCHELL: Yep.

00:19:52.752 --> 00:19:53.918
Which one'd you go to, Wolf?

00:19:53.918 --> 00:19:54.376
AUDIENCE: Atlanta.

00:19:54.376 --> 00:19:55.292
WHIT MITCHELL: Yeah.

00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:55.750
And you went?

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.958
AUDIENCE: I went to LA, also.

00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:57.620
Yeah.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.860
My sister-in-law made the 1976
Olympic Games in Montreal.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.265
We live an hour
and a half south.

00:20:03.265 --> 00:20:05.890
I sat next to her parents as she
marched into opening ceremony.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.390
I still get chills
talking about it.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.110
She marched in opening ceremony,
and here's her father in tears.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.210
It was unbelievable.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.990
I have not competed,
but I have been to one.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.032
Knowing-- what do we
know about ourselves,

00:20:19.032 --> 00:20:19.990
and what don't we know?

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.140
What are some of the blind
spots in both directions?

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.690
What are we doing
really well at work here

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.815
that we don't know that
we're doing it really well?

00:20:27.815 --> 00:20:30.189
I talk to the people around
you, and they said, you know,

00:20:30.189 --> 00:20:31.500
she runs meetings really well.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.890
She's organized the agenda.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.480
She's on time.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.720
We end on time.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.890
It's great.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.848
Then you think, I don't
run meetings very well.

00:20:37.848 --> 00:20:41.050
Or the other thing-- what do you
not know about you that others

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.730
know-- a blind spot-- that
could help you get better?

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.260
If you got 5% better-- if the
Canadians had been 5% better,

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.004
they would have
beaten the Americans.

00:20:49.004 --> 00:20:50.670
This is a guy by the
name of Sam Kinney.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.490
Sam rode with Wolf
freshman year.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.430
Sam and about four
or five other guys

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.950
said, hey Coach, let's go
hunting in South Dakota.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:58.980
Well, I'm not a hunter.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.176
I don't own guns, and I'm
not big at killing things.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:02.800
But somehow, they
got a gun in my hand,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.510
and we killed these pigeons--
not pigeons, pheasants--

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.260
and we had a ball.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.960
But we got back together
after 30 years and connected.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.997
Sam came from Ohio.

00:21:12.997 --> 00:21:15.080
And one of the things I
appreciated about Sam when

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.686
I was coaching him was that Sam
brought a work ethic with him

00:21:18.686 --> 00:21:19.560
to Dartmouth College.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.200
He'd never rowed before.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.450
But he grew up on a farm.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.620
And in March, the
sap would run, and he

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.950
talked about 16 to 18 hours
of carrying sap buckets down

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.010
to get boiled.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.410
And I knew the kid
loved to work hard.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.040
But the other thing
about Sam is that I

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.330
called him sort of the
keeper of the culture.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.440
He always kept people up.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.440
He always had a story.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.064
He was always kidding
people, sometimes

00:21:40.064 --> 00:21:42.250
maybe a little too much.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.764
Sam graduated from Tuck School
number one in this class,

00:21:44.764 --> 00:21:46.430
and he went on to
start a company called

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.870
Free Markets in Pittsburgh--
reverse auctioning.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:54.870
Sam rang the bell, and
retired at the age of 37.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.350
Sam has a quote in
the book on page 122

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:01.175
that says "the leading cause
of death in an executive career

00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:03.670
is lack of self-awareness."

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.320
Sam was known at his company
for building dynamic teams

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.510
by knowing more about himself.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.950
Self-awareness-- he learned that
because the company he worked

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.060
at before he started this
company-- one of the engineers

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.674
put a 360 degree
review on his door

00:22:20.674 --> 00:22:22.590
so that every time he
walked in, he would say,

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.714
that's what I'm working on.

00:22:23.714 --> 00:22:26.010
That's what people say
I need to get better at.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.610
Sam used to walk
around his company

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.539
and ask how he was
doing, like Ed Koch did,

00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:32.580
and find out what he was
doing well as the leader

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.470
and what he needed
to do differently

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.030
and started instituting
some of that.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.760
And his company went public,
and he did quite well.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.627
He's now an entrepreneur and
investing in other things.

00:22:43.627 --> 00:22:45.210
The reason I'm
standing here is that I

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.480
was in Hanover, New Hampshire,
in 2011, going downtown

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.660
to where Dartmouth College is to
go out to dinner with my wife.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.435
And across the room, I heard
this guy go, "Hey, Coach."

00:22:55.435 --> 00:22:57.394
Well, I'd been coaching
athletes and executives

00:22:57.394 --> 00:22:59.684
for years, so I thought I
had the right to turn around,

00:22:59.684 --> 00:23:00.560
see who it might be.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.790
And sure enough, it was Sam.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.400
And we all got together that
night-- 11 out of the 18 guys

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.464
that rowed for me back in
1983-- and they told me

00:23:07.464 --> 00:23:09.880
story after story after story
about what they were doing--

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.660
successful, like my
good friend Wolf.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.860
And they made analogies.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.985
They were nice enough to
me to say, "You know what?

00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:17.850
I learned a little
bit about business

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.390
through my time in that boat.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.180
It was rowing 20
miles when it was

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.420
sleeting and raining and
cold and my hands wet."

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.700
I had one of the guys say
he made it through residency

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.616
because he remembered
how hard it was in crew.

00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:30.439
The residency couldn't
have been that hard.

00:23:30.439 --> 00:23:31.730
So knowing more about yourself.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.970
For the last 25
or so years, I've

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.910
been working with
top-level executives,

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.760
and I asked them to--
it's very simple.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.800
I say pick one
behavior that you think

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.890
if you got better
at it might make

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.140
a difference in the bottom
line of your organization--

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.460
a behavior making a
difference in the bottom line.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.670
So this guy picked listening.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.140
He said, "I got to be
a better listener."

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.190
And I told him because
of the statistics I know,

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.136
"Listen with your eyes,
because you're not

00:24:00.136 --> 00:24:01.511
doing really well
with your ears.

00:24:01.511 --> 00:24:03.690
So at least watch
the body language."

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.600
And he had me call
a number of people

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.270
and ask how he was at listening.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.185
And I called his-- he
said, "Call my wife."

00:24:09.185 --> 00:24:11.020
I said, "I'm not going
to call your wife."

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:11.550
He said, "No, I want
you to call my wife."

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.661
So I called her.

00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:14.910
She said he comes home--
"Kevin comes home every night

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.450
for dinner, and he asks
me how was your day."

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.912
His wife would
start in on her day,

00:24:20.912 --> 00:24:22.620
and he'd interrupt
about halfway through,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.560
and he'd take 45 minutes
and tell her about his day.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.776
She said he's a
horrendous listener.

00:24:27.776 --> 00:24:29.400
I asked his people
who worked with him.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.983
They said, "When I walk into his
office, he's on his computer.

00:24:31.983 --> 00:24:32.980
He's on his cellphone.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.950
He's not listening
to a thing I say."

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.310
So nine months of work with
him-- and I'll show you

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.110
the system I used
about listening-- he's

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.660
now given six keynote
addresses across the country

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.570
in listening.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.870
We groomed him for
the CEO job-- he just

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.400
got that in December-- to run
his small insurance company

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.280
was just bought by Nationwide.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.170
And he's about to write a book
for executives on listening.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:59.990
So if we could take a
behavior and turn it into ROI,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.980
we can do that.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.200
So let me just practice in here.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.800
Who's got a behavior that if
you got a little better at,

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.580
it might make a
difference in your world

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.300
and the world of the
people that work with you?

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.400
So who'd like to volunteer?

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.920
It's a quick little
minute exercise,

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.060
but it'll give you an example.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.560
One behavioral change that
if I asked the people that

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.210
work with you,
they might say she

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.104
or he could do this
a little better.

00:25:23.104 --> 00:25:24.895
Anybody want to quickly
volunteer for this?

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.340
Great.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:29.840
Thank you.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.460
Pick a behavior.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.140
AUDIENCE: Is writing?

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.310
WHIT MITCHELL: So a
behavior is not writing.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.831
What's a behavior?

00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:37.330
Yes?

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.250
AUDIENCE: Speak up more.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:40.564
So I want to speak up more.

00:25:40.564 --> 00:25:42.480
So I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.380
It'll take about a minute.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.921
They're going to be
the same question

00:25:44.921 --> 00:25:46.131
over, so be patient with me.

00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:48.380
But I want to show you how
it impacts the bottom line.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.840
So if you spoke up more in
meetings and with people

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.990
one-on-one-- and you
just did it here.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:58.434
In a word or two, what's the
benefit to the organization?

00:25:58.434 --> 00:25:59.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.720
WHIT MITCHELL: So knowledge
starts to increase.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.110
What's the benefit if they
get more knowledge from you

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.600
in you speaking up?

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.642
What's the benefit to Google?

00:26:06.642 --> 00:26:07.600
AUDIENCE: Better ideas?

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.724
WHIT MITCHELL: So if we
had better ideas at Google,

00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:10.898
what's the benefit?

00:26:10.898 --> 00:26:12.490
AUDIENCE: A lot
better for customers.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.990
WHIT MITCHELL:
Better for customers.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.600
And if we have
better for customers,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.758
what's the benefit to Google?

00:26:18.758 --> 00:26:20.250
AUDIENCE: Revenue-- bottom line.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.260
WHIT MITCHELL:
Better bottom line.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.330
And if we have-- this is the
one where people get stumbled.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.740
They get to that, and
they think that's it.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.490
If there's a better
bottom line at Google,

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.797
what is the benefit to them?

00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:30.380
AUDIENCE: Revenue
solves all problems.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.250
WHIT MITCHELL: And what's
the benefit of that?

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.470
So if revenue solves all
problems, what's the benefit?

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.011
Keep with me.

00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:35.910
We're almost done.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:36.650
AUDIENCE: The
employees are happy.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:37.880
WHIT MITCHELL: OK, so
employees are happy.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.560
If that all happens and you made
that happen because you spoke

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.130
up more, what's
the benefit to you?

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.470
AUDIENCE: Fulfilled my dogma.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.556
So fulfillment--
fulfillment and happiness.

00:26:47.556 --> 00:26:48.930
So think about
that for a minute.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.560
You take one behavior
with a top leader,

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.150
and they do that,
that's what happens.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.774
So I work with leaders
for nine months,

00:26:54.774 --> 00:26:57.450
and that's the goal
I'm trying to get to.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.450
Winning-- the third one.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.070
Winning's about that gold
medal around the neck.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.700
So winning has to do with
thinking about, developing

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.390
for yourself, three
to five key results.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.870
Three five key
results-- we could

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.950
measure these results
that would reflect

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.987
superior performance
in your job.

00:27:15.987 --> 00:27:17.820
Three to five key results
that would reflect

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.590
superior performance
in your job.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.170
And write those down,
and have those somewhere.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.670
And here's a practical
tip that's easy to do,

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.580
and watch what happens.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.190
Every morning when
you come to work,

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.360
before you start answering
emails and phone calls

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.210
and everything else, write down
three high-value activities

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:39.130
that would help you get one,
two, or three of those results.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.030
Now what's a
high-value activity?

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.690
It might mean I've got
to give my boss a call,

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.950
and sit down for 15
minutes, and talk about X.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.670
That would be a
high-value activity.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.630
I'm going to be thinking
about something.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.838
I don't know is-- that's
high value unless you put it

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.140
into action.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.740
Could going for a run at noon
be a high-value activity?

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.050
Boy, for me, it is.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.670
I always put that down because
that's where my ideas come up.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.870
That's where I've
got things going.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.840
I wish I had a tape recorder.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.381
I get back to the
office after a run,

00:28:06.381 --> 00:28:08.690
and I'm just writing stuff down.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.270
So try that for three
months-- not for a week,

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.380
not for 21 days.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.500
Every morning, write down
three high-value activities

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.050
that lead to one of those
three to five key results.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.994
My coaching's called
Inner Circle Coaching.

00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:26.410
I had the great fortune of
working with Marshall Goldsmith

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.830
at the Tuck School
for nine years.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.540
Marshall's one of the
premier coaches in the world.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.540
He coaches Michael Dell.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.710
He coaches the CEO of
United Airlines-- Boeing.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:36.810
So he's big time.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.850
He wrote a book called "What Got
You Here Won't Get You There."

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.657
Wonderful book-- 20 things
leaders should stop doing.

00:28:42.657 --> 00:28:44.490
But here's the model
that he shared with me,

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.440
and I've just sort
of played with it.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.030
So if I'm working with one of
the leaders here, one of you

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.385
at Google, you
are in the middle.

00:28:52.385 --> 00:28:54.010
And we're going to
work for nine months

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:57.314
on a behavior like listening,
like I did with Kevin.

00:28:57.314 --> 00:28:58.730
And I'm going to
say to you what I

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:04.230
want you to do is I want you to
pick three to five influencers

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:09.660
that influence your decision
making, that challenge you,

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.580
that make you better
at what you do.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.510
And you'll be able to give
them open and honest feedback.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.885
So pick three to
five people that

00:29:15.885 --> 00:29:17.343
are willing to do
that, because I'm

00:29:17.343 --> 00:29:18.950
going to meet with
each one of them.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.533
I go meet with each
one of them, and I

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:24.230
say there's four commitments to
me working with Kevin and you.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.410
The first is to
let go of the past.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.310
So if there's still something
that's kernel in the tooth,

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.400
get rid of it in the
next week because I'm

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.280
coming into work with Kevin.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.200
The second thing is to
support and encourage Kevin.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.136
Kevin's going to make a change.

00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:39.510
Kevin's going to
be more positive

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.540
or listen better,
be more objective,

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.762
whatever it might be.

00:29:42.762 --> 00:29:43.470
So be supportive.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.000
When you see him
doing it, tell him.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.790
"Hey, you're doing it better."

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.960
The third commitment
is to give Kevin and me

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.770
every 30 days open and honest
feedback on his progress

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.850
on what he's trying to achieve.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:59.120
Wow, so I get feedback from six
or seven people every 30 days.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.860
Do you think a change
is going to happen?

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.062
It's got to.

00:30:02.062 --> 00:30:05.580
And the fourth is, to the
blue people on the outside,

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.650
I'm asking you to also make
a behavioral change that

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.070
will impact you, your
world at work and at home.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.790
So pick one.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.070
So the whole system
is like an elephant

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.810
through a snake, so to speak.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:20.330
So there's a whole
team working a system.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.580
Kevin's getting better every
single month because he's

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.240
getting feedback through me
and by asking how am I doing.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.880
It's a beautiful system.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.720
So it's nine months.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.240
Here's some results
that I got with Kevin.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.780
So I went in and asked his team.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.950
He asked me-- as
the influencers,

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.830
he wanted eight
people on his team

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.110
to go through this process.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.130
So we incorporated all eight.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.390
And I went in in March of 2012,
and I said on a scale of 0

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:51.050
to 10, how's the trust
amongst the team members.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.060
So the average score,
5.8, not so high.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.080
The end of nine months-- and
Kevin worked on-- a different

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.567
Kevin-- but he worked on
positivity because when I

00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:02.942
interviewed each one of his
people, they said, "You know,

00:31:02.942 --> 00:31:04.699
he's-- you come in at 8:01.

00:31:04.699 --> 00:31:05.740
He starts yelling at you.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.970
You got to be here at 8:00.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.975
And he's blunt, and he's
competitive, and he's driving,

00:31:09.975 --> 00:31:11.350
and he doesn't
have any empathy,"

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.544
and boom, boom, boom-- it's
one thing after another.

00:31:13.544 --> 00:31:15.460
So Kevin said, "I'm going
to be more positive.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.970
I'm going to start
complimenting people.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.820
I'm going to start looking
for what they're doing well."

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.290
And it was a struggle for Kevin.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.540
So every month, he'd get
more feedback, and some of it

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.980
was good, and some
of it was, "You know,

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.730
I came in the other
day, and he was blunt,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.100
and he was brutal to me."

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.845
But it got better
and better and better

00:31:30.845 --> 00:31:32.220
because he kept
getting feedback.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.820
And then he started
asking for it.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.900
Went up to 8.5.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.030
Communication skills, 0
to 10-- that's a big word,

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.490
but I ask it anyway.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.360
How's communication?

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.430
4.41, went up to 8.5.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.520
How's the morale?

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.920
5.1, went up to 8.4.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.290
Happiness, lowest one
here-- what did you want?

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.130
Fulfillment.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.160
Happiness.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.944
4.2 was the lowest one.

00:31:51.944 --> 00:31:53.360
People did not
like going to work.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.359
They sat in their silos.

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:55.860
They didn't talk to one another.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.276
After a while, these teams
started talking to one another.

00:31:58.276 --> 00:32:01.070
They started connecting--
building better relationships.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.590
8.7-- so it went from the
lowest to the highest.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.954
And stress was high.

00:32:04.954 --> 00:32:06.370
People did not
like working there.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.530
They lost two women, which
is why they hired me.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.710
Two women with a
blunt man-- there

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.120
was more than just
behavior going on there.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.369
So they didn't want to
lose any more people.

00:32:15.369 --> 00:32:16.910
You lose somebody,
it's three times--

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:21.640
the cost to an organization is
about three times the person's

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.582
annual salary.

00:32:22.582 --> 00:32:24.540
You have to find somebody,
train them, get them

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.530
back up to speed.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:26.390
So it's a big cost.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:30.320
So they brought me in and
said we got to stop the blood.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.360
So stress went from
7.8 down to 4.3,

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.120
just working on a behavior--
being more positive.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.500
Peer coaching-- this is
a high-value activity

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.710
with a low amount of time.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.130
So the guy on the right, his
name is John [? Kerig ?].

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.310
He's a colleague of mine.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.554
And I'm in the red
suit on the right.

00:32:47.554 --> 00:32:48.470
So John's on the left.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:50.040
I'm on the right.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.020
I'd been saying for
10 years I'd like

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.210
to go skiing-- heli-skiing.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.970
I love to ski.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:55.649
And John was tired
of hearing about it.

00:32:55.649 --> 00:32:57.440
He said, so we're going
to go do something.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.356
It wasn't heli-skiing.

00:32:58.356 --> 00:32:59.909
It was cat skiing.

00:32:59.909 --> 00:33:01.200
But here's what John and I did.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.800
We listened to Marshall enough
about this peer coaching.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.660
And it's very simple.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.680
I have made up eight questions
that I've given to John,

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.530
and every Sunday night
for nine years, John and I

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.470
talk at 9 o'clock.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.440
And John asks me my
questions, and they're

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.140
yes, no, or a number.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.062
And John's given me
his 11 questions,

00:33:22.062 --> 00:33:23.270
and I ask John the questions.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.650
There's no judgment.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.190
It's just ask the
questions, and I

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.412
have an Excel spreadsheet
for nine years.

00:33:28.412 --> 00:33:29.870
So the first question
John asked me

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.420
is have you hugged
your wife this week.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.670
Well, I can tell you I
don't want to say no.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.984
So unconsciously, every
morning-- and sometimes

00:33:36.984 --> 00:33:39.400
she'll say, are you just doing
this to check the list off?

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.940
And I said no, come on, honey.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.920
I want to-- we need a hug.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.060
Have you made a difference
in someone else's life?

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.060
So I look for
opportunities to make

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.845
a difference in
other people's lives.

00:33:49.845 --> 00:33:51.220
There was a guy
in a wheelchair--

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.136
I'd just gone snowshoe
running the other day--

00:33:53.136 --> 00:33:54.730
and he was sitting,
waiting for a bus.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.020
And I have my dog with
me-- a yellow lab.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.740
And I was going to
cross the street,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.120
or I could go
another 50 feet up.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.870
And this guy was just
sitting in the snow,

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.530
waiting for the bus
in a wheelchair.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:04.495
I went 50 feet up.

00:34:04.495 --> 00:34:06.347
I found out I knew
this guy from youth.

00:34:06.347 --> 00:34:07.680
He'd been in a bad car accident.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.030
He'd been in a
wheelchair for 10 years.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.510
We had a 40-minute conversation.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.079
Did I make a
difference in his life?

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:14.780
Yeah, but I made a difference
in my life as well.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.610
Health-- so one of
John questions to me

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:21.270
is did you pick up your cell
phone in the car while driving.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.750
I want the answer to be no-- or
actually, it's how many times.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:27.780
So I want that to be
zero because I understand

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.049
that that's more dangerous
than driving drunk.

00:34:30.049 --> 00:34:31.590
So I don't want to
pick up the phone.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.850
So I don't want to
say to John "nine."

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.960
My values-- I have a
certain list of values,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.739
and John asks me my values--
high, medium, or low,

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.394
and I tell them every week.

00:34:40.394 --> 00:34:42.310
And did you have fun
with your wife this week?

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.440
And I want to say yes.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.480
Think about picking a peer coach
and taking 10 minutes a week

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.080
and asking each other questions
and keeping a spreadsheet.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.780
Do it for three
months, and then decide

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.690
whether you want to
stop doing it or not.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.330
It's changed my life.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:59.250
I drink less.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.160
I drive safer.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.670
I have a relationship with my
wife that's a little closer.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.160
So it's a pretty
simple activity.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.140
Call to action--
so the three things

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.692
I talked about-- connecting,
knowing, and winning.

00:35:13.692 --> 00:35:15.900
Think about leaving here
and connecting with somebody

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.080
that you see every day.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.220
Maybe you work with them.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.970
But you just haven't
found out about them.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.090
Maybe they shot a hole-in-one
or rode an elephant in India.

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:25.980
Make it a point once a week
to go connect with somebody.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.890
Knowing-- maybe get
on SurveyMonkey--

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:31.520
monkey survey, whatever
it's called, or just

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.770
ask some people you work with.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.680
Hey, what's one thing
that I do that really

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.990
helps you do your job well?

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.860
And what's one thing
I could do better?

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.902
Maybe do some of that.

00:35:40.902 --> 00:35:42.610
Find out a little bit
more about yourself

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.590
through the eyes of others,
and you'll find out quickly

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.840
if it's safe because they'll
say "you do just fine."

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.710
That means "I can't
tell you because I

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.410
don't think it's
safe to tell you."

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.062
But if you encourage
them and say,

00:35:54.062 --> 00:35:55.520
"Look, let me make
it safe for you.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.710
I'm just going to write it
down" and say thank you.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:58.900
Don't argue with them.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.810
Don't get defensive.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.860
Just say thank you.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.630
That's their perception.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.724
And winning?

00:36:04.724 --> 00:36:06.140
Maybe leave here
today and come up

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.100
with three to five
key results that

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.930
would reflect superior
performance from now

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.250
until the end of December
in your work at Google.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.600
So there's some call to action.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.114
Let me end with a quick story.

00:36:17.114 --> 00:36:19.030
Many years ago, I worked
with United Airlines.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.800
This was before 9/11.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.180
And we went to
Chicago, out where

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.290
the corporate offices were.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.623
And this particular day was
in the middle of the summer,

00:36:25.623 --> 00:36:27.910
and we were trying to get
from Chicago back to Boston.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:29.120
There were two of us.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.420
We show up at the airport,
and its thunderstorm

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.620
season in Boston and Chicago.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.760
They had flights leaving at
2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, and 4

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.420
o'clock.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.019
We were on the 3 o'clock.

00:36:40.019 --> 00:36:42.310
We get there, and the two
o'clock flight's still there.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.460
They hadn't boarded yet.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.820
Immediately, you know what
that's like at the airport.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.319
So you're thinking,
oh, my goodness.

00:36:47.319 --> 00:36:49.524
So the whole room was
filled with people.

00:36:49.524 --> 00:36:50.940
And we started to
work our way up,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.356
because they got
on the microphone

00:36:52.356 --> 00:36:55.010
and they said we're going to
send one of the three flights--

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.260
we know when we can get it
out of here-- because the 4

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.880
o'clock people started showing
up-- and we'll get into Boston,

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.876
and we'll have to
rebook everyone else.

00:37:02.876 --> 00:37:04.250
So we'd been
working with United.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.740
We thought maybe we had an in.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.490
Again, let's remember
connecting, knowing,

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:08.352
and winning.

00:37:08.352 --> 00:37:09.810
So as we're standing
in line, we're

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.768
getting close to the
front where the woman that

00:37:11.768 --> 00:37:13.400
makes the reservations
and rebooks--

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.740
and there's a guy in
the line next to me

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:18.350
who you can tell-- he's itchy.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:19.230
He's irritated.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.175
He's sort of looking
at his watch,

00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:22.890
and he's sort of
mumbling to himself,

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.510
and you could just tell he
was upset about something.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.070
We got to the front,
and my buddy Robin

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.210
started talking to the
woman-- connecting--

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.960
said "Do you know
such-and-such a person?"

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.810
"Oh, yeah, I used
to work with him."

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.020
He's the CFO in Chicago.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.654
She said, "I was the person that
ordered that red convertible

00:37:41.654 --> 00:37:44.730
for--" "Oh," Robin said, "Yeah,
I rode in that this weekend."

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.785
Connection-- knowing.

00:37:45.785 --> 00:37:48.400
It was sincere.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.030
So she starts going like this.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.489
Next to me, I hear this guy
start blasting the woman about,

00:37:52.489 --> 00:37:53.863
"I'm going to get
on that flight.

00:37:53.863 --> 00:37:54.830
I'm getting to Boston."

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.785
He said, "Don't
you know who I am?"

00:37:56.785 --> 00:37:59.390
And she said "Sir, sir,
just a second, please."

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.690
and she went over, and she
tapped on the microphone,

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:02.510
and she said, "Excuse me.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.620
Could I have
everybody's attention?"

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.460
There were 300 people
in the lobby waiting

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.380
to get on a flight, irritated.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.990
And she said to the man, "Can
you raise your hand, please?"

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.580
So he raises his hand, sort of
not knowing what's going on.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:17.530
"There is a follow up here
who does not know who he is."

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.640
Embarrassed him--
connecting, knowing, winning.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.130
As we left, I
turned to the woman.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.780
I said, "How do you
deal with those people?"

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.240
And she said, "Oh,
he's going to Boston.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.880
His bags are going to Boise."

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.890
We got on the flight.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:35.223
The woman that we connected
with-- two tickets came out,

00:38:35.223 --> 00:38:36.380
and off we went.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.960
So thank you for
your time here today.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.850
I have the book that
is for sale outside.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.400
Google price of $10 a book.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.470
So if you want a book, I'm done.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.860
Any questions you have for
me, I'm happy to answer.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.000
If not, you can go back to work.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.760
Questions?

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.540
Thank you.
