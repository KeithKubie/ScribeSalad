00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.680
Okay, so why virtualization in
hypervisor may give you better security,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.060
we're going to get back to the third
requirement that we have for

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.420
a trusted computing base,
which was getting it right or

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.500
having the correctness property.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.670
And correctness is really important
because compromise of that trusted

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.140
computing base means attacker
has access to everything.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.020
Remember our keys to the kingdom
statement that we had before?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.760
You compromise the operating system,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.770
you gain access to all the physical
resources, every memory page, every

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.970
block on the disk, whatever else is
coming in out of this machine and so on.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.440
So compromise off of TCB
is really bad and so

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.990
we don't want that and that's why we
want the correctness requirement.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.460
Unfortunately getting
the trusted computing base,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.110
meeting this correctness
requirement is extremely hard.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.760
Operating systems are complex,
there's all kind of concurrency,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.230
resource management, handling,
managing devices or dealing with

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.940
devices that we have lots of them and
things like that makes it complex.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.890
And we know complex is not good for
security or for correctness.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.000
So one thing you can do is make
the trusted computing base smaller.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.630
Hopefully, if it's smaller and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.180
simpler, then you have a better
change of getting it correct.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.030
So the third requirement of a TCB.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.180
You can see the connection
with virtualization.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.130
Hopefully, the hypervisor is a lot
smaller than the operating system.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.620
Because all it should do is
partition the physical resources

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.880
across the various virtual machines.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.020
And a lot of the guest management
of how those resources get used by

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.760
the applications can be done
by the guest operating system.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.290
The details right in the main point
to take away from here is that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.500
hypervisor could be smaller and simpler.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.530
And if that is true then securely or
having correctness of that, for

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.130
that obviously going to quote
it securely, is important with

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.820
the operating system because it
gives you access to everything.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.800
It's written in languages and not type
set, so keeping that program smaller and

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.600
simpler is going to help
you get it right and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.449
have that correctness requirement
that we're talking about.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.940
So, with a hypervisor,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.230
you may have a better chance than
a full fledged operating system.
