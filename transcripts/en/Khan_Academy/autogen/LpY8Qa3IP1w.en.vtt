00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560
 AUTOMATICKY PREKLAD !! it is necessary to do the whole thing 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.430
 Very similar to the last but with a slight difference. 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.860
 And the subtle difference will make a big difference. 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.050
 Let's say we have a curve integral over some curve c - 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.590
 I will define the second curve - zx square y 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:25.420
 Second Dx and Dy 2xy - And it can look very good 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.000
 This was very similar to what we saw last time, except the last one 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.520
 This time we had a closed integral. 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.550
 This is not a closed integral. 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.560
 And our curve, c, parameterization is x is 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.080
 equals cosine t, y equals sine of woods. 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.480
 Meanwhile - it looks like he's sitting. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.020
 Let me write sinus t - so far it looks very similar to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.800
 closed integral example we are in last 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.120
 video but instead t go from 0 to 2 pi, we will 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.570
 have t go from 0 to pi. 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.180
 t is greater than or equal to 0, less than or equal to pi. 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.650
 So now we are basically our way - if I should draw on 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.420
 XY Plane - That's my y axis, that's my x-axis. 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 So our path is not around a unit circle. 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.120
 Our way - our c curve now - just starts t is equal to 0. 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.120
 It can be imagined that t is almost an angle. 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.950
 t is equal to 0, and we want to go pi. 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.970
 So this is our journey right now, in this example. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.330
 So it's not a curved road. 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.830
 This is not a closed path. 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.270
 So we can't just show that f, in this example - and we are 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.580
 to re-look at what f looks like - Hey that's it 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.370
 conservative vector field if it is a closed loop that is equal 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.920
 0, this is not a closed loop. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.970
 So we can't use it. 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.510
 But let's see if we can use any of our other tools. 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.720
 As we saw in the last video, it may look like 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.800
 a little stranger to you. 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.040
 But when you say f is equal to i, plus 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.140
 times j then it might look a little more familiar. 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.230
 When we say that f xy - f vector field equals x 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:15.500
 reliability plus y second times i plus 2xy ja Dr. - I am 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.980
 I don't even have to look at this right now. Dr, you can always 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.230
 to write it as dx i plus dy x j. 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.720
 You will instantly see when you have the scalar product of these 2 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.330
 things when Dr. dot f - are both vector rated 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.150
 vector award winning differential, valued vector box or vector 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.760
 Valuable Features - If you dr f dot, you get 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.460
 Here is. 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.820
 You get what we have in the interval. 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.270
 You'll get it, okay? 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.120
 That times - your product and conditions - 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.290
 That times it equals it and add it to 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.360
 product of j conditions. 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.080
 2xy times dy. 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.820
 Write it. 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.000
 So our integral, we can rewrite it like this. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.650
 Along this curve f dot dr where is our f. 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.000
 Now we still want to ask a question, is it 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.680
 conservative fields? 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.010
 Or does it have the potential? 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.650
 Is equal to the transition of some function, the capital ff? 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.810
 I think I could write the transition because 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.860
 This creates a vector. 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.390
 It's like a vector. 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.650
 Is it true? 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.040
 And we saw the last video, that's it. 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.600
 I'll be doing it again a little this time. 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.830
 Because if that's true, we can't say it's closed 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.950
 Repeat and say oh that it is equal to 0. 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.330
 But if that's true, then we know it - that 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.660
 Integral is a path independent. 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:44.040
 nothing here 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.450
 And we will find that it equals capital F, 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.780
 If we say that t is z - Well, in this case t is 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.000
 goes from 0 to pi - we can say it will be 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.490
 equals capital fi minus capital F 0. 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.910
 Or if we want to write x and y - because f 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.150
 there will be x and y - we could write - and that 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.195
 Right here, these are them 

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:13.000
 nothing here 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.290
 We could also write that it equals fx pi, y 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:31.020
 pi, minus fx 0, y 0. 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.830
 It's what I mean when I say f pi. 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.070
 If we were to write f purely as a function of t. 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.310
 But we know that this capital f will be a function. 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.960
 This is a scalar function defined in xy. 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.060
 So we could say fx pi, y pi. 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.460
 These are now. 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.920
 These are all equivalent. 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.090
 So if it's a path dependent, we can find our f. 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.420
 We can only evaluate it, just by accepting ours 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.970
 f, rating on these two points. 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.770
 At this point and at that moment over there. 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.040
 Because the way would be independent. 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.130
 If it is conservative, if it has a potential function, 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.090
 As for the transition from another Scalar field, and then it 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.790
 is a conservative vector field and its integral 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.750
 The road is independent. 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.710
 It depends only on it and that. 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.750
 So let's see if we can find our f. 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.670
 So I'll do exactly what we did in the last video. 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.400
 If you're watching the last video, it might be 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.090
 a little monotonous. 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.540
 But I'll do it a little faster here. 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.430
 So we know that a partial f for x is being prepared 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.310
 it must be right here. 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.690
 So that is the reliability of x plus y to the other. 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.050
 Which tells us when we take an antiderivative, considering 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.420
 x, then f xy is going to have to be x to 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.510
 third over 3 plus xy reliability - right? y on the other is just 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.830
 constant in terms of x - plus f y. 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.640
 There may be some y functions when you do 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.480
 partial for x, just disappears. 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.980
 And then we know that partial fs with regard to 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.140
 y has to be equal to it or that. 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.070
 We say it's a transition f. 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.670
 So it is supposed to be partial for y. 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.230
 2xy. 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.430
 And maybe you would watch the video. 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.540
 I'll just go a little slower in this one. 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.410
 So out of that primitive for y - so we get f 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.050
 xy - would be the same xy reliability plus some 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.770
 Function x. 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.590
 Now we're in the last video. 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.590
 These 2 things must be the same to 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.520
 transition from capital f to lowercase letters f. 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.350
 And we have xy reliability, xy squared. 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.180
 We have a function x, we have a function of pure x. 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.860
 And then here, we don't have a pure y function 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.090
 So it has to be 0 here. 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.560
 We solved. 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.250
 Our city f xy must be equal to x 3 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.660
 over 3 plus xy to the other. 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.120
 We know that lowercase letters f are definitely conservative. 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.200
 It is a path independent. 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.350
 It has its potential. 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.750
 It's a transition over here. 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.970
 And solve our integral - that was 0 - solve ours 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.470
 integral, we'll have to figure out x pi, y 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.970
 pi, x 0, y 0. 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.140
 Evaluates bullets and then subtracts 2. 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.400
 So let's go. 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.630
 Doctor x was the cosine of t, y is the sine of t. 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.160
 Let me rewrite them down here. 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.880
 X is therefore equal to cosine t. 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.360
 y is equal to sine t. 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:51.600
 Thus, X 0 is equal to cosine 0, which is equal to 1. 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.400
 x pi equals cosine pi equal to minus 1. 

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.960
 y 0 is sine 0, which is 0. 

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.870
 y pi, which equals the sine of p, which is equal to 0. 

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.140
 So fx pi, y pi - that's the same, 

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.970
 So I rewrite it. 

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.560
 Our integral is simplified to - our integral along this path 

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:26.130
 f point dr - will be equal to capital fx pi. 

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.620
 x pi is minus 1. 

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.730
 y is equal to 0. 

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:48.730
 Minus capital fx 0 is 1, comma y 0 0. 

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.950
 So what is it? 

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.160
 Just remember, here's the same thing 

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.810
 It's right there. 

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.150
 That's x pi. 

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.400
 This is y pi. 

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.100
 Term here. 

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.250
 You can imagine this whole f minus 1, 0 - that's the same
