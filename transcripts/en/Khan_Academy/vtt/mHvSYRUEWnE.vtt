00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.990
Welcome back.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.410
In this presentation I'm just
going to do a bunch of examples

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.200
of taking the antiderivative or
the indefinite integral of

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.610
polynomial expressions, and
hopefully I'll show you that

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.740
it's a pretty straightforward
thing to do.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.952
So let's get started.

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:22.755
If I wanted to take indefinite
integral-- and you could do a

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.810
web search for integral and
you'll see this drawn

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.190
properly-- take the indefinite
integral-- let me make

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.060
a big expression.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.930
Let's say I want to take the
indefinite integral of 3x to

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:49.650
the negative 5 minus 7x
to the third plus 3

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.250
minus x to the ninth.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.900
So you might already
be intimidated by

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.670
what I wrote down.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.700
Well, one, if you saw the
last presentation or if you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.035
understood presentation, you
probably realize, well the

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:04.690
indefinite integral even
though it looks like fancy

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.770
math isn't that fancy.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.020
Or at least it isn't that
difficult to perform.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.610
And all you have to realize now
is if we took the derivative of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.790
a polynomial, it was just the
sum of the derivatives

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.490
of each of the terms.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.880
it actually it turns out is the
same way the other way around.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990
The antiderivative of this
entire expression is just the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.160
sum of the antidervatives of
each of the individual terms.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.420
So we can just take
the [? integers ?]

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.570
of each term and we'll
get the answer.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.960
So what does this equal?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.800
Well in this case 3x
to the minus 5 power.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.000
So we take the exponent, we add
1 to the exponent, so now we

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.470
get x to the negative 4, and
then we multiply the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.380
coefficient times 1
over the new exponent.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.160
So 1 over the new
exponent is minus 1/4.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.933
So 3 times minus
1/4 is minus 3/4.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.860
And let's see.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.670
Here we have x to the third.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.050
So instead of x to the third,
let's raise it by one number.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.520
So we get x to the fourth.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.560
And then we multiply
the coefficient.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.770
You know, we could either just
keep the minus and say the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.353
coefficient's 7, or we could
just say the coefficient

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.290
is minus 7.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.420
We multiply the coefficient
times 1 over the new exponent.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.370
So the new exponent is 4,
so we multiply 1/4 times

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.160
minus 7, so minus 7/4.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.730
And now this is interesting.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.880
3, just 3.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.270
Well how do we apply this?

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.760
Well isn't 3 the same thing
as 3 times x to the 0?

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.710
Right, because x to
the 0 is just 1.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.300
And that's how you
should view it.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.280
It shows you that this rule
is actually very consistent.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.740
So what's the answer
derivative of 3?

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.360
Well if we view 3 as 3 x to the
0, we raise the exponent by

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.520
1, so now we're going
to have x to the 1.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.145
And x to the 1 is just
x, so I'm just going

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:16.180
to leave it as an x.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.410
And we multiply it, the old
coefficient-- this 3 or you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.830
know the derivative
coefficient-- we multiply that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.600
times 1 over the inverse
of the new exponent.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.580
So the exponent's 1, so
the inverse of 1 is 1,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.670
so it just stays 3.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.670
We've multiplied 3 times
1/1, which is still just 3.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.090
And then finally x to the
ninth-- I think you're getting

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.460
the hang of this-- we raise the
exponent by one,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.270
x to the tenth.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.920
And then we multiply the
current coefficient.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.860
Well the current coefficient
is minus 1, right.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.430
We just didn't
write the 1 there.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.530
We multiply the current
coefficient minus 1 times

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.880
1 over the new exponent,
so it's minus 1/10.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.810
There we did it.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.520
That wasn't too difficult of
taking the antiderivative

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.710
or-- I always forget.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.270
Plus c, right?

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.835
Because when you take the
derivative of any constant

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:15.030
it becomes 0, so it might
have disappeared here.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.050
So plus c where this
is any constant.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.310
This could be a 10, could
be a million, could

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.305
be a minus trillion.

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:23.400
It's any constant.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.160
And just to really hit the
point home, let's take the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.300
derivative of this and just
make sure we got

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.890
this expression.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.590
And hopefully this is second
nature to you by now.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.550
And you know if you ever run
out of practice problems

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.350
in your book because you
love doing math so much,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.280
just make up problems.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.083
That's what I'm doing.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.860
I do this even when I'm not
recording videos, just for fun.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.930
So let's take the
derivative of this.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.840
Minus 4 times this coefficient.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.910
Minus 4 times minus 3/4 is 3x.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.740
Then we subtract 1 from
this exponent, minus 5.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:09.090
And then 4 times 4 is minus 7 x
to the-- we take 1 from this

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.300
exponent-- x to the third.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.920
And I promise you I'm not
even looking up here.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.000
I know you might think, well
Sal, he's just looking up here,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.250
but no I'm actually in my head
at least working through this.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.540
And then plus the
derivative of 3x.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.140
Well the derivative of 3x is
3-- is almost second nature

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.510
now, but you can kind of
do this-- is 3x to the 1.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.820
And you say 1 times 3
is 3 times x to the 0.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.400
And then 10 times minus 1/10.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.220
Well that's just minus 1.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.670
x to the 1 less than 10, so x
to the ninth, plus-- what's the

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.690
derivative of any constant?

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.330
Right, it's 0.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.810
You could almost do this
constant as some number

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.850
times x to the 0.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.310
And if you took the derivative,
well you multiply the 0

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.600
times c and you get 0.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.130
Well, you might get minus
1 depending on how

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.520
you're doing it.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.060
But that's actually kind of
an interesting question.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.120
OK I'll stop digressing.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.190
But you get a 0 here, and if
you simplify that, that just

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.450
equals 3x to the minus 5
minus 7x to the third plus

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.720
3 minus x to the ninth.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.480
Think we have time for one
more problem like this.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.630
I think you probably got this.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.890
This is probably one of the
more straightforward things

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.970
you'll learn in mathematics.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.200
And in future presentations
I'll give you more of an

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.400
intuition of why the
antiderivative is useful.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.580
We're learning the indefinite
integral, but we could learn to

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.045
use the definite integral,
which we'll learn in a couple

00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:38.500
of presentations to figure out
things like the area under

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.050
curve, or the volume of
a rotational figure.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.800
Well I don't confuse
you too much.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.630
Let's do one more problem.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.820
I won't make this one as hairy.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:55.870
So the integral of negative
1/2x to the minus 3

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.760
plus 7x to the fifth.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.340
Let's start with this
term of the polynomial.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.790
We raise the exponent one,
so x to the minus 2 now,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.710
right, because we added
one to negative 3.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.620
And then we multiply 1 over
this new exponent times

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.940
the old coefficient.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.480
And actually I'll write
out all the steps.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.170
So the old coefficient
is minus 1/2.

00:07:30.395 --> 00:07:34.230
So this is a minus 2.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.930
Minus 2 so we multiply
it times minus 1/2.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.000
Let me switch colors back.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.410
Plus we raise the exponent by
one, x to the sixth, and we

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:54.140
multiply the old coefficient
times 1 over the new

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.550
coefficient, times 1/6.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.620
And so what's the answer?

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.430
Well what's minus 1/2
times minus 1/2?

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:11.030
Well that's positive
1/4 x to the minus 2.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.350
Oh, and of course, plus c.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.820
As you can tell, this is
my main source of missing

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.980
points on calculus quizzes.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:30.790
1/4 x to the minus 2 plus
7/6 x to the sixth plus c.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:31.700
There you go.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.160
And if you wanted to take the
derivative, minus 2 times 1/4

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.420
is minus 2/4 which is minus
1/2 x to the minus 3.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.320
And then 6 times 7/6 is 7x.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.440
And then you decrease
the exponent by one,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.430
x to the fifth.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.900
And the derivative of
our constant is 0.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.200
And then we get our
original expression.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.000
Hopefully at this point you're
pretty comfortable taking a

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.540
derivative of a polynomial, and
then given a polynomial you can

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.500
actually take the
antiderivative, go

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.980
the other way.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.770
And never forget to
do your plus c.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.500
And I hope you understand why
we have to put that constant

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.460
there, because when you take an
antiderivative, you don't know

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.350
whether the original thing that
you the derivative of I guess

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.600
had a constant there, because
the constant's derivative is 0.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.470
Hopefully I confused you
with that last statement.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.320
I'll see you in the next
presentation and I'll show you

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.450
how to reverse the chain rule.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:26.930
See you soon.
