accomplished there are times when it
would appear that all hope is lost and

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200
would appear that all hope is lost and
 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.210
would appear that all hope is lost and
that if we are not to end our days stuck

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220
that if we are not to end our days stuck
 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.580
that if we are not to end our days stuck
on these local maximum whatever we have

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590
on these local maximum whatever we have
 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.280
on these local maximum whatever we have
achieved that we have to fundamentally

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290
achieved that we have to fundamentally
 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.039
achieved that we have to fundamentally
experiment with ways of thinking if only

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049
experiment with ways of thinking if only
 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.860
experiment with ways of thinking if only
temporarily to get us to higher ground

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870
temporarily to get us to higher ground
 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.120
temporarily to get us to higher ground
