The Johnny Cash Song "A Boy Named Sue" — TodayIFoundOut

00:00:01.505 --> 00:00:05.430
The Johnny Cash song “A Boy Named Sue”
was written by Shel Silverstein.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.240
The song was originally inspired by a friend
of Silverstein’s, Jean Shepherd (noted writer,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.579
actor, radio personality, and humorist, who,
among other things, co-wrote and narrated

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.450
the holiday classic The Christmas Story film,
partially based on his childhood).

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.630
Jean had often been teased and picked on as
a child for his somewhat effeminate name and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.800
was quoted as saying because of it, “I fist-fought
my way through every grade in school.”

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.230
As to why Silverstein picked “Sue”, it
is thought that it was after famed attorney

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.010
Sue Hicks who was named after his mother who
died from complications due to child birth

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.820
a few days after giving birth to Hicks.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.519
Hicks is most famous for his part in the 1925
Scopes Trial.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.640
For those unfamiliar, John T. Scopes was a
teacher in Tennessee who broke Tennessee State

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.129
law by teaching evolution in his classroom.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.079
In any event, at a party in 1969 held at Johnny
Cash’s home, some of the guests decided

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.730
to have an impromptu “guitar pull”, which
was where a group of people pass a guitar

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.580
around with each person playing and singing
a song.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.030
Among those in attendance at Johnny Cash’
party were Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, and,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.370
of course, Shel Silverstein.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.810
Mitchell sang “Both Sides Now” and Dylan
sang “Lay Lady Lay”.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.810
When it was Silverstein’s turn, he sang
“A Boy Named Sue”.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.020
Cash was enamored with the song and so Silverstein
wrote the lyrics down for him.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.250
Cash’ wife, June, told him he should record
the song in the upcoming show he was doing

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.990
at the San Quentin prison on February 24,
1969.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.570
Cash was at first resistant to recording it
at the show, as he didn’t think he’d have

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.560
time to learn it… and, indeed, he didn’t,
but recorded it anyway.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.820
As Cash later said,
“I’d only sung it the first time the night

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.510
before and I read it off as I sang it.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.710
I still didn’t know the words.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.840
As a last resort, I pulled those lyrics out
and laid them on the music stand, and when

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.680
it came time that I thought I was brave enough,
I did the song.”

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.150
In fact, if you watch the filmed recording
of him performing “A Boy Named Sue” during

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.300
that concert, you can see Cash is reading
the lyrics as he sings, almost for the entire

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.300
song.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.390
As he really liked “A Boy Named Sue” and
the inmates had responded well to it, Cash

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.550
convinced Columbia Records, after cleaning
up the lyrics a bit to be more radio friendly,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.650
to release the song as a single.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.940
Up to this point, Cash had previously seen
quite a bit of success, but had never had

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.430
a record crack the top 10 in the Billboard’s
Hot 100 (in fact, Cash still holds the record

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.890
for most consecutive songs that charted on
the Top 100 without cracking the top 10- at

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.890
36 songs).

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.860
“A Boy Named Sue” changed all that, rocketing
to #2 on the Hot 100 list and staying there

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.870
for 3 weeks.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.190
It also hit #1 on the U.S. Billboard’s Hot
Country Singles.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.930
Bonus Facts:
• While Shel Silverstein is today best known

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.831
for his children’s poem books such as “Where
the Sidewalk Ends”, before that he was a

00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:05.959
noted song writer and longtime writer/cartoonist
for Playboy magazine (from 1957 through much

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.620
of the 1970s.)

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.150
Silverstein got his start as a professional
cartoonist when he was drafted into the army

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.130
in 1953 and was published in the Pacific Stars
and Stripes.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.470
After the war, he got a job as a hot dog seller,
primarily working Cubs and White Sox games.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.880
During this time, he also continued to submit
his cartoons to various magazines and his

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.689
career blossomed from there.

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.730
• There is a sequel of sorts to “A Boy
Named Sue”, written by Shel Silverstein

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.810
from the perspective of the father of Sue,
called “The Father of a Boy Named Sue”.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.930
Not to completely spoil the ending, but let’s
just say the last few verses more reflect

00:03:44.930 --> 00:04:02.669
Silverstein’s adult themed work, rather
than his children’s poems.
