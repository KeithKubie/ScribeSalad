00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:08.741
IT'S A TOOLBOX
THAT FITS IN YOUR POCKET,

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:13.346
ONE TOOL THAT DOES MORE
THAN JUST ONE JOB.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.482
HOW DOES THIS 8 1/2-INCH PIECE
OF METAL

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.818
TRANSFORM
INTO SO MANY DIFFERENT TOOLS?

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:26.993
UNDER A TEMPERED STEEL FRAME...

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:35.067
17 DIFFERENT TOOLS
DEPLOY WITH A SIMPLE FLICK.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:39.072
THREE SETS OF SAFETY TABS
LOCK THEM INTO PLACE.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.845
A CLEVER HINGE
HOLDS THE TOOLS TOGETHER

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.115
AND ALLOWS FOR
A TRADEMARK TRANSFORMATION

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:52.184
FROM A MULTI-TOOL
TO A PAIR OF PLIERS

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.287
WITH A FLICK OF THE WRIST.

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:58.224
17 DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.693
TO THOUSANDS
OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:08.500
THIS MULTI-TOOL GIVES YOU
RAZOR-SHARP BLADES

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.003
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.574
SO EACH TOOL MUST HAVE
A DEDICATED SAFETY MECHANISM.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.747
THE HINGES OF THE LONG BLADES...

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.954
CLICK INTO
TEMPERED STEEL CATCHES.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.289
ON THE OTHER SIDE,

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.461
T-SHAPED TABS SECURE THE BASES
OF THE SHORTER TOOLS.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.567
AND IN THE PLIER FORMATION,

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:45.638
HIDDEN WEDGES PUSH OUT A PIN

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.841
TO LOCK DOWN THE BLADES
ON THE INSIDE.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.444
THEY RELEASE
WHEN YOU CLOSE THE PLIERS

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.681
SO YOU CAN GET ON WITH
THE NEXT JOB.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.086

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.656

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.260
OUT OF THE TIGHTEST OF SPOTS.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.363
WHY WOULD YOU EVER
LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT?
