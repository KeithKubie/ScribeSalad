Hi, my name is Satyajeet Salgar.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.480
I work in Google Search.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.671
Thanks for watching.

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.170
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the Knowledge Graph

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.270
and how using schema.org
markup, we, Google,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.260
and you developers
and content owners

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.020
can work together to build a
better experience for people

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.190
around media.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.750
But first, let's talk
about why this matters.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.720
It matters because life is hard.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.932
There's always a lot to do.

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:24.640
Everything is harder
than it needs to be.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.250
And most things are unfair.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.190
But some things make
it a little bit better.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.350
One of those things are
movies and television.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.000
If you're a fan like me, it's
an important part of your life.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.320
And most people are like me.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.830
According to
official statistics,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.330
literally the only
thing people do more

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.820
than watch television is sleep.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.720
We at Google see this in what
people ask us about every day

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.170
as well.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.100
But finding great
content to watch

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.860
is actually getting harder.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.110
And there are a
number of reasons why.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.720
The main reason
is fragmentation.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.461
There's just more
content being created.

00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:01.210
The amount of content
that's being created

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.099
has exploded, as have
the ways to distribute

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.970
that content and the
business models tied to it.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.110
Do you rent, or do you buy?

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.605
Do you watch HD or SD?

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:11.730
Do you have access through
your cable provider?

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.960
Is there a window after
which this movie will

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.690
be open on another service?

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.630
Finally, do you watch
this on your phone?

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.020
Can you watch it on TV?

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.450
Will this be on broadcast
television at some point?

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.100
So basically something that
would make life less hard

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.440
has become a hard problem.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.860
But let's solve
that hard problem,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.240
and let's do it together.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.030
First, let's break this
problem down a little bit.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.700
Let's talk about
three things and help

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.320
people solve these three.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.270
What are the various things
that these people could watch?

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.330
Where should they
consider watching it?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.950
And why should they
consider watching it?

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.520
Now let's talk
about the tools we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.310
have available to
us to help them.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.990
In particular, let's talk about
the Google Knowledge Graph.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.920
The Knowledge Graph maps
out how 1 billion things

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.080
in the real world-- 1 billion
things-- people, places,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.380
and things-- are
connected to each other.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.880
Having this data in
a structured form

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.070
lets us do some really
powerful things with it.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.210
It helps us answer all
sorts of hard questions

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.280
every single day.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.460
For example, just ask
Google a celebrity's age,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.760
or compare two entities
like rivers or two movies,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.500
or ask at Google who won
the Oscars a certain year.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.110
Today, we answer questions
like a movie's running time,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.460
its cost, and so much more.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.780
We can answer some really
hard questions as well.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.390
For example, how many
degrees of separation

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.400
is your favorite actor
from Kevin Bacon?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.650
Or what movies have
two actors you've

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.110
heard about been in together?

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.710
Just try this out.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.940
Now let's go back and
tackle those questions

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.050
we wanted to answer,
starting with helping

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.030
you decide what to watch.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.310
Try searching for action movies,
or even movies about basketball

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.090
on an Android phone.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.110
You'll see an entry point into
a rich, immersive experience.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.030
You can browse a list
of movies, click through

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.020
to learn more
about one you like,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.460
learn everything about
it, as well as check out

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.310
a magically organized list of
recommended similar movies.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.740
We think this experience of
organized Knowledge Panels

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.220
will help you explore movies and
TV shows you never heard about

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.360
and make it a lot more fun.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.170
Now let's go to that
second question--

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.100
where should you watch it?

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.060
The most obvious thing we
could do at Google to help you

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.160
with that is give you a link
right on the Knowledge Panel

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.700
to click on when you're
looking at a piece of content.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.840
So we've done that
most obvious thing.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.040
For numerous
episodes and movies,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.020
we're trying hard to give
you a single click that'll

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.890
let you either watch or
buy that piece of content.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.930
We want to partner
with you to make

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.030
sure we let people watch
every single piece of content

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.860
every creator ever created
with a single click.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.380
Now let's talk about why
someone watches something.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.880
Now, there are many
things that help

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.470
you decide if you're
going to watch--

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.740
what the trailer of
a movie looks like,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.720
who's in it, who the director
is and what they did before.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.850
We try hard to give you all of
that information on the Google

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.090
Knowledge Panel.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.310
Now, another important factor
is what critics you like

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.940
and trusted voices also think
about that piece of content.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.010
So we made it easier to
surface critic reviews right

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.650
on Google Knowledge Panels.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.660
Try it out for
some recent movies.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.370
We've actually found
that people are

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.230
able to make better
decisions because of this.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.960
They tell us it gives
them more nuance

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.100
as well as introduces them to
new critics whose opinions they

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.580
really enjoy.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.880
Now, we're starting
with movies, but we

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.670
believe the pattern will carry
over to all media-- for books,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.160
for TV shows, games, music.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.290
In fact, we're inviting you to
submit critic reviews for books

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.410
as well.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.070
Stay tuned as we extend
this to other verticals.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.040
So hopefully the question
at this point is,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.700
what's in it for me as a
developer or content owner,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.020
and how hard is this to do?

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.680
Now not only do we believe
this creates a better

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.820
experience for
people, we think it's

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.210
a great way for people to find
your content-- your videos

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.480
or your reviews--
and get introduced

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.090
to your app, your
website, or your service.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.970
By simply adding a couple of
lines of schema.org markup

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.550
on your site, you can ensure
that Google finds and surfaces

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.300
these links on search,
on desktop, as well as

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.200
on the web and mobile.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.630
So what I want to
leave you with.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.480
We're expanding beyond our
set of initial partners.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.800
Join us.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.060
It's easy to do.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.960
And it's a great
way to help people

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.830
find your app or service.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.980
Check out developers.google.com
to learn more.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.500
Let's build a better
media experience

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.440
and help people make
better decisions

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.040
about what they watch.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.550
Thanks for making a great
decision and watching this far.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.100
