00:00:00.683 --> 00:00:01.835
- [Voiceover] What is the product

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:06.835
of the smallest prime number
that is greater than 50

00:00:07.013 --> 00:00:11.030
and the greatest prime
number that is less than 50?

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.468
So let's just think about
the numbers around 50.

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:17.787
So I don't know, I'll start
with five below and five above.

00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:22.787
So we go 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50,

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:30.551
51, 52, 53, 54, and 55

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:34.667
and I could obviously keep
going in both directions.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.641
Now we want to take the product

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:39.496
of the smallest prime number
that is greater than 50.

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:42.492
So let's start at 50 and
let's go greater than that,

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:44.163
think about which of these are prime.

00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:46.834
Now 51 is always a little
tricky one, it feels prime

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:51.083
but it's good to know that
that's 17 times three,

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:53.103
and one way to test a
divisibility by three

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:53.815
is to add these digits.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:55.680
Five plus one is equal to six,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.027
and we have other Khan Academy videos

00:00:57.027 --> 00:00:58.420
on why that actually works.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.254
But six is divisible by three,

00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:01.879
so this is not a prime number.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.851
52 is clearly even, so
it's not a prime number.

00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:06.872
And so the smallest prime number above 50

00:01:06.872 --> 00:01:08.590
is going to be 53.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.097
53. Try things out.

00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:14.836
53. Its only factors are one and itself.

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.229
So this is the smallest prime number

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.390
that is greater than 50,

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.363
and what is the greatest prime number

00:01:19.363 --> 00:01:20.154
that is less than 50?

00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:22.614
So now let's start at 50 and go backwards,

00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:23.937
and find the greatest prime number

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:25.006
that is less than 50.

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:26.793
49 is seven times seven,

00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:28.930
this is even, and this is six times eight,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.804
47 is a prime number, its only
factors are one and itself.

00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:38.612
So really, they want us to
take the product of 53 and 47.

00:01:38.612 --> 00:01:43.612
So, 53 times 47,

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:50.291
and we are going to get
seven times three is 21,

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:55.291
seven times five is 35 plus two is 37,

00:01:55.562 --> 00:02:00.363
and now we can do four
times, put a zero here

00:02:00.363 --> 00:02:02.574
because we're really
multiplying with a 40,

00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:05.964
four times three is 12,

00:02:05.964 --> 00:02:09.441
four times five is 20 plus one is 21,

00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.697
and we get, one plus zero is one,

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:15.615
seven plus two is nine,
three plus one is four,

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:19.615
and we have a two, we get 2,491.
