00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:08.780
You've probably heard of the human genome,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.393
the huge collection of genes

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:13.790
inside each and every one of your cells.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.244
You probably also know

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:16.827
that we've sequenced the human genome,

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:18.993
but what does that actually mean?

00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:22.159
How do you sequence someone's genome?

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:23.795
Let's back up a bit.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.462
What is a genome?

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:30.520
Well, a genome is all the genes plus some extra

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.584
that make up an organism.

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:34.582
Genes are made up of DNA,

00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:37.678
and DNA is made up of long, paired strands

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:38.914
of A's,

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.084
T's,

00:00:40.084 --> 00:00:41.970
C's,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.832
and G's.

00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.350
Your genome is the code

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.862
that your cells use to know how to behave.

00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:51.315
Cells interacting together make tissues.

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:54.447
Tissues cooperating with each other make organs.

00:00:54.447 --> 00:00:56.411
Organs cooperating with each other

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:57.910
make an organism,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.238
you!

00:00:59.238 --> 00:01:01.998
So, you are who you are

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:04.621
in large part because of your genome.

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:06.048
The first human genome

00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:08.160
was sequenced ten years ago

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.996
and was no easy task.

00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:12.909
It took two decades to complete,

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.676
required the effort of hundreds of scientists

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.241
across dozens of countries,

00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.474
and cost over three billion dollars.

00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:22.132
But some day very soon,

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:24.318
it will be possible to know the sequence of letters

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.740
that make up your own personal genome

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.493
all in a matter of minutes

00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:29.821
and for less than the cost

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:32.431
of a pretty nice birthday present.

00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.323
How is that possible?

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.323
Let's take a closer look.

00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:38.906
Knowing the sequence of the billions of letters

00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:40.382
that make up your genome

00:01:40.382 --> 00:01:42.908
is the goal of genome sequencing.

00:01:42.908 --> 00:01:46.449
A genome is both really, really big

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:49.402
and very, very small.

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:51.592
The individual letters of DNA,

00:01:51.592 --> 00:01:54.777
the A's, T's, G's, and C's,

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:57.767
are only eight or ten atoms wide,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:01.307
and they're all packed together into a clump,

00:02:01.307 --> 00:02:03.048
like a ball of yarn.

00:02:03.048 --> 00:02:05.155
So, to get all that information

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:07.407
out of that tiny space,

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:08.993
scientists first have to break

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:14.054
the long string of DNA down into smaller pieces.

00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:17.050
Each of these pieces is then separated in space

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.908
and sequenced individually,

00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:20.336
but how?

00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:21.495
It's helpful to remember

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:24.248
that DNA binds to other DNA

00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:27.997
if the sequences are the exact opposite of each other.

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:29.807
A's bind to T's,

00:02:29.807 --> 00:02:32.388
and T's bind to A's.

00:02:32.388 --> 00:02:34.217
G's bind to C's,

00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:36.593
and C's to G's.

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:40.600
If the A-T-G-C sequence of two pieces of DNA

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.680
are exact opposites,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.683
they stick together.

00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:45.408
Because the genome pieces

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:47.188
are so very small,

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:48.813
we need some way to increase

00:02:48.813 --> 00:02:50.426
the signal we can detect

00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:52.703
from each of the individual letters.

00:02:52.703 --> 00:02:54.193
In the most common method,

00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:57.189
scientists use enzymes to make thousands of copies

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.376
of each genome piece.

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.834
So, we now have thousands of replicas

00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:03.926
of each of the genome pieces,

00:03:03.926 --> 00:03:05.553
all with the same sequence

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:09.740
of A's, T's, G's, and C's.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.358
But we have to read them all somehow.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.114
To do this, we need to make

00:03:14.114 --> 00:03:15.960
a batch of special letters,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.962
each with a distinct color.

00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:20.847
A mixture of these special colored letters and enzymes

00:03:20.847 --> 00:03:22.289
are then added to the genome

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:23.925
we're trying to read.

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:25.555
At each spot on the genome,

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:26.873
one of the special letters

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.807
binds to its opposite letter,

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:32.009
so we now have a double-stranded piece of DNA

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.594
with a colorful spot at each letter.

00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:36.390
Scientists then take pictures

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.765
of each snippet of genome.

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:40.349
Seeing the order of the colors

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.599
allows us to read the sequence.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.014
The sequences of each

00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:47.244
of these millions of pieces of DNA

00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:49.361
are stitched together using computer programs

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.868
to create a complete sequence of the entire genome.

00:03:52.868 --> 00:03:53.926
This isn't the only way

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:56.527
to read the letter sequences of pieces of DNA,

00:03:56.527 --> 00:03:58.289
but it's one of the most common.

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.997
Of course, just reading the letters in the genome

00:04:00.997 --> 00:04:02.630
doesn't tell us much.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.628
It's kind of like looking through a book

00:04:04.628 --> 00:04:07.176
written in a language you don't speak.

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:08.884
You can recognize all the letters

00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:11.547
but still have no idea what's going on.

00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:13.602
So, the next step is to decipher

00:04:13.602 --> 00:04:15.461
what the sequence means,

00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.722
how your genome and my genome are different.

00:04:18.722 --> 00:04:20.639
Interpreting the genes of the genome

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.455
is the part scientists are still working on.

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:26.121
While not every difference is consequential,

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:27.679
the sum of these differences

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:29.217
is responsible for differences

00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:30.430
in how we look,

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.431
what we like,

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:32.623
how we act,

00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:34.844
and even how likely we are to get sick

00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:37.309
or respond to specific medicines.

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.977
Better understanding of how disparities

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:40.210
between our genomes

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.809
account for these differences

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.774
is sure to change the way we think

00:04:43.774 --> 00:04:46.540
not only about how doctors treat their patients,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.123
but also how we treat each other.
