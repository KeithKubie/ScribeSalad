00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.700
Tina Seelig: I'm Tina Seelig, and I play two
roles here today.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.100
First, I am the host normally.
But today, I am also the speaker.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.860
So I'm going to give you a little bit of my
background so you know actually who am I besides

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.800
the person who usually introduces our other
guests.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.720
I am the executive director of the Stanford
Technology Ventures Program, and along with

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.050
my wonderful colleagues Tom Byers and Kathy
Eisenhardt -- who are the faculty directors

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.739
 -- we run the Stanford Technology Ventures
Program.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.649
And we spent all out of our efforts thinking
about research and teaching and outreach efforts

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.719
all related to high-tech entrepreneurship.
My background is a little bit unusual.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.190
I actually did my Ph.D. over at the med school.
I did my Ph.D.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.760
in neuroscience, and after that I've done
a bunch of different things.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.949
I was a management consultant, I was a multimedia
producer, I worked at Compac.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.679
I started a company.
And I also have written a whole bunch of books.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.749
And this talk is about the most recent book
I wrote called, "What I wish I knew when I

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.469
was 20.”
Now, there's an interesting story behind this

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.620
talk, because I actually gave a talk by the
same name three years ago right here.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.870
At that point, this talk was extremely raw.
It was brand new.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.220
It was just the beginning of some ideas.
But what happened is, the talk ended up really

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.460
getting some traction.
And a year ago -- almost exactly a year ago

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.030
 -- I was asked by HarperCollins to turn this
talk into a book.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.370
And so, over the last year, I spent a lot
of time digging into these concepts and came

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.940
up with a bunch of really new and interesting
stories and, in fact, changed my point of

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.080
view on some of these ideas.
So I'm going to tell you a little bit about

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.470
what's inside this book and invite you at
the end to ask whatever questions you might

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.620
have.
Okay. So, as part of my role at STVP, I have

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.350
the incredible honor of teaching a course
on Creativity and Innovation.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.871
In fact, I see some of my students in the
room.

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:58.540
And the entire overarching theme of this class
is that "All problems are opportunities.”

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.010
The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.
In fact, anyone in my class would probably

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.090
be able to recite that in their sleep, right?
Any problem is an opportunity.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.890
The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.
And what I do is, I give students problems.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.269
They start out as really small problems, and
over the course of the quarter, they get bigger

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.180
and bigger and bigger, until finally, they
just get extremely comfortable taking on challenges

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.330
and looking at them through the lens of possibilities.
Now, don't just listen to me.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.129
I mean, Why should you listen to me telling
you that problems are opportunities?

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.599
This is something that is embraced by the
entire venture capital community and the whole

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.079
entrepreneurial community.
In fact, I'm going to play you a videoclip

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.389
that I play all the time, and it's one of
my favorites.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.079
It's by Vinod Khosla.
Do you guys know who Vinod Khosla is?

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.950
Who is he? Founder of Sun Microsystems, successful
venture capitalist.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.939
And this is a 27-second-long clip where he
talks about problems as opportunities.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:54.639
Vinod Khosla: One thing I would say is, "Find
a big problem.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.980
To me any big problem is a big opportunity.”
Because if you think about it, no problem,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.659
no solution, no company.
It's very simple.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.450
Every big problem is a big opportunity.
If you don't have a big problem, you don't

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.000
have a big opportunity.
Nobody will pay you to solve a nonproblem.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.389
Tina Seelig: In fact, I see that was a talk
where Tom Byers, my colleague, was introducing

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.629
him, interviewing him.
And it's a clip that we play in all of our

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.420
classes.
Because this is the essence, the core of entrepreneurship.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.480
So how do you teach this?
How do you teach people to turn problems into

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.749
opportunities and look at the world as 'opportunity
rich'?

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:37.109
Is it like this? Is this what you do?
You line people up in rows and columns, right?

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.540
In fact, it kind of looks like this room right
here.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.590
Everyone lined up in rows and columns, the
chairs bolted to the floor, God forbid, you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.079
know, you actually talk to anyone else or
move around.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.049
Looks like everyone's taking a multiple choice
test where they're filling out one right answer

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.569
to every question, filling it out with a number
two pencil.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.359
Is that how you teach creativity?
I don't think so.

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.950
This is the way you teach creativity.
You get people out of their comfort zone.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.829
You get them jumping off of perfectly good
cliffs.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:14.139
You get them to feel it in their gut.
It's not necessarily a completely intellectual

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.710
experience.
You need to be able to take risks, to do things

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:23.000
you haven't done before, to take on problems
no one knows the answer to.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.430
So what I'm going to do is, tell you about
some of the things that we do in our classes

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.210
to help people have this experience.
So a few years ago I was -- the D school -- the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.699
Design School at Stanford was just starting
off.

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.680
And there was the first year.
There was a boot camp class.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.250
There was a whole cast of thousands of people
teaching the class.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.620
And I was asked to teach one week that focused
on entrepreneurship.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.169
"Tina will you teach one week that gets folks
understanding the general principles and the

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.169
ideas of entrepreneurial thinking?”
So I thought, "What can I do?”

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.830
So what I did is, I gave the students, every
team, an envelope.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.560
And in that envelope was seed funding.
How many of you know this story?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.639
Okay. We're going to cut to the chase in a
second and go on to the next stories.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.669
But this one is the first assignment I gave.
They had an envelope, and in that envelope

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.430
was seed-funding.
They had four or five days to plan as long

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.650
as they wanted, but as soon as they opened
that envelope, they had two hours to make

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.800
as much money as possible.
Now, for those people who don't know this.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.810
Folks who don't know this story, How much
money do you think I gave them?

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.810
Any guesses?

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.810
&gt;&gt; $500.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.810
Tina Seelig: $500. Anyone else?

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.810
&gt;&gt; Five dollars.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.250
Tina Seelig: Five dollars. I bet you know
this story. Okay?

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.220
I know you know this story.
So, okay, let's cut to the chase here.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.270
I gave them five dollars and two hours to
make as much money as possible.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.889
So what would you do if you were given this
challenge? What would you do?

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.210
Think about it.
Does anyone have any ideas? Any thoughts?

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.470
Organize a party. Invite everyone.
Are you going to basically charge people?

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.100
Absolutely.
You're going to charge people to come to your

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.250
party.
Love that idea. Great. I'd love to come.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.139
How much are you going to charge people?

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.139
&gt;&gt; Ten dollars.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.779
Tina Seelig: Ten dollars? And how much is
the party going to cost?

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:18.779
&gt;&gt; About $50.

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.159
Tina Seelig: So you only need five people
to break even.

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.189
Okay, good. Anyone else? Another idea?
What you might do with five dollars and two

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.909
hours?
First of all, you guys get gold stars, because

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:36.720
usually when I ask that question, the first
thing anyone ever says is, "Go to Las Vegas,"

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.800
or "Buy a lottery ticket."

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.800
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.919
Tina Seelig: Really. They feel like, "Well,
you know, I should take a really high risk

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.750
for earning a big reward.”
Of course, we all know that the high likelihood

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.669
is that you're going to walk away with nothing.
Well, let me tell you the clue.

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:54.690
The teams that made the most money didn't
use the five dollars at all.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.169
They realized that the five dollars was actually
a limitation.

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.340
They realized that that framed the problem
way too tightly, and that if they looked at

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.590
the skills they had and the opportunities
around them, that was worth a lot more.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.110
So with that in mind, what do you think you
would do?

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.361
Any thoughts?
Okay. Since you're being shy, I'm going to

00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:19.710
tell you.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.840
One team set up a stand in the middle of the
Student Union here at Stanford in front of

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.229
Tresidder.
And they just said -- they put up a little

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:32.250
sign that said, "We will measure your bicycle
tire pressure for free, but if you need air

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.900
in the tires, we will charge you a dollar.”
Pretty cool?

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.439
Well, first they thought they were taking
advantage of their fellow classmates, because

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:46.250
people could go around the corner and easily
get their bike tires pumped up for free.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.749
But you know what?
They realized halfway through the two hours

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:55.540
that people were incredibly appreciative.
And so, what they did is, they stopped asking

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.599
for a dollar.
And halfway through, they asked for donations

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.949
instead.
And you know what happened?

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.749
People paid them much more.
And they walked away at the end of two hours

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:09.129
with a couple hundred dollars.
Pretty cool?

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:12.080
Now, there was some interest things that fell
out of this experiment.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.530
First of all, they realized that iterating
along the way -- experimenting was incredibly

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.349
valuable.
They could have stayed in their dorm room,

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:24.940
written a business plan, and they never would
have learned the fact, all of these things

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.830
they learned along the way.
You know, that by asking for donations, they

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.069
actually made more.
So by rapidly prototyping, experimenting,

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:35.740
and you know, trying things out along the
way, they actually learned a tremendous number

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.740
of things.
Another team did something equally clever.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.969
They realized that, in Palo Alto -- I'm sure
all of you know this as well -- there were

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:44.853
really long lines at restaurants on Saturday
night.

00:08:44.853 --> 00:08:49.930
In fact, sometimes it's an hour-and-a-half
wait to get a table at the most popular restaurants.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.200
So what they did is they split up, and they
made reservations at all the most popular

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:06.079
restaurants.
And as those times came up, they sold the

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.440
reservations.
Yeah, question?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.399
Tina Seelig: Yeah. Well, they realized they
were basically scalping restaurant reservations.

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:16.021
And so, you know, people with a screaming,
hungry kid -- for any of you who know what

00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.790
that's like -- they're like, "Of course, I'll
pay $20 to skip in front of you in line.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.790
I've got to feed my baby.”
So here was another thing.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.610
Again, they learned some really cool things
along the way.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.490
First, the women were much better at selling
the reservations.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.920
People trusted them more. Go figure.
Okay. So the guys ran around making reservations;

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.589
the women sold them.
But here was another really important insight.

00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:42.220
They realized this worked best in the restaurants
that use those buzzers that tell you when

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.560
their time comes up, because there was something
very tangible they could sell.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:51.899
So it's kind of like a reverse hand grenade,
"Here it's going to go off in five minutes.

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:54.040
Take it.” Okay?
The other thing that happened as a result

00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:00.029
of that is, they traded the buzzers.
Now, they had now traded up to a later reservation.

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:04.579
Pretty cool?
So they realized -- these students walked

00:10:04.579 --> 00:10:10.580
away with a huge insight and that is, they
should never look around and say, "I don't

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.060
have any money in my pockets.”
Because there were opportunities everywhere

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.600
just waiting to be solved, whether it was
tires that needed to get filled up or whether

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:26.209
it was restaurant reservations.
But, the team that made the most money challenged

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:30.380
all of the assumptions.
They broke all the rules and they continue

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.589
to open the frame of the problem beyond anything
that I imagined.

00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:41.899
They realized the most valuable thing they
had was not the five dollars and was not the

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:46.389
two hours.
They realized the most valuable thing they

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:53.149
had was their three-minute presentation time,
which they sold to a company that wanted to

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:56.420
recruit those students.
Pretty cool?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.710
So I thought they're onto something. This
was so great.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:05.180
This was a mind-blowing, life-changing experience
for the students in this class.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.320
And again, we pushed them off of that cliff
and gave them a problem without any right

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.399
answers.
In fact, the answers they came up with were

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:16.519
much better than anything I could have put
on the answer key, right?

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:24.790
But I had one problem after I gave this assignment.
And it was really preying on my mind.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.930
And that problem was that I felt that I was
communicating that value was measured in terms

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.230
of making money.
And we all know that that's not the case,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.060
right?
That value is created in so many different

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.810
ways besides, you know, cold hard cash.
So the next quarter in my creativity class,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:45.910
I decided to give this assignment again, but
instead of giving the students five dollars,

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:52.690
I gave them a handful of paper clips.
Ten paper clips. And four hours.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.370
I told them, "You now have one week.
You have ten paper clips and four hours to

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.790
create as much value as possible.
Somehow you've got to use these paper clips.”

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.670
And I was inspired by the guy who started
with the one red paper clip and traded to

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.801
a house.
You guys know the story?

00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:09.380
How many people do not know the story of the
one red paper clip? Okay.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.959
This was a guy a few years ago who basically
said, "I really, really, really want a house,

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:18.509
and all I have is one red paper clip.”
So he set up a blog and decided to trade the

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:22.480
paper clip up until he had a house.
And he did it.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.940
He started with a paper clip.
He traded it for a pen and the pen for a doorknob

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.259
and the doorknob for this and that and this
and that.

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:29.820
And over the course of a year, he ended up
with a house.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.240
Now, I believe the house was like in Saskatchewan,
but it still was a house, okay?

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.699
So I thought I was being very generous giving
these students ten paper clips.

00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:43.060
So, okay, folks.
What would you do with ten paper clips -- four

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.480
hours, ten paper clips?
Any thoughts?

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.699
&gt;&gt; Pick some locks.

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:58.600
Tina Seelig: Pick some locks.
Okay, let's cut to the chase, because I'm

00:12:58.600 --> 00:14:03.060
going to show you what one of the teams did.
Is there some way for us to lower the lights

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:12.440
a little bit?
Is that something I should have asked at all?

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:27.499
What's that? Okay.
Let's show it, and see if it works.

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:28.499
&gt;&gt; [music]

00:14:28.499 --> 00:14:42.410
&gt;&gt; Bad boys. What you want, what you want,
what you want to do.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:49.240
When the servicemen come for you.
Tell me what you want to do, what you going

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.199
to do.
Tell. Bad boys, bad boys, what you going to

00:14:54.199 --> 00:15:01.230
do?
What you going to do when they come for you?

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:14.680
Bad boys, bad boys, what you going to do?
What you going to do when they come for you?

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:24.060
When you were eight and you had bad traits,
you go to school and learn the golden rule.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:29.290
So why are you acting like a bloody fool if
you get.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:38.240
Tina Seelig: Okay, at this point -- I kid
you not -- I was lying on the floor hyperventilating.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.160
I thought I really did love that job, okay?
Because I am fired now.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:52.120
I mean, I am out of here.
There is no way I'm talking my way out of

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:58.880
this one.
The students -- I said, "How did you do this?

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.810
What did you do?”
They said, "You know, it was a fraternity

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:08.339
party, things get stolen all the time.
No one even noticed.”

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:13.280
Then they said, "Just kidding.”
So what they actually did is, they took the

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:21.279
ten paper clips and they traded them for some
posterboard.

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:29.100
And they made a sign that said, "Stanford
students for sale.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:36.889
Buy one, get two free.” Okay?
And they went to the Stanford Shopping Center

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:46.740
and they sat in the middle of the shopping
center with their sign.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:53.800
And they started asking people, "What can
we do for you?" Just like this fellow suggested,

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.519
What can I do for you?
You guys are too creative here, you know.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:04.069
So they -- first people asked them, Well can
you carry my bags to my car?

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:10.809
Can you take out the recycling? But eventually,
they learned how to sell themselves a little

00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:13.289
better.
They realized they were engineering students.

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:17.720
They had a lot more skills than carrying bags
and taking out recycling.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.880
One guy asked them if they could, you know,
design a transreceiver for him.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.650
And they said, "Yes, we could, but probably
take a little more than four hours.”

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:37.980
So a woman came up -- a business exec -- and
she said, "Boy, you're in a course on creativity.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:50.330
I've got a business problem I'm really struggling
with at work.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:18:15.690
Would you mind coming to my office and leading
a brainstorming session with my team?”

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:53.120
They said, "No problem. We know how to do
this.”

00:18:53.120 --> 00:19:25.070
And so, they went to her office; they led
a brainstorming session for a couple of hours.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:37.210
She was so delighted with the outcome, she
paid them in three computer monitors that

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:46.210
she didn't need. Pretty cool?
So they arrived in class with three computer

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:55.420
monitors starting with ten paper clips.
The other teams did things that were equally

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:02.140
inventive.
And I don't have all the videos there to show

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:10.520
you.
But I want to tell you, this was the start

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:35.600
of something very big.
Because that what happened is, I got a call

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:47.900
from the Kauffman Foundation.
Many of you might have heard of them.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:53.860
They are the big, entrepreneurship foundation
there in Kansas City.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.950
And they decided about three years ago to
launch a National Entrepreneurship Week.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:08.260
And they called me and said, "Tina would you
take the lead at Stanford in making this happen?”

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.840
I said, "No problem.”
So I called up my friends, you know, e-mailed

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:22.380
my friends across campus who were in the business
school and the law school and the med school

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:32.000
and the engineering school all over and said,
"We're going to put together this week.”

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:43.890
So we did this sort of open-source week where
everybody took a day to do something.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.000
And we had talks, and lectures and workshops
and etc. etc.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.450
But it was preying on my mind, that guy jumping
off that cliff, and I said, "You know what?

00:21:51.450 --> 00:22:11.150
We can't have an entrepreneurship week unless
we do.”

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:41.279
So came up with the idea of using this concept
as a cross-campus activity.

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:53.460
And this time gave the students one pack of
Post-it Notes. Okay?

00:22:53.460 --> 00:23:02.429
A hundred, 3 x 3 Post-its, and the idea is
they had all week during Entrepreneurship

00:23:02.429 --> 00:23:08.320
Week when we unveiled this object the first
day -- this challenge.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:18.580
And they had one week to create as much value
as possible using Post-it Notes.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.830
Well, I told the Kauffman Foundation.
They got so excited.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:29.159
They said, "Boy, can we roll this out around
the country?”

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:38.909
And I said, "Let's not stop there.
Let's roll it out around the world.

00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:46.230
I run conferences all over the planet and
one e-mail, I was able to invite colleagues

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:50.550
and their students to participate in this
challenge.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:58.930
So we had thousands of students around the
world creating as much value as they could

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:06.850
with Post-it Notes.
And the idea was, they could measure value

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:18.500
in any way they wanted.
So what would you do? You guys are now up

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.590
to speed.
You've done the five dollars.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:32.320
You've done the paper clips.
What would you do with Post-it Notes?

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:40.899
What's that? A treasure hunt.
You could use an integrated treasure hunt.

00:24:40.899 --> 00:24:47.630
Great idea.
Any other thoughts? Yep, back there.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:56.890
You could put artwork on it.
We could have poetry on it. Terrific.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:08.510
Let me play you a videoclip, a short clip
from one of the teams, and you tell me what

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:13.950
kind of value was created by this team?

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.320
&gt;&gt; [rapid music]

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:23.480
Tina Seelig: Pretty cool.
What kind of value was created? What's that?

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:41.330
Information and saving energy, right? So this
was put on YouTube and thousands of people

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:52.820
watched this video.
I know that I, for one -- when I ended up

00:25:52.820 --> 00:26:05.559
leaving town to go away for Spring break,
I unplugged all the appliances -- all the

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:12.390
equipment -- in my office.
So they ended up having a really, big impact

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:18.250
using Post-it Notes for a sort of public service
announcement. Pretty cool?

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:28.929
So I could spend the entire talk just showing
you video clips of what happened with Post-its,

00:26:28.929 --> 00:26:38.510
because they were really remarkable.
And the teams did things.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:50.020
They created collaborative music projects.
They created a company called Gumball Capital

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:58.490
that actually turned into a real company raising
money.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:04.670
They got solicitations for money to raise
it for Kiva.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:19.299
But I want to move on, because again, this
took on a life of its own.

00:27:19.299 --> 00:27:31.370
The next year, we decided to do this again.
And I wanted to come up with a challenge that

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:50.220
was somewhat different, because everyone had
been thinking about Post-it Notes all year,

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:57.649
and I really wanted to stretch everyone's
imagination -- give them something that might

00:27:57.649 --> 00:28:08.010
be even a little harder.
So the next year -- here we were up in Memorial

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:17.720
Auditorium -- the whole place is packed.
John Hennessy, the president of Stanford,

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:28.800
introduces the week, welcomes everyone.
I get up there and reveal the next challenge

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:39.480
 -- the next object -- and the air got sucked
out of the room.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:49.410
Because they now had to create value with
a rubberband.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:29:01.640
I wanted to stretch their imagination.
And they could use as many rubberbands as

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:13.630
they wanted -- as many colors, as many sizes,
as many as they wanted.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:23.039
What would you guys do if you were given this
challenge?

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:31.570
Any thoughts?
Want me to show you one?

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:37.020
Get your mind thinking? Okay.
Let me show you.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:44.039
This was actually some students from my class.
I'm very proud of them.

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:47.230
You tell me at the end what you think.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:51.770
&gt;&gt; Tired of bikes gobbling up your laces?
Troublesome doorways?

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:59.150
Loose laces caught in vicious vacuums?
Constantly fighting your garbage disposal

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:05.870
for your shoes?
Being hounded at school by shoe bandits?

00:30:05.870 --> 00:31:16.290
You need Shoe Bands.
With our revolutionary technology, you'll

00:31:16.290 --> 00:32:17.900
never worry about shoelaces getting untied
again.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:33:00.799
Shoe Bands will make you more stylish, lose
ten pounds instantly, and will save baby penguins

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:04.900
from global warming.
Everybody loves them.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:14.059
50 years of R and D, utilizing sic sigma,
lean production, and other buzzword processes,

00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:23.070
went into the development of Shoe Bands.
Procured from pencil erasers, our rubber is

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:29.419
vulcanized twice to remove bad karma.
Here's what our customers have to say.

00:33:29.419 --> 00:33:37.350
&gt;&gt; As an athlete, I need my shoes to stay
on.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:47.409
Velcro provides some security, but to really
get the job done, I use my Shoe Bands.

00:33:47.409 --> 00:33:56.889
&gt;&gt; Recently, one of our customers wrote in
to tell us about an experience where her Shoe

00:33:56.889 --> 00:34:04.330
Bands saved her life. [screaming and growling]
Should have worn Shoe Bands.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:14.440
&gt;&gt; Ever since I started using Shoe Bands,
I jacked up my bench press by 50 pounds.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.040
Sometimes I even double-band. Sometimes I
double-band.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:34.450
&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm the founder of Shoe Bands Incorporated.
But not only am I the CEO, I'm also an avid

00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:36.379
and dedicated customer.

&gt;&gt; Through this exclusive TV offer receive
not two, but three packs of Shoe Bands, for

00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:04.340
just five easy payments of 19.99.
Wait, call in the next sixty seconds and we'll

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:19.350
slash a payment and send you a llama. [baa]
That's right a llama [baa] Order today.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:24.250
Exclusive shipping and handling.
Taxes may vary.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:36.650
Consult your physician before handling llama.
And for more information visit our website

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.550
at www.ShoeBands.com.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:50.560
&gt;&gt; Tina Seelig: Okay. I'm going to leave it
at that.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:36:07.940
Pretty cool? Really funny. Anyways.
So again, the people did incredible things

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:20.450
with rubberbands.
And we were stunned by the creativity.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:26.850
And one of the most interesting things is
this all happened outside the scope of a classroom.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:34.260
Nobody told them what to do.
No one gave them a grade.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:44.900
Nobody told them that it was due at a certain
time.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.660
They took all their extra free time and put
all their creativity in doing this.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:57.070
So I love the fact that we have all these
exercises that teach students how to turn

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:06.010
problems into opportunities, but there are
so many other things that go into being entrepreneurial.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:18.530
And when I wrote this book about, What I wish
I knew when I was 20, one of the other key

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:29.250
concepts was how you make your own luck.
When I grew up, my father always used to say,

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:39.370
"The harder you work, the luckier you get.”
How many of you have ever heard that?

00:37:39.370 --> 00:38:02.470
The harder I work, the luckier I get. Okay.
It's one of those things that's sort of drilled

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:13.650
into our heads.
But one of the most interesting things is,

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:26.110
I realized over the last years -- is that,
hard work is only the tip of the iceberg in

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:54.370
making yourself lucky.
There's so many things you can do to make

00:38:54.370 --> 00:39:22.770
yourself lucky beyond just putting in a lot
hard work and sweat.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:35.760
And I'm going to tell you a little story that
comes from my own life that brings this to

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:43.310
life.
Okay. So a few years ago, my son was about

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.950
this big.
He's now about this big.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:53.070
And he and I were at the grocery store.
And I was at the grocery store with him.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:59.920
We were sort of walking down one of the aisles
and a man came up to me.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.130
And he asked me how to make a can of lemonade.
He had some lemonade can.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.450
He said, "Excuse me, can you explain to me
how to make this lemonade?”

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.920
He was there with his daughter, who was about
the same size.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:15.720
He had an accent.
He was clearly new to town, and I explained

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:21.280
to him how to make the lemonade.
You know, three cans of water to the can of

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.280
lemonade.
For most people, that would be the end of

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.280
the conversation, right?
He'd say, "Thank you very much," and you'd

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.600
go away.
But you know what?

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:34.090
I have learned from some of my wonderful colleagues
that, if you go somewhere and you don't meet

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:38.350
someone new, at the minimum, you've missed
out on the opportunity of learning something

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:40.320
or making a new friend.
At the maximum, you've missed out on the opportunity

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320
of making a million dollars.
So I've really absorbed this attitude -- this

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.320
philosophy of life.
So when I was checking out of the grocery

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.370
store, I had a choice of different lines.
I got in line behind this guy.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:45.370
Now, I was not stalking him, but you know,
I was just curious.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:46.370
I wanted to learn a little bit more.
Maybe there was something I could do for him.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:47.370
Maybe there's something he could do for me.
Maybe I'd learn something.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.700
So I said, "Gee, you know, you have an interesting
accent.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.700
Where are you from?”
He said, "I'm from Chile.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.700
I'm from Santiago.”
And I said, "Oh, that's really interesting.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.410
What are you doing here?”
At first, he was a little put off like, Why

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:59.250
am I asking these questions?
But he kind of melted and finally said, "Well,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:04.490
I'm here.
I'm going to be taking over my family's business

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:09.621
in Chile, and I'm here for awhile to learn
about innovation and entrepreneurship." I

00:41:09.621 --> 00:41:11.620
said, "That's so nice.
I actually run this program at Stanford that

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.800
focuses on entrepreneurship and high-tech
entrepreneurship.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:24.480
If I can be helpful to you in any way, please
let me know.”

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.150
So I gave him my business card, and that was
the end of the conversation.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.150
But he did contact me.
He sent me an e-mail.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:32.290
He said, "You know, I'd really love to take
you up on your offer.”

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:39.320
So I introduced him to a few people and I
knew some folks from Chile and I knew some

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.680
venture capitalists who might be interested
in Latin America, and I helped him out.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.760
He ended up bringing an entourage of people
to Stanford, including the president of the

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.190
Chile, and I helped out with that a little
bit.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:51.040
That was the end.
He said, "Thank you very much." Went back

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.040
to Chile about a year, year and a half after
he had arrived.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.040
A few years later, I was going down to Santiago
and I sent him an e-mail.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.730
I said, "Eduardo, I'm going to be in Santiago.
Will you want to grab a cup of coffee?

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.550
I'd love to find out what's going on with
you.”

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.990
And he said, "Absolutely.”
But as the time came up, he was really too

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.130
busy.
And he said, "You know, Tina, I would love

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.130
to see you, but I just can't get away.
But do me a favor.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:10.850
Come with a few of your colleagues and meet
at the lobby of this building in downtown

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.690
Santiago.”
So I said, "Sure.”

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:22.230
So I grabbed a few of my friends, and we went
over there.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:31.190
We were met by one of his colleagues, who
took us to the roof of the building where

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:37.340
we were picked up by his family's helicopter,
flown over the city up to his family ski resort,

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.960
and then back down to the site of the city
where we left off.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.960
And the moral of the story is that, you know,
most people stop at looking at life as turning

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.960
problems into opportunities -- that's like
turning lemons into lemonade.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.960
But really entrepreneurship is about turning
lemonade into helicopters.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960
Pretty cool? Anyway, I thought that was kind
of a fun story, and it sort of had a fun punch

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.960
line.
But the fact is, you can make your own luck

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960
in lots of different ways.
It's about being open, about being optimistic,

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.960
and about engaging the world in a way that
makes you pay attention to the opportunities

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.960
around you every single moment, as opposed
to being heads-down and staying in sort of

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.960
the rut you're in every single day.
You should look at the world as if you're

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960
a foreign traveler, as if you're looking at
things for the first time and really, really

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960
examining them.
So let's go onto another concept that I wrote

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960
about in my book.
It is about failing fast and frequently. Okay?

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.960
I'm sure nobody here fails at Google, right?
Everything's always perfect?

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.960
But, you know, one of the secret sauces of
Silicon Valley is that you need to be able

00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:01.900
to fail and fail gracefully.
In fact, it is known that probably the ratio

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.900
between your successes and your failures is
pretty constant.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.900
If that ratio is constant then, if you want
more successes, you're going to have to put

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.900
up with more failures.
And the key is, you can't be so worried about

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:17.790
failure that you're not willing to try.
In fact, I have my students write "Failure

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:32.510
Resumes.”
Resumes with all their biggest screw-ups -- personal,

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:56.520
professional, and academic.
And the reason for this is that if you write

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:26.370
down your failures, and then what you learned
from it, that's when you really learn -- is

00:44:26.370 --> 00:45:19.500
when you get to think back and say, "Boy,
I won't do that again.”

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.180
And in fact, it's funny.
When I wrote about this in my book and when

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.030
I showed an early draft to one of my students,
she said, "Boy, I was really interested in

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:26.030
this idea of 'failure resumes'.
I'd love to see what one looks like.”

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.030
So I said, "Okay.
We could do that.”

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.030
And I decided to put my own failure resume
in the book.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:29.030
And I think I spent more time on those two
pages in the book than any other pages, because

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:30.030
it was a little bit nerve-wracking.
But it hasn't come back to bite me, and I

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.030
would encourage you to try it for yourself.
It is really quite an interesting process

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.163
to think about that.
And I want to show you here -- to amplify

00:45:32.163 --> 00:45:54.250
this point.
I want to show you a video clip that came

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:59.260
from an innovation tournament.
Remember I told you about the rubberbands

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.850
and the paperclips? This was a clip -- I'm
going to show you -- from one of the teams

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:06.950
from the challenge with the rubberbands.
And this was a team that failed pretty miserably

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:08.610
 -- and how they took that failure and turned
it into a success.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:09.610
&gt;&gt; [guitar music]

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:10.610
&gt;&gt; [exciting music]

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:11.610
&gt;&gt; [singing] One more day down.
Everybody has those days, where one soft,

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.610
sweet song just enough to clear my head.
For hungry life.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:13.610
Has anybody left their same?

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:14.610
&gt;&gt; Awesome thank you.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.610
&gt;&gt; Slide on over and accept fate.
And there's a thousand feet of powerful things

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:16.610
here.
It's just that your week -- can we talk about

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:17.610
it?
It's getting so damn creepy just nursing this

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:18.610
ghost of chance -- fiction or romance -- and
accept color change, black and white people.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:19.610
One boy headstrong.
It isn't going to hear just plain.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.610
He's pushed down so hard you can hear him
start to sink.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.610
One last round of petty conversation, "You
hold on boy, because you won't go down like

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:22.610
this.
You're just going to roll on over and lay

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:23.610
down.
How can you take.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:24.610
It's just that you're weak.
Can we talk about it?

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:25.610
It's getting so damn creepy just nursing this
ghost of a chance -- the fiction or romance

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:26.610
 -- the technicolor dream, called black and
white people.

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.610
Tina Seelig: Pretty cool?
I mean, they could have decided just not even

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:28.610
to submit this.
But they ended up winning one of the biggest

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:29.610
prizes, because they ended up really capturing
the essence of entrepreneurship.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:30.610
It's about trying lots of things and keeping
what works.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:31.610
And here is the coolest punch line of all.
This team was made up of the biodesign fellows

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:32.610
at Stanford.
These are students that come from medicine

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:33.610
and business and engineering.
And they spend a year shadowing doctors, identifying

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:34.610
the problems they had, coming up with inventions,
and eventually putting together a business

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:35.610
plan.
That team that did this, won the campuswide

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.610
business plan competition, competing against
hundreds of other business plans.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:37.610
And of course, they never would have gotten
to that success if they hadn't embraced this

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.060
concept that they had to fail many times along
the way before coming up with something that

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.060
was a big success.
So I want to lead to a next topic, and that

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.060
is, "Don't wait to be anointed.” You know?
We often are in situations where we wait for

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.060
someone else to come and give us an assignment
 -- to give us a job, to give us a role, to

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.060
give us a promotion.
But, you know, this is not what people who

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.060
are entrepreneurial do.
In any organization, in anywhere in life,

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.060
there are always problems to be solved.
There are always white spaces in the organization.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.060
There are always ways that you can contribute
beyond what you even imagined.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.060
And you don't have to wait for someone else
to give you those assignments.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.060
Let me tell you a quick, little personal story
that amplifies this.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.060
When I was a kid, my father became a very
successful, multinational corporate executive.

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.060
But he started out as an engineer. He was
an engineer.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.060
And we got used to every couple years he'd
have another promotion, you know?

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.060
Turn director to a VP to executive vice PD
to executive senior blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.060
blah, blah, blah.
So this was something -- I was very proud

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.060
of him. He did very, very well.
But then, I decided to start my own company.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.060
And I came to him and I'd made out business
cards, and they said, "Tina Seelig, President.”

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.060
And he looked at them and he looked at me,
and he got really mad.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.060
He got annoyed with me.
He said, "How can you call yourself 'President'?

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.060
You can't just call yourself president.”
And I said, "Well, why not?”

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.060
He had grown up in this environment where
you have to wait for other people to anoint

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.060
you -- other people to give you that mantle
of power.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.060
But entrepreneurs are those people who make
their own business cards.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.060
They're the people who put the ladder below
them, as opposed to waiting for someone else

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.060
to put the ladder in front of them.
And the fact that this doesn't just happen

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.060
as an entrepreneurial, you know, attitude
in starting your own company, it's something

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.060
that happens here.
I mean, my goodness, Larry and Sergey are

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.060
not the only entrepreneurs at Google, right?
I mean, every single one of you are entrepreneurial,

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.060
solving problems along the way that come up.
And that's the point.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.060
You don't have to wait for someone else to
give you permission to do something; you can

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.060
do it yourself.
And I want to play a videoclip here that came

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.060
again from the innovation tournament.
This is again, the ones with the rubberbands.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.060
This is the team that captured the essence
of the fact that there is a very tiny switch

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.060
between doing nothing and doing something.
And it's really up to you whether you decide

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.060
to flip that switch and really make things
happen.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.060
&gt;&gt; [piano music]

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.060
&gt;&gt; I worked out for the first time in weeks.
I ______ deeply with joy.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.060
&gt;&gt; I finally took my chubby butt to the gym.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.060
&gt;&gt; I carried a package for someone who was
overburdened.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.060
&gt;&gt; I said, "thank you," more often.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.060
&gt;&gt; I mustered up the courage to ask my crush
out.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.060
&gt;&gt; I spoke with my dear friend on the phone
for an hour and a half.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.060
I'm so glad to reconnect with her.
True friends are treasures in life.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.060
&gt;&gt; Let me tell you about how these work.
These bands here -- they -- so we could try

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.060
to rally everyone behind one cause, but we're
not necessarily going to get people to agree

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.060
with us.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.060
&gt;&gt; The "Do Band" is based on two insights
we had.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.060
One, you can't force someone to agree with
your cause.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.060
Without buy-in, nothing real is going to happen.
Two, everyone has their own cause, something

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.060
they should do, they want to do, but they
just never get to it.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.060
And this is what we're after.
We want to get people over their block and

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.060
get them to do it.
Enter the Do Band.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.060
&gt;&gt; The Do Band has a simple set of rules.
One, put it on with a promise and don't take

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.060
it off until you've fulfilled it.
Two, record your success online.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.060
Share your story.
Three, pass it on.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.060
&gt;&gt; Every Do Band comes with a serial number.
When you record your success, you can see

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.060
what else your band has inspired.
Each Do Band creates a chain of successes.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.060
And that's just one Do Band.
With many Do Bands, it grows even quicker.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.060
And with the addition of the virtual Do Band,
the numbers multiply astoundingly fast.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.060
&gt;&gt; Do Bands that block by that comment.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.060
&gt;&gt; What's happening with your Do Band?

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.060
&gt;&gt; Oh, I actually passed it off.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.060
&gt;&gt; The Do Band creates value, by appealing
to our inner desires.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.060
&gt;&gt; Done!

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.060
&gt;&gt; Just 36 hours, we created social value,
health value, entertainment value, and political

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.060
value, to name a few.
We may not have collected $500, but Do Bands

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.060
kicked off a new summer camp, initiated tons
of phone calls to mothers, inspired compliments

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.060
and apologies, healthy eating, and many other
personal contributions to the greater good.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.060
These little things add up, and success is
infectious.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.060
And one more thing, actually, people did donate
over $500 to the charities that they chose.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.060
And this is only the beginning.
Imagine it.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.060
&gt;&gt; [upbeat music]

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.060
Tina Seelig: Pretty cool? Great.
So the corollary to this is, Never miss an

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.060
opportunity to be fabulous.
Let me tell you the evolution of this phrase.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.060
As I mentioned, I teach this course on creativity
and innovation.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.060
And I never use slides in my class, because
it's all experiential.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.060
I set up things, often things I've never done
before.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.060
And I get the students to experiment with
all the variables related to creativity and

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.060
innovation.
But the first day of class, I do show some

00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.060
slides to basically show them a roadmap of
what's going to come up ahead in the next

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.060
ten weeks.
And at the very bottom, the first day, you

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.060
know, the last slide, the last bullet point
is, "Never miss an opportunity to be fabulous.”

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.060
And I basically say, "I promise I'm going
to do my very, very best.

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.060
I'm going to give it my all teaching this
class.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.060
And I expect the same from you.”
And the fact is, I would be happy to give

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.060
everyone in the class an A, but the bar is
very high, and I expect all of you to jump

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.060
over it.
This is different from most other classes,

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.060
right?
Most other classes, the teachers tell you

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.060
what you need to do to get an A.
I hate that question, right?

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.060
Will this be on the exam?
I look at my kid, who is a very, very sharp

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.060
kid.
He does -- and I'm sure many of you in this

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.060
room.
I won't ask you to raise your hand -- always

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.060
did the minimum amount to get an A.
Could you imagine what the world is like if

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.060
everyone does the minimum amount to get an
A?

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.060
The fact is, people who do amazing things
go well-beyond what it takes to get an A.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.060
They're what's equivalent of an A plus, plus,
plus, plus, plus, plus.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.060
The fascinating thing about this concept is
that it is incredibly sticky, because I believe

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.060
each of us is actually waiting for this instruction.
A few months after my class began a couple

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.060
years ago -- in fact, the story will date
itself in a minute.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.060
You can tell me what year it was.
-- one of my students was sitting outside

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.060
when I got to class.
And she was listening to her iPod nano.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.060
Now, I had never seen a nano before.
They were brand new.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.060
And I said, "Hey, Becky, can I take a look
at that nano.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.060
I haven't seen them before." She said, "Sure.”
She took it off, handed it to me, and apparently,

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.060
when you get it ordered online, you can have
it engraved on the back with something.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.060
People usually have their e-mail address or
their phone number.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.060
She turned it over, and on the back was engraved
with, what?

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.060
"Never miss an opportunity to be fabulous.”
That is what she wanted to look at every day.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.060
And I think that's what most of us actually
really want to look at.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.060
We want to say, "I have done the very best
I can.”

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.060
Because I think it's one of the reasons people
get frustrated in their lives is because they're

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.060
not challenging themselves.
They're not in a position where they really

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.060
are doing the very best they can.
So I want to leave with a videoclip.

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.060
This is actually the trailer for a movie.
What happened is -- remember I told you the

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.060
Kauffman foundation was excited about our
doing this innovation tournament, and we rolled

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.060
it out around the world the first year when
we did it with Post-it Notes?

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.060
Well, they had a professional video team that
was going to be capturing the week.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.060
And the video team said, "Terrific.
This is what we want to capture the week is

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.060
this innovation tournament.”
So they put video crews around the world.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.060
They were in Australia.
They were in Japan.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.060
They were in Thailand.
They were in Ecuador.

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.060
They were in the United States.
They were in India.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.060
Probably other countries I'm forgetting right
now.

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.060
This is -- they made a movie called, "Imagine
It.”

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.060
In fact, you can download the movie for free
at ImagineItProject.com.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.060
But I'm going to show you the trailer for
the movie.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.060
You'll recognize some of the cast of characters.
You'll recognize some of the stories.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.060
And it was pretty terrific.
I captured the essence of what happened with

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.060
this around the world.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.060
&gt;&gt; Imagine the future the way you'd like to
see it.

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.060
&gt;&gt; Because if you can imagine it, then it
can be.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.060
&gt;&gt; Go to the problem, and imagine a world
where that problem has been removed.

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.060
And then say, "Well, how many steps are there
from this world to that world?"

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.060
&gt;&gt; Imagining a new future, a new path, a new
direction.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.060
&gt;&gt; If you have the power to imagine it, you
have the power to change the world.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.060
&gt;&gt; Imagine a more perfect world than the one
we live in, and then to actually engage in

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.060
making that happen.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.060
&gt;&gt; [rock music] I believe I can fly.
I believe I can touch the sky.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.060
I think about it every night and day.
Spread my wings and fly away.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.060
I believe I can soar.
See me running through that open door.

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.060
I believe I can fly.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.060
&gt;&gt; People think that pressure is bad, but
pressure -- in a very short period of time

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:02.060
 -- can be stimulating.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.060
&gt;&gt; It taps into the rawest level of their
creativity.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.060
&gt;&gt; It puts down the gauntlet of challenge
and inspiration.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.060
&gt;&gt; [music] Sometimes silence.
There are miracles in life...

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.060
&gt;&gt; You never have infinite resources.
And you're given this constraint.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.060
And this constraint is Post-it pads.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.060
&gt;&gt; We define the value of our project as innovating
outside of the box.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.060
And the box here is actually a Post-it Note.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.060
&gt;&gt; [music] I believe I can fly.
I believe I can touch the sky.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.060
I think about it every night and day.
Spread my wings and fly away.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.060
I believe I can soar.
See me going through that open door.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.060
I believe I can fly.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.060
&gt;&gt; A grand total of $3,200.

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.060
&gt;&gt; [music] I believe I can fly.
I believe I can fly.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.060
Because I believe in you.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.060
&gt;&gt; Entrepreneurship is an extreme sport.
Getting out and do it.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.060
&gt;&gt; This is an important way to progress in
life.

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.060
&gt;&gt; It's an experiment in focus.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.060
&gt;&gt; I bet you, you'll be blown away.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.060
&gt;&gt; [music] I believe I can fly.
I believe I can touch the sky.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.060
I think about it every night and day.
Spread my wings and fly away.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.060
I believe I can soar.
See me running through that open door.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.060
I believe I can fly.
I believe I can fly.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.060
I believe I can fly.
I believe I can fly.

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.060
&gt;&gt; Imagine It. Imagine It. Imagine It.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.060
&gt;&gt; [Clapping] [cheering].

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.060
Tina Seelig: So hopefully, these exercises
demonstrate that we might be pushing these

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.060
kids off of this perfectly good cliff, but
also giving them a pretty good parachute so

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.060
that they feel actually comfortable when they
got out in the world -- taking on challenges,

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.060
taking risks, making things happen in ways
that they might have not been comfortable

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.060
with before this.
So I want to thank you very, very much.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.060
And I'd be delighted to answer any questions.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.060
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.060
Tina Seelig: So any thoughts? Questions? Yeah.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.060
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.060
Tina Seelig: In my failure resume? Okay.
You got to bring that up. Let's see.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.060
Most of the time, the failures on there were
failures that came from not really paying

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.060
attention to what was really going on and
making assumptions.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.060
So like going in my first job after college,
going into a company and thinking I knew the

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.060
way things worked and acting based on the
way I thought it worked as opposed to to actually

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.060
taking the time to figure out the way it really
did work and then acting accordingly.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.060
Or things where I didn't necessarily align
my goals with the goals of the other people

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.060
I was working with.
And you can easily do that.

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.060
All you have to do is actually pay attention
again to what the other people's goals are

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.060
and figuring out some ways to get them aligned.
Any other questions? No?

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.060
Well, if not, I'm happy to talk to anyone
afterwards.

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.060
Thank you very much.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:48.061
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
