00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.629
Sitting in the back of a dark, old-fashioned
Las Vegas casino sits, rather unremarkably,

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.680
the largest gold nugget on display in the
world.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.880
Slowly spinning on a table in a place not
uncoincidentally named “The Golden Nugget,”

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.529
the so-called “Hand of Faith” gold nugget
is not as glamorous nor as shiny as cartoon

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.850
gold nuggets would have you believe.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.370
While the rock gets visitors, the foot traffic
does not match its monetary value – which

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.699
is said to be worth approximately $5 million.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.879
So, how did the largest displayed gold nugget
on the globe end up here in Las Vegas?

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.460
Here’s the tale of the Hand of Faith’s
discovery and its journey to Sin City.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.910
It had been a rough few months during the
fall of 1980 for the Hillier family traveling

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.910
around Australia.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.920
For the last two years, the young family of
six had been driving up and down the country’

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.729
coast in a bus they had named “Gus.”

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.350
Father Kevin earned money for the family doing
odd jobs, but that type of work had dried

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.550
up due in large part to severe back injury.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.259
Mother Bip had just given birth and had her
hands full dealing with a new baby.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.530
In a nutshell, the family was broke, with
very little food and in dire straits.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.810
In this state, they settled in a small former
gold rush town called Kingower near Victoria.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.420
Much like in America (See: What Sparked the
California Gold Rush?), Australia experienced

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.090
their own gold rush in the mid-19th century.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.570
While glittering stones had been found prior,
it was on February 12, 1851 that the rush

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.229
really began with the discovery of gold near
Bathurst in New South Wales.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.320
Within months, people from all over the world
had flocked to the island continent in search

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.539
of their own riches.

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.219
Within decades, the population of Australia
nearly doubled from the influx of gold seekers

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.329
from across the globe.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.560
However, also like America, the market just
as quickly collapsed.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.200
By the turn of the 20th century, the gold
fields were more or less abandoned, with the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.770
recent immigrants moving to the rapidly modernizing
cities.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.329
Despite this, and even years later, there
were reports of lucky people coming across

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.110
small gold nuggets.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.460
Discoveries in the late 20th century led many
to think that the fields still had enough

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.690
gold in them to forever change the fortunes
of those who found it.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.670
After his back injury, Kevin Hillier was advised
by doctors to spend as much time as he could

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.670
walking.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.610
So, Kevin and his wife Bip took up strolling
through the former gold fields with a metal

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.610
detector.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.770
In Bip Hillier’s book about her family’s
story, she describes constantly praying for

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.990
them to find gold.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.720
She thought her prayers had been answered
when Kevin came home one night with a small

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.680
gold pebble, but it turned out to only be
worth enough to buy a second metal detector.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.220
This wasn’t exactly fortune-changing gold.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.940
But a few nights later, Kevin supposedly dreamed
that he found an endless gold nugget that

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.360
was so big that it could not be dug out of
the ground.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.600
The next morning, he drew a picture depicting
his dream on a piece of paper and had his

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600
friend Russell sign it as a witness.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.450
Whether coincidence from having gold on his
brain or indeed prophetic, on September 26,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.610
1980, the dream would come true.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.410
After lunch, Kevin and Bip were detecting
in opposite directions when Kevin screamed.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.620
Rushing to him, Bip found her husband on the
ground sobbing while kneeling in front of

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.830
a tip of a gold nugget that couldn’t be
pried from the ground directly.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.300
As a result, they began to dig… and dig
and dig until they finally reached the bottom.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.810
Lifting it up, they realized what they had
found was history.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.190
Weighing an astounding 27.2 kilograms (nearly
60 pounds), it was the largest gold nugget

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.120
ever found by a hand held metal detector and
the second largest discovered in Australia

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.790
in the 20th century.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.160
In a recent interview, Bip claimed that the
couple had some heavenly intervention, “People

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.060
will say it was all coincidence and that’s
fine.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.480
But that’s my Father up there…and he’s
interested in everything we do.”

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.990
To them, the rock looked like a hand making
a blessing.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.620
So, Bip and Kevin named the gold rock the
“Hand of Faith.”

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.200
Scared to tell anyone, they rushed it home
and soaked the sixty-pound chunk in the sink.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.110
The kids all helped to clean it with toothbrushes.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.590
That night, the family slept as the gold sat
in a kiddie pool under the parents’ bed.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.060
After a few days of debate about what to do,
they decided to hand the rock over to a trusted

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.840
friend to take it back to Melbourne for a
delivery to the government.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.829
A few days later, at a televised press conference,
Victorian Premier Dick Hamer announced the

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.829
discovery.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.970
However, the Hilliers were not there.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.940
They were hold up in a motel room watching
the press conference on television, refusing

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.140
to be identified.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.720
Said one of the Hillier kids, “Even for
years afterwards, we kids never brought it

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720
up.”

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.420
It took several months for the nugget to sell
(according to Bip, this was the government’s

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.330
fault and caused the nugget to dip in value
as the hype died down a bit), but finally

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.780
in early February of 1981, with the help of
Kovac’s Gems &amp; Minerals, it was sold to

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.140
the appropriately-named Golden Nugget Casino
in Las Vegas for about a million dollars (approximately

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.440
$2.7 million today).

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.920
In the years after, Kevin and Bip continued
to walk those same fields with their metal

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.440
detector in hopes of finding what they described
as the Hand of Faith’s companion – the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.690
“Foot of Faith.”

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.280
They never did and Kevin Hillier died in 2014.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.800
At the funeral, the original metal detector
and a replica of the giant nugget were placed

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.910
next to his coffin.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.510
His ashes were spread at the site of his discovery.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.980
The metal detector is now stored in Bip’s
garage.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.350
Although Bip’s now in her late 70s and her
husband is no longer alive, she still thinks

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.000
about going back out to search.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:06:08.169
“I do wonder,” she told the Monthly in
late 2016, “what might still be out there.”
