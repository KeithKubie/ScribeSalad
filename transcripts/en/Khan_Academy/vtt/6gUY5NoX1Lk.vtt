00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:03.258
- [Voiceover] We've already
talked about how DNA's structure

00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:05.778
as this double helix, this twisted ladder,

00:00:05.778 --> 00:00:10.022
makes it suitable for being the
molecular basis of heredity.

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:11.954
And what we wanna do in this video is get

00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:14.297
a better appreciation
for why it is suitable,

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:16.442
and the mechanism by which it is

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:18.588
the molecular basis for heredity.

00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:19.861
And we're gonna focus
on a conceptual level,

00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.505
I'm not gonna go into all of the,

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:23.721
I guess you could say biochemical details.

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:26.209
Really just give you the
conceptual idea of what happens.

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:30.115
So right over here this
could be a fragment of DNA,

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:31.656
I have, what, I have--

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.304
This is eight base pairs depicted.

00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:35.728
And just to be clear,
and we talked about this

00:00:35.728 --> 00:00:37.792
in the introductory video to DNA,

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:42.332
DNA is much more than, you
know, a handful of base pairs.

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:47.042
The DNA molecule can be tens
of millions of base pairs long.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.138
So for example this might be a section

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:51.050
of a much longer molecule,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.819
so the much longer strand of DNA,

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:57.891
and even there I'm probably
not giving justice to it.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:02.178
But this might just be this
very, very small section,

00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:04.910
let me do this in a different color,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.941
this little section right over here,

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.653
zoomed in.

00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:10.381
So once again it might
be part of a molecule

00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:13.173
that has not seven or eight base pairs,

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.005
but might have 70 million base pairs.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.530
So just like that.

00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:23.689
So let's understand what a
molecular basis of heredity

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.181
would need to do.

00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:27.492
Well first of all it would
need to be replicable.

00:01:27.492 --> 00:01:31.009
Or we would need to be
able to replicate it.

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.461
As a cell divides,

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.646
the two new cells would want to have

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:37.389
the same genetic material.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.429
So how does DNA replicate?

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.597
And this process is called replication.

00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:47.541
And we covered this in the
introduction video as well,

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:49.637
but it's nice to see
the different processes

00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:51.456
next to each other.

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:54.785
And replication, you can imagine taking

00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:58.808
either splitting these
two sides of the ladder,

00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:00.263
and actually let's do that.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:03.248
So let me copy and paste,

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:06.543
so if I take that side right over there,

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:10.023
so let me copy and then paste it.

00:02:10.023 --> 00:02:12.870
And then there we go,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.005
a little bit of it is
dropping below the video

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.069
but I think that serves the purpose.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.225
And then let's copy and
paste the other side.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.338
So let me select that.

00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:32.823
And then I copy and then I paste,

00:02:32.823 --> 00:02:35.247
and it's just like that.

00:02:35.247 --> 00:02:38.414
And so you can imagine if
you were to split these,

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:41.046
these things you could call
them two sides of the ladder,

00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:43.793
that either side could be used
to construct the other side.

00:02:43.793 --> 00:02:45.497
And then you would have two strands,

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:48.605
two identical strands of the DNA.

00:02:49.313 --> 00:02:52.281
And so let's see what
that actually looks like.

00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:54.001
So let me get my pen tool out now,

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.485
let me deselect this,
get the pen tool out.

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.568
It's a new tool I'm using,

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:01.304
so let me make sure I'm doing it right.

00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:02.297
Alright, so from this side,

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:03.337
from this left side,

00:03:03.337 --> 00:03:05.170
or at least what we are
looking at as the left side,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.161
you can then construct another right side

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:09.033
based on this information.

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:13.929
A always pairs with T if
we're talking about DNA.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.287
So adenine pairs with
thymine just like that.

00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:19.480
Thymine pairs with adenine

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.703
Let me do that a little bit neater.

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:26.115
Thymine pairs with adenine,

00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:29.444
guanine pairs with cytosine,

00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:32.071
cytosine pairs with guanine,

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:33.833
falling a little bit down here.

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.308
And just like that I was able to construct

00:03:35.308 --> 00:03:38.874
a new right hand side
using that left hand side.

00:03:38.874 --> 00:03:43.874
So maybe I'll do the new sugar phosphate

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.765
backbone in yellow.

00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:47.321
And we can do the same thing here

00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:49.551
using the original right hand side.

00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:51.367
So using the original right hand side,

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:54.111
once again the T is paired with the A,

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:56.543
let me do that in adenine's color.

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.454
So we have an adenine and thymine,

00:03:59.454 --> 00:04:00.537
adenine and thymine,

00:04:00.537 --> 00:04:02.457
adenine and thymine.

00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:03.681
Thymine pairs with adenine,

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:05.753
so thymine, adenine.

00:04:05.753 --> 00:04:07.426
Thymine, adenine.

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:09.352
Guanine pairs with cytosine.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.532
And then cytosine pairs with guanine.

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:17.492
So cytosine just like that.

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:19.988
And so you can take half
of each of this ladder,

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:21.142
and then you can use it to
construct the other half,

00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:22.372
and what you've essentially done is

00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:25.720
you've replicated the actual DNA.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.231
And this is actually a
kind of conceptual level

00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:29.975
of how replication is done

00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:32.063
before a cell divides and replicates,

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.463
and the entire cell duplicates itself.

00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:37.633
So that's replication.

00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:39.335
So the next thing you're
probably thinking about,

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:41.569
"Okay, well it's nice to be
able to replicate yourself

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.248
"but that's kind of useless
if that information can't be

00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:47.441
"used to define the organism in some way

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.361
"to express what's actually happening."

00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:54.353
And so let's think about how the genes

00:04:54.353 --> 00:04:59.174
in this DNA molecule
are actually expressed.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.001
So I'll write this as "expression".

00:05:03.784 --> 00:05:07.264
And actually that warrants
a little bit of a detour

00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:09.247
because you hear sometimes the words

00:05:09.247 --> 00:05:11.823
DNA and chromosome and gene

00:05:11.823 --> 00:05:13.712
used somewhat interchangeably,

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.206
and they are clearly related,

00:05:15.206 --> 00:05:17.223
but it's worth knowing what is what.

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:18.672
So when you're talking about DNA

00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:21.066
you're talking literally
about this molecule here

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:23.015
that has this sugar phosphate base

00:05:23.015 --> 00:05:25.479
and it has the sequence of base pairs,

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.447
it's got this double helix structure,

00:05:27.447 --> 00:05:29.919
and so this whole thing this
could be a DNA molecule.

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.558
Now when you have a DNA molecule

00:05:32.558 --> 00:05:34.439
and it's packaged together
with other molecules

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.079
and proteins and kind of
given a broader structure,

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:40.410
then you're talking about a chromosome.

00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:42.654
And when you're talking about a gene,

00:05:42.654 --> 00:05:45.653
you're talking about a section of DNA

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:48.429
that's used to express a certain trait.

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:53.220
Or actually used to code for
a certain type of protein.

00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:55.576
So for example this could be,

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:57.847
this whole thing could be a strand of DNA,

00:05:57.847 --> 00:06:01.336
but this part right over,
let's say in orange I'll do it,

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:04.890
this part in orange right
over here could be one gene,

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.435
it might define information for one gene,

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.250
it could define a protein,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.513
this section right over here

00:06:13.513 --> 00:06:17.807
could be used to define another gene.

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:20.329
And genes could be anywhere from

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:22.181
several thousand base pairs long,

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:24.718
all the way up into the millions.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:25.733
And as we'll see,

00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:27.613
the way that a gene is expressed,

00:06:27.613 --> 00:06:30.269
the way we get from the
information for that section of DNA

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:33.805
into a protein which is
really how it's expressed,

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:37.348
is through a related molecule to DNA,

00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:39.744
and that is RNA.

00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:41.560
Actually let me write this down.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.727
RNA.

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:50.157
So RNA stands for ribonucleic acid.

00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:53.026
Ribonucleic acid, let me write that down.

00:07:02.848 --> 00:07:04.904
And so you might remember that DNA is

00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:07.264
deoxyribonucleic acid,

00:07:07.264 --> 00:07:09.775
so the sugar backbone in RNA

00:07:09.775 --> 00:07:11.463
is a very similar molecule,

00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:12.809
well now it's got its oxy,

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:15.351
it's not deoxyribonucleic acid,

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.339
it's ribonucleic acid.

00:07:17.574 --> 00:07:19.846
The R, let me make it clear
where the RNA come from,

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:22.199
the R is right over there,

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.806
then you have the nucleic, that's the n,

00:07:27.835 --> 00:07:29.172
and then it's a, acid.

00:07:29.172 --> 00:07:32.322
Same reason why we call
the DNA nucleic acid.

00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:35.668
So you have this RNA.

00:07:35.668 --> 00:07:38.204
So what role does this
play as we are trying

00:07:38.204 --> 00:07:40.736
to express the information in this DNA?

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:41.850
Well the DNA,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.568
especially if we're talking
about cells with nucleii,

00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:47.424
the DNA sits there but
that information has to

00:07:47.424 --> 00:07:49.164
for the most part get
outside of the nucleus

00:07:49.164 --> 00:07:50.903
in order to be expressed.

00:07:50.947 --> 00:07:53.410
And one of the functions that RNA plays

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.930
is to be that messenger,

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.459
that messenger between
a certain section of DNA

00:07:57.459 --> 00:07:59.568
and kind of what goes on
outside of the nucleus,

00:07:59.568 --> 00:08:04.348
so that that can be translated
into an actual protein.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.784
So the step that you go from DNA to mRNA,

00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:08.905
messenger RNA,

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.261
is called transcription.

00:08:11.296 --> 00:08:13.196
Let me write that down.

00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:21.858
And what happens in transcription,

00:08:21.858 --> 00:08:26.651
let's go back to looking at
one side of this DNA molecule.

00:08:27.512 --> 00:08:30.878
So let's say you have
that right over there,

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:32.874
let me copy and paste it.

00:08:34.198 --> 00:08:37.217
So there we go, actually
I didn't wanna do that.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.354
I wanted the other side.

00:08:39.734 --> 00:08:43.328
So actually I think I'm on the
wrong, let me go back here.

00:08:44.102 --> 00:08:47.433
And so let me copy and then let me paste.

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:49.976
There we go.

00:08:49.976 --> 00:08:54.669
So let's say you have
part of this DNA molecule,

00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:57.495
or you have 1/2 of it

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:58.824
just like we did when we replicated it.

00:08:58.824 --> 00:09:01.711
But now we're not just trying
to duplicate the DNA molecule,

00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:02.937
we're actually trying to create

00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:05.518
a corresponding mRNA molecule.

00:09:05.518 --> 00:09:08.064
At least for that section of,

00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:09.575
at least for that gene.

00:09:09.575 --> 00:09:11.022
So this might be part of a gene

00:09:11.022 --> 00:09:14.059
Actually whoops, let me make
sure I'm using the right tool.

00:09:14.143 --> 00:09:17.510
This might be part of a
gene that is this section

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.310
of our DNA molecule right over there.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.550
And so transcription is a
very similar conceputal idea,

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.014
where we're now going to construct

00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:28.264
a strand of RNA and specifically mRNA

00:09:28.264 --> 00:09:29.516
'cause it's going to take that information

00:09:29.516 --> 00:09:32.001
outside of the nucleus.

00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:33.769
And so it's very similar

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:35.929
except for when we're talking about RNA,

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:38.113
adenine, instead of pairing with thymine,

00:09:38.113 --> 00:09:41.044
is now going to pair with uracil.

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:42.761
So let me write this down,

00:09:42.761 --> 00:09:45.617
so now you're gonna have
adenine pairs not with thymine

00:09:45.617 --> 00:09:46.997
but uracil.

00:09:47.017 --> 00:09:49.344
DNA has uracil instead of the thymine.

00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:52.357
But you're still going to have
cytosine and guanine pairing.

00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:56.588
So for the RNA and in this case the mRNA

00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:59.152
that's going to leave the nucleus

00:09:59.152 --> 00:10:01.489
A is going to pair with U,

00:10:01.489 --> 00:10:03.568
U for uracil,

00:10:03.568 --> 00:10:06.167
so uracil, that's the
base we're talking about,

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:07.933
let me write it down, uracil.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.704
Thymine is still going
to pair with adenine,

00:10:15.272 --> 00:10:16.452
just like that.

00:10:16.452 --> 00:10:18.932
Guanine is gonna pair with cytosine,

00:10:20.207 --> 00:10:25.207
and cytosine is going
to pair with guanine.

00:10:26.372 --> 00:10:27.724
And so when you do that,

00:10:27.724 --> 00:10:29.900
now these two characters can detach,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.379
and now you have a single strand of RNA

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:33.908
and in this case messenger RNA,

00:10:33.908 --> 00:10:37.405
that has all the information

00:10:37.405 --> 00:10:41.210
on that section of DNA.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.863
And so now that thing
can leave the nucleus,

00:10:44.863 --> 00:10:46.712
go attach to a ribosome,

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:48.983
and we'll talk more about
that in future videos

00:10:48.983 --> 00:10:50.440
exactly how that's happened,

00:10:50.543 --> 00:10:52.486
and then this code can be used

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:55.242
to actually code for proteins.

00:10:55.242 --> 00:10:56.305
Now how does that happen?

00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:58.586
And that process is called translation.

00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:04.980
Which is really taking
this base pair sequence

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.356
and turning it into an
amino acid sequence.

00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:10.754
Proteins are made up of
sequences of amino acids.

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:11.907
So translation.

00:11:11.907 --> 00:11:15.190
So let's take our mRNA or this
little section of our mRNA,

00:11:15.996 --> 00:11:18.959
and actually let me draw it like this.

00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:23.668
Now let's see, I have it is U A C,

00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:28.498
so it's gonna be U A C then U U

00:11:28.498 --> 00:11:30.739
then A C G okay?

00:11:30.903 --> 00:11:33.095
And then we have an A,

00:11:33.095 --> 00:11:35.510
let me make sure I change
it to the right color.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.510
We have an A there, and
then we have this U U A,

00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:43.300
C G, alright,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.522
now let me put a C right over there,

00:11:45.522 --> 00:11:47.938
I'm just taking this and
I'm writing it horizontally.

00:11:47.938 --> 00:11:51.246
I have a C here, not a G, it's a C.

00:11:52.248 --> 00:11:54.660
And then finally I have a G.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.722
And of course it'll keep
going on and on and on.

00:11:57.722 --> 00:12:01.789
And what happens is
each sequence of three,

00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:03.517
and you have to be very
careful where it starts,

00:12:03.517 --> 00:12:05.761
and so this is in some ways
a delicate and surprising,

00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:08.228
but at the same time
surprisingly robust process,

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:13.228
every three of these bases
code for a specific amino acid.

00:12:14.121 --> 00:12:16.638
And so three bases together,

00:12:16.638 --> 00:12:18.582
so these bases right over here,

00:12:18.582 --> 00:12:20.846
these I guess you could
say this three letter word

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:22.190
or this three letter sequence,

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.770
that's called a codon.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.117
And this is going to be the next codon.

00:12:29.536 --> 00:12:31.694
And we actually haven't drawn
the next codon after that

00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:34.922
'cause we need three bases
to get to the next codon.

00:12:35.733 --> 00:12:38.070
And how many possible codons do you have?

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.062
Well you have one of four bases

00:12:40.062 --> 00:12:42.622
and you have them in
three different places,

00:12:42.622 --> 00:12:44.588
so you have four times four times four,

00:12:44.588 --> 00:12:47.750
possible codon words
I guess you could say.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.141
And four times four times four is 64.

00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:55.447
So you have 64 possible codons.

00:12:56.217 --> 00:12:58.901
Which is good because you
have 20 possible amino acids.

00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:01.309
So this is overkill and
allows codons to be used

00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:02.844
for other purposes as well.

00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:04.989
And they also, you might
have more than one codon

00:13:04.989 --> 00:13:07.076
coding for the same amino acid.

00:13:07.076 --> 00:13:08.553
So you have 64 possible codons

00:13:08.553 --> 00:13:11.430
that need to code for 20 amino acids.

00:13:11.477 --> 00:13:14.660
And so this codon right
over here with the ribosome,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.716
and we'll talk more
about how that happens,

00:13:16.716 --> 00:13:18.619
can code for

00:13:22.172 --> 00:13:25.038
amino acid 1.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:28.918
So let me just write it
here, this is amino acid 1.

00:13:28.918 --> 00:13:31.614
And actually this amino
acid is brought to here,

00:13:31.614 --> 00:13:34.725
they're actually matched
together by another type of RNA,

00:13:34.725 --> 00:13:37.117
this is mRNA we're talking
about right over here.

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:41.897
This is mRNA, but there's
another type of RNA

00:13:41.907 --> 00:13:43.610
called tRNA

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.034
that essentially brings these
two characters together.

00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:48.146
So the tRNA,

00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:49.480
and I'm just gonna, it's
got some structure here,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.013
I'm not drawing it completely right,

00:13:51.013 --> 00:13:52.706
but it's going to match right over here,

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:57.706
where maybe it has an A, a
U, and a G right over here

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.801
and on this end it was
attached to this amino acid,

00:14:01.801 --> 00:14:03.809
and so it matches them together.

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:07.125
And then they're gonna have another tRNA

00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:11.464
that might attach to amino acid 2,

00:14:12.064 --> 00:14:13.674
which I will do in purple,

00:14:16.812 --> 00:14:19.429
and that just happens to coincide with,

00:14:19.429 --> 00:14:21.192
so it can complement right over here,

00:14:21.192 --> 00:14:22.406
so it attaches in the right place,

00:14:22.406 --> 00:14:25.075
so it's A A U right over here,

00:14:25.075 --> 00:14:26.468
this tRNA.

00:14:26.468 --> 00:14:29.796
And so it'll construct the
sequence of amino acids.

00:14:29.796 --> 00:14:31.965
And as you put these amino acids together,

00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:34.679
then you're actually
constructing a protein.

00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:38.011
So protein is essentially a bunch,

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:40.554
a sequence of these
amino acids put together.

00:14:42.706 --> 00:14:46.239
And these proteins are
essentially the molecules

00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:49.288
that run life for the most part.

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.086
Obviously you know if you eat an animal

00:14:51.086 --> 00:14:53.999
it's going to be made up of
fat and sugars and proteins,

00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:56.415
but the proteins are the
things that actually do a lot

00:14:56.415 --> 00:14:58.815
of the whether they're enzymes,
whether they're structural,

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.903
the muscle is formed from proteins,

00:15:00.903 --> 00:15:01.782
these are the things,

00:15:01.782 --> 00:15:03.631
and I'm just drawing a
small segment of them,

00:15:03.631 --> 00:15:08.522
they could be thousands or
more of these amino acids long.

00:15:08.522 --> 00:15:11.583
And they kind of form these
incredibly complex shapes

00:15:11.583 --> 00:15:13.231
and they have all of these functions.

00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:15.807
This is what's kind of
doing the work of life.

00:15:15.807 --> 00:15:17.120
And this for the most part,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.334
and this is kind of how the
information for life is stored.
