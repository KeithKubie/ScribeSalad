00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.230
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, and welcome.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.750
My name is Mary Lou Reker
and on behalf of the Library

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.730
of Congress's John W. Kluge
Center, I want to welcome you

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.650
to a talk today by Dr. Rachel
Shelden entitled, "Abraham Lincoln

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.700
and the US Supreme Court and
the Politics of Slavery".

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.560
Now, before I get started
here, I want to remind you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.830
that we are recording this
for the library's website,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.370
so any questions you may ask at
the end constitute your permission

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.110
to keep that question
in the recording.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.970
So, just be aware of that.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.100
Many of you know that the
Kluge Center is located right

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.710
through those doors, up
here on Capitol Hill.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.230 position:56%
And it strives to bring together
scholars and researchers to make use

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.720
of the collections of the Library
of Congress and to communicate

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.430
with policymakers across the
city and around the country.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.100
And also to foster a
collegial atmosphere

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.070
in which scholarship can
generate more scholarship

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.110
and deeper scholarship.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.470
Dr. Rachel Shelden has
been an integral member

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.320
of the community here at the
Kluge Center this past year.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.820
Her research at the library focuses

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.010
on the US Supreme Court
during the 19th century.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.110
Her talk will examine the Supreme
Court before the Civil War,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.360
and in particular, a conspiracy
charge to perpetuate slavery,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.850
which was levied by the
then senatorial candidate,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.430
Abraham Lincoln, against
a variety of members

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.100
of the federal government.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.200
Shelden will reexamine Lincoln's
conspiracy charge in the context

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.220 position:56%
of how the federal political system,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.960
and particularly the
US Supreme Court,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.210
operated in the mid-19th century.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.020
Rachel Shelden is an assistant
professor in American History

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.730
at the University of Oklahoma.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.910
She is the author of "Washington
Brotherhood, Politics, Social Life

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.670
and the Coming of the Civil War".

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.410
She is also coeditor of the book,
"A Political Nation, New Directions

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.940
in Mid-Nineteenth Century
American Political Theory".

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.860
She received her PhD from
the University of Virginia,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.940
and as a Kluge Fellow,
researched her future monograph,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.370
the third here.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.000
"On the Political History
of the US Supreme Court

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.710
from the Mid-1830s
through the 1890s".

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.510
Please help me welcome
her, Dr. Rachel Shelden.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.180
[ Applause ]

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.910
And thank you, Mary Lou.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.570 position:56%
Before I talk about Lincoln, which I
know you're all here to hear about,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.650 position:56%
I want to thank all of the wonderful
folks at the Library of Congress

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.160
for supporting my project.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.790
It has been an absolute
privilege to be a Kluge Fellow.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.420
And the Kluge Center really
is a special place to work.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.570
I want to thank all of the
staff, and particularly Mary Lou.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.070
Jason Steinhauer, Joanne Kitchens,
Dan Turello, Robert Gallucci

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.760
and Travis Hensley, among others.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.380
As always, I had a wonderful
experience researching

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.200
in the Manuscript Division, and
I want to thank Michelle Crowell,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.140
who's here, who helped me
out in a number of ways,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.580
in addition to the incredibly
knowledgeable reference staff

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.840
for all of their help, and
especially their good cheer.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.740
While in residence, I had the
wonderful opportunity to work

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.030
with Kluge Center intern, Jack
Femol [presumed spelling].

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.440
He helped with the database
project on the Supreme Court cases

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.220
and lawyers, which has
proved tremendously useful

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.800
in my research so far.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.720
And finally, I want to thank all
of the fellows for their many,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.830
many pointed insights,
their heartfelt support

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.480
and engaging conversation.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.000
So, with that said, I want
to tell you a little bit

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.910 position:56%
about the larger project that I have
been doing here at the Kluge Center.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.040
I've been working on a political
history of the Supreme Court

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.640
in the Civil War era, from
roughly the 1830s to the 1890s.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.670
My project is primarily
concerned with the ways

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.860
in which the Supreme
Court was and acted

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.020
as a political body
during this period.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.130
And one of the key points
that I intend to make is

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.450
that we should think about the
Supreme Court, not as a separate

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.240
and isolated institution,
but rather as an integral

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.620
and interconnected part

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.460
of the federal political
apparatus in the 19th century.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.200
As the evidence here at
the library demonstrated

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.810
in the incredible sources
in the Jefferson Building

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.570
and in the Manuscript
Division in numerous letters

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.210
from Supreme Court Justices and the
lawyers who tried cases in front

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.150
of them, the experience
and the context of serving

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.640
as a Supreme Court Justice
was inherently political.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.400
In essence, political history
is about the Supreme Court, too.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.300
Reframing our understanding
of the court

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.510
in this context can tell us much

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.890
about the way 19th century
Supreme Court justices thought

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:56.010
about their roles in promoting
democracy, union and liberty.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.840 position:56%
But the justices' political behavior
also influenced their engagement

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.840
with some of the most
important issues of this period,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.140
particularly issues
involving slavery and race.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.800 position:56%
There are a number of ways to get at
this relationship between politics,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.250
the Supreme Court and slavery
and race in the mid-19th century,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.830
but given that we have just passed
Lincoln's birthday late last week,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.230
I thought there was no better entry
point into the political history

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.070
of the Supreme Court
in the Civil War era.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.230
So, I want to start with a
famous political accusation

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.950
that Lincoln made about an equally
famous Supreme Court ruling.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:38.550 position:56%
In June, 1858, Abraham Lincoln
delivered an address at Springfield,

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.850
Illinois, that has come to be known
as his "House Divided" speech.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.460
This was a speech many of you
are undoubtedly familiar with.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.610
Lincoln began, "A house divided
against itself cannot stand.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.850
I believe this government cannot
endure permanently half slave

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.570
and half free."

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.150
As Lincoln explained, the
United States would have

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.390
to go one direction or the other.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.210
Become an entirely
non-slaveholding nation,

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.110
or an entirely slaveholding nation.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.970
The opening section of the
speech is the most famous piece,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.920
probably the piece you have heard.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.670
But the rest of the address
is equally noteworthy.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.280
Here Lincoln developed
and explained his theory

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.050
that there was a conspiracy
among four men

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.570
to spread slavery throughout
the United States.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.300
To make this an entirely
slaveholding nation

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.590
by making slavery legal not
only in the southern states,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.090
but in the north, as well.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:38.220
The men in this conspiracy were
Lincoln's chief rival in Illinois,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.980
Stephen Douglas, and three
other federal leaders,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.790
former president Franklin
Pierce, President James Buchanan

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.100
and Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court, Roger Taney.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.930
According to Lincoln, the
conspiracy began in 1854

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:00.020 position:56%
when Stephen Douglas introduced the
Kansas-Nebraska Act into the Senate.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.620
Douglas's bill upended a
30-plus year ban on slavery

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.280
in the US Territory above the 36'
30" Latitude, or what we think

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.810
of as the line that
separates south from north.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.510
Instead, the Kansas-Nebraska
act implemented the principle

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.450
of popular sovereignty, or the
ability of people in the territory

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.980
to vote in favor or against
slavery in their borders.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.890
According to Lincoln, three years
later, the Supreme Court finalized

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.630
and compounded the move toward
nationalizing slavery in the case

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.130
of Dred Scott v. Sanford.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.450
On March 6th 1857, Chief
Justice, Roger Taney,

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.010
read the majority opinion
in Dred Scott,

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.020
which denied African
Americans the right

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.930 position:56%
to be citizens of the United States.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.980
And in the most consequential
part of this particular ruling

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.500
for Lincoln's charge,
prohibited congress

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.360
from restricting slavery
in the US Territories.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.740 position:56%
Now, in between these two monumental
moves, outgoing president,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.760
Franklin Pierce, had
encouraged acceptance

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.610
of the Kansas-Nebraska legislation

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.330
and any potential consequences
that came from it.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.120 position:56%
And a mere two days before the court
issued its decision in Dred Scott,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.110
the incoming president,
James Buchanan,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.150
pressed his inaugural audience

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.840
to accept whatever the
court might decide.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.960
Lincoln finally connected
the circle back to Douglas,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.510
who was similarly insistent
that the court receive its due.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.020 position:56%
In the weeks before Buchanan's
inauguration, Douglas had been asked

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.390
by an Illinois colleague
on the floor of the senate

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.220
if it was constitutional for
the people of a territory

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.440
to ban slavery from their borders.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.630
Douglas replied that this was a
question for the Supreme Court.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.380
So, with so many overlapping
connections, Lincoln exclaimed

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:57.030
in his "House Divided" speech, "We
find it impossible to not believe

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:02.500 position:56%
that Steven and Franklin and Roger
and James all understood one another

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:09.350
from the beginning, and all worked
upon a common plan or draft drawn

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.440
up before the first
lick was struck."

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.960
Now, on its face, this
charge might seem outlandish.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.790
There is no evidence to suggest
that these four men met in a room

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.440 position:56%
and hashed out a plan for Douglas
to introduce the Kansas-Nebraska Act

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.520
in 1854 and Taney to
rule in Dred Scott.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.530
And in the formalized debates
between Lincoln and Douglas

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.860
that followed, the debates
you're familiar with, I'm sure,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.830 position:56%
the Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858,

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.720
Douglas repeatedly
denied having spoken

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.520
to Chief Justice Taney
about the matter.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.780
He also pointed out, Douglas, that
Buchanan was serving as Minister

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.040
to London when he introduced
the Kansas-Nebraska Act,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.370
making any conference among the
four men in 1854 before the first

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.670
of Lincoln's conspiratorial
moves, wholly impossible.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.260
So, why did Lincoln
make this charge?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.030
Or perhaps more pointedly,
did Lincoln really believe

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.080
that these men had
colluded in a plot

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.820
to spread slavery throughout
the United States?

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.050
Some Lincoln scholars have argued

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.100
that Lincoln genuinely
believed this.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.390
If for no other reason,
than his abject distrust

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.800
of his rival, Stephen Douglas.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.590
Other scholars have been
less sure, suggesting instead

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.270
that Lincoln made sort of a
fanciful argument for the sake

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.400
of making Douglas look bad.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.680
After all, Lincoln was in a
heated campaign against Douglas

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.570
for election to the US
Senate from Illinois,

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.620
and Lincoln was doing all he
could to defeat his rival.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.780
In fact, earlier in the
year, some republicans

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.250
from the east had suggested
that maybe they were going

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.270
to support Douglas for
his senatorial bid,

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.820
and this really freaked Lincoln
out and made him think, "Oh,

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.420
I really need to show
that the democrats are not

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.650
in a good way on this issue."

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.920
The political benefit, therefore,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.600
of this conspiracy
charge, was substantial.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.210
And some evidence sustains
this interpretation

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.950
that Lincoln was simply
playing a political game.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.760
In the joint debates with
Douglas that followed his

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.900
"House Divided" speech,
Lincoln repeated the charge.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.430
But he was very careful
to acknowledge

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.990
that he could not prove
the conspiracy.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.840
That he had only inferred that
such collusion had taken place.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.510
Regardless of whether Lincoln
believed the charge or not,

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.250
the suggestion of conspiracy
among federal politicians made

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.200
for some great political theater.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.950
Much like today, charges
of conspiracy

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.680 position:56%
in the Civil War era sent a powerful
message that energized voters.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.310
And this particular conspiracy
charge had rhetorical legs,

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.820
because of the plausibility
of the argument.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.990
Certainly, southern slaveholders
were intent on preserving

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.090 position:56%
and promoting slavery in their
states and in new federal territory.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.760
And anti-slavery men in the north
had been thoroughly disgusted

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.600
by Douglas's role in
the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.140 position:56%
Many saw the introduction of popular
sovereignty into the territories

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.810
as a victory for slaveholders.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.920
Certainly, the recent
tendency to expand the power

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.630
of slavery made a slaveholder
conspiracy sound more likely.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.220
And in fact, several republicans

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.100
in Washington had already been
exploiting this northern fear

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.770
of a slaveholder conspiracy

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:29.170
by the time Lincoln delivered
his "House Divided" speech.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.660
But Lincoln's description

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.630
of the conspiracy was
perhaps even more effective.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.590
Because it had the sound bite
specifics that others had lacked.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.300
He fleshed out the details by
naming the four co-conspirators

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.710
who were directly responsible
for this.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.160
Stephen and Franklin
and Roger and James.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.270
The conspiracy featured
democrats from all three branches

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.120
of the federal government,
working in concert over some time,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.180
culminating in a case
before the Supreme Court.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.220
And in many ways, this
part of the conspiracy,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.780 position:56%
Taney's role in the Dred Scott case,

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.430 position:56%
is the part that looks most
ethically questionable to all of us.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.970
We're used to the idea that
the president and members

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.550
of congress might work together
to promote an agenda or a piece

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.000
of legislation, though, especially
these days, that might rely

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.250
on a president and congress
being of the same party.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.060
What was really galling about
Lincoln's charge, to us at least,

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.770
is that at least one member of
the Supreme Court was in on it.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.860 position:56%
But Lincoln was no less certain that
Roger had played a critical role.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.610
And I think this is
really important.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.390
We could simply assume Lincoln
was exaggerating the level

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.620
of the Supreme Court's rule,
as some historians have.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.090
But I think that misses
what was really going on.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.520
For Lincoln, the conspiracy
was plausible,

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.920
not just because of
recent pro-slavery moves,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.150
but because of who was
involved in those moves.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.320
And the "who" included Roger Taney.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.110
The key here is that
Lincoln recognized

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.550
that the Supreme Court was not
simply a legal body deciding cases

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.120
in the vacuum of the court chamber.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.800
Rather, he knew first hand that
the court was intimately connected

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:21.680 position:56%
to the other branches of government,
both in personnel and in operation.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.090
There were no stark lines
separating senators from justices

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.840
or even judge from lawyer.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.200
In fact, this is an
aspect of Lincoln's life

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.630
that does not get enough attention.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.890
Lincoln is known for his brilliant
political mind both in the debates

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.710
with Douglas and then, of course,

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.400
in his years as president during
our nation's most difficult moment,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.460
the Civil War.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.110
But Lincoln spent most
of his career,

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.520
before becoming president,
as a lawyer.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.970
Perhaps we have ignored this,
in part, because our perception

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.820
of lawyers is not always
very positive today.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.390
And this was actually true
in the 19th century, as well.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.140
Lincoln acknowledged as
much in preparing some notes

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.610
for a law lecture in 1850.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.900
He noted, "There is a
vague popular belief

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.250
that lawyers are necessarily
dishonest.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.640
The impression is common,
almost universal."

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.030
[Laughter] So, perhaps, given
this perception in our rush

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.480
to celebrate Lincoln's important
role in our national story,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.250
we sometimes minimize
his legal contributions.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.550
But Lincoln had intimate
knowledge, not only of the law,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.010
but also the structures
of the Judicial System.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.790 position:56%
Lincoln and his several law partners

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.740
over the years had
a bustling business,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.140
trying cases in the
Illinois Court System.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.080
Historians estimate that
Lincoln's law practice was involved

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.040
in nearly 5,000 cases
on the state level.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.160
And he was also involved in nearly
350 cases on the federal level,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.450
including several that
reached the Supreme Court.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.740
Although Lincoln only made
oral arguments in front

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.400
of the Supreme Court once during
his career, in all likelihood,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.760
this was not his only experience
with the court's proceedings.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.120
Until the 20th century,
as you may know,

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.520
the court's chamber was located
in the chamber of the Capitol.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.190
And Lincoln had spent enough time

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:19.080
in the Capitol building during his
single term as a US Congressman,

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.480
to know that the line
between legislative

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.230
and judicial branches
was often blurry.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:29.170
In essence, Lincoln was intimately
experienced with the ways

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.890
in which the federal system
operated at each level.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.890
Ultimately, from this experience
in Washington, and in trying cases

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.000
in the Illinois state and
federal courts, Lincoln understood

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.760
that the 19th century
judiciary often operated

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.070
in fluid and informal ways.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.650
Whether he actually believed
his own accusations or not,

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.670
Lincoln's understanding
of the Supreme Court

00:17:55.670 --> 00:18:00.950
as a political body gave even
more plausibility to the idea

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.270
that a conspiracy had occurred.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.210
And Lincoln clearly
framed his charge

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.240
with this understanding in mind.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.980
So, in the remainder
of my time here,

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.270
I want to show you just how
important this judicial context was

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.770
by highlighting some
of the political

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.850
and legal relationships
of the mid-19th century.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.070
Relationships that Lincoln
would have been familiar

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.220
with when making his
conspiracy charge.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.780
In particular, I want to focus
on the two types of relationships

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.180
that I just mentioned, that would
have given Lincoln the special

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.070
knowledge to see collusion.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:39.210
First, the Washington political
community and second the community

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.070
of lawyers and judges that
practiced both in Washington

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.020
and throughout the
federal court system.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.510 position:56%
By the end, perhaps you will be as
convinced as Lincoln purported to be

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.470
that Stephen and Franklin and
Roger and James were colluding

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.980
in the Dred Scott decision.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.680
So, I'll start with the
Washington political community.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.400
A community that very much
included the Supreme Court.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.350
Today, we often assume a very
strict level of separation

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:13.190
between the Supreme Court and the
Legislative and Executive Branches.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:17.430
But, as Lincoln would have noted,
in the 19th century, the boundaries

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.760
between these bodies
were much blurrier.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.150
To begin with, there was no stark
line separating Supreme Court

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.820
Justices from members of Congress.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.660
The fact that the court chamber
was located in the Capitol itself,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.350
helped to ensure that congressional

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.730
and judicial business
sometimes overlapped.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.010
And overlapped is perhaps
the best word.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:43.360
A number of congressmen served as
lawyers before the Supreme Court

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.620
in the era of Dred Scott.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.170
In fact, Congressmen
were paid so little

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.600
for their legislative services
that it was a happy coincidence

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.670
if a sitting senator or
representative could take care

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.200
of some profitable
legal business in front

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.760
of the court while in Washington.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.550 position:56%
Lincoln understood this well,
having argued his only case in front

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.400
of the Supreme Court at the
close of his term in the House

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.830
of Representatives in 1849.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.840
Occasionally, congressmen argued
Supreme Court cases in the midst

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.160
of pressing congressional
business, requiring them to work

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.480 position:56%
with the justices to schedule
arguments for days when congress was

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.640
in recess, or to simply miss the
legislative meetings entirely.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.950
Perhaps the most famous
example of this kind of juggling

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:35.650
at an important moment was when New
York Senator William Henry Seward

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:40.150
was arguing a case in front of
the court in December, 1860.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:44.010
If you know anything about what
was happening in December 1860,

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.750
this is right in the midst of South
Carolina threatening to secede

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.190
from the union and, as a senator,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.770
William Henry Seward was
very involved in trying

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.410
to prevent this from happening.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.720
So, he's juggling these things.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.090
In the case of Dred Scott,
Lincoln was undoubtedly aware

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.970
that Henry Geyer, a sitting
congressman from Missouri,

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.750
was one of the lawyers from the
named parties, John Sanford.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.250
Congressmen were not the
only ones to blur the lines

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.080
between government branches.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.610
Just as legislative members
engaged in judicial business,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.280
so too did judiciary members
engage in legislative business.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.490
There are numerous examples in
this period of a justice working

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.170
on congressional legislation
behind the scenes.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.040
Often, but not always, this
meant helping congressmen

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.920 position:56%
to craft laws regarding the federal
court system or other legal matters.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.430
But sometimes, this was completely
separate from legal issues.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.340
Supreme Court Justices and
Congressmen also interacted

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.970
in more social ways
than they do today.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.930
In the 1840s and 1850s, Supreme
Court Justices often lived

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.650
in boarding houses and
hotels throughout the area

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.680
between the White House
and the Capitol Building.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.450 position:56%
And while some on the Dred Scott
Court like Taney confined themselves

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.820
to small houses with just
a few other justices,

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.190
others were more inclined
to mix with other members

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.600
of the Washington community,
including members of congress.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.360
For example, associate justice,
John McLean, often rented rooms

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.060
at Mrs. Carter's Boarding
House, where he lived

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.220
with upwards of ten congressmen.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.410
And in the late 1840s when
Lincoln served in the House

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.990
of Representatives, one of McLean's
mess mates was Lincoln's good

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.930
friend, Alexander Stephens.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.690
If the Supreme Court Justices
did not live with members

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.010
of the Washington community,
they were still sure to interact

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.440
with them on a wide
variety of occasions.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.490
This happened most frequently
at the dinner table of friends

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.830
or prominent city residents.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.420
On more formal occasions, the
justices went to state dinners

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.870
at the White House or
to various celebrations,

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.040
like the annual Birthnight Ball,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.850
which honored George
Washington's birthday.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.680
But still, other times,
their dinners took place

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.520
in more casual circumstances.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.520
Sometimes, such dinners featured
both justices and the lawyers

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.250
who were making oral
arguments in court that week.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:15.250
If the social and professional
interaction between congressmen

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.310
and justices does not convince you
that the line between the judicial

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.230
and legislative branches
were blurry,

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.970
perhaps I can state the
case more definitively.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.030
There is significant
evidence that members

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.160
of the Supreme Court discussed
open cases with the senators

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.890
and representatives who
tried cases in front of them.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.260
Sometimes, these discussions
involved a justice simply filling

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.630
in a friend that he had
lost a case a couple

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.390
of days before the
decision was made,

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.270
but others featured conversations

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.420
about a case still
under consideration.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.400
Lincoln did not have
personal experience

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.870
with this kind of conversation.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.200
At least, there's no evidence
to suggest that in the records.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.100
But he certainly would have
been aware of this kind of thing

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.800 position:56%
from his time serving in Washington,
or heard about it from friends

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.400
in the House who were
regular court attendees.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.100
So, this is one kind
of relationship.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.050
This very fluid relationship

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:20.000
between the legislative
and judicial branches.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.450
The relationships between
judges on the Supreme Court

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.910
and sitting presidents in the 19th
century were also far more intimate

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.310
than we might expect.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:33.310 position:56%
One reason for this is that
justices did not have the same kinds

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.140
of credentials that they do today.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.960
Supreme Court nominees
had to be lawyers,

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.740
but there were very few
law schools in the 1850s.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.030
Most American Lawyers had received
their formal training by serving

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.900
in an apprentice role from
a more experienced lawyer,

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.370
though you did not have to do this.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.850
And Lincoln himself had
almost no legal training.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.640
He'd not even apprenticed.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.140
He'd learned the law primarily

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.980
from reading Blackstone's
Commentaries and by trying cases.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.820
Moreover, justices did not
typically enter the Supreme Court

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.880
from a previous position
on the Bench.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.430
There were no feeder courts

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.870
from which presidents
could find a farm team

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.240
of suitable judges as
the often do today.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.650
Of the nine justices who
served on the Dred Scott Court,

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.260
only five had experience as
judges before they joined the

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.560
Supreme Court.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.930
And of those five, only
two were serving as judges

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.080
when they were nominated
to the court.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.960
So, as a result of this
relatively informal legal

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.230
and judicial training, political
experience was often the best

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:44.180
indicator for who would
join the Supreme Court.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.610
Nineteenth century presidents
typically made Supreme Court

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:52.420
nominations based squarely
on partisan reasoning,

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.740
rewarding political friends
with a job in the judiciary.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.610
Among the seven Dred Scott justices
who were not serving as justices

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.230
when they were nominated to the
Supreme Court, two were serving

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.000
in the Executive Branch,
one was a US Congressman,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.590
and a fourth held a
prominent state position

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.630
as Lieutenant Governor or Virginia.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.070
These men were rewarded for
their political commitments,

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.530
not their judicial service.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:24.060
Roger Taney, himself, had received
his nomination for Chief Justice

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.860
from President Andrew Jackson in
1836 as a result of Taney's support

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.490
for Jackson's banking policies.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.800
Taney was certainly
a qualified lawyer,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.940 position:56%
but he was also a strong democrat,
and a confident of Andrew Jackson's.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:43.010
In 1846, James K. Polk had
actually toyed with the idea

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.960
of making James Buchanan a Supreme
Court nominee while Buchanan was

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.280
serving as Secretary of State.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.840
Buchanan was a strong democrat,

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.990
but he'd also been giving Polk
some headaches in the cabinet,

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.040
and so he thought, Polk
thought, putting Buchanan

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.900
on the court would
make perfect sense.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.710
It would give him an ally and it
would get him out of the cabinet.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.940
Ultimately, Buchanan decided
against accepting the nomination,

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.610
but the possibility was there.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.630
And Buchanan's political
experience was a positive

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.560
in Polk's considerations.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.960
The Supreme Court might actually
have looked slightly different

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.040
and decided Dred Scott
slightly differently,

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.060
had Millard Fillmore been
successful in nominating one

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.590
of his partisan friends to
the court in early 1853.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.720
Fillmore was a Whig and
he hoped to get his friend

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.790
and former senate colleague, George
Edmund Badger of North Carolina,

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.440
on the court to replace
Associate Justice, John McKinley,

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.460
who had died the July before.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:47.130 position:56%
But the democratic congress rejected
Badger and the next president,

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.890
Franklin Pierce, successfully
nominated John Archibald Campbell

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.930
of Alabama.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.760
Although Badger was a
southerner, following the decision,

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.850
Badger came out against the court's
restriction of congress's right

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.410
to legislate for the territories
in the case of slavery.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.940 position:56%
So, had he been on the court, things
might have looked very different.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.710
So, although partisanship clearly
mattered when making nominations,

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.740
what's most important
here is that confirmation

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.250
as a Supreme Court Justice
did not actually bring an end

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:26.370
to the close relationships
between president and judge.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:31.250 position:56%
Taney, for example, was close enough
with Jackson to actually provide him

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.980
with constitutional advice
during his presidency.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.990 position:56%
And he even helped the retiring
president write his farewell address

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.140
in 1837.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.130
Nor was Taney alone.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.710
Fellow associate justices on the
Dred Scott Court, Peter Daniel

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:50.580
and John Catron, similarly offered
political advice to their friends,

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:55.430
President Martin Van Buren and
President James Polk, respectively.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.320
Justices also routinely advised
presidents and their cabinets

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.140
on judicial matters from who
should fill court vacancies,

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.630
to navigating sticky legal
problems such as extradition.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.290
Lincoln may not have had first-hand
knowledge of these conversations,

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:15.410
but he would have known plenty
of federal politicians who did.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.320
The line between the
federal, judicial

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.930
and executive departments
was actually so blurry

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:26.330
that several judges actively sought
their own presidential nomination

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.400
while sitting on the Supreme Court.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.240
The most consistent candidate

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.200
for president among the Dred Scott
court justices was John McLean

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.830
of Ohio, a frontrunner
for nomination

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:45.250
in every presidential contest
between 1832 and 1860, and,

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.440
I should add, representing
nearly every political party

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:53.690
of the antebellum era, including
anti-masons, Whigs, Free Soilers,

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.830 position:56%
Americans, Republicans and
Constitutional Unionists [laughter].

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.950
Only nine months before
the decision in Dred Scott,

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.490
McLean had been a favorite
to win the nomination

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.160
at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.560
Lincoln had been among the
nominees for vice president

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.970
at the 1856 convention, and he
was therefore intimately familiar

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.370
with this kind of cross
branch behavior.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.530
So, I hope I've convinced you
the Supreme Court that operated

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.200
in Lincoln's time was not isolated.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.420
The lines between the highest US
Court and the other two branches

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.830
of government were blurry
and sometimes fluid.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.180
And Lincoln made his conspiracy
charge with this context in mind.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.770
Now, Lincoln also had
additional proof

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:40.380
of cross branch interaction
in the Dred Scott case.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.040
Remember that on March 4, 1857,

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.030
a mere two days before Taney
issued the decision in Dred Scott,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.720
James Buchanan had been sworn

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.880
in as the 15th president
of the United States.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.640
And he told the inaugural
crowd that they ought

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.440
to accept whatever the
Supreme Court decided.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.500
On his way up to the podium to
deliver this inaugural address,

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.760
the president elect stopped briefly
to have a little conversation

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.200
with Chief Justice Taney.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.500
Republican politicians

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.650
and newspapers throughout
the north commented

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.950
on this very public
discussion between the two men,

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.860
suggesting that they exchanged
words about Dred Scott.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.520
Lincoln did not know what
was said, and neither do we.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.580
But it certainly looked
like collusion.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.710
And with Lincoln's
knowledge of the intimacies

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.560
between the various
branches of government,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.840
the events on inauguration day may
have looked like a smoking gun.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.300
What Lincoln didn't know is
that this short conversation

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.790
between Chief Justice Taney

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:46.230
and the president elect was
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.820
In the weeks before
Buchanan's inauguration,

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.620
he had exchanged several letters
with one of the associate justices,

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.110
John Catron of Tennessee.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.460
Catron had been keeping
Buchanan apprised

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.690
of the court's deliberations
over Dred Scott.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:06.330
But his correspondence went
beyond just sharing information.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.840
Not all of the justices had yet
decided how they were going to rule

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.520
on the Missouri Compromise issue.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.190
That's the issue regarding whether
Congress had the right to legislate

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.070
for the territories
regarding slavery.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.140
Among the undecideds
was Associate Justice,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.240
Robert Grier of Pennsylvania,
a friend of Buchanan's.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:31.450
Catron wrote to Buchanan and
asked him to "drop Grier a line"

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.380
to suggest he fall in with
Taney's majority position.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.530
Here, then, is one
link in the conspiracy

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.530
that Lincoln had anticipated,
even without direct knowledge

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.560
of the Buchanan-Catron
correspondence.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.960
You might say that Taney and
Buchanan were in on it together.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.080
We don't have any solid
evidence that Pierce

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.050
or Douglas would have discussed
the details of Dred Scott

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.110
with members of the Supreme Court.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.220
But their knowledge of the case
may have stemmed from another part

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.590
of the legal community, the
relationship between lawyers

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.040
and judges throughout
the federal system.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.240
Now, the relationship between these
federal judges and the lawyers

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.910
who tried cases in front of them
was understandably intimate.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:19.790
In the 19th century, the Supreme
Court Bar was relatively small

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:24.640
and justices repeatedly saw the
same lawyers in case after case.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.900
While there were certainly cases
involving first timers before the

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.010
bar, there were some
standard-bearers.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:35.590 position:56%
Daniel Webster, Richard Cox, George
Bibb, John Sergeant, John Crittenden

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.600
and Henry Stanbery show up
repeatedly in the records

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.440
as having argued cases from a vast
number of original jurisdictions.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.770
Several lawyers, many of
whom were former congressmen,

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.910
set up law offices in
Washington for the simple purpose

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.090
of attracting Supreme Court cases.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.820
And as one Washington
resident remarked,

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.130
a congressman turned
lawyer was expected

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.460
to have some influence
with the justices.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.770
We've seen this already with some
of the congressmen who tried cases

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.070
in front of the justices.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.390
But the men who served
as attorneys general

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:11.280
in the antebellum years also tended
to develop intimate relationships

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.530
with the Supreme Court
members returning

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.790
to the Supreme Court repeatedly in
the years after they left office.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:21.140
In the 1850s, one of the favorites

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:24.340
on the Supreme Court
was Reverdy Johnson,

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.240 position:56%
one of the lawyers for John Sanford.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.750
Johnson was an intimate
friend of Chief Justice Taney,

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:34.370
and had been trying cases in front
of the Supreme Court for as long

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.900
as most of the members had
been sitting on the bench.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.400
In fact, Johnson was well known
in Washington for his influence

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.460
with the justices, as they
spent time together at public

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:49.560
and private parties, state
dinners and more intimate affairs.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.480
While there is no direct evidence

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.450
that Johnson had ex parte
communication with the justices

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:56.370
about the Dred Scott Case,

00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:00.500
his reputation suggested he often
knew the court's proclivities

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.950
in other matters.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.120
Lincoln would have understood well

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.060
that judges sometimes had close
relationships with the lawyers

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.280
who tried cases before them.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.620
He had undoubtedly
witnessed this while serving

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.120
as a congressman in Washington.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.520
But perhaps more importantly,
he had personal experience

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.890
with a close lawyer-judge
relationship

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.450
on a state and local level.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.750
One of Lincoln's best friends
in Illinois was David Davis,

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:33.750
a state lawyer who rode the circuit
with Lincoln throughout the 1840s.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:38.670
But in 1848, Illinois residents
elected Davis the judge

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.520
of the 8th Judicial
Circuit of Illinois.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:47.950
And Lincoln soon began trying
cases in front of his friend.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.580
While there's no smoking gun that
Lincoln had ex parte communications

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.780
with Davis, several
anecdotes and letters

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.230
from the time suggest the two men
may have discussed pending legal

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.450
issues outside the courtroom.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:06.110
And in fact, the line between judge
and lawyer blended even further

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.570
when Davis needed to attend

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.680
to personal business
outside the circuit.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.150
And he put Lincoln on
the bench temporarily

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.100
to attend to judicial duties.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.460
This was no small matter.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:23.910
Lincoln acted as circuit court
judge for Davis in over 300 cases.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:28.260
And Lincoln, as you may know,
successfully nominated David Davis

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.430
to the Supreme Court in 1862.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.050
So, they remained friends
a long time.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:36.600
While the state court saw a
greater rotation of lawyers,

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.390
the Supreme Court bar was small
enough that occasionally a relative

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.220
of one of the justices would
find himself trying a case

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.140
in front of the bench.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.440
For example.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.390
Taney's brother-in-law,
Francis Scott Key,

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.790
occasionally made oral arguments
in the court in the Dred Scott era.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.290 position:56%
Taney recused himself in at least
one of these cases, but the presence

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.770
of a relative did not
necessarily mean a recusal.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:05.820
One of the true oddities of
the Dred Scott Case itself,

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.630
at least to our modern eyes,

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:11.840
is that one of Dred Scott's
lawyers was George Ticknor Curtis,

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.840
the brother of one of the associate
justices, Benjamin Robbins Curtis.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.740
The judge did not recuse himself.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.750
And Benjamin Curtis actually
received several compliments

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:27.800
from his fellow justices for his
brother's performance in court.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.090
Now, I see now contemporary
complaints

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.660 position:56%
that Benjamin Curtis heard the case,
in spite of his brother's presence.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.540
Lincoln did not point it out,
perhaps because Curtis was one

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.030 position:56%
of the two dissenters in Dred Scott,

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.690
and therefore had earned
republican praise.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:45.690 position:56%
But it certainly gives fodder to the
argument that Supreme Court Justices

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.230
and the lawyers who try
cases in front of them,

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.030
had more than a simple
professional relationship.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:55.460
And finally, the second aspect
of the federal court system

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.950
that I would like to point out
as relevant to Lincoln's charges,

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:03.390 position:56%
and this is the federal court system
and its structure in this era,

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.130
particularly the federal
circuit courts.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.470
The intermediary federal
judicial body

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.140
between the district
and Supreme Court.

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.400
As some of you may know,
in the antebellum era,

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.980 position:56%
there were no judges whose sole duty
was to sit on the circuit court.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.830
Rather, the circuit
court was composed

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.850
of two justices who
had other positions.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.540
A sitting district
judge for the area,

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.900
and a US Supreme Court member
who was riding circuit.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:36.120
As a result of this arrangement,
the circuit court only met a couple

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:41.080 position:56%
of specified times per year, and in
order to have both justices present,

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.620
they needed to account for
the intense travel schedules

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.980
of the Supreme Court
men who were responsible

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.840
for at least three different
circuit courts in addition

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.700
to handling business in Washington.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.690
The staffing of the circuit courts,
with one man from the district

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.050
and one man from the Supreme
Court, lent itself to all kinds

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.380
of manipulation and
maneuvering among the justices.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.400
For example, a member
of the Supreme Court

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.040
who was riding circuit
might purposely split

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.030
with his fellow judge to make
sure the case could be appealed

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.890
to the highest body.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.640
Or, as in the case with Dred Scott,

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.590
the absence of the Supreme Court
Justice form the circuit during

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.490
that body's deliberations
could influence when

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.640
and how quickly the
case could be appealed.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.920
Lincoln, as I mentioned previously,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.220
would have understood this
system well, having tried cases

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:34.790
in the 7th Federal Circuit
repeatedly for Justice McLean.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.350
So, how does this context factor

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.030
into what actually
happened in Dred Scott?

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.290
Unlike our Buchanan-Catron smoking
gun, there's no direct evidence

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.000
that Douglas or Pierce knew
about the court's decision

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.890
in Dred Scott ahead of time, but
if we look a little bit closer

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:52.030
at Lincoln's charges, we might
be able to see some connections.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:57.640
In his "House Divided" speech,
Lincoln specifically made a link

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.420
between the year that the
Kansas-Nebraska Act passed

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.800 position:56%
through congress and when the Dred
Scott Case first entered the federal

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.810
court system.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.860
Although a version
of the case had gone

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.960
through the Missouri State
Court since the late 1840s,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.720
the suit that we know as Dred Scott
v. Sanford reached the 8th Federal

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.250
Circuit in Missouri in early 1854.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.690
Lincoln emphasized that the
1854 date was not a coincidence,

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.790
and perhaps he was right.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.950
The justice who was
supposed to serve

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:32.100
on the 8th circuit was
John Catron, remember,

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.430
the man who had written
Buchanan for a little help

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.910
with his colleague, Justice Grier.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.950
But Catron was not present
for the circuit court session

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.560
that began the first
Monday in April.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.420
And although the district
judge, Robert Wells,

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.660
could have postponed
the case until October,

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.960
he decided to go ahead in April.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.940
Both Catron and Wells had been
serving on the 8th Circuit Court

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.320
since their appointments
in the late 1830s,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.510
and they would have known
each other intimately.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.660 position:56%
It's possible that the two discussed
how to proceed with the case,

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.580
though there's no direct
evidence to support that.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.710
Ultimately, I don't actually know
why Wells didn't wait for Catron,

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.170
and given that Wells was more
sympathetic to Dred Scott's plea,

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.060
I'm not sure he was really involved
in any collusion with Catron

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.360
to get the case moving
so that it would coincide

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.590
with the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.540
But you can see how
this looked to Lincoln,

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.940
a man who understood the federal
legal system and its penchant

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.370
for manipulation quite well.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:32.890
And so, here we can tie
Douglas to the court,

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:36.960
if not Taney specifically,
perhaps just Catron.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.980
And what about the final piece
of the puzzle, Pierce and Taney?

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.290
Again, no direct evidence

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:45.420
that Pierce knew how
the court would decide.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:50.250
But if we extend out net a little
bit further into Pierce's cabinet,

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.660
we might have some answers.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:56.330
You might remember that the Supreme
Court originally heard the Dred

00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:01.130
Scott Case in 1856 while
Pierce was still in office.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.330
One prominent historian has
suggested that Taney had been

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:09.950 position:56%
in direct conversation with Pierce's
attorney general, Caleb Cushing.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:14.040
And they had talked about the case,
and how it ought to be decided.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.930
Circumstantial evidence from after
the decision may back this up.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:22.490
In November, 1857, after the case
was published in Howard's reports,

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.830
Taney wrote a letter
to Cushing thanking him

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.100
for his support for their decision.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.790 position:56%
Cushing, who was from Massachusetts,
was among a handful of northerners

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:35.360
who had expressed their approval
of the Dred Scott decision.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.590 position:56%
But he may have known ahead of time.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.310
And certainly it would
not be farfetched

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.160
to assume he discussed
the matter with Pierce.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.890
And there you have it.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:49.290 position:56%
Buchanan and the court, Douglas and
the court, and Pierce and the court.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.020
You can see why Lincoln might
have believed this conspiracy

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.130
actually happened.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.470
Now, I don't want to give
you the wrong impression.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.280
I'm not actually suggesting here

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.670
that these men really did
conspire to perpetuate slavery.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.800
The evidence I sketched
here probably wouldn't hold

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.420
up in court today or
in the 19th century.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.780
But I hope that I've
convinced you that even

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.820
if the Dred Scott conspiracy
may not have happened,

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.030
it was certainly possible
that it could have happened,

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:19.560
given the realities of
federal, and particularly,

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.460
judicial politics in the 1850s.

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:26.210
of course, there are a number
of important implications

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.680
for how the judicial system
operated in the Civil War era

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.990
that go beyond Lincoln and
this conspiracy theory.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.640
And I'll just point out a few here.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.670
First, we have to stop thinking
about the Supreme Court as separate

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.250
from the rest of the federal
government in the 19th century.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:47.060
The judicial, executive and
legislative branches operated

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.490 position:56%
in cooperative and overlapping ways.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.170
Lincoln might have
been wrong that each

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.520
of these conspirators were
trying to nationalize slavery,

00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.140 position:56%
but he wasn't wrong that there was a
relatively free flowing conversation

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.480
happening among members of the
three branches about the future

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.130
of slavery in the nation.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:12.170 position:56%
Second, the federal judicial system
operated in fluid and informal ways.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.460
Judges and the lawyers
who tried cases in front

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.450 position:56%
of them often formed personal rather

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.210
than strictly business
relationships.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.900
Moreover, there was
little consistency either

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.970
in how the federal courts operated,
or in the personnel present

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.820
for federal cases at
the circuit level.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.120
In essence, the formality of
the legal system that we expect

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.580
in the 21st century
simply did not apply.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:42.680
Judges shaped the federal court
system to suit their needs.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.200
Finally, there is a
hint of elitism here.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.180
Or perhaps more than a hint.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:51.450
Members of the federal government
believed that they had answers

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.960
for what the United States
should look like going forward.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.170
In Dred Scott alone, these answers
included the future of slavery,

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:04.210
citizenship, property rights and
congressional power, among others.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:07.700 position:56%
The people who were making these
decisions were at the highest levels

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:12.720
of government, making policy in
private conversations and deals.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.240
This was not the popular democracy
we think of in the age of Jackson.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.920
Public opinion simply
did not factor in.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.800
And this is the last
piece of the puzzle

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.630 position:56%
that we haven't really talked about.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:29.210
How was Lincoln's conspiracy
charge actually received?

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.290
The evidence here is mixed.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.170
While some partisans
encouraged Lincoln

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:36.610
to continue making his conspiracy
charge throughout his campaign

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:41.030
against Douglas in 1858, Lincoln
had largely dropped the matter

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.430
by the third joint debate.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:46.870
Some scholars have taken this as
evidence that the voting public

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.090
in Illinois thought
Lincoln was delusional,

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.040
or at least unconvincing.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.700
And perhaps he was.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.620
Even if Lincoln had
intimate experience

00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:00.360
with the Supreme Court's political
role his audience might not have.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.310
The extent to which average
Americans understood the federal

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:07.470
court system and how it
operated is an open question.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.350
One that I hope to explore
further in my research.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.150
Thank you so much.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:24.040
[ Applause ]

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.340
&gt;&gt; ... a few questions,
so [inaudible].

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.410
&gt;&gt; Any questions?

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:51.880
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank
you very much.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:57.160
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Propositions
you make about political nature

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:03.000
of the interactions between
branches, the suggestion is that,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.010
that was then, and not now.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:10.250
And I wondered if you would,
I mean, if, for example,

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.610
your model is that
that's how it was then...

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:13.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.330
&gt;&gt; And it is pristine
and pure now...

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.630
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.930
I wouldn't say that...

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:21.120
&gt;&gt; But if it were, then I wonder
how the transition took place?

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.670
And if it's not, how far
along on the continuum is it?

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:27.230
&gt;&gt; That's a very good question.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:28.580
I'm going to.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.390
I'm going to be a little
bit hesitant to answer

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.380
because I'm a historian
of the 19th century,

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.710
and the 19th century is quite
different from the 21st century.

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:40.130
Certainly, a lot of this
stuff was happening well

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:41.470
into the 20th century.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.340
You still had, for example,
Supreme Court Justices running

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.010
for president in the FDR era.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:52.500
But, there clearly was
a change at some point.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:59.780
One reason for this is probably the
actual implementation of law school

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.060
as the sort-of starting
ground for all lawyers.

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:05.910
Some of it has to do with
sort-of our growing concern

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:10.260
about the Supreme Court and whether
it should be making certain kinds

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:14.430
of decisions, activist
judging and that kind of stuff.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:17.810
I think there's a lot more
political behavior that happens

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:19.950
on the Supreme Court
today, but that's more

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.800
as an observer than as a historian.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.700
I think there's, there's
a problem with thinking

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.150
about the Supreme Court as
separate, in large part,

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.800
because it was not
separate from the beginning.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.240
And so, if we have this originalist
interpretation of the court

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.200
as being this body that is
completely outside the bounds

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.600
of the rest of the
federal government,

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.930
we have a misunderstanding of the
way the court operated originally.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.860
I'm not sure the justices
think of it that way today.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.470
But certainly the public
does, as you suggested.

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:52.380
So, I'm sorry to not give you as
complete an answer as you'd like,

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.330
but as a 19th century historian,
I think I'd better stick

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:57.630
to my century [laughter].

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:19.970
&gt;&gt; It's not unusual to
the 19th century mind

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:26.620
to give out the slave power.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.740
&gt;&gt; Um-hum.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:38.670
&gt;&gt; If I knew that there was a
conspiracy implication involving

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:39.970
[inaudible] or slavery...

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:41.270
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:45.650
&gt;&gt; But the problem
with any conspiracy is

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.050
that think about the execution.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.810
And here you have volumes,

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:59.000
constantly bringing forth
the multi-member bodies.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.510 position:56%
So, assuming [inaudible] conspiracy,
was there any other [inaudible]

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:06.150
that Chief Justice Taney
and others were able to lean

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:11.980
on at last four other justices
to, in order to get a majority

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:17.570
in Dred Scott of 7 to 2,
McLean and Curtis dissenting.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:18.870
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.750
&gt;&gt; Assuming evidence of Taney an
others leaning on other justices

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.820
to get them to go along
with this conspiracy.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.900
&gt;&gt; Certainly that happened
in the case of Dred Scott.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.120
There was a move to try to
get the other justices to get

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.750
on board with Taney's opinion.

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.510
And that's pretty common
throughout the 19th century,

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:39.020
that a Chief Justice, in
particular, is going to try

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:43.640
to get the other members
of the court to be in line

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.330
with the majority opinion.

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:52.140
He wasn't actually as successful
with it as he would have liked,

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.590
because there are also
quite a few concurrences

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:55.890
in the Dred Scott decision.

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:57.410
It's not a matter of just,
oh, there's a decision,

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:58.710
and there are a couple of dissents.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.010
There is not a lot of
smoking gun evidence

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.310
about Taney getting
involved with congress

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:02.610
and putting pressure on congress.

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:03.910
But there were definitely
conversations happening.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.210
So, it depends what you
think of as pressure.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:06.510
There was at least an understanding
that this was something

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:07.810
that was open for discussion.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.110
I actually think Taney
mistakenly believed

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.410
that this would actually quiet
all of the furor that was going

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:11.710
on in the rest of the country
about the slave power conspiracy.

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:13.010
He thought, oh, the court's
going to rule, and shut it down.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:14.310
And they're not going to
talk about it anymore.

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:15.610
It did the exact opposite.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.910
But, that doesn't mean
his intentions weren't

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.210
in this one particular place.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:19.510
And I think that's just
a matter of him thinking

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:20.810
that the Supreme Court was as
important as he expected it to be

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.110
in making people listen
to what was going on.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.780
&gt;&gt; You mentioned Supreme Court
Justices running for president?

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.080
&gt;&gt; Um hum.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.140
&gt;&gt; In the FDR era, and
that was certainly true

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:39.220
of Charles Evans Hughes.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.190
&gt;&gt; Um hum.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:47.060
&gt;&gt; But he ran in 1916.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.980
&gt;&gt; Has any justice run
subsequent to that?

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.280
&gt;&gt; Not actively.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.830
This is not my specific area of
expertise but a lot of historians

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:57.230
of the Supreme Court and the 20th
century have said Hugo Black was

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.530
interested in running.

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:00.500
It's much more behind the
scenes than in the 19th century,

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.800
where it would have
been much more obvious

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.100
that someone like McLean
was running.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.400
But, certainly, there were
justices who were interested

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.700
in running for president.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:08.000
And working behind the scenes
to try to make it happen.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:22.630
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that Lincoln
appointed one Supreme Court Justice

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:25.900
in 1862.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:29.400
My question is, how
many did he appoint,

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:36.940
and can you talk a little bit about
what the confirmation process was

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:41.250
like in the 19th century?

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.020
&gt;&gt; Sure. Lincoln appointed
five, actually,

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.170
and was successful in all of these.

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:49.690
I bet you're surprised because
republicans controlled congress.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:54.790
The process was actually very
partisan in the 19th century also.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:58.970
Some of the best examples
of this are John Tyler,

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:02.320
who was president in
the early 1840s.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:05.700
We think of him as a
man without a party.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.700
He was vice president for
William Henry Harrison.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:12.610
And he was supposedly a Whig
but the Whigs hated him.

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:18.100
And he tried to get nine
Supreme Court Justices.

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:23.380
He tried a couple of times
with two different guys.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:27.520 position:56%
And he only was successful with one.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.860
It did not go well.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.670
And one of the justices
positions was open

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:36.170
for two years while he was
waiting for a nomination.

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:40.380
And the very best example of
this is Roger Taney himself,

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:44.040
who was put up for
Supreme Court Justice

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.060
in an associate justice position
by Andrew Jackson in 1835,

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.470
was basically not confirmed
by the senate at this time.

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:48.770
It was a hostile senate.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:50.070
Mostly people who were
opposed to Jackson.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.370
The next year, there's turnover.

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:52.670
Get a new democratic senate.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:53.970
And he puts Taney up for Chief
Justice, and it's confirmed.

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:55.270
So, that, the original
position that he was put up for,

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:56.570
associate justice, stayed open

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:57.870
for over a year while they
were waiting to fill that.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.170
And so, it is a very
partisan process.

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:00.470
And was in the 19th century.

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:02.770
Other questions?

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.310
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.930
&gt;&gt; Might not be true.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:15.000
If Lincoln were correct
about the conspiracy, was it,

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.040
would it have been illegal?

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.420
Would laws have been broken?

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.720
Or just unethical?

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.020
Or amoral?

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.320
Or what?

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.620
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.080
And this is sort of at
the heart of my research.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.370
Is to try to understand what was
considered ethically appropriate

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:31.940
in the 19th century.

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:36.170
And most of what happened
looks to be perfectly ethical

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:39.150
from the position of
most of the politicians

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.620
who were working in this period.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:47.250
It's all legal, but they saw it
as perfectly within the bounds.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.320
Whether this would
have been the reaction

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.440
of the public had they known really
what was going on, I'm not sure.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.150
That's harder to figure out because
there aren't a lot of examples

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.380
of it becoming public knowledge.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.370
So, we don't get a ton of outcry
about it, which means it's hard

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:06.780
to know what would happen
if it became more public.

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:11.140 position:56%
But certainly Taney in
particular, saw himself as perfectly

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:14.380
within the law and behaving
in perfectly ethical ways.

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:19.890
&gt;&gt; We have time for one more.

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.190
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] ok.

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:31.580
&gt;&gt; Hello. In your talk, there
was one [inaudible] line,

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:48.050 position:56%
about regardless of whether the
conspiracy actually existed, it's...

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:55.130
[inaudible].

00:55:55.130 --> 00:56:03.760 position:56%
Regardless of whether the conspiracy
actually existed, it seems,

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.510
the existence of conspiracy
seemed plausible

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:20.150
and therefore had political value
[inaudible] running for a position.

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:23.310
One reason, that to me is
the more interesting part

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:24.890
about the political value

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:30.940
of plausibility regardless
of the underlying facts.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.010
Wonder if you can talk
a little bit more

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:37.910
about what the political
value was, and wasn't,

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:39.240
and how that played out...

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.200
[inaudible] connections to
seriously curious today.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.500
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:43.800
&gt;&gt; I also...

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.100
&gt;&gt; Well, so, this is part of.

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.400
This fellow right here.

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.700
I appreciate mentioning
the Slave Power Conspiracy.

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.290
It was part of a tradition
right around this time

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.190
since the early 1850s to say

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:59.680
that there was a conspiracy among
slaveholders to perpetuate slavery,

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:04.870
to do all they could to
spread slavery to the north.

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:09.330
And so, Lincoln is
participating in this tradition.

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:12.500
This Slave Power Conspiracy
suggestion.

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:16.740
And it was very effective
among republican voters.

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.440
They were very worried about
losing their own liberty.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.280
They thought they were
going to lose their liberty

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:30.670
if slaveholders were able
to get control of the north.

00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:36.840
Lincoln actually later made several
references to another court case

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:39.170
where he called the
second Dred Scott.

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:43.690
Which was going though the New
York court system at this time.

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:45.120
Lemons v. The People.

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.420
Which was another case
that involved New York,

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.720
whether slaveholders could
bring their slaves to New York.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:49.480
And the New York legislature
had said no in 1841.

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.890
And this case was appealed
in the New York State Courts.

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:52.450
And the New York State Courts
had said no, it's totally fine

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.070
to ban slaveholders from bringing
their slaves into New York.

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.840
And Lincoln was afraid this was
going to get to the Supreme Court.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.340
So there would actually be a
case where northern states had

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.640
to allow slavery in their states.

00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.940
So, this is a situation where it
actually plays well to the fears

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:01.510
of northerners who think that our
state is free, our state allows me

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:02.810
to have the kind of
liberty that I want.

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:04.210
And now we're in a situation where
slaveholders might change that.

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:05.740
Because they're going to change
the circumstances on the ground.

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.040
It was a very powerful
argument at that time.

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.340
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you all very much.

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.440
