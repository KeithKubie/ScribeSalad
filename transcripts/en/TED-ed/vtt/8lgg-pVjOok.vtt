00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:10.805
A high forehead topped 
by disheveled black hair,

00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:12.553
a sickly pallor,

00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:16.609
and a look of deep intelligence 
and deeper exhaustion

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.049
in his dark, sunken eyes.

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:24.282
Edgar Allan Poe’s image 
is not just instantly recognizable –

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:27.310
it’s perfectly suited to his reputation.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.014
From the prisoner strapped 
under a descending pendulum blade,

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:34.951
to a raven who refuses 
to leave the narrator’s chamber,

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.390
Poe’s macabre and innovative stories 
of gothic horror

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.058
have left a timeless mark on literature.

00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:46.463
But just what is it that makes
Edgar Allan Poe

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.727
one of the greatest American authors?

00:00:48.727 --> 00:00:52.234
After all, horror was a popular
genre of the period,

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:54.286
with many practitioners.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:01:00.261
Yet Poe stood out thanks to his
careful attention to form and style.

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.584
As a literary critic,

00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:05.502
he identified two cardinal rules 
for the short story form:

00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:08.124
it must be short enough 
to read in one sitting,

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:11.697
and every word 
must contribute to its purpose.

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:13.380
By mastering these rules,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.547
Poe commands the reader’s attention

00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:19.864
and rewards them with an intense 
and singular experience –

00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:23.219
what Poe called the unity of effect.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.087
Though often frightening,
this effect goes far beyond fear.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.897
Poe’s stories use violence and horror
to explore the paradoxes and mysteries

00:01:31.897 --> 00:01:32.886
of love,

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:33.693
grief,

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:34.802
and guilt,

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:39.451
while resisting simple interpretations 
or clear moral messages.

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.075
And while they often hint 
at supernatural elements,

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:46.236
the true darkness they explore
is the human mind

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:49.029
and its propensity for self-destruction.

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.788
In “The Tell-Tale Heart,”
a ghastly murder

00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:55.964
is juxtaposed with the killer’s 
tender empathy towards the victim –

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:59.239
a connection that soon 
returns to haunt him.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.121
The title character of "Ligeia"
returns from the dead

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.968
through the corpse 
of her husband’s second wife –

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:09.543
or at least the opium-addicted 
narrator thinks she does.

00:02:09.543 --> 00:02:12.105
And when the protagonist 
of “William Wilson”

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:15.671
violently confronts a man 
he believes has been following him,

00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:19.515
he might just be staring 
at his own image in a mirror.

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:23.188
Through his pioneering use 
of unreliable narrators,

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:26.185
Poe turns readers into active participants

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:29.424
who must decide when a storyteller
might be misinterpreting

00:02:29.424 --> 00:02:33.181
or even lying about the events 
they’re relating.

00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:36.283
Although he’s best known 
for his short horror stories,

00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:38.805
Poe was actually one of the most versatile

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:42.268
and experimental writers 
of the nineteenth century.

00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:44.728
He invented the detective story 
as we know it,

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:46.857
with “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,”

00:02:46.857 --> 00:02:49.652
followed by “The Mystery of Marie Roget”

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:51.944
and “The Purloined Letter.”

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:54.854
All three feature 
the original armchair detective,

00:02:54.854 --> 00:02:56.898
C. Auguste Dupin,

00:02:56.898 --> 00:03:01.501
who uses his genius and unusual powers 
of observation and deduction

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:04.418
to solve crimes that baffle the police.

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:07.767
Poe also wrote satires of social 
and literary trends,

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:11.978
and hoaxes that in some cases 
anticipated science fiction.

00:03:11.978 --> 00:03:15.409
Those included an account of 
a balloon voyage to the moon,

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.306
and a report of a dying patient 
put into a hypnotic trance

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:22.233
so he could speak from the other side.

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:27.060
Poe even wrote an adventure novel 
about a voyage to the South Pole

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.319
and a treatise on astrophysics,

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.100
all while he worked as an editor,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.669
producing hundreds of pages 
of book reviews and literary theory.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:40.064
An appreciation of Poe’s career 
wouldn’t be complete without his poetry:

00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:42.179
haunting and hypnotic.

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:46.387
His best-known poems are songs of grief, 
or in his words,

00:03:46.387 --> 00:03:49.845
“mournful and never-ending remembrance.”

00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:53.632
“The Raven,” in which the speaker 
projects his grief onto a bird

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:56.043
who merely repeats a single sound,

00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:57.810
made Poe famous.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.694
But despite his literary success,

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:02.010
Poe lived in poverty 
throughout his career,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.920
and his personal life was often 
as dark as his writing.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.457
He was haunted by the loss of his mother 
and his wife,

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:13.054
who both died of tuberculosis 
at the age of 24.

00:04:13.054 --> 00:04:15.048
Poe struggled with alcoholism

00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:18.012
and frequently antagonized 
other popular writers.

00:04:18.012 --> 00:04:23.835
Much of his fame came from posthumous –
and very loose – adaptations of his work.

00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:28.064
And yet, if he could’ve known 
how much pleasure and inspiration

00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:32.569
his writing would bring to generations
of readers and writers alike,

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.717
perhaps it may have brought 
a smile to that famously brooding visage.
