00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.435
- [Instructor] So we're told
that Lynnette can wash 95 cars

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:05.176
in five days.

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:08.785
How many cars can
Lynnette wash in 11 days?

00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:10.217
So like always, pause this video

00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:12.755
and see if you can figure this out.

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:14.785
So the way that I would like to tackle it

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:18.952
is given the information they
gave us, 95 cars in five days,

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.760
can we figure out how many
cars she can wash per day?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.867
How many cars in one day?

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:27.755
And then we could just multiply that by 11

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:30.516
to figure out how many
she could wash in 11 days.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:33.099
So there's 95 cars in five days

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:39.115
and so instead of five,

00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:42.032
if we were to say one day, one day,

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.583
well, to go from five days to
one day, we divide by five.

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:48.869
So the number of cars
she can do in one day,

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:50.745
that would be that divided by five.

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:53.844
In either case, we would divide by five

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:55.995
and what's 95 divided by five?

00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:57.596
You might recognize that well, look,

00:00:57.596 --> 00:01:00.045
five times 20 is equal to 100.

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:02.462
So five times 19 is 95.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:06.460
So you might recognize
that's 19 cars in one day

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.868
or if that math I just did
seems a little bit too fast,

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.421
you could just take five into 95.

00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:15.366
Five goes into nine one
time, one times five is five,

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:19.888
subtract, nine minus five is
four, bring down that five,

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:23.969
five goes into 45 nine
times, nine times five is 45

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.216
and it goes in perfectly.

00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:26.296
There's no remainder.

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.432
So all I did is I divided
both of these numbers by five

00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:32.712
to figure out how many
she can wash per day.

00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:37.286
So she can wash 19 cars in
one day, 19 cars per day

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:38.496
and so if I wanna figure out

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:42.496
how many she can wash in
11 days, so in 11 days,

00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:47.637
well, now, I am just multiplying by 11.

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:51.804
So if I multiply 19 times
11, what am I going to get?

00:01:53.898 --> 00:01:55.856
Well, if you're good at
the mental mathematics,

00:01:55.856 --> 00:01:59.490
you might recognize 19
times 10 would be 190

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.737
and then you would have one more 19

00:02:01.737 --> 00:02:03.820
so that would be 209 cars

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:09.061
or you could just multiply 19 times 11.

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.978
One times 19 is 19 and
then one times 19 is 19.

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.793
Add 'em together, you get 209.

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.029
So she can wash 209 cars in 11 days.

00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:25.637
Let's do another example.

00:02:26.718 --> 00:02:30.885
Here, we are told at the market,
eight batteries cost $10.

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:34.558
How much do six batteries cost?

00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:37.419
Once again, pause this video
and try to figure it out.

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.388
Well, I'm gonna do the same technique.

00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:41.399
If eight batteries cost $10,

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.182
let's figure out how
much one battery costs.

00:02:44.182 --> 00:02:46.349
So one battery costs what?

00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:51.493
Figure that out.

00:02:51.493 --> 00:02:53.931
Well, it's going to be 1/8th.

00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:56.374
To go from eight to
one, I divide by eight.

00:02:56.374 --> 00:02:59.112
So what happens when I divide 10 by eight?

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.749
That's gonna be my per battery cost.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.916
So 10 divided by eight
is the same thing as 5/4

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:12.545
which is the same thing as one and 1/4

00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:14.875
which is the same thing if
we're talking in terms of money,

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:17.176
it might be more useful to write it like

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:19.404
one and 25 hundredths

00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:21.654
or one battery costs $1.25.

00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:26.352
And so when they're saying six batteries,

00:03:26.352 --> 00:03:28.598
how much do six batteries cost,

00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:32.181
well, if we're going
to six batteries cost,

00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:37.997
we're multiplying the number
of batteries times six now.

00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:40.726
So what's $1.25 times six?

00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:44.109
So it's gonna be $6 plus another $1.50

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.723
'cause six times 25 is 150.

00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:49.333
So it's gonna be $7.50

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.297
and just to make sure the
math I just did was right,

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.880
let's multiply $1.25 times six.

00:03:55.548 --> 00:03:57.424
Six times five is 30.

00:03:57.424 --> 00:04:00.811
Six times two is 12 plus three is 15.

00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:03.180
Six times one is six plus one is seven

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.036
and we have a total of two
digits behind the decimal

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:08.860
so there you have it, you have $7.50.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.839
Now, there's other ways
that you could tackle this.

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.004
You could say that hey, this is,

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:16.530
six batteries is gonna cost 6/8ths

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.123
as much as eight batteries

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:20.369
but that's a little bit
confusing, at least for my brain.

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:23.063
I like to go just down to
the unit cost you could say,

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:26.298
the cost per battery and
then multiply it by six.

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:29.742
It gives me more comfort in
understanding what I'm doing.
