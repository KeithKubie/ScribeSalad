&gt;&gt; Jon:  WELCOME BACK.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:09.475 line:91%
LAST WEEK, WE DID-- LAST WEEK, I
THOUGHT A VERY NICE PIECE ON THE

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:14.113 line:91%
SHOW ABOUT HOW FOX NEWS WANTED
PEOPLE TO APOLOGIZE FOR RUSHING

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.115 size:84% position:42% line:91%
TO JUDGMENT ON THE FERGUSON
SHOOTING OF MICHAEL BROWN.

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.017 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND SO WE I THINK QUITE CLEVERLY
DREW AN ANALOGY TO THAT

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.022 line:91%
AND THEIR RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON
BENGHAZI, IT WAS REALLY QUITE

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.056 align:start position:0% line:85%
DROLL.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.293 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW WHILE FOX NEVER ADDRESSED
OUR BENGHAZI POINT,

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:28.661 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
IT APPEARS NOW THEY'RE ASKING
FOR MORE THAN AN APOLOGY.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:32.398 line:91%
&gt;&gt; PETE WILLIAMS, TO HIS CREDIT,
GOT THAT BOSTON MARATHON TERROR

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.599 align:start position:0% line:85%
REPORTING DEAD ON.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:37.804 line:91%
AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAILED
HIM AS A HERO FOR GETTING IT

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.272 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT, WHICH HE DID.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.740 line:85%
FOX NEWS GOT THIS CASE RIGHT.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.942 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOX NEWS, NOT JUST ME.

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:46.913 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEAN HANNITY HAD A LOT OF
SEGMENTS, PLUS O'REILLY HAD A

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:51.084 line:85%
LOT OF SEGMENTS, URGING CAUTION.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:55.755 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOULD THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER
HAIL THEM AS HEROES LIKE WE

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.256 size:81% position:41% line:85%
HEARD ABOUT PETE WILLIAMS?

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.928 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, WHY DOESN'T FOX
GET AS MUCH CREDIT AS-- WHO'S

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:02.862 align:start position:0% line:85%
PETE WILLIAMS?

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.564 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS, IT WASN'T

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.065 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE FIRST TIME THEY GOT IT
RIGHT.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:10.303 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I URGED CAUTION IN THE DUKE
COVERAGE, AND IN THE TRAYVON

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.238 align:start position:0% line:91%
MARTIN COVERAGE, AND NOW THIS
COVERAGE.

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.139 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THAT'S THREE TIMES.

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.942 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY GOT IT RIGHT THREE TIMES IN
10 YEARS.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:20.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
THOSE ARE SOLAR ECLIPSE NUMBERS,
PEOPLE, WHICH I THINK IS WHY

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:25.184 line:91%
IT'S RECOMMENDED YOU ONLY WATCH
FOX THROUGH A TINY PINHOLE POKED

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:26.752 size:75% position:38% line:85%
IN A PIECE OF CARDBOARD.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.521 line:85%
YOU CAN'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT FOX.

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:31.524 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WILL INDELIBLY BURN YOUR
SOUL.

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:35.394 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHILE OF COURSE THE WHOLE
RUSH TO JUDGMENT COMPLAINT IS

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:38.197 size:78% position:39% line:91%
( BLEEP ), FOX IS NOTHING
BUT A RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
ALMOST EVERY SITUATION.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.001 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.871 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE THE CAUTION AND SOBER
REFLECTION NETWORK.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.773 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT MY FAVORITE PART OF THE

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:50.643 line:91%
PIECE WAS AFTER 10 MINUTES OF
COMPLAINING THAT NO ONE WOULD

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:51.877 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVER THANK THEM, THIS.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:55.381 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE WAITING FOR THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA TO SAY NOT ONLY

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:58.217 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THAT WE WERE WRONG IN THIS
RACIALLY CHARGED CASE THAT

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.521 size:88% position:44% line:91%
RESULTED IN SO MUCH VIOLENCE
IN THAT TOWN AND TO CREDIT

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.221 line:91%
FOX NEWS FOR BEING RIGHT,
YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD YOUR

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.123 size:78% position:39%
BREATH A LONG TIME.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:06.959 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM.

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:08.093 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Jon:  RIGHT, YOU DON'T

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.731 size:88% position:44% line:91%
CARE, IN THE SAME WAY MY MOM
DOESN'T CARE IF I EVER CALL.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:15.067 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
SURE, CALL OR NOT.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.370 align:start position:0% line:91%
I COULD JUST SIT HERE AND DIE. 
( LAUGHTER )

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:23.209 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE POINT IS, THE POINT IS
YOU WERE RIGHT,

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:26.312 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THAT IS NEWSWORTHY
WHEN FOX IS RIGHT.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.047 size:81% position:41% line:85%
AND CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:37.456 line:91%
SO TO HONOR THAT TIME YOU WERE
RIGHT, WE GOT YOU A FUDGIE THE

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.590 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHALE.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:43.162 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW WHY, WE THINK

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.831 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YOU'RE A WHALE OF A NETWORK!

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:49.769 line:91%
IN THAT WE'VE BEEN CHASING YOU
OUR WHOLE LIVES AND JUST CAN'T

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:50.369 align:start position:0% line:85%
KILL YOU.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.471 size:75% position:38% line:85%
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL, FOX.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:56.175 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN HONOR OF THIS SINGULAR
ACHIEVEMENT OF YOU BEING RIGHT,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:03:03.749 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD HAS SOMETHING
THEY'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU.

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:04.950 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOLLYWOOD.

00:03:04.983 --> 00:03:10.623 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M GEORGE LUCUS AND I'M HERE
TO ASSURE YOU THAT I AM ONLY

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.291 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
GOING TO MAKE MOVIES FROM NOW

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:16.229 size:75% position:38%
UNCRITICAL OF AMERICA.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.296 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE "THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,
JUSTIFIABLY".

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.931 align:start position:0% line:91%
"AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM
GRAFFITI."

AND "THE CLINTON MENACE."

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:28.641 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOX NEWS, MAY YOU LIVE LONG AND
PROSPER.

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.810 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAIT, I DIDN'T WRITE THAT, DID
I?

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.613 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SORRY. BUT THE TRUTH IS
THIS--

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:37.984 align:start position:0% line:91%
( APPLAUSE )
FOX, WE CAN SEND YOU ALL THE

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.820 align:start position:0% line:91%
CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES AND
PRAISE WE CAN MUSTER, BUT IT'S

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:47.426 line:91%
REALLY JUST GOING TO PALE IN
COMPARISON TO HOW YOUR BIGGEST

FANS FEEL ABOUT YOU, AND
