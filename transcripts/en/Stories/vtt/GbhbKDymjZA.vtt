00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.040
NARRATOR: It's fair to
say that the relationship

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.589
between the United States
and Russia is tense at best.

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.380
Throughout their history,
the two countries

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.020
have been both
allies and enemies.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.320
During the Cold War, the
US and the Soviet Union

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.860
were locked in an intense battle
that very nearly culminated

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.570
in nuclear war.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.900
Thankfully, it didn't.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.842
And in 1991, the Soviet Union
collapsed, ending the Cold War.

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.800
KSENIA YURKOVA: It's been
more than two decades

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.760
since the Soviet era ended.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.320
Russia and its people
have moved on--

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.650
well, except for
towns like this.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.620
Zarechny, its former
name was Penza-19.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.460
It's one of the 44
last remaining closed

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.140
cities left in Russia.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.690
Under Communism, it was
not even shown on the map,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.080
and freedom of movement
was heavily restricted.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.930
NARRATOR: That's Ksenia
Yurkova, a Russian photographer

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.800
who visited Zarechny, a closed
city southeast of Moscow.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.140
Now you're probably wondering
what a closed city is.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.300
Throughout the Cold
War, the Soviet Union

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.020
created 44 cities that were
kept secret from the world.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.070
These cities were dedicated to
making weaponry, specifically

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.960
nuclear bombs.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.160
The USSR was trying
to play catch-up

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.432
because in 1945, this happened.

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:15.390
REPORTER: The bomb was
exploded above the city,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.324
and in the towering mushroom,
Japan could read its doom.

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:20.740
NARRATOR: The
American detonations

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.970
in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki kick-started

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.320
an arms race between
the US and Soviets

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.220
that would last for decades.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.290
But the USSR didn't want
anyone knowing where

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.950
they were building their bombs.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.660
So they created cities
that were, at the time,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.290
impossible to find.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.480
Secret cities likes
Zarechny existed

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.820
to make weapons without
interruption or interference.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.380
But now, long after the Cold War
has ended, many of these cities

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.900
remain isolated, not just
from the rest of the world,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.710
but from the rest
of the country, too.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.090
KSENIA YURKOVA: The
city's 62,000 inhabitants

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.860
live encircled by a
fence of barbed wire.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.850
They easily can leave the
city, but their guests

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.600
are allowed to visit only after
they obtain the invitation

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.880
from the locals, and only if it
is approved by the authorities.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.826
The city is
beginning to open up,

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:14.450
but there are still parts of it
that are completely blocked off

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.430
from outsiders like Ksenia.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.450
Today, Zarechny is still full
of out-of-bounds areas, most

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.130
notably Rose Autumn, the
state-owned corporation

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.630
to manufacture parts
for nuclear weapons.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.340
Most of inhabitants
work on the main plant,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.345
and help others connected
to that industry.

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:37.470
NARRATOR: Although work
here doesn't pay very well,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.990
the work is steady,
food is cheap.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.940
And although there's
not much else to do,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.420
the local government does
provide some social programs

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.270
to keep the community happy.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.700
Some commentators have
even described Zarechny

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.960
as a kind of
socialist wonderland,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.760
a relic of the Soviet era.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.500
Even so, in recent years,
some youth in the city

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.630
have expressed their desire
to leave, or at the very least

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.410
to have more freedom.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.840
When Ksenia visited
the city, it was clear

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.480
that residents
were still subject

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.726
to the local government.

00:03:05.726 --> 00:03:07.100
KSENIA YURKOVA:
People seem to be

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.850
not so free in their decisions.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.820
It was rather visible
during the official parade

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.860
to due to anniversary
celebration,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.230
when the most of workers
were forced to take part.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.440
NARRATOR: In a lot of
ways living in Zarechny

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.180
really is like living in a
time capsule of Soviet life.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.820
The people here
face restrictions

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.070
on their movements,
on their work,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.480
and even on how they socialize.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.630
But maybe residing
in this bubble,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.170
away from the problems
of the wider world,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.150
does mean that life is somewhat
easier, if a little dull.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.270
KSENIA YURKOVA: The main
Russian political agenda

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.820
transmitted by mass media is
absolutely imperceptible here.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.290
There is no attention to
the problems of immigrants,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.820
external state policy,
minorities, gay prides,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.600
and so forth.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.650
The daily routine doesn't
assume any fluctuations.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.750
Life is safe, measured,
and tranquil, even sleepy.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.350
The inheritance of the
previous Soviet era.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.400
NARRATOR: The Soviet era
was a tumultuous time

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.430
outside of Russia as well.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.730
Our latest video takes
a look at the long road

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.279
to independence for
the Czech Republic.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.269
Check that out now.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.970
MAN: You can imagine how
transfixed I was by the news

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.050
when I started to hear
about demonstrations

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
against the Communist
regime in the fall of 1989.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.730
NARRATOR: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.450
Thanks for watching.
