00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.460
 When you browse for the latest dating apps, have you stopped a little and wondered 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.260
 "Why many people have a beautiful appearance of harmony?" 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.460
 Well, it turns out there is a simple explanation for this phenomenon. 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.200
 If we make a diagram showing the relationship between kindness and beautiful appearance, we can show the answer. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.020
 First, we have to assume that people are distributed equally across this scheme. 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.480
 In other words, some people here are ugly and ugly 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 Some people are ugly and kind 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.840
 Some are beautiful looking and lame, 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.120
 Some are nice looking and nice! 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.060
 Of course, this depends on your personal taste and what you see beautiful or ugly. 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.020
 Now: when you think about it, your interest is probably zero for people you find to be bad and ugly 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.800
 Which means that your probability circle has become smaller. 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.480
 Frankly, you may prefer a specific combination of beauty and kindness. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 In the end, we left a group of people who found them acceptable and showed interest from the beginning. 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.750
 But now, 100% of the people who stayed in the group who do not find them attractive 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.319
 They are nice 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.440
 They have to be, otherwise you will not be interested. 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.700
 After all, if a person is nice, your criticism will probably decrease, 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.440
 Lowering your average beauty standard. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.220
 Similarly, nearly half of the people you find beautiful are harmonious. 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.840
 Similarly, if a person is a person, 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.060
 You will probably need to be very attractive to you to give them any attention, 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.760
 Making it seem as if all the people are attractive 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 They are harmoniously. 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.040
 If we look further we can assume that people who are beautiful and nice of luck are present 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.140
 And disappear from the market quickly, 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.320
 Increasing your awareness and bias. 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.800
 We can see something similar to this for food 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.620
 Have you ever wondered why the taste of healthy eating does not seem delicious? 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.400
 Well let's use our chart 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.300
 Pleasure versus health 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.280
 Of course, in fact, foods will not be distributed equally in the scheme, 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.290
 Because food is usually made to be savory, 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.190
 So the right part of the chart will look more dense. 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.120
 Regardless, we can remove all foods that have no taste or even benefit for you 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.600
 The reason - why bother to eat them? 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.160
 But among the foods that I have eaten and eaten, 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.960
 Now 100% of non-tasty food is beneficial to you! 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.420
 Just as in the dating scheme, 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.220
 It is only because of people or food 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.859
 Which does not give him any attention you have become distorted. 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.619
 Referring to dating, this is true. 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.219
 From your point of view, people with a beautiful appearance are likely to be harmonious - 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.000
 But because of who gives him attention from the beginning! 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.060
 You simply ignore the ugly harmony. 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.930
