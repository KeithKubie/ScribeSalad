00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.229
- [Voiceover] Mrs. Henry's
class has 64 crayons.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.100
At the end of the year

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.387
only 31 crayons remain.

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:12.463
How many crayons have been used?

00:00:12.463 --> 00:00:13.479
And they give us a picture here.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.487
So, the beginning of the
year, this is 64 crayons.

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:18.761
Six tens and four ones.

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.582
One, two, three, four, five, six tens,

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:24.353
and one, two, three, four ones.

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:26.589
So this is 64 at the
beginning of the year,

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.828
and at the end of the year

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:29.799
only 31 crayons remain.

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.500
Well, 31 is three tens and one one.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.658
Three tens.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.630
One ten, two tens, three tens,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.092
and one one.

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:39.307
So how many have been used?

00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:43.025
And try to pause the video
and try it on your own.

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.818
All right, I assume you have tried it.

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:47.266
Let's do it together.

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:48.912
So there's a couple of ways to do it.

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:51.533
If we didn't have the picture here,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.590
we would say all right,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.283
she started, her class
started with 64 crayons,

00:00:57.283 --> 00:01:00.119
they used some, so if we are using crayons

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.638
that would kind of
subtract the crayons away.

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:04.791
So if you're using some crayons,

00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:07.535
you would subtract some number from 64,

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:09.303
so I'm just gonna put a blank here.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:12.390
So 64 minus the number that are used

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.195
is going to be equal to
the number that remain.

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.348
So this is going to be
equal to what's left over,

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:21.073
and they tell us that 31 crayons remain.

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:22.556
31 crayons remain.

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:25.318
So, we need to figure out what's here?

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.112
What is this blank?

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:28.448
64 minus blank is 31.

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:31.211
Well, if 64 minus blank is 31,

00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:33.750
then I can swap the 31 and the blank.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.986
That means that 64 minus 31

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:40.478
is going to be equal to blank.

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:44.908
That means that 64 minus 31

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.423
is going to be equal to blank.

00:01:52.423 --> 00:01:54.064
How did I do that?

00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:55.404
How do I think about that?

00:01:55.404 --> 00:01:57.213
Well, imagine 64 things.

00:01:57.213 --> 00:02:01.131
So if this block represents 64.

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:02.976
So this is 64,

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.785
just like that,

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:07.948
and if this is 31,

00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:14.324
and then this is our blank.

00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:15.842
We know that the blank,

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:18.483
so I could put a question
mark here if I like.

00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:19.784
I could put a question mark.

00:02:19.784 --> 00:02:21.388
So this is the question mark.

00:02:21.388 --> 00:02:24.172
So we know that 64 minus the question mark

00:02:24.172 --> 00:02:25.636
would be 31.

00:02:25.636 --> 00:02:29.319
Or that 31 plus question mark would be 64.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.259
Or that 64 minus 31 is going to get us

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.460
the question mark right over here.

00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:36.619
So we just have to figure out

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.158
what 64 minus 31 is.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:40.885
And let's do that.

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.262
Let's do that right over here.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:46.676
So 64 minus 31,

00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:52.478
and it's going to be equal to,

00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:53.757
so let's look at that ones place.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.485
Four ones minus one one

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:57.537
is going to be three ones.

00:02:57.537 --> 00:03:00.136
Six tens minus three tens

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:02.677
is three tens.

00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:04.965
So the blank is 33.

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:05.940
And you could check that,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.866
64 minus 33 is 31.

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:12.543
Or 64 minus 31 is 33.

00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:15.611
So 33 crayons have been used.

00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.988
Now since they made this
neat picture for us,

00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:20.406
we actually could have
just used the picture.

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:21.618
How would we have done that?

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.427
Well, this is what they started with.

00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:24.523
This is the 64.

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:25.924
Six tens.

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:29.480
One, two, three, four, five, six tens,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.284
and one, two, three, four ones.

00:03:32.284 --> 00:03:33.382
So 64,

00:03:33.382 --> 00:03:35.548
and they end up with 31.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.205
So how many of the tens do we use up

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:38.892
to go from what we started with

00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:40.273
to what we finish with?

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:42.670
Well, we end up using, let's see,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.335
there's only three tens here.

00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:45.982
There were six tens here.

00:03:45.982 --> 00:03:49.863
So we used one, two, three tens.

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:53.073
So we used up three tens.

00:03:53.073 --> 00:03:55.124
And how many ones do we use up?

00:03:55.124 --> 00:03:56.628
Well, we have four ones here,

00:03:56.628 --> 00:03:58.355
and we only have one right over here.

00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:00.631
So we use up three ones.

00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:03.457
We used up three ones.

00:04:03.457 --> 00:04:05.367
If you take away these three tens,

00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:06.546
and these three ones,

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.495
you'll be left with the
same number of crayons

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:10.175
that we have at the end of the year.

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:12.085
So we use up three, I guess you could say,

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.824
we used up three ten packs,

00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:16.099
and we used up three ones.

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.236
So what's that going to be?

00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:19.065
Well, three tens plus three ones

00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:22.534
is 33.
