00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:10.940
Why are Cashews Not Sold to Consumers in Their
Shells?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.950
Cashews are a member of the same family as
poison ivy, Anacardiaceae.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.489
Like poison ivy and many other members of
the family, part of the cashew plant contains

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:24.499
an oily chemical called urushiol, which is
a strong irritant for most people and can

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.109
even be fatal for some if ingested.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.800
In cashews, the urushiol is found not only
in the leaves, but also in a layer of oil

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.610
between the shell and the cashew seed.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.320
Needless to say, shelling cashews is something
that needs to be done very carefully and not

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.500
by consumers.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.720
Despite the need for care in shelling cashews,
it’s still often done by hand, much to the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.640
chagrin of the workers involved, particularly
in poorer nations where safety equipment is

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.970
often lacking.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.760
From the above, you might be wondering why
you can purchase raw cashews.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.720
It turns out, even so-called “raw” cashews
are not actually raw.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.809
Eating true raw, unprocessed cashew seeds
would result in you ingesting some of this

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.969
urushiol, which, as mentioned, can potentially
be fatal.

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.649
Thus, the seeds must either be roasted at
high temperatures to destroy the offending

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.530
oil or, in the case of “raw” cashews,
usually steamed and/or boiled in oils.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.012
Unlike many seeds, the cashew seed grows on
the outside of the fruit itself as you can

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:26.179
see from the above picture, making it a “false
fruit” or “accessory fruit.”

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.189
The fruit, known as a cashew apple, is actually
very good to eat, but is not widely consumed

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.829
outside of areas it is grown in due to the
fact that it’s not easy to transport because

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:56.079
of its extremely fragile skin.
