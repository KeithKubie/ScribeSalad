00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.110
- Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.270
My name is Yukio Lippit.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.680
I'm the faculty director of the
arts at the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.180
and a co-organizer
of this conference.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.650
And it's my pleasure
to welcome you

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.560
to the final panel of
today's conference,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.670
which is titled "Gender,
Media, and Popular Culture."

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.920
We have a terrific
group of speakers

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.740
that are going to address a
complex nexus of problems.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.150
And we have the
perfect moderator

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.030
to introduce and moderate them,
professor Mary Jo Kane, whose

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.920
full biography is listed in
the booklet, the conference

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.420
booklet.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.080
But I'll just say here she is
professor of sports sociology

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.290
and the director
of a unique center,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.470
the Tucker Center for
Research on Girls and Women

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.960
in Sports, at the University
of Minnesota, which

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.000
she had a hand in founding.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.660
Her list of publications on the
subject of sports in society

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.950
is extensive.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.710
And her contributions to
sports education in general

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.690
are really immense
and multifaceted.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.150
All of us, as
educators at Radcliffe,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.860
hold her in the highest regard.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.750
So without further ado,
I'd like to introduce

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.005
Mary Jo Kane and the panelists.

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.100
- Before I begin
my final remarks,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.890
I want to say that over 30 years
of being in higher education

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.780
and going to countless
conferences--

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.090
and as the director
of the Tucker Center,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.250
hosting a few
conferences myself--

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.380
I know event management.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.850
And I just have to say that I
told this to Becky last night.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.970
When you come here to
the Radcliffe Institute

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.900
for Advanced Study at Harvard
University as an outsider,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.450
you are dealing with the A team.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.746
So how about a round of
applause for all those folks.

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:47.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.970
The opening sentence on the
invitation to this conference

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.460
reads as follows: the
degree to which sports

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.100
permeate societies has
never been greater,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.500
making it a revealing lens
through which to understand

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.312
many contemporary issues.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:04.770
The contemporary
issues that we are

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.150
going to examine this afternoon
is sport, media, and gender.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.550
I'll set the stage with a
general critique of what sport

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.700
media scholarship has produced
over the last 40 years

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.920
regarding media
representations and how

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.830
they impact the way we
think about female athletes,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.350
as part of a larger
critical analysis regarding

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.250
sport, gender, and power
in the post Title IX era.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.074
My remarks will be followed
by Professor Mike Messner, who

00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:30.990
is a sociologist at the
University of Southern

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.420
California, who
will discuss change

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.960
and continuity in the coverage
of men's and women's sports.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.570
Mike's remarks will be followed
next by Professor Rachael

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.200
Joo, who is in American
Studies at Middlebury College.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.810
And she will discuss how
female golfers are represented

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.600
in U.S. And Korean media, while
exploring links among gender,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.300
race, and nationalism.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.990
Finally, Kavitha
Davidson, from espnW,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.850
will highlight the
decisions the media make

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.520
that affect representations
of women's sports,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.710
ranging from which
sports they cover to how

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.389
they frame that coverage.

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.680
And then we all know the drill.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.760
After we're done, I'll lead
us and have the panel members

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.320
talk for about 15 minutes.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.700
And then we will open
it up for a public Q&amp;A.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.010
Over the last four decades,
sport media scholars

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.440
have amassed an increasingly
sophisticated body

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.630
of knowledge regarding
the symbiotic connections

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.740
among sport, gender, and power.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.710
We moved beyond
descriptive content

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.140
analysis-driven
studies, which examined

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.140
the frequency of coverage given
to women's and men's sports,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.720
to scholarly lines of
inquiry that were grounded

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.940
in critical feminist theory.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.830
This particular
analytic framework

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.450
argues that society
is structured

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.870
around a series of inequitable
relationships of power

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.410
where women are systematically
devalued and marginalized.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.230
We made the empirical
and theoretical case

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.680
that sports serve as an ideal
site for the connections

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.370
between gender and power because
sport vigilantly maintains

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.250
gender as hierarchically
ordered, but more

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.310
importantly grounded
in the physical body

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.740
and thus perceived
as biologically,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.960
meaning inherently, based.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.630
We also argue that media
representations play a critical

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.060
role in perpetuating
these notions

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.180
of a biologically-based,
gendered hierarchy--

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.992
where in spite of
the enormous progress

00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:20.200
that has been made two
generations removed from Title

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.290
IX, women remain
second-class citizens in one

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.620
of the most powerful economic,
social, and political

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.630
institutions on this planet.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.170
In some, as Mike Messner has
insightfully pointed out,

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.770
female athletes and media
representations of their body

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.327
became and remain
contested terrain.

00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:42.910
Let me just take a
few minutes to talk

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.250
about what we, as
sport media scholars,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.590
have amassed again over
the last forty years.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.290
And we've found two
overarching patterns

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.110
of media representations
given to women's sports.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.800
First, female athletes are
significantly underrepresented

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.640
in that, for example, even
though 43% of all scholarship

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.970
athletes in college sports
nationwide are women,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.540
they receive only about 2%
to 4% of overall coverage

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.050
across the vast and ubiquitous
sport media landscape.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.300
And Mike Messner's work,
his longitudinal work,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.620
will point that out.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.740
Second, within this
coverage, female athletes

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.350
are significantly
more likely than males

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.070
to be portrayed off the court,
out of uniform, and in highly

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.780
sexualized poses.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.520
Let me just give you
a couple of examples

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.700
of what I mean by that.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.050
That's also Lindsey Vonn.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.170
And next, from the
team sport of soccer.

00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:55.960
And then look at how
you feel when you

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.126
see that they're juxtaposed.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.430
So let me close by
highlighting the impacts

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.290
of these kinds of images.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.880
I began my remarks
by pointing out

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.340
that sports serves as a
critical site for reproducing

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.710
notions of gender and
power differences.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.350
But what is often overlooked--
and this is absolutely

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.780
essential for any
analysis going forward--

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.810
is how sports can also
serve as a critical site

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.680
for subverting these very
ideologies and practices.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.140
When media images and
narratives emphasize women

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.260
as highly skilled and
physically powerful athletes,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.440
they are directly
challenging and profoundly

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.630
threatening to
belief systems that

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.220
have and continue to relegate
sports women to the sidelines.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.570
And that is because when we
sexualize female athletes,

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.320
it takes away from an incredibly
powerful and reaffirming moment

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.720
of women's physical
capacities and turn it

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.420
into something that is
a moment of triviality

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.040
and marginalization.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.900
I would suggest to
you that until we

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.370
see a plethora of images that
reflect the reality of women's

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.580
participation, they will
never receive the full respect

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.970
and admiration that they
not only richly deserve,

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.350
but that they have also earned.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.850
Thank you.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.540
- Thank you very
much for inviting me.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.230
And I echo what Mary
Jo and other people

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.490
have all been saying about how
wonderfully organized this day

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.040
has been and how fabulous the
previous sessions have been.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.700
My comments will build on,
I think, and possibly echo

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.120
some of the points that were
made earlier this morning.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.390
It's great especially--
I just want to mention--

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.490
as a former basketball
player and someone

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.110
who loves basketball still,
to be in this building.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.470
It's fun to imagine
this as a place

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.120
where basketball
was once played.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.620
And to sort of hear
the echoes of the ball

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.290
slapping on the
wood floors here,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.420
I really love that sense
of history as well.

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:06.860
I wanted to start with
a little anecdote.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.970
I'm going to talk about more
longitudinal study of sports

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.410
media that I've
been involved in.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.743
But I wanted to start with
an anecdote that kind of sets

00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:18.350
the stage for me that
happened just a few days ago.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.090
I live in South
Pasadena, California,

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.660
and I do my grocery shopping at
a grocery store called Ralphs.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.450
And often when I'm at
the checkout stand,

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.740
people are talking sports.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.810
And some of the
checkers sometimes

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.200
will all dress in football
jerseys during the Super Bowl.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.607
Or they'll be talking
about USC and UCLA.

00:08:35.607 --> 00:08:36.940
Who's going to win the big game?

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.523
And if it's basketball
season, they're

00:08:38.523 --> 00:08:40.190
always talking about the men.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.789
And so I will sometimes say to
one of the checkers, well yeah,

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.314
I like the UCLA and USC rivalry.

00:08:46.314 --> 00:08:48.230
But I'm really interested
in the women's game.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.420
I go to all of the USC
women's basketball games.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.050
And usually that comment
falls pretty flat.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.260
And "oh" is kind of
the usual answer.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.640
And then they give me my change.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.431
I was standing there,
though, the other day

00:09:00.431 --> 00:09:03.810
after the semifinals of
the women's tournament.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.620
And in the checkstand
behind me, I

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.320
heard this man saying
to the checker,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.144
did you see that game yesterday?

00:09:11.144 --> 00:09:13.560
I thought he was going to be
talking about something else.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.018
But it was the game
that I watched.

00:09:15.018 --> 00:09:17.570
He said, that little
Morgan William just nailed

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.420
that shot and just put
the dagger in UConn.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.670
And then the checker said,
yeah, I watched that.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.230
That was so great, wasn't it?

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.460
And then I think I hurt my
neck whiplashing around.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.380
I want to get into
this conversation.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.370
I said, yeah, wasn't that great?

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.060
She was so awesome, but even
more so in the game before

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.420
against Baylor where she hit 41.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.430
And one of them had watched that
too, and we bonded around that.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:45.200
And I thought, wow, this
is quite an amazing moment.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.260
And I think it's
a sign of change.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.320
One anecdote, but
it's a sign of change

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.740
that reflects the fact
that women's basketball--

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.770
not just the final four, but
throughout the regular season

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.015
now we can watch women's
basketball on television.

00:10:00.015 --> 00:10:01.640
Where I live, there's
a Pac-12 network.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.650
We can watch regular
season games,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.960
which helps to build
a storyline that

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.110
creates an interest
and a fan base for when

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.030
the final four happens.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.540
20 or 30 years ago, if
you watched the final four

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.300
for the women, it would have
been a tape delay, really poor

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.520
production values,
with no opportunity

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.910
to watch regular season games.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.290
And it's like it's dropping
in from Mars into your living

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.790
room.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.464
So now, it's quite a
different experience.

00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:29.630
On the other hand, I think
all the things that we've

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.460
heard today, and
some of the data

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.190
that I'll give you
in a moment, suggest

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.920
that it's not quite time for
the feminist victory lap.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.420
I've been working with some
colleagues around this idea

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.635
that instead of thinking
of the social changes that

00:10:48.635 --> 00:10:50.260
have taken place over
the last 30 years

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.570
in sport and in other
parts of our society,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.349
we've neither
experienced a revolution

00:10:54.349 --> 00:10:56.640
nor have we experienced this
sort of stalled revolution

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.630
that some people
are talking about.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.950
But really instead
we're experiencing

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:08.920
what I call social change
that is incomplete.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.030
And many of these sort of
bullets you see up here

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.370
are repeating things that
have been said today.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.710
But in youth sport, an
area that I've studied,

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.930
there's been this
huge boom of girls.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.120
And yet there is this continued
inequities in sex segregation

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.700
and other parts of youth
sports that really have not yet

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.520
transformed.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.670
In particular, the
new research that's

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:38.130
developing on transgender kids
and their families struggle

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.710
to get into a binary
divided youth sports system.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.740
Sports leadership, as several
people have pointed out today,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.450
at the high school
and college level

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.360
is still largely in male hands--

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.450
athletic directors,
head coaches.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.310
And in the media,
we see an expansion,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.590
as I said, in some areas, like
the coverage of women's hoops,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.630
which I really applaud as a fan.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.760
But on the other
hand, we see still

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.640
continued silences and
poor quality coverage

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.850
of women's sports.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.220
So I'm really kind of
interested in understanding

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.050
that unevenness
of social change--

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.090
why and how social
change happens

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.930
more rapidly in some sectors
and not so much in others.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.000
And sports media is
just one of the places I

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.060
think we can think about that.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.460
I'm going to talk about a study
that a couple of people here

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.830
today, Donna Lopiano and
others, have referenced

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.200
that I've done over the years.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.510
It's a 25-year study now.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.790
We're going to do
it again in 2019.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.720
Most recently, I did
it with Cheryl Cooky

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.310
and my graduate
student, Michela Musto.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.310
And the citation
for that is on here.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.000
You can download that on
communication and sport

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.440
website.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.730
And it's basically a
study that started.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.740
And it was first
sponsored by what

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.990
was then called the Amateur
Athletic Foundation of Los

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.260
Angeles, later LA84 Foundation,
that Anita DeFrantz, who

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.955
you met this morning,
was the president

00:13:06.955 --> 00:13:09.460
of for many, many years.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.970
And it started out as a study,
a content analysis basically,

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.650
of the three network affiliate
news stations early evening

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.310
and late night news shows.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.829
And then a little bit later,
we added ESPN SportsCenter

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:27.370
because we realized people were
getting a lot of their sports

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.750
news from SportsCenter.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.280
Next time we do it,
we're determined

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.390
to add one more thing.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.000
And I think it's
because we're learning

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.770
that younger people,
especially, are

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.920
getting a lot of their
sports information online.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.290
And so what's the most sort of
general source of sports news?

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.620
I think it might be
espn.com, so we'll probably

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.814
add a content analysis of
that next time as well.

00:13:48.814 --> 00:13:50.980
But the point is that we've
come out with this study

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.820
every five years.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.850
And so we're able to track both
the quantity and the quality

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.430
of coverage of men's and women's
sports in news and highlight

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.660
shows over this period of
time at five-year intervals.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.680
And what we've seen, it's not
a very pretty picture, frankly.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.370
The top line there--

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.670
I'm colorblind, but
I think that's blue.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.780
Am I right?

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.850
Thank you.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.580
Is the three network
affiliate shows,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.190
early evening and
late night shows.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.439
And you can see
that 1999 and 2000,

00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:25.480
we were starting to feel
a little bit optimistic.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.188
And everybody was
asking us to interpret.

00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:29.710
Is this an upward slope that's
just going to keep going up?

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.310
Suddenly it's up
to a whopping 8.7%.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.340
And we weren't quite
sure how to interpret it.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.230
But then it dropped off
again the following time

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.600
and then has plummeted
in recent years

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.500
to a much lower level in
the last two iterations

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.400
of the study.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.070
ESPN SportsCenter pretty
much flatted around

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:54.940
2% of the time devoted
to the coverage of sports

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.400
devoted to women's sports.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.340
Here's a sort of what actually
is covered in terms of sports.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.790
This is combining the
news and highlights shows.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.500
And as some people have
mentioned earlier today,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.930
it's the big three
really for the most part.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.820
Men's basketball,
men's football,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.890
men's baseball are getting
the whopping proportions

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.050
of coverage on these shows.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.690
And this is just
the 2014 numbers.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.380
But if you look at this over
time, one of the things you see

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.540
is that that big
three has taken up

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.880
a larger and larger
proportion of coverage

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.650
over the years,
rather than smaller.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.330
And I think part of this has
to do with a kind of timidity

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.620
in the newsroom in
these shows that they're

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.260
kind of going with the most
comfortable and familiar types

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.600
of sports.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.510
I don't think with ESPN
this is probably an issue.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.790
But with the TV
news shows, it might

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:03.310
be just like with newspapers,
the declining revenue

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:07.030
and declining labor to cover
certain kinds of things.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.920
I read the LA Times every day.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.440
And they can count on
at least one letter

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.690
from me every year
during basketball season.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.950
Why aren't you covering women's
sports in the regular season?

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.776
If one of the local teams
gets into the NCAA tournament,

00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:22.150
then they will
start covering it.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.110
But the answer I usually
get from the editor is, A,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.830
not that many people
go to the games.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.340
And B, we just don't have the
staff anymore to cover that.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.100
So we have to just sort of take
the little piece of news that

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.430
comes from the team itself
and put that in the newspaper.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.680
And my argument all
the time back to them

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.590
is the chicken and egg
argument that people oftentimes

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.080
have with media about
audience building

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.710
and how when things
are covered more,

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.480
people learn more about them.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.550
And newspapers are
an important part

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.250
of that web of information,
as are TV news and highlight

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.000
shows, that build interest
and a sense of history

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.410
and a sense of audience
buy-in to these forms

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.440
of entertainment.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.329
Another thing that we
found in the study--

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.210
and this is again
just the 2014 data,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:14.410
but it's very similar in recent
iterations of the study--

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.510
is that men's sports tend
to get covered even when

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.680
they're out of season.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.910
There's lavish coverage.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.380
And this is just a comparison of
the WNBA and the NBA coverage,

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.080
but we did this with
some other sports too.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.520
But this is kind of a
good apples and apples

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.420
comparison in a lot of ways,
even though the WNBA season

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.560
is much shorter.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.680
But you see a lot of
coverage, for instance, also

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.060
of Major League Baseball
when it's out of season.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.360
The LA Times, again using
a sort of print example,

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.850
has front page sports
section stories

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.320
on USC football and UCLA
football in the springtime

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.140
during spring practice, and
then in months leading up

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.210
to the season building
a sense of excitement

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.850
about the first kickoff.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.460
And women's sports, when
they do get covered,

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.680
are covered only
within the season.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.770
And then it just kind of
evaporates and goes away.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:17.380
So again, a kind of audience
building, interest building,

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.180
factor.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.150
The most interesting thing I
think we have seen over time

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.640
is it's kind of
simple and easy to--

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.820
well, I will say this since
the research assistants who

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.090
have done the hard work on
this project over the years

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.860
aren't here with me.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.620
Sitting there and watching
videotape hours and hours

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.230
and hours and coding it.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.964
But the data are quite simple
for this sort of study,

00:18:41.964 --> 00:18:42.880
the quantitative data.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.960
But teasing out qualitative
patterns and changes over time

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.744
has been especially interesting.

00:18:48.744 --> 00:18:50.410
And one of the things
that we've noticed

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.671
has been there's a decided
shift over time in the ways

00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:56.170
that women's sports are covered
on news and highlight shows,

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.460
when they're covered at all.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.881
And you saw those numbers.

00:18:58.881 --> 00:19:00.130
They're not covered very much.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.720
But when they're
covered at all, some

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.261
of the major patterns
that we've seen

00:19:03.261 --> 00:19:06.640
are in those early
iterations of the study.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.680
We saw a tremendous
amount of just kind

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.150
of making fun of and,
quote, "humorous" joking

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.090
and sexualization
and trivialization

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.330
of women's sports
and women athletes.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.940
And there's lots
of examples of this

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.590
in earlier iterations
of our study--

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.680
a big, long story
on a woman who's

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.490
a nude bungee jumper off of a
bridge or something in a week

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.740
where there's no coverage
of any other women's sports,

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.690
that sort of thing.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:40.600
And then by 2005, 2010,
you see a decline--

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.220
not a disappearance,
but a decline--

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.980
of that sort of trivializing
and overtly sexualizing

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.410
and making fun of
women's sports.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.960
And the dominant
sort of narrative

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.910
for talking about women's
sports at that time

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:59.230
becomes talking about women in
these very well accepted kind

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.790
of, quote, "traditional"
sorts of gender frames--

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.630
women as the girl next door,
women as somebody's mother,

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:11.530
women as somebody's girlfriend
or wife, a woman athlete.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.100
And so you see interviews,
when there are interviews

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.130
on the news and highlight
shows, with a woman athlete that

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.920
focus a lot on a high
profile woman or a highly

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.760
successful woman athlete.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.000
You're a mother.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.500
How do you possibly do it?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.670
Talk about your child.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.680
Tell us about your
role as a mother.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.740
Which, of course, is fine
if they just did that

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.621
with men athletes too, I think.

00:20:33.621 --> 00:20:36.120
And I tell my students who are
going into sports journalism.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.330
I said, when you find yourself
in the locker room with LeBron

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.120
James after the
championship, ask him,

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.570
LeBron how do you do it?

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.390
Aren't you a father?

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.880
It just boggles me you can
be this great an athlete

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.640
and still have a child.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.850
So I mean, a lot of this
is just about asymmetries

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.990
of the way we talk about and
talk to and frame women and men

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.624
athletes.

00:21:00.624 --> 00:21:02.790
And then the most recent
iteration of this study, we

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.920
were very interested to find
a lot less, and almost no

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.030
really, insulting and
sexualizing frames

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.830
and presentations of women
athletes in these shows.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.450
That had gone away
almost entirely.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.590
And I think news
shows in particular

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.090
had been criticized
a lot for this,

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.760
and they kind of
pulled back on it.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.090
But what we have seen is
a little bit of that kind

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.760
of ambivalent, wife/
mother sort of framing.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.280
But instead, the
main finding that we

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.580
had in terms of the qualitative
coverage of women's sports

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.440
in these shows was just
that it was very, very dull,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.670
really boring in the
way it got presented.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.550
Not very much visuals, kind
of maybe just this brief,

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.850
monotone kind of report.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:56.380
And so the comparison
looks something like this.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.190
You have a few minutes
on a news show,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.580
or a full hour on
ESPN SportsCenter,

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.880
where you just have bang, bang,
bang stories about men's sports

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.430
that have all these
popping visuals and all

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.220
this exciting commentary.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.520
And it reminds me-- and we
wrote this in the article--

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.100
that all the superlatives and
the high action commentary

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.020
reminds me-- and some
of you are old enough

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.690
to remember this-- of the
old Batman show on TV,

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:29.790
the kind of bam, pow, wow
and that sort of action

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.110
stuff that you see.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:37.340
And ESPN is really quite good
with this with their visuals.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.880
And then, oh yeah, and the
women played today too.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.340
And the voice
literally flattens out.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.140
And so we call this
gender bland sexism,

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:55.650
kind of taking off on the
terms about racism that

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.600
are very similar today.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.020
So you have really this sort
of active audience building

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.450
happening with men's sports and
very boring sort of commentary

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.290
on women's sports.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:12.480
And it's almost as though
when they decided or someone

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.070
told them that they couldn't or
shouldn't insult or sexualize

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.890
women or trivialize
women athletes,

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.100
that they just decided not to
cover them very much at all.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.720
And if they did,
they would do so

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:31.540
in a voice that communicated
their lack of interest.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.750
Let me just say just
the last thing then

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.569
is that I think
we also, in terms

00:23:35.569 --> 00:23:37.860
of textual analysis, that's
what we're looking at here.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.380
But we also need to
think about production

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.310
and what it means to have
the kind of decisions

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.167
that are made in newsrooms,
print, and electronic.

00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:48.750
And we need to think
about consumption

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.820
and how it is that people read.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.310
Like that guy that
I saw in the grocery

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.010
store, how did he get
excited about women's sports?

00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:02.550
And how did he make his
way into that program

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.080
and get so excited about it?

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.160
And SportsCenter to me is--

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.820
a research question I have about
SportsCenter is to what extent

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.160
men consumers experience
that as a kind of man

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.500
cave that insulates them
from the changes that

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.080
are going on in the world
around them that are all

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.930
about the empowerment of women.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.070
So I'm out of time, and
I will stop at that then.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.570
Thank you.

00:24:30.784 --> 00:24:32.170
- Thanks.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.140
Thank you for being here on
this beautiful Friday afternoon

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.050
and staying for
this final panel.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.050
I'm really excited to be on
this panel with some of my idols

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.270
who have been so
central to the field.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:48.340
And I am here to build on some
of the fantastic discussions

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.170
we've had thus far.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.110
And I'll be focusing on
media representations

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.510
of transnational
female athletes who

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:56.950
compete in the United States.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.430
And by transnational, I mean
either foreign to the United

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.620
States, on temporary work
visas, naturalized immigrants,

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.180
or the children
of immigrants who

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.360
continue to have connections
to their homelands.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.540
Transnational female athletes
raise important questions

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.290
about the connections between
race, nation, and gender.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.780
And I'm going to
base my statements

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.470
on my own research on Korean
female golfers in the Ladies

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.860
Professional Golf
Association, or the LPGA.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.880
And I'll also suggest that
researchers and critics should

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.330
attempt to foster
relationships with journalists,

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.000
athletic personnel, and
feminists in other countries

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.480
in order to engage in a process
of transnational critique

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.810
when discussing
gender and sports.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.540
So in 2014, a New
Zealander was the youngest

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.410
to win an LPGA tournament
at the age of 15.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.080
And two years later,
at age 17, she

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.680
became the youngest professional
golfer, male or female,

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.140
to hold the world's
number one spot.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.450
The golfer is Lydia
Ko, who is a New

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.570
Zealander born in South Korea.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:08.260
The AP has referred to her as
a transplanted New Zealander.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.170
And given the complexities
of globalization and sports

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:16.270
migration, she is referenced
as a Korean-born New Zealander,

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.900
as a Korean golfer with
New Zealand citizenship,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.680
as simply a Korean golfer,
or as she refers to herself,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.760
as a Korean Kiwi, or a Kowi.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.880
Lydia Ko bucks the
notion of the apolitical

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.770
and post-political
Asian athlete.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.490
She won a spot in Time
Magazine's 100 Most

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.790
Influential People
in the World in 2014.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.680
And since the
beginning of this year,

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.370
she has begun to publicly
advocate for equal pay.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.520
As the number one
female player in 2016,

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.290
she was the only woman among the
top 50 highest earning golfers.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:57.770
And she ranked 44th
on the pay scale.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.130
She made a minor splash in
New Zealand, United States,

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.670
and Korean language media when
she entered into the equal pay

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:05.210
debate.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.150
And her advocacy for female
professional athletes

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.610
placed her in media
articles where

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.510
she was quoted alongside
the great Billie Jean King.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.910
For Lydia Ko, gender
has become a category

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.180
for connecting her
various national, ethnic,

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.130
and racial ties.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.170
As with many top
female athletes,

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:33.330
she underwent a makeover with
increased coverage and rising

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:33.830
fame.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.510
She was signed by IMG.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.230
And to kick off 2015,
she ditched her trademark

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.890
big glasses for contacts and
what is commonly referred

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.410
to as a double eyelid surgery.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.990
She received the
surgery in South Korea,

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.890
where she also received
acupuncture for her wrist.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.190
The Korean newspaper,
Chosun Ilbo,

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.570
stated in a rather
perfunctory way,

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:00.125
Ko said her caddy didn't
even recognize her

00:28:00.125 --> 00:28:03.710
at first as she wore glasses
for about five years.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:08.360
For a number of teenage Korean
girls and increasingly boys,

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.150
this procedure takes place
as a kind of rite of passage.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.760
And in South Korea,
the inability

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.910
to recognize someone after
surgery is so commonplace

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.550
that the government has
mandated that individuals have

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.270
their national identity cards
reissued upon plastic surgery

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.770
to the face.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.350
Pre- and post-op photos
like these of Lydia Ko

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:31.340
are ubiquitous on ads in public
spaces, and beauty magazines,

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.760
and websites, and on personal
social media where individuals

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.450
proudly post their own
pre- and post-op photos.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.380
And so these makeover
images hardly cause a stir.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.480
In mainstream Korean
context, the general attitude

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.980
towards these
surgeries is that they

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.800
are a positive
demonstration of aspiration,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.920
if not necessary as
an economic strategy

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.990
to get ahead in a culture
that greatly values

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.270
appearance and a
culture that generally

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.800
assumes that the features you
are born with are not destiny.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.680
It's fascinating to compare
Ko to the previous number one

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.300
golfer, Inbee Park, who is
also a history making golfer.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.460
And this is a picture of Inbee.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.690
Inbee Park is hardly recognized
outside of Korean golfing

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.310
contexts.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.030
And while she was at
the top of her game

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.040
and will certainly be
in the Hall of Fame,

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.480
she made comparatively
little in advertising.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.870
Park Inbee, or Inbee
Park, defiantly resisted

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.230
outside pressure to adjust
her weight and her looks,

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.450
pointing out that a
previous attempt to diet

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.760
had been disastrous
for her game.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.370
She dismissed criticisms
of her lack of effort,

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.100
stating that money or fame
was never her motivation

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.890
for entering the sport.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.340
Ko's surgery certainly
highlights the truism

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.770
that Mary Jo Kane
and Michael Messner

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.360
have proven again and again.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.930
That while it takes athletic
talent to rise to the top,

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.350
female athletes continue to
be judged by their looks.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.240
And that female
athletes themselves

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.430
actively participate
in the system

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.530
given its financial rewards.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.020
Yet her surgery also points
to the common practice

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.830
of eyelid surgery for Korean and
Asian females the world over.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.160
While it is certainly
a racialized practice,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.770
it needs to be understood within
a Korean political economy

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.290
of images as an
attempt to project

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.080
a kind of global
Koreanness by adhering

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.720
to a particular
standard of appearance.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.600
I remember being in Korea and
being told by a Mongolian woman

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.450
that I did not look Korean, but
rather more like a Mongolian.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.200
And I have also been told
that I need to fix things,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.390
as though somehow
there was something

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.970
wrong with my natural face.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.350
This had more to
do with the fact

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.920
that I was not conforming to
the standards of Korean beauty

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.680
at the time.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.720
And many critics
see Ko's surgery

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.720
not as an attempt to
look more Western,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:58.510
but to conform to the
manner of Korean beauty

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.800
that's defined by Korean
actors and K-pop movie stars.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.050
There are more important
distinctions to be parsed out

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:06.610
with respect to
the different ways

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.820
her gender and gender
practices associated

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.360
with her are understood
depending on national context.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.360
Most Koreans consider
her Korean regardless

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.470
of nationality because of
her familial ties to Korea.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.240
She is understood as part of
the education exodus of families

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.330
that leave to educate their
children in an Anglophone

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.500
country.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.920
As a golfer, she is seen as one
of the many top Korean heritage

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.620
female players who
entered and dominated

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.820
the LPGA since the debut
of Se-ri Pak in 1998.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:44.230
She was initiated into the
game by her golf-obsessed uncle

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.390
and aunt who reside in Seoul.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:49.240
She is known to be obsessed
with K-pop and Hallyu stars,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:55.120
or the Korean wave of
popular culture celebrities.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.640
She received plastic surgery
and acupuncture in Seoul.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.330
She enrolled at one of the top
universities in the nation,

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.330
Korea University,
in 2015, most likely

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.900
because they will allow her to
do her studies extramurally.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.700
And for Koreans,
there is no doubt

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.800
that her great golfing success
hails from her Koreanness.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.770
And her New Zealand
citizenship is

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.880
seen as a matter of convenience
or an economic strategy.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.830
Yet she has been
embraced as a Kiwi

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.830
and has likewise been embraced
as a New Zealander who

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.820
has bolstered its multicultural
and immigrant friendly image.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.650
She has been attributed
with bringing

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.600
the LPGA to the country.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.030
She emigrated to New
Zealand at six years old

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.160
and gained citizenship at 12.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.380
She is a national
icon and recognized

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.150
as one of the top
athletes of the nation.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.140
She won at the
Australian Open in 2015,

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.350
which has always brought
a lot of pleasure

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.160
to the New Zealand
national public.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.600
For New Zealanders to
win on Australian soil,

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.060
it's a big deal.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.620
She won a silver medal in
Rio and was named Young New

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.320
Zealander of the Year in 2016.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.490
Her gender is significant as she
is one of the few female Kiwi

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.010
athletes to rise to any
global acclaim, given

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:12.550
the overwhelming dominance
of the male sports of rugby

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.710
and cricket.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.080
Yet even this identification
with New Zealand

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.060
is understood as fungible.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.070
When asked about whether
she might represent

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.070
South Korea in future
Olympics, she has said,

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.010
"There have been
players in the past who

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.660
have gone back to Korea.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.660
There have been questions to me
about changing my nationality

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.560
back to Korea.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.670
But at the end of the day,
the players who did it

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.080
thought it best for them.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.380
I'm proud to have New
Zealand on my bag."

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.610
She continued, "I
started golf in Korea

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.450
but did most of my
development in New Zealand

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.450
and where New Zealand
golf was very supportive.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.000
And they're still
supportive now.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.310
So it's kind of hard
to leave that behind.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.310
Obviously when someone looks
at me, they see a Korean face.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:00.490
I'm proud to be born in Korea
and to represent New Zealand.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.440
And that's something
I'm fortunate to have,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.540
support from two
amazing countries.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.960
I'm a Korean Kiwi, or
as we say it, Kowi.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.409
This self-naming practice
as a Korean Kiwi, or Kowi,

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.560
is reminiscent of
Tiger's Cablinasian

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.350
and highlights a similar attempt
to reduce any real tension

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.920
or politics around
her national identity.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.000
Clearly a preoccupation of U.S.
Media and Anglophone golf media

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.239
is the idea that Asians
are actually always

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.010
originally from Asia.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.070
And while she is a New Zealander
by nationality and has enrolled

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.370
at a Korean college, much of her
training takes place in Florida

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.389
and the U.S. And she spends
much of her time on a U.S.-based

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:41.500
tour.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.060
Within the U.S.,
she is perceived

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.580
as one of many players
of Asian heritage

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.820
who are shifting the cultural
makeup of professional golf

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.480
and also opening
markets to Asia for U.S.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.590
golf-related interests.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.830
She has been signed by the New
York-based talent management

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:03.820
company, IMG, who famously
signed Korean-American Michelle

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:04.960
Wie in her teens.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.140
And she has also been accused
of acculturating to the U.S.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.810
and in an interview,
confessed, I

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.490
think I got an American
accent somewhere.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.810
In the United States, she is
read through the lens of race

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.640
in ways that continue
to characterize

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.430
the presence of
Asians as temporary

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.290
and as perpetual foreigners.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.930
As Asian females, they
are without exception

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.140
associated with their family
and often overdetermined

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.780
by their culture,
rather than seen

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.180
as world-class
individual athletes who

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.580
have cultivated their talent
through hard work and grit.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.880
They are often infantilized
and objectified

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.500
as cute little Asians
available for a kiss,

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.900
as you see in this image.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.410
While the LPGA presents itself
as the ultimate destination

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:53.340
for female golfers, for
many Korean players,

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:57.690
they have the opportunity
to make more in South Korea.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.760
So they have to make a
very difficult decision

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.430
about whether to
remain in the LPGA.

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.910
Should they try to win a major
tournament in the LPGA, where

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.890
they suffer in anonymity?

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.960
Or should they play
in Korea, where

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.360
opportunities for making
money through sponsorships,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.490
television spots, golf
clinics, and pro-ams

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.020
are much more frequent.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.600
Because they are lumped together
as Korean female golfers,

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.320
even top golfers are largely
ignored by U.S. Sports media

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.010
unless they are number one
or especially attractive.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.290
So what I've tried
to do is to highlight

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.870
various national contexts for
understanding how race, gender,

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.170
and nation operate in golf.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:41.640
And I could go on, but I'm
just going to end here.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.510
But I just wanted to
suggest that for academics,

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.720
journalists, and critics
in the United States

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.440
or in Europe or in the West,
it's highly problematic to make

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.840
a universal gender
critique about gender

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.300
inequality in sports
without addressing

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.890
the complexities of gender, and
race, and national differences,

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:07.980
and the scale of those important
identities for these players

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.850
themselves.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.590
So I just want to
encourage us to think

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.370
about how to offer a gender
critique in sports that's

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:17.790
in conversation with critics,
journalists, and athletes

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:22.200
who reside in places where
these athletes are coming from,

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.570
or where they've migrated
to, and also who represent

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:30.200
underrepresented communities.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:30.700
Thank you.

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:37.720
- Hi.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.090
I'm Kavitha, and I guess
I'm ESPN's diversity hire.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.420
So I think that we've
been talking about access

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.340
to women's sports all day.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.627
And now we're obviously
talking about coverage.

00:37:49.627 --> 00:37:51.960
And it's impossible to talk
about either of those things

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.600
without talking
about the women fan.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.030
And the thing that underlies
all three of these things

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.810
is really that antiquated
notions about these people--

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.720
about these aspects of women
and sports, and their fandom,

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.940
and who covers them, and
how they're covered--

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.040
are still kind of
rooted in the idea

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.050
that sports are a place for men.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.890
And the rest of us
are just visiting.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:16.380
So the female fan who knows all
the stats and all the players

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.140
and has a ton of experience
talking about sports,

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.560
she's the outlier.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.190
The female athlete who
is dominant in her game,

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.320
she's also the outlier.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.200
Not everybody is Serena.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.590
The idea that women can cover
sports analytically and not

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.650
just be sideline reporters,
that's also an outlier.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:38.160
So I think that we have a lot of
these issues to kind of unpack

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.700
here.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.910
And it all really does come
down to who the fans are,

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.460
and recognizing that,
and how that can

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.170
translate to better coverage.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:50.670
So not to be too simplistic,
but this problem can kind of be

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:55.170
broken down to two prongs, the
fiscal undervaluing of women's

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.200
sports and the cultural
undervaluing of women's sports.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.260
And the two are
really interrelated.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.060
And I'm going to start with
the fiscal undervaluing

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.040
because I used to write
sports for Bloomberg.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.010
And if you think the sports
journalism industry is

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:12.390
homogeneous, the finance sports
journalism industry is even

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.150
more so.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.860
And ideally we could make
a purely moral argument

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.950
for why we should have equal
coverage, equal pay, equal

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.510
respect for women's sports.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.760
But when you're trying to
make a purely moral argument

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.110
to bankers, that doesn't
really go over well.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.550
So you kind of have to appeal
to that other side of them.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.320
So management in the
industry-- and this

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.030
is throughout the industry.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.430
And we're talking
television, radio, print,

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.575
online, everything,
including advertising.

00:39:38.575 --> 00:39:40.950
And I'll get to that because
that's a huge driver of what

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.510
we're seeing here.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.850
Management tends to argue
that women's sports don't

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:45.660
draw big ratings.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.620
They don't draw high
traffic numbers.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.530
They don't get enough clicks.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.130
And they don't generate revenue.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:52.320
And that's the reason.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.120
That's the justification,
essentially,

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.530
for prioritizing men's
sports over women's sports.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.000
People don't watch them, so
why should we force them to?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.560
And why should we take up
valuable air time when we could

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.970
be airing things like poker?

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.560
The problem with
this mentality is

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.920
that it's also, as Michael said,
the ultimate chicken or the egg

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.940
thing.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.060
If you give more exposure,
do proper promotion,

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.304
schedule games when people
would actually watch them

00:40:20.304 --> 00:40:20.970
and are at home.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.980
My God.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.600
People would have
more familiarity

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.847
with these amazing athletes,
and with these games,

00:40:26.847 --> 00:40:28.680
and with these things
that we want to cover,

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.990
and yes, sometimes with
the human interest stories

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.281
and the back stories that do
make some of these figures

00:40:33.281 --> 00:40:35.250
really compelling.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.352
It bears out with
the success of espnW.

00:40:38.352 --> 00:40:39.810
And that's one of
the sites at ESPN

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:40.935
that I'm lucky to work for.

00:40:40.935 --> 00:40:43.485
I also write for the
magazine and for .com.

00:40:43.485 --> 00:40:45.930
But we've seen incredible
growth in traffic

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:47.380
in the last few years.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.580
And as a result, we've seen
a lot more on-air coverage,

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.700
a lot more online coverage,
and a huge expansion

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.990
into how our women's content
kind of permeates other areas

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.615
of the company.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:04.350
I can personally, anecdotally
attest to the idea

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.990
that more coverage will
generate more interest.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.340
And it's the same game that
Michael was talking about.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:12.270
I have a bunch of guy friends
who are always asking me,

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.309
help me get more into
women's basketball.

00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:16.350
And I think mostly it's
just to get me to shut up

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:17.740
about women's basketball.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.120
But so I'm watching
Mississippi State UConn,

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.120
and I'm texting all of them
to turn on the television.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.090
And they do.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.546
And I'm watching at home because
I want to watch in peace.

00:41:27.546 --> 00:41:28.920
And I want to yell
at the TV when

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.650
I want to and everything
and have the sound on.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.010
After the game finishes
airing, I go to my local bar

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.157
where most of them were.

00:41:35.157 --> 00:41:36.240
And they had the sound on.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.824
And they had the post-game on,
and they had all the interviews

00:41:38.824 --> 00:41:39.323
on.

00:41:39.323 --> 00:41:40.640
And everyone is going crazy.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.794
And these were guys
rooting for teams

00:41:42.794 --> 00:41:44.210
that they've never
watched before,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.310
athletes they couldn't
name, cheering

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.900
at the top of their lungs.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.110
And this was an
incredible thing to see.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.840
It's not just the interest
that that generates, though.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.570
This is very tangible.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.280
Sorry.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.140
It carried-- ratings
for that game

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.100
were up 90% from
the year before.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.600
And they were the highest final
four ratings for the women's

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.430
tournament in five years.

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.800
It carried into the title
game two days later.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.200
Ratings for the
championship were 20% higher

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.250
than last year's, and it was
the most streamed women's game

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:17.850
ever.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.560
And that's important
because I think

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.700
that our generation does
not consume sports mostly

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.634
on television.

00:42:24.634 --> 00:42:25.800
We don't get our news there.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.480
We don't get our
games there largely.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.770
We get them online.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.690
So the fact that this game--

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:34.710
and the future of where we see
this industry going is online.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.280
And that this women's game was
the most streamed game ever

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.400
is a testament to
how powerful just

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.910
being able to see how
incredible these games

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.190
and matchups and
exciting things can be.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:52.060
And that game was everything
you want out of sports.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:52.670
It was drama.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.420
It was compelling.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.264
It was unexpected.

00:42:54.264 --> 00:42:54.930
It was historic.

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:56.130
It was improbable.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.140
And those are the
kinds of things

00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.790
that we can get
from women's sports

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:03.390
that we already know we
can get from men's sports.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.850
If people knew how exciting
these games could be,

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.590
more people would
want to watch them.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:09.450
And that's more
viewers, more readers,

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.850
and honestly most
importantly, more targeted

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.977
consumers for advertisers.

00:43:13.977 --> 00:43:15.810
The difficulty here is
that it's really hard

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.820
to change the game
plan among management

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.029
without hard evidence.

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.820
And you can't really
get that hard evidence

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.070
without observing some
of the anecdotal behavior

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:26.340
that we've talked about and
also taking a leap of faith

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.630
that women's
coverage is worth it.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.360
My problem with
that part of it is

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.550
that there have been
numerous leaps of faith

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.310
over the years that have gotten
men's sports the profitability

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:38.419
and the popularity
where they are now.

00:43:38.419 --> 00:43:40.710
People always forget that it
took major league baseball

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.560
and football more than 50
years to actually reach

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.610
profitability.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.890
And they did so with huge
government intervention,

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.490
anti-trust exemptions, tax
exemptions, some of which

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.449
still exist today.

00:43:52.449 --> 00:43:54.990
Women's sports have not received
any of that kind of support.

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:57.540
I will say the WNBA has
had incredible support

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.710
from the NBA.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.771
But come on.

00:43:59.771 --> 00:44:01.770
We're not talking about
a league-wide anti-trust

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:03.990
exemption.

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:07.830
Similarly, 31 million
people watched game 7

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.100
of the NBA finals last year.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.760
31 years ago, in
1986, CBS was tape

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.100
delaying NBA playoff games.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.830
For context, I wasn't born then.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.240
Neither was the WNBA.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.830
The WNBA is 21 years old.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:24.660
It was established in 1996.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.970
So we're talking
about a sport that

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.890
can go from being on
tape delay to having

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:33.264
31 million people watching
it in a span of 30 years.

00:44:33.264 --> 00:44:34.680
And we're not even
willing to give

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.330
the WNBA a chance for 20 years
of reaching profitability.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.890
Besides that leap
of faith, there

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.140
are some tangible
arguments we can make both

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.030
to media and the
advertising industry that

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.570
drives our profit.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.350
And we can do this
in showing that we're

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.890
shortchanging both women's
sports and women's fans.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.150
And that that's shortsighted.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.910
That we're leaving money
on the table when we do so.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.160
So we did some
preliminary research.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.110
We've been doing research
at ESPN for years

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.940
now on the women fan.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.400
And I can share a couple
of things with you.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.010
And the biggest number is
half of all sports fans--

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.230
literally half of all
sports fans-- are women.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.030
That's 115 million people.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.795
That's a huge
growth market there.

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:16.170
And that's something
that's being

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:20.070
overlooked that we have to stop
overlooking as an industry.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.650
If you already have a pretty
well-established audience

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.600
and a consumer base,
I think we can all

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.990
agree it can be better catered
to, even among the women who

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.730
are currently watching.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.800
But perhaps more
importantly, women fans

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.020
are growing at rates
higher than men's fans.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.420
And in certain breakdowns
of the demographic,

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.460
the men's fans are
actually declining

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.900
in areas where the
women's fans are going up.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.930
Women fans are also raising
in size and avidity.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.260
Now what that means is
that the number of fans

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:54.060
who are going from casual
to average to strong, strong

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.342
sports fans is on the rise.

00:45:55.342 --> 00:45:57.300
And those are the people
that we can absolutely

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.510
capture loyalty-wise.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.290
The Title IX generation
largely accounts for this.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.870
As you can imagine,
former athletes

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:07.140
tend to be the most
engaged in women's sports.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.840
These women say, by
and large, that they

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.170
are sports fans for life because
they played sports growing up.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.555
That's a sports fan for life.

00:46:14.555 --> 00:46:15.930
That's exactly
what Christine was

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.170
talking about when she
was on stage with Layla

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:19.920
is that these are the
women that we should

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.810
be catering to especially.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.400
As the participation rates
of female athletes go up,

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.120
so too will the fandom,
and the viewership,

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.650
and the consumer base.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.680
So it's no secret that in every
facet of media, even sports

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.290
media, which has long
seemed untouchable,

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.230
the shift toward cord
cutting, toward going online,

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.800
away from print to digital, away
from digital to social media

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.580
and video is causing a lot
of media companies to try

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.010
and re-evaluate
how they can reach

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.770
new populations and new
viewers and new consumers.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:54.000
And the women's market obviously
represents a huge potential

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.750
for that.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.751
It seems
counterproductive to leave

00:46:56.751 --> 00:46:59.250
the needs of a group of millions
of fans that's only getting

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.170
larger unattended
simply because we

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:04.191
don't look like what you think
a sports fan usually looks like.

00:47:04.191 --> 00:47:06.690
So here's the point where I
have to interject with an appeal

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:09.780
specifically to
advertisers about the value

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.620
of the female fan.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.640
I used to work at--

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.060
I interned at Nielsen Sports
doing consumer and viewership

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:16.560
insights.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.110
And I can't tell you how many
times I was sitting in a room

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:20.610
with a bunch of
male ad execs trying

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.097
to convince them that, yes,
women might not drink the beer.

00:47:23.097 --> 00:47:25.680
But they're the ones buying the
beer, so maybe don't offend us

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.530
in the commercials.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.840
I understand where their
mentality comes from,

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.180
even if it is archaic.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.770
We all know that the
ad industry tends

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.220
to uphold the male, 18 to
24 demo as its main target.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.320
But it's finally coming
around to the reality

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.960
that, even if women
don't watch sports,

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.490
and that's obviously
a very dubious

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:48.259
if, we buy a lot of things.

00:47:48.259 --> 00:47:49.800
It's not just the
household products.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.830
We buy a lot of things.

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.330
We make those
purchasing decisions.

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.900
And that's really important
that advertisers start

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.610
to come around to realize.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.670
Among female sports
fans, three groups

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.180
tend to be the most engaged.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.870
This is one of my favorite
stats from one of our reports.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:08.160
Women 25 to 34, African-American
women as a whole,

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.980
and moms with kids 6 through 17.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:14.156
Women 25 to 34
increasingly being coveted,

00:48:14.156 --> 00:48:15.780
they're coming around
to that at least.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.470
They might be highly educated,
high-earning, single,

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:20.345
professional.

00:48:20.345 --> 00:48:21.720
Or they might
belong to the group

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.730
of women that are getting
married, and having

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:26.640
kids, and starting families much
later than they were before.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.340
Either way, they have really
high purchasing power.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.200
Meanwhile African-American
women are largely

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.150
ignored all over the
place, whether it's

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.090
as consumers of products
or as consumers of media.

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:39.240
So that represents a huge
space that we need to tap into.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.120
And then moms with kids
6 to 17, like most women,

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.695
make the household
purchasing decisions.

00:48:44.695 --> 00:48:47.070
Ad execs have been trying to
market to mothers for years.

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:50.130
We see this with all the
Procter &amp; Gamble commercials

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.690
during the Olympics.

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:54.150
Sports year-round can be
a way to tap into that

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:56.154
not just every four years.

00:48:56.154 --> 00:48:57.570
All of this is to
say that there's

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:01.200
a market for female fans that's
rich and not fully tapped into.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.910
But once you've cleared
that first hurdle

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:04.284
of convincing
people that there's

00:49:04.284 --> 00:49:06.619
a monetary value
in women's sports,

00:49:06.619 --> 00:49:08.160
you still run into
the roadblock when

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.880
it comes to the cultural value.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.920
Women fans don't
watch women's sports.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.740
This is a huge thing that
people always, always bring up.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.700
And that's sadly true.

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.000
But I don't think it should
be the burden of simply

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.310
women's fans to convince
management, mostly

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:27.450
male management, that women's
sports are worth something.

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:28.807
Male fans do exist.

00:49:28.807 --> 00:49:30.390
And they just haven't
been catered to,

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:34.080
the same way women fans
haven't been catered to.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.170
If you grow overall the
interest among sports fans,

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:39.420
more women are going to watch.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.753
And more men are going to watch.

00:49:40.753 --> 00:49:42.180
It's not going to be stratified.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.890
Because if you look
at the breakdown,

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.889
the way that women fans
engage with their sports

00:49:45.889 --> 00:49:47.700
is very similar to
the way that male fans

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.741
engage with their sports.

00:49:48.741 --> 00:49:51.040
They like the same
sports, in the same order,

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.885
the same amount.

00:49:52.885 --> 00:49:55.830
But they're just
not being exposed

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.720
to the women's side of it.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.100
There is a slight distinction.

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.770
While women do mostly
watch men's sports,

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.680
they do care that women's
sports are being covered.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.680
And that's something that we
can really, really tap into.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.220
Because they care that--

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.650
they want the game highlights.

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:12.746
They want the actual events on.

00:50:12.746 --> 00:50:14.370
They want to watch
all of these things.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:17.730
But they also want to
watch a female perspective.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:19.380
They want to read a
female perspective.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.080
They want the stories
about these women athletes

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.044
that maybe they can relate
to on a more personal level.

00:50:25.044 --> 00:50:26.460
And that's a really
different kind

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.422
of way to attract these fans.

00:50:28.422 --> 00:50:29.880
And that does come
to the coverage.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.740
That does come to
the representation.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.530
That does come to the on-air
talent, and the writers,

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:37.210
and everything like that.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.160
All that need for respect--

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.760
and that's what your
female fan mostly

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.250
says is that we want
women to be treated

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:45.797
with respect in this space.

00:50:45.797 --> 00:50:47.880
All of that brings us to
the cultural undervaluing

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.344
of women's sports and, by
extension, women's sports fans.

00:50:51.344 --> 00:50:53.010
You can make all the
empirical arguments

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.196
for how covering sports
can boost your bottom line.

00:50:55.196 --> 00:50:56.820
But they won't make
any impact until we

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.290
start to think of them as worthy
instruments of our culture

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.710
and entertainment.

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:02.990
The fiscal undervaluing
of women's sports

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:04.910
is based largely on
the perceived value

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.740
of women athletes as less than.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.140
And that's a conversation
that's impossible to have

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.600
without talking about how our
society values masculinity

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.860
over femininity.

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.870
The age-old argument
against women's sports

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.594
was that athleticism was
antithetical to femininity.

00:51:17.594 --> 00:51:19.010
We had all kinds
of crazy theories

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.470
about the impact of playing
sports on a woman's fertility

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.390
and things like
that, assumptions

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.120
about the limitations of
her strength and stamina.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.730
For some, it was unnatural
to watch a woman just sweat

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.800
and exert herself.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.070
Hopefully, the fertility thing
has been cleared up by now.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.590
But many of those attitudes
abound and are often

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.960
used precisely to
devalue women's sports.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.460
Women's tennis
players shouldn't get

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.380
paid as much because
they only play

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.742
three sets instead of five.

00:51:43.742 --> 00:51:45.200
Meanwhile, the
women tennis players

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.680
have been fighting to be able
to play five sets for years

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.180
now and have been told that
they can't physically handle it.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.720
So don't use that
argument against them.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.360
Tennis is a great thing because
we have Serena Williams.

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.510
And Serena is just a
flash mob of every issue

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.674
that we've talked about today.

00:52:02.674 --> 00:52:05.090
From the idea that anything
could be physically out of her

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:07.130
reach-- which I haven't seen
anything she can't physically

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.960
do yet--

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.550
to the sexism and
racism that is often

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:12.860
employed when talking
about her body.

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.500
Whether it's the
framing of her to fans,

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.440
whether she looks too
manly, whether she's

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.420
only successful and
strong because she's

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.980
taking
performance-enhancing drugs,

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.950
which is an accusation that
flies about with absolutely

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:26.630
no basis whatsoever.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.040
But she's also
really interesting

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.530
because, in the context
of sexualizing athletes,

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:34.340
she owns her sexuality in a
way that isn't commodified.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:39.080
She has been able to be an
athlete first and, yes, a sexy,

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.290
beautiful, could-be-a-model
woman second.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:44.210
I wrote a column
when I first started

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:47.990
ESPN around the Olympics
about how attractive I find

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.540
Conor Dwyer, Olympic swimmer.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.490
And I basically
used it as a joke

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:57.230
to kind of start discussing how
objectifying male athletes can

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:58.190
be OK.

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:00.320
Objectifying female
athletes can be OK.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.600
The problem is we don't
do it in the same way.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:07.100
If we did, if we started from
the same starting point, then

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.260
it would make sense to
do it in the same way.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:09.950
But we don't.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:13.040
What we do is the male
athlete is an athlete first,

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.530
and a good-looking guy second.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.970
The female athlete is a
good-looking girl first,

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.310
and maybe you consider
her athletic ability

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:22.310
after you consider
how hot she is.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:24.890
That's a really problematic way
of how we're framing things.

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:26.598
And I think that that's
one of the things

00:53:26.598 --> 00:53:27.860
that we need to work on.

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.860
Serena's also a great
example for why we don't just

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.560
undervalue individual athletes,
but the quality of the sport.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.490
Her success is used
against her as a marker

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:41.600
of how weak the field is--
the same thing with UConn

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.650
basketball.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:44.900
You're talking about
two incredibly dominant,

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:49.160
winning programs and people
whose success is completely

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:53.690
used against them as a sign
of how weak their field is.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:55.010
Now, the field is weaker.

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.990
But the solution isn't to
disrespect them or blame them

00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.490
for that.

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:00.740
The solution is to
help the field grow

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:03.710
by telling girls that there
are other programs out there.

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:07.170
By showing them Mississippi
State instead of UConn

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.970
and by showing that
there are more options

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:10.553
to being successful
than just the one.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.920
- Well, thank you,
all panelists.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.040
I really would like to
start this discussion

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.750
among the three of you,
and then maybe later when

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.840
we get to the
public Q&amp;A. And it's

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:39.190
this whole notion of why
aren't women covered more.

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:42.460
And I heard that on the
previous panel and now today.

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.610
And I want to push
us to say this.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.620
It is true that
women are overlooked.

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.140
And it is true that
women are underutilized.

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.780
And I would argue from a
critical feminist perspective

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.600
that is precisely the point.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.750
It is not, I don't believe,
that key decision-makers

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:02.980
don't understand that there are
market imperatives where they

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:03.490
could--

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:05.860
that there is this
untapped market.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.870
I think that they
refuse to acknowledge

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:12.100
that there is an untapped market
because I have come to believe,

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:15.430
after being told for 30 years
that nobody's interested-- this

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:18.130
is what I believe the
biggest concern is

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:19.630
on key decision-makers.

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.370
And I want to hear what you say.

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:25.900
I think the biggest "fear" is
not that no one is interested.

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.660
But that if the audience
were given half a chance,

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.930
and women's sports were
promoted anywhere near the way

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:35.590
that men's sports were
reported, far too many people

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:36.949
would be interested.

00:55:36.949 --> 00:55:38.740
And then they would no
longer be the center

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:42.190
of the universe monopolizing,
again, this enormously

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:44.080
important institution.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.940
So I really want
us to stop thinking

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.430
about this in terms
of they're undervalued

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:50.890
and they're underutilized.

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:53.620
Because I think that
that's exactly what

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:57.830
they're supposed to be, so that
we continue to be marginalized.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.411
So I don't know how you
want to react to that.

00:56:00.411 --> 00:56:02.410
- I think there's something
to be said for that.

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:04.690
At the same time, I
think the money really

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:05.800
does speak for itself.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:09.400
If you talk to these people
one-on-one-- and they're

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.480
not just male executives.

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.310
There are women in
management positions

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:14.470
who really do wish
that they could do more

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:17.710
to prioritize women's
games and air them more.

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:19.690
And they really do feel
hampered by the fact

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:21.610
that this is how
we've done things,

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:23.560
and this is how we've
been making our money,

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.500
and we can't see a future
in which this is changed.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.040
I think there is something to
be said for the power structure

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.920
because that's who is
making these decisions.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.310
If you had more women in
team and team executive,

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:41.140
league executive, editorial ,
executive management executive,

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.260
advertising executive positions,
then I think you would start

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.310
to see that sea change.

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:46.300
And I think you do--

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.841
when you finally do have a woman
in the room-- how many times

00:56:48.841 --> 00:56:50.980
have we seen an ad or
a programming decision

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.050
and thought, there was no woman
in the room when that happened.

00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:58.401
And I think that that's
really a function of that.

00:56:58.401 --> 00:56:58.900
- Yeah.

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.690
But again, I want to push
back just a little bit

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:05.354
and say we've never given
women's sports the opportunity

00:57:05.354 --> 00:57:07.270
to be covered in the way
that men's sports are

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:10.540
covered to see if there would
be a financial advantage.

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:14.530
And so, I mean, again, it does
become this chicken and egg.

00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:18.370
And I would ask us to think
about what powerful forces are

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:21.760
at work that would prevent key
decision-makers from really

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.490
acting against their
own financial interests.

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:26.560
That's my only argument.

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.970
- If I could.

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:30.310
It's a great way to put
the question, I think,

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:31.780
because for me it's part--

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.940
I don't know as much
about the financial side

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.580
or how decisions are
made behind the closed

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.890
doors of media organizations.

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:41.410
But to me, I think
it's really important

00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:43.600
to think about gender
and sport and gender

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.950
in sports media in terms of
broader, historical power

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:50.140
relations between women and men.

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.400
And the ways in which--

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.490
sport as we know it
as an institution

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:57.430
really took shape in
the mid-20th century.

00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:03.880
And football emerges at a time,
in the post-World War II era,

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:09.640
when they were at least trying
to send Rosie the Riveter home

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.450
and re-asserting a gendered
public domestic split.

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:16.836
And then, within a couple
decades, feminism emerges.

00:58:16.836 --> 00:58:18.460
And I think it's
right around that time

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.500
that football becomes
more and more popular,

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.000
as Mariah Burton
Nelson pointed out

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.560
with that great
title of her book,

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.560
The Stronger Women Get,
The More Men Love Football.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.300
And I think there's something--

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:33.340
I interviewed a male
former athlete years ago.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.400
And one quote that stuck in my
head and I've used many times

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.400
in things that I've
written is a guy who

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.470
I ask him about his workplace.

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:42.961
He hadn't played
sports for years.

00:58:42.961 --> 00:58:44.710
And he worked in a
professional workplace.

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:48.640
And I asked him if he had women
working at his level or higher.

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.510
And he said, "Look.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:52.374
A woman can do the same job as
me and maybe even be my boss.

00:58:52.374 --> 00:58:54.790
But I'll be damned if she can
go out on the football field

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:57.140
and take a hit
from Ronnie Lott--"

00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:59.890
that great defensive back
who was known for exploding

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:01.150
people with his body.

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.889
And if you could
have seen this guy,

00:59:02.889 --> 00:59:04.930
you would have realized
that he too couldn't have

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:07.160
taken a hit from Ronnie Lott.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.570
And about 99.99%
of men could not

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:12.306
have taken a hit
from Ronnie Lott

00:59:12.306 --> 00:59:13.430
and lived to tell about it.

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:17.710
But Ronnie Lott existed
for him as a media image

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:22.200
to which he attached a sort of
ideology of male superiority.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:25.200
And sport, then, came
to be this institution--

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.850
and especially
mediated sport-- came

00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:29.660
to be this institution
that reinforced

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.880
this binary and this hierarchy
between men and women.

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.170
And Mary Jo pointed out
with such a great article

00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:39.030
a number of years
ago that when women

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:42.330
start playing sport more
visibly, and we watch them,

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:44.400
and we support them,
what's revealed

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.160
is not that women and men
are from Mars and Venus

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.790
and very separate and totally
categorically different.

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:53.340
But instead there's this
continuum of difference

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.220
that's revealed empirically
between the abilities

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.290
of women's and men's bodies.

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:05.460
That knowledge is very
threatening to an entrenched

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:09.090
system of male entitlement.

01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:13.845
And I'm really happy to--

01:00:13.845 --> 01:00:15.720
some people were talking
earlier this morning

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.100
about what's it like--

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.950
Laila Ali was talking
what's it like for her son

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.620
to see competent girls
playing alongside.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.530
And I had this experience
when my sons were growing up.

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:28.380
My younger son, I took them
all to all the USC women's

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.660
basketball games with me
for a number of years.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.730
And I think there's a
whole generation of boys

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:36.114
that have grown up seeing and
even playing alongside girls

01:00:36.114 --> 01:00:38.280
who are extremely competent,
and sometimes just beat

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.946
their butts at whatever
they're playing.

01:00:39.946 --> 01:00:43.140
And it's the greatest
experience for a boy to have.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.570
But as long as the mass
media isn't covering

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:49.290
this in any way that's
equitable or symmetrical,

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:53.670
then all of those kinds
of gains on some level--

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:55.080
because social
change takes place

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.370
at the interpersonal level,
at the structural level,

01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:59.980
and at the sort of symbolic,
institutional level.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.430
If it's not happening
at the symbolic level,

01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:05.820
then in some ways it's
really just not happening.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.530
So to me, that's why
it's so important

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.620
to think about the media
coverage of women in sports,

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.340
in part because of fairness.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.660
If men have a right to do one
thing and get paid for it,

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.130
women should too.

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:19.680
But for me, it's because
media coverage of women

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.170
is part of this broader
system that's really in flux,

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:28.320
but it ultimately has to do with
the ways we think essentially

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.450
about women's and
men's bodies as being

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:34.250
different and
inferior and superior.

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.440
- And I just wanted
to add that--

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.000
I do a lot of my research
in Korea and Asia.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.370
And in many of these
contexts, women

01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:48.030
are a large part of
the media coverage

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:50.440
because they are
symbols of the nation.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.150
And I think that connection
is important to think

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:58.020
about in terms of why
women's coverage rises

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:02.760
during the Olympics and whether
being a symbol of the nation

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.570
then supersedes the
fact that they're women.

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:09.750
And it makes it acceptable
during the Olympics.

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:12.210
And so I think that
it's important to think

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:18.756
about the ways in which gender
and nation work in sports.

01:02:18.756 --> 01:02:19.830
- I-- well, go ahead.

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:20.910
- I just wanted
to add onto that.

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:22.951
It's a great point that
came up a couple of times

01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:24.840
earlier today in a
different sort of way.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.300
In the ways that, in
the United States,

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.520
coverage of women athletes
just really spikes

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.390
during the Olympics.

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:32.520
And we suddenly have
these female heroines

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.340
that we all know and
become household names.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.344
And people sometimes
get very hopeful

01:02:37.344 --> 01:02:38.760
that that's going
to kind of spill

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.100
over after the Olympics ends.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.030
But it doesn't.

01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:45.750
It seems to just kind of
evaporate back to a baseline

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.440
again.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.750
And I've wondered how
and why that happens.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.430
And I'd love to
hear from people who

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:52.638
work within the media about
how and why that happens.

01:02:52.638 --> 01:02:54.760
But for me, what it says--

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:01.600
the story it tells to me is
that nationalism trumps sexism.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.750
And I hate to use that
word as a verb now,

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.810
but it still works I think.

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:12.210
That somehow the way the
media coverage of women

01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:14.430
happens between
all these Olympiads

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.500
is just shot through
with all this sexism.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:19.020
But suddenly when we
have, quote, "our girls,"

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:22.020
who are going to go
and win medals for us,

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.350
and that we can all identify
in a nationalistic sort of way

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:28.290
with them, then suddenly
they become people

01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:32.610
that we identify with and
lavish a lot of attention upon.

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:34.890
- But I think that
happens because it's safe.

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:36.060
It's every four years.

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.560
And it's not football.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.320
And so I mean, I think that
that's in a safe space,

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.950
to be able to do that
where nationalism--

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.990
I don't want to
say trumps either--

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:47.790
trumps sexism.

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.520
I wanted to just-- we have 30
seconds before we open this up.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.490
I wanted to ask
Rachael a question.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:04:00.420
I assume that no male
Korean golfers have surgery.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.780
Is that-- and the other
question that I have is

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.920
is there any backlash
or feminist critique

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.910
of these surgeries in
Korea and South Korea?

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:14.190
- I think increasingly,
men are doing it.

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.940
- They are.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:22.640
- If they are in a media, like
a visible arena, a visual arena,

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.260
it's increasingly
acceptable for men.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:31.430
And it's interesting because the
critique is less about gender

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:35.300
as it is about opportunity,
economic opportunity.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:40.940
And so it's seen as a way
to advance opportunity

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.270
in an economy where
visual images are

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:46.760
so important to
one's opportunities.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:54.050
So I think that there
is the gender critique.

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:57.050
But I think that
many-- even feminists

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:59.930
think that it's more
important to think about why

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.750
is the economy such
that individuals feel

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:03.965
that they have to do this.

01:05:03.965 --> 01:05:06.080
- Interesting.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.990
Well, we now want to open
it up to the audience.

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:12.410
And we would welcome
your questions.

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:15.710
Please just as a reminder,
just tell us who you are

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:18.840
and focus on the question.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.340
- Hi.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.131
My name is Deborah.

01:05:20.131 --> 01:05:21.020
I'm a Harvard alumna.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.240
But I'm here today
in my capacity

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.400
working with a small, all
women's college in the area who

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:31.000
is considering starting a
sports management concentration.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.600
We've been doing
a lot of research

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.480
and would love to
infuse the curriculum

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.830
with this perspective.

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:39.320
We want to graduate
women who are not

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.760
only competitive
in the marketplace,

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.470
but also will be change agents.

01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:46.089
If you had to make one or
two suggestions about what

01:05:46.089 --> 01:05:47.630
you would like to
see in a curriculum

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:50.522
for specifically women going
into sports management,

01:05:50.522 --> 01:05:51.230
what would it be?

01:05:53.882 --> 01:05:56.982
- I think that they should read
the work that Mike and I do.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:02.620
I actually-- when I first
got out of graduate school,

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.560
I taught in sport
management programs.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.447
I think, again, it's central
to doing a gendered analysis

01:06:09.447 --> 01:06:10.530
of what is happening here.

01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:14.460
And I always take
everything back to power.

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:17.312
And the reason that
I say that is--

01:06:17.312 --> 01:06:19.770
folks here in New England are
going to remember this story.

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:21.270
We talked about it at lunch.

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:25.410
Where a sports reporter for
the New England Patriots

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:27.150
was sexually harassed
in the locker room.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.410
Her name was Lisa Olson.

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:30.330
And I remembered
sitting at NASSM,

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:33.000
which is the North American
Society for Sport Management's

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.690
professional organization.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:38.280
And everyone was deploring
how horrible this was.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.720
And it was horrible.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.210
But the punch line from all
of the sort of academics

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:44.760
and scholars was, this is
horrible because nobody

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.950
benefits when this
kind of thing happens.

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:49.927
And I thought, no,
that's not true actually.

01:06:49.927 --> 01:06:51.510
Men benefit when
these kinds of things

01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:53.670
happen because then women don't
want to go into those locker

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:56.370
rooms, and women don't want
to go into those professions.

01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:59.310
And so I think
that that would be,

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:01.350
I would hope, central
to any sort of analysis

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.570
in a sport management
curriculum.

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:06.990
I don't know if you
all want to say.

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:10.050
- I will say that it was
a class that I lobbied

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:12.300
to take at the School of
Sports Management at Columbia

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.030
when I was a freshmen that
is the reason that I am here

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.336
today.

01:07:16.336 --> 01:07:18.210
It was called the
Sociohistorical Foundations

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.870
of American Sport,
and it basically

01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:24.900
taught me about how sports could
be used as a cultural lens.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.810
And that's basically how I
approach every single one

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.480
of my writings right now.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.640
It was incredible to put what
can seem kind of frivolous

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.530
into historical context.

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:41.580
And simple things, like
baseball specialization

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.540
accompanying the assembly line,
and seeing how that was just

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.890
reflected in our nation's
history and global history

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:49.470
in some ways too.

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:52.207
I think that that could
be really important.

01:07:52.207 --> 01:07:53.790
As far as the sexual
harassment thing,

01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:55.665
I've been sexually
harassed in a locker room.

01:07:55.665 --> 01:07:57.900
And it's never stopped me
from going back in, so.

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.816
- Thank you very much.

01:07:58.816 --> 01:08:01.302
- Thank you.

01:08:01.302 --> 01:08:02.070
- Hi.

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:03.690
My name's David Tannenwald.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:05.640
I'm a freelance
writer in Cambridge,

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.070
and I really enjoyed
the discussion.

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:09.840
And one of the
things that struck me

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.300
is that politics is a
big theme in all this.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.050
There were jokes about Trump,
talk about nationalism.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:20.220
And I was curious what you
think about comparing inequity

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.200
in sports journalism
with journalism

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.819
in the political
arena, particularly

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:25.330
after the presidential election.

01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:25.890
Is it better?

01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:26.390
Is it worse?

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.254
Is it more of the same?

01:08:29.254 --> 01:08:31.395
- Go ahead.

01:08:31.395 --> 01:08:33.660
- I think it's worse
in sports journalism.

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:37.500
I think it's the worst in
tech and finance journalism.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.800
Politics actually tends to
have a little bit more parity

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.720
than the rest of journalism,
that isn't culture and fashion.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.630
And that's not to denigrate
culture and fashion journalism,

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:50.520
by the way.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:56.880
I think that it's harder to be
a woman in sports journalism

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.412
with an eye toward
politics, which is kind

01:09:00.412 --> 01:09:01.620
of how I approach my writing.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.800
But it's a really fine
line, especially when

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.990
you're not a freelancer.

01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:10.979
But I think that it's
definitely harder in sports.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.990
And there are just fewer of us.

01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:14.760
If you look at the
White House press pool,

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.740
there are more than two women.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:20.226
If you go to a press conference
after a game as a woman,

01:09:20.226 --> 01:09:22.100
you'll notice if there's
another woman there.

01:09:25.572 --> 01:09:27.556
- Thanks.

01:09:27.556 --> 01:09:31.524
- Thank you.

01:09:31.524 --> 01:09:34.250
- Walter Harper, anthropologist.

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:38.660
I'd like to ask a two-pronged,
just one question.

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.850
It concerns or focuses
on the Williams sisters.

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:47.560
Is my sentiment that
what they both experience

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.510
is as bad, if not
worse, than what

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:52.810
Jackie Robinson experienced
when he broke into baseball?

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:56.170
I don't-- I'm just of
the impression that there

01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:57.700
hasn't been enough
said about it,

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.520
especially when they say that
they look like a man or they

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.780
are men.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.420
And then secondly,
what about the racism

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.720
against the Euro-American
women, or the European women,

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.070
that they play against?

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:11.170
It seems to me,
on many occasions,

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:14.260
that their racism is as bad
as what outside people are

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.200
saying outside of tennis
regarding the Williams sisters.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.730
I haven't seen any journalists
say enough about it.

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:24.520
I've never seen a big
ad in the New York Times

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.870
saying this has to stop.

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:28.340
This is just unacceptable.

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.010
And that's why I'm
asking the question.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.130
- Panelists.

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:38.669
- I'll have to ask
for clarification

01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:40.210
on the second part
of it in a second.

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:42.850
But as far as Jackie
versus Venus and Serena,

01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:45.010
I think if you look at
how the media has treated

01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:48.280
Venus versus Serena, it kind
of highlights the racism

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.420
that they've experienced.

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.730
Which is Venus did
everything right,

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:54.386
the way that Jackie kind of had
to take everything in stride.

01:10:54.386 --> 01:10:55.510
He had to be the gentleman.

01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:59.290
He had to put his head down
and just play the game and win.

01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:02.230
Venus is naturally
just a quieter person.

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:04.040
She's not a showy--

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.090
but the word that's often
bandied about is she's elegant,

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:08.350
and she's classy.

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:11.330
And the subtext is Serena's not.

01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:14.250
Serena's a showy,
passionate person.

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.750
And that's one of the reasons
she's such a great competitor.

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.550
And both of them are
incredible winners.

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:20.380
But I think that if you look
at the different treatment,

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.510
and if you talk to fans who
don't think that they're racist

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:24.370
and hate Serena but
love Venus, there's

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:26.110
a very distinct reason there.

01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:27.850
And that's because
of the expectation

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:31.064
for black people,
especially black women,

01:11:31.064 --> 01:11:32.980
to keep their head down
and their mouths shut,

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:35.455
even when they're winning
at the levels that they are.

01:11:35.455 --> 01:11:38.350
- Well, I also think you can't
separate the fact that you have

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:40.540
two very different body types.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:43.600
And when you look at Serena
Williams and her body type,

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.340
it's enormously threatening to
what a woman's body should look

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:50.110
like, even as a tennis player.

01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:55.180
And she has been resolutely
unapologetic about her body

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.220
and about her power.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:58.670
And I admire her
greatly for that.

01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:02.770
But I also think that is also
a huge difference between how

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:05.985
Serena versus Venus
Williams is covered.

01:12:05.985 --> 01:12:08.140
- But that's my whole point.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:12.430
What's the difference then
between Serena and Sarah

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:13.694
Baartman?

01:12:13.694 --> 01:12:15.610
I mean this has been
going on for a long time.

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:16.110
- Yeah.

01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:18.990
- But what concerns me is
there hasn't been, to me,

01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:21.430
enough sentiment saying
that this has to stop and is

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:25.120
acceptable, especially when
little African-American girls

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.842
could be seeing all of this.

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:29.050
And that might prompt them
not to want to play tennis

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:29.841
to go through that.

01:12:29.841 --> 01:12:30.770
- Yeah, I agree.

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:31.270
- Thank you.

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:34.870
- So I write about
this almost every week.

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:37.210
I've probably written 17
articles about the treatment

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:38.110
that Serena's had.

01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:39.680
- And I've read
a couple of them,

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.930
but I don't think it's enough.

01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:42.274
- Well.

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:44.000
- I've read a couple.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.435
But thank you very much.

01:12:45.435 --> 01:12:46.190
- Thank you.

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:49.690
- Hi.

01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:51.130
My name's Barbara Wolfinger.

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:53.740
I'm a retired mathematician
from North Andover.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:59.530
But I happened to watch
the semifinal UConn game,

01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:03.760
and I rooted for UConn
being from Connecticut.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.940
And I was disappointed they
lost, but very excited.

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.850
I mean, an incredible
game, so much so

01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:14.770
that I even had to watch the
final and root for Mississippi.

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:15.920
Lost again.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.260
But my question actually
relates to a question

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:23.200
posed by one of the
talking heads ESPN shows.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.700
I can't keep them all straight.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.590
My husband has them
on all the time.

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:28.880
Posed a year ago.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.272
And the question was-- and
I was shocked at the time--

01:13:32.272 --> 01:13:38.620
is UConn women's basketball
team bad for women's sports.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:42.280
And the statistics
quoted earlier about

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.410
how many people
watched the semifinals,

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:47.500
and it was because UConn lost.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.260
And how they lost, and how
exciting it was, and then

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:54.580
how exciting it made the
final game because UConn lost.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.390
At least that's
how I interpret it.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:01.120
So it made me think back a
year ago to that question.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.570
Did the dynasty that
UConn represent end

01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:06.940
up being bad for women's sports?

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.970
So I'd be interested
in your opinions.

01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:12.060
- I'll just take one
first crack at that,

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.720
and then others can chime in.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.095
Thank you for that question too.

01:14:15.095 --> 01:14:16.720
I've been paying
attention to that too.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.600
People have been saying
that about the UConn women's

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.530
program.

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:24.700
And as someone who has been
watching college basketball

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:28.150
since long before the
rise of the women's game,

01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:31.630
I remember very fondly
admiring so much

01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:35.110
the UCLA men's
basketball dynasty when

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:37.930
Lew Alcindor and others
were playing, later

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:40.120
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.870
And they didn't win quite as
many championships in a row

01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:43.770
as UConn did.

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:48.000
But for a decade or 12 years,
they were almost always there

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.362
and won almost all the time and
had a long, long win streak.

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:53.070
I don't remember
anybody ever saying this

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:54.290
is bad for men's basketball.

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:55.735
Of course just
bad for basketball

01:14:55.735 --> 01:14:57.360
because they wouldn't
even think-- it's

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.700
just men's basketball
at that time.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:04.380
And so my sense is that
UConn women's basketball team

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:10.410
has raised the profile of
women's basketball greatly.

01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:13.770
And yeah, I mean, I'm happy
that Mississippi State beat them

01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:16.470
because I'd just kind of gotten
on with their story line.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:20.310
I was happy about them having
watched them against Baylor.

01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:22.767
But maybe it's good
for basketball,

01:15:22.767 --> 01:15:23.850
too, that they got beaten.

01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:25.433
And probably they'll
be back next year

01:15:25.433 --> 01:15:27.090
and start a big,
long streak again.

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:29.490
But they're not going away.

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:33.240
So I think it's a
double standard that's

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.670
placed on a really high quality
program that, in my view,

01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:39.840
probably-- and probably it'll
be really clear in retrospect

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.270
that this is something that
brought women's basketball up

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:43.140
to another level.

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:43.860
- Yeah.

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:45.570
And I would go with the whole--

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:47.910
not only the UCLA John
Wooden comparison,

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:51.300
but the notion of a rising
tide lifts all boats.

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.640
And one of the great things
that we love about sports

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.700
is a David and Goliath story.

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.410
And that's exactly what we had.

01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:05.010
And the fact that Mississippi
State beat them was phenomenal.

01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:09.030
And that would not have been
an iconic moment had they just

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:11.250
beaten any other
team but Connecticut

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:13.710
because nobody thought that
anybody would beat Connecticut,

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:16.500
and certainly not
Mississippi State.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:20.760
So I mean, I think Geno
and they've been great

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.080
for women's basketball.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.860
- And I just wanted to add that
the coverage of the UConn fans,

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:30.626
I think, has done a
lot for women's sports.

01:16:30.626 --> 01:16:35.230
Because they're just as rabid
and excited as any other fans.

01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:35.910
- Yeah.

01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:37.710
I started to talk about this,
and then I ran out of time.

01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:39.876
I had about a page and a
half left of things to say.

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:43.830
It's the same thing with Serena.

01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:45.360
It's the same thing with UConn.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.760
The argument is that the
field isn't good enough.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.960
The sport isn't good enough.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.130
And honestly, we don't see that.

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:53.446
As Mary Jo and
Michael pointed out,

01:16:53.446 --> 01:16:55.570
we don't see that argument
made about Duke and UNC.

01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:57.861
When was the last time we
had a Sweet 16 without either

01:16:57.861 --> 01:16:59.340
of those teams in there?

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.260
Actually there was a statistic.

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:02.040
I wrote it down.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.380
22 current NBA
players went to Duke.

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.600
That's 5.5% of the league.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.970
So Duke is bad for basketball.

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:10.140
Are we going to
start saying that?

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:12.090
It's only ever used
against the woman.

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:14.520
It's only ever used
against Serena and UConn.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.640
I will say that
we love the drama.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.260
We love the upset, absolutely.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.970
And that did help.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.560
It will help in recruiting.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.351
And I think that
because you now have--

01:17:25.351 --> 01:17:26.850
and again this goes
back to my point

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:29.340
that the solution
here to strengthen

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.740
the field isn't to
completely dismiss the sport

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.750
or to blame the dominant team.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.400
It's to try and
elevate the coverage.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.340
Because the coverage was
elevated because the drama

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:39.660
was so compelling.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:42.960
You're now going to have high
school women's basketball

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.330
players considering
Mississippi State,

01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:47.910
considering committing to
Mississippi State instead

01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:50.917
of maybe UConn-- or not instead
of, but in addition to--

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:53.250
because now they know they
have another school that they

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:55.372
could possibly win a title at.

01:17:55.372 --> 01:17:56.170
- Great.

01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:56.670
Thank you.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.760
- Hi.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.710
I'm Arlen Baron.

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:04.290
I'm a senior at
Clark University.

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:07.470
I'm extremely interested
in sports radio.

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:10.530
And more often than not,
that's very marketed

01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:15.210
towards the male [INAUDIBLE]
and can often be very crude.

01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:19.980
And how would you break
the stigmatization

01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:22.390
of women's sports and
incorporate that even

01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:26.585
in that kind of
crude atmosphere?

01:18:26.585 --> 01:18:30.150
- So The Trifecta airs
between noon and 3:00

01:18:30.150 --> 01:18:32.130
every Saturday on ESPN Radio.

01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:35.040
And it's hosted by Jane McManus,
Sarah Spain, and Kate Fagan,

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.290
and occasionally yours truly.

01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:40.830
And I think that it's
really starting to get--

01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:42.870
I mean, the show itself
is very successful.

01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:45.800
Overall, we are having
a lot more exposure

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.770
of female voices, both on
television and on radio.

01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:52.950
We see Jemele Hill is co-hosting
SportsCenter at 6:00 every day

01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:54.120
right now.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.910
I don't know what the
actual solution is, other

01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:58.680
than to just give us a chance.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.695
And we don't always talk
about women's sports.

01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:03.484
It's probably not even the
majority of what we talk about.

01:19:03.484 --> 01:19:05.400
But we talk about them
when they're definitely

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.690
worth talking about it.

01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:10.050
And you won't get that
coverage elsewhere.

01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:13.980
- There's a sports studies
scholar, David Nylund,

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:18.200
who's written a book
on sports talk radio.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.070
And what did somebody
earlier today call it?

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:22.740
Sports screaming radio or
something, I can't remember.

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.040
But looking at it, I
mentioned earlier sort

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.560
of that I've been thinking
about SportsCenter

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.020
as a kind of symbolic man
cave, I think, in some ways.

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:38.400
And Nylund's analysis of sports
talk radio is kind of that too.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.180
It's a place where
guys go to get--

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.700
not just kind of to have
fun, just to talk sports.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.910
But what's happening
below the surface

01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:51.570
is having certain narrow
conceptions of masculinity

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:55.800
reinforced through their
banter with each other.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.860
So I've been a couple of times
invited to come on those shows.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:03.160
And I did once,
and I regretted it.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:08.160
And so call me weak-kneed, but
I say no thank you from now on.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.662
I'm not going on those shows.

01:20:09.662 --> 01:20:10.870
- And I won't do them either.

01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:11.550
I won't.

01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:13.270
It's just not worth it.

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:15.270
- I think it also matters
if it's a call-in show

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.936
and if it's not.

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:17.477
Because the ones
that aren't tend

01:20:17.477 --> 01:20:19.560
to have more thoughtful
voices, and they tend to--

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.810
and the call-in shows
are literally just fans.

01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:23.851
And this is what goes back
to the man cave thing.

01:20:23.851 --> 01:20:27.660
A lot of what's wrong with the
male sports fan and the way

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:30.090
that we cater to him
is that he thinks

01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.490
of these athletes as
substitutes for himself

01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:33.990
and his own failed ambitions.

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:36.210
And he can't do that with women.

01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:39.570
So when we don't
have call-in shows,

01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:42.150
we don't have Joe from
Staten Island calling

01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:44.100
to yell about the
Knicks, then we tend

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.280
to have more serious discourse.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.940
- We have time for
one more question.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:50.792
- Hi, there.

01:20:50.792 --> 01:20:52.000
Thank you all for being here.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.220
It's been really great.

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.010
My name's Connor.

01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:55.520
I go to Tufts University.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.570
I'm majoring in film
and media studies

01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:00.540
and minoring in sociology,
so this has been perfect.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.640
I have a question
for Miss Davidson

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.560
but also for the whole panel.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.630
I was wondering how
you would respond

01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:10.970
to the initial backlash of
espnW because it's obviously

01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:12.720
a subset of ESPN?

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.720
And does that contribute to
othering women continually

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.470
because there's obviously
not espnM or something?

01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:20.899
- So this is a really
interesting question.

01:21:20.899 --> 01:21:23.190
And this is something that
we have internal discussions

01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:24.840
about all the time.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:29.111
The initial criticism of
creating W--and I was nowhere

01:21:29.111 --> 01:21:29.610
near this.

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:30.210
I was still at--

01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:31.320
I don't even think
I was at Bloomberg.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.400
I think I was in college
when this happened.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:38.040
But was that it would create
a, quote, "pink ghetto"

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.530
for women's sports and for
women's sports coverage

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:42.740
because it would be
siloed somewhere else.

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:45.240
And the answer to that, and
what we've seen in the numbers--

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:49.050
and I think I originally did
conceptualize that happening.

01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:51.300
What we've actually
seen bear out

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:54.727
is that yes, a lot of the
women's content stays on W,

01:21:54.727 --> 01:21:56.310
doesn't get promoted
on the home page,

01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:58.320
doesn't get read
by the general fan.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.740
But that content wouldn't
exist at all if W didn't exist.

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:06.570
And the content that is of
higher interest that does get

01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:07.440
pushed out--

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.370
my columns, Jane's
columns, all the coverage

01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:12.120
about women's basketball,
Mechelle Voepel,

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:16.200
our amazing basketball
correspondent--

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.180
would not make it
to the front page

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:22.170
if we didn't have a W.
We also wouldn't have

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.520
certain SportsCenter things.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.610
We did a thing.

01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:28.320
The ESPN the Magazine and W's--

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.690
W's editor-in-chief
became the editor-in-chief

01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:33.150
of ESPN the Magazine last
year, Alison Overholt.

01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:35.430
She was the first
woman ever to be

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:37.980
the editor-in-chief of a
sports magazine, a major sports

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:39.210
magazine.

01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:41.700
Did a 20th anniversary
cover for the WNBA

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.227
that was nominated for
a major magazine award.

01:22:44.227 --> 01:22:45.810
That wouldn't have
happened without W.

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:47.370
That wouldn't have happened
without leadership like

01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:47.870
Alison's.

01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:51.120
So I do see that
criticism, and we

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.410
do have a ways to go to make
our content more visible.

01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:57.210
But I think that that
content wouldn't even

01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:59.160
exist if we didn't have a W.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.160
- Thank you.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.970
- Well, I want to thank
all the panelists.

01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:04.443
They were fabulous.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.304
And also the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced

01:23:13.304 --> 01:23:14.470
Study at Harvard University.

01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:16.540
Again, it's meant a
lot to me, as somebody

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.520
who's been doing
this 30 years, to be

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.810
invited to a place like this to
have this kind of a conference.

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:23.520
- Thank you.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.290
And it's our honor
to have you guys.

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:27.630
I'm Janet Rich-Edwards.

01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:30.930
I am the director of life
sciences here at Radcliffe.

01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:32.880
And it's my pleasure
to be able to do

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.490
a couple minutes of
wrap-up before we send you

01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:38.520
to the reception.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.200
We've covered a lot
of ground today.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.230
We started with
Egyptian stickball,

01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:46.560
with women handing
bouquets to male athletes,

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.380
and got to a place today where
we had Laila Ali and Christine

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:53.910
Brennan I think agreeing
that the glass is half full.

01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:57.600
And I will say that for
women of a certain age,

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.820
we've seen a lot of change.

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:04.690
I can tell you that in
1970, small town Ohio,

01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:09.060
where I was eight years old, I
really wanted to play baseball.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:12.900
I loved the smell of the
gloves, the sound of that ball.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:15.810
But they wouldn't let
a girl on the team.

01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:19.560
So instead, I took
baton twirling lessons.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.590
My little sister, two
years younger than I am,

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:24.317
got on that team.

01:24:24.317 --> 01:24:24.900
It's very sad.

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:27.690
She still can't twirl a baton.

01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:30.450
But it's made a big
difference in her life.

01:24:30.450 --> 01:24:36.360
And I can say that my daughters,
45 years after Title IX,

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.330
are division 1 rowers
and marathon runners.

01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:44.020
And those girls are not just
visiting, to use your words.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.270
I thought that was great.

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:49.650
But this social
change is incomplete.

01:24:49.650 --> 01:24:53.100
Women make up 55% of
our college students,

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.060
but 43% of our college
athletes, we learned today.

01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:03.180
I was shocked that 43% of
NCAA teams, of women's teams,

01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:05.450
are coached by women, only that.

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:11.080
And that only one out of five
athletic directors is a woman.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.830
More depressing still, that
2% of coverage of sports

01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:18.550
is apparently coverage
of women athletes.

01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:21.309
It is good news that it's less
sexualized and trivialized

01:25:21.309 --> 01:25:22.100
than it used to be.

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:25.000
So that's progress, but there's
a long ways to go there.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.120
I think even in our bright
spot every four years,

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.730
the Olympics-- where recently
half of the athletes were

01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:34.120
women, where the gold medals for
men weigh the same as the gold

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:37.840
medals for women, and where
we get decent coverage--

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.130
even there, 38% of the national
flag bearers are women.

01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:44.660
A baton twirler
would notice that.

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.800
And only 11% of the heads of
the national missions, the Chef

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.580
de Mission, are women.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.050
So it strikes me that this
is something of a pipeline.

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:58.210
It's a pipeline like
we see for academics,

01:25:58.210 --> 01:25:59.520
for women in academics.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.680
But it's a pipeline we
cannot take for granted.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.240
We need women as athletes, as
the role models that they are,

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.520
whether they want to be or not.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.750
We need mentors.

01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:11.980
We need coaches.

01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:14.440
We talked today
about speaking up.

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.032
We talked about the
roles of parents,

01:26:16.032 --> 01:26:17.740
and a special shout-out
a couple of times

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.609
to the role of fathers.

01:26:19.609 --> 01:26:21.400
We've talked about the
athletes themselves,

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.910
the current athletes speaking
up and the former athletes--

01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:28.630
I think an increasingly vocal
and important voice both

01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:31.570
to promote the sport, but
also to warn us of the dangers

01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:34.780
we heard about today, the sort
of dark side of athletics--

01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:39.400
the injuries, the
doping, the pressure.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.910
We've heard many calls
today to generate

01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:45.250
more data, more
hard evidence that

01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:49.720
will serve to ignite advocacy,
data about who is watching,

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.525
data about who is playing, and
data-- if Parissa Safai's still

01:26:53.525 --> 01:26:58.690
here-- about who is not playing,
which is very important.

01:26:58.690 --> 01:27:02.350
I was also struck by our need
to lawyer up, the importance

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.930
not only of legislation
but of regulations.

01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:07.240
The devil is in these details.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.070
That's very important
for us as advocates

01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:11.410
and a role for leadership.

01:27:11.410 --> 01:27:13.240
And, of course, the
media, media that

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.090
destabilizes these
boxes of sex and gender.

01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:18.662
And the role of
places like espnW,

01:27:18.662 --> 01:27:20.620
which gets more coverage,
which will eventually

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:21.894
generate more interest.

01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:30.260
I also very much liked
our rights-based framing.

01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:33.740
As Stephanie Wheeler said, the
right to get to that starting

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:34.850
line--

01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:37.940
whether it's disability, your
gender, or, as Parissa Safai

01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:39.980
said, about poverty.

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:44.150
The right to true sport and
the right to safe sport,

01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:49.430
these are communal,
socially-determined access, not

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:53.300
frills for the powerful
and the privileged.

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:54.770
And we talked about sports--

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:55.655
I was moved by this.

01:27:55.655 --> 01:27:59.920
This was Anita
DeFrantz's comment.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.120
Sports is an expression
of the humanity of spirit.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:07.180
We talked about it being a zone
of excellence where confidence

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:10.450
and respect prevail, where
there's a sense of community,

01:28:10.450 --> 01:28:14.450
and also of sport as a
microcosm of our world.

01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:16.930
So at the end of
today, I hope we

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:20.980
go away inspired to enjoy
our rights, to protect them,

01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:24.100
to advance them, and to
cheer at the top of our lungs

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.900
for our right to sport.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.350
So thank you so much
for coming today.

01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:31.000
Thank you to our many panelists,
who just hit the ball out

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:31.900
of the park.

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:35.550
