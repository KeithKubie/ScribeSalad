00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.650
We left off in the last
video in the Archean Eon.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.700
And "arche" comes
from ancient Greek.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.010
It means beginning or origin.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.530
And it's the eon in which either
life first started to exist

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.870
or at least it first start
to somewhat flourish.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.170
It's possible that
maybe life first

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.470
started to exist at the
end of the Hadeon Eon.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.920
And, of course, this
boundary is vague.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.210
And the Archean Eon
is also the first eon

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.750
where we still have
rocks from that time.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.750
So we are able to find
rocks that we can date

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.340
to be roughly 3.8 billion years.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.560
Now, the other really
interesting thing

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.935
that happened in
the Archean Eon,

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.870
and it really has
pretty profound effects

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.640
once we get into
the Proterozoic Eon,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.795
is that you started to have
cyanobacteria produce oxygen.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.950
And we said in the last video
that they were producing

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.960
oxygen, but most
of that oxygen was

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.690
being absorbed by
iron in the oceans.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.230
But what happens is we enter
into the Proterozoic Eon.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.817
And Proterozoic Eon,
it's right over here.

00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:01.150
I don't know if you can see it .

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.350
I'll rewrite it, Proterozoic.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.730
We're now in the
Proterozoic Eon that

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.460
starts up about 2.5
billion years ago.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.940
And "proterozoic" comes from
the Greek for earlier life.

00:01:22.404 --> 00:01:23.570
And I'm not a Greek scholar.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.190
So any of you Greeks
out there, forgive me

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.840
if I'm not getting the
translation exactly right.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.250
But what's really interesting
about the Proterozoic Eon

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.590
is that that oxygen
that was being produced

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.300
by the cyanobactera,
and at some point

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.020
begins to saturate the iron
and any other molecule that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.870
could have absorbed it before.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.290
And once it saturates,
it starts to get

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.200
released into the atmosphere.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.450
So the oxygen starts
to get released

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.915
and accumulate in
the atmosphere.

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:55.130
And we think this
started to happen

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.040
about 2.4 billion years ago.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.657
So 2.4 billion years
ago, oxygen begins

00:02:02.657 --> 00:02:03.990
to accumulate in the atmosphere.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.700
And, of course,
these dates, they

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.090
might be moved around a
few hundred million years

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.419
as we get more and more data.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.490
But this is the
current understanding

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.154
of when things happened.

00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:15.070
And maybe we'll look at
the geological record,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.403
or the fossil record, and
we'll move these things around

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.030
in the future.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.780
I can only imagine
that 50 years from now,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.530
or 100 years from now,
if someone is still

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.130
watching this
video, a lot of this

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.870
might say, hey,
we found out later

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.140
that oxygen started to
accumulate in the atmosphere

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.130
earlier or later
or that eukaryotes

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.270
occurred earlier or later.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.900
But this, as far
as I can tell, is

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.690
our best current understanding.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.840
But the 2.4 billion
years ago, oxygen

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.990
begins to accumulate
in the atmosphere.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.100
And what's interesting about
this is once it accumulates

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.636
and once it gets kind of a
critical amount of oxygen

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:54.010
in the atmosphere--
and I touched

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.580
on this in the last video--
about 2.3 billion years ago,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.390
we have something called
the Great Oxygenation Event,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.140
sometimes called the
Oxygen Catastrophe.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.210
And this is right here.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.070
They marked it this right
here, 2.3 billion years ago

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.780
or 2,300 million years ago,
atmosphere becomes oxygen rich.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.470
And it's not as oxygen rich
as our current atmosphere.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.220
But it becomes
oxygen rich enough

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.640
that at least the
environment becomes

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.009
suitable for eurkaryotic
organisms or eukaryotic cells.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.050
Now the other interesting
thing, and we might not

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.626
care so much about it
because we needed the oxygen,

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:33.250
is that we think that
this was actually

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.070
the greatest extinction event
in the history of Earth.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.100
That's why it's called
the Oxygen Catastrophe.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.730
So this right over here,
2.3 billion years ago-- I

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.670
shouldn't giggle about it--
this is a serious matter.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:55.550
This is the greatest extinction
event in Earth's history,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.860
in History.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.770
And I'll do history
with a capital H,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.700
in the history of the Earth.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.980
And that's because
the cyanobacteria

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.190
is producing all this oxygen.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.170
It eventually
saturates the iron.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.789
It accumulates in the air.

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.330
Once it gets to
enough concentration,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.663
it begins to actually suffocate.

00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:12.680
It's poisonous.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.339
It's poisonous to most
of the other organisms

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.850
on the planet that
were anaerobic,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.320
that did not need
oxygen, that actually

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.970
found oxygen poisonous.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.420
But since we have
oxygen, there's

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.100
two interesting things that
happened once that oxygen

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.120
accumulated, other than
causing this mass extinction

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.990
event-- actually three
interesting things.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.210
Two of them are crucial
to us eventually

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.140
showing up on this planet.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.370
The first is is that it became
suitable now for eukaryotes

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.110
to exist.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.970
Eukaryotic organisms,
remember, these

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.910
are organisms that have nuclear
membranes around their DNA.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.760
Most eukaryotes have other
organelles, like mitochondria.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.940
They need oxygen.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.010
You can go to the
biology playlist.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.840
We actually talk
about respiration

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.760
that occurs in the mitochondria.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.090
And that's obviously a
process that needs oxygen.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.979
So one, we have, now that
oxygen is in the atmosphere,

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.770
we're starting to have
an environment where

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.850
eukaryotes could at least exist.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.820
And based on the fossil
records, and when

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.300
we look at how the DNA
has changed over time--

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.170
and we'll do multiple
videos of that-- we

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.710
think that the first
eukaryotes showed up

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.034
about 2.2 billion years ago.

00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:31.450
Although there's
some debate here.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.360
There's some evidence it might
have been a little earlier,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.151
some evidence it might
have a little later.

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:37.080
I'm sure that number
will be refined.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.690
But give or take a
few hundred millions

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.299
of years, one prokaryote got
engulfed by another prokaryote,

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:47.340
and said, hey, we do pretty
well living together.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:55.590
I mean the current theory is
that mitochondria is actually

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.730
descended from kind of an
ancient prokaryotic cell,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.585
an ancient bacteria.

00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:02.460
It actually has its own DNA.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.050
And actually, your
mitochondrial DNA

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.466
is passed down from your mother,
and your mother's mother,

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.380
and your mother's mother,
so on and so forth.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.610
So it's kind of like
another little animal

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.680
living inside of a larger cell.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.910
And we are eukaryotes.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.540
We needed this to happen.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.740
The human body, we're not
just one eukaryotic cell.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.865
We're made up of trillions.

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:24.210
The estimates are 50 to 100
trillion eukaryotic cells.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.850
So these are our
ancestors that had

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.000
to come into being at that time.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.791
And once again, all of this is
happening inside of the oceans.

00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.790
Now, the other interesting
thing that happened--

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.650
remember, we're being bombarded
with UV radiation from the Sun.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.780
So if you're on the land-- let
me draw the land and the ocean.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.450
So here is the ocean and
then here is the land.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.170
Here is the land, right over
there in yellow, constantly

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.200
being bombarded
with UV radiation.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.700
And "UV" stands for ultraviolet.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.970
So I'm drawing it in purple.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.580
But it's even more
violet than purple.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.060
So it's constantly
being bombarded

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.530
by with ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun,

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.300
which is very inhospitable
to DNA and to life.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.260
And so the only
life at this point

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.350
could occur in the ocean,
where it was protected

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.070
to some degree from the
ultraviolet radiation.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.369
The land was just open to it.

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:24.660
Anything on the land would
have just gotten irradiated.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.865
It's DNA would get mutated.

00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:28.860
It just would not
be able to live.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.430
So what happened, and what
I guess has to happen,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.890
and the reason why we
are able to live on land

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.250
now is that we have
an ozone layer.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.610
We have an ozone layer up
in the upper atmosphere

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:46.260
that helps absorb, that blocks
most of the UV radiation

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.540
from the Sun.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.120
And now that oxygen
began to accumulate,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.790
we have the Oxygen Catastrophe.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.380
Oxygen accumulates
in the atmosphere.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.470
Some of that oxygen goes
into the upper atmosphere.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.799
So we're now in this time
period right over here.

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:01.215
It goes into the
upper atmosphere.

00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.500
It actually really
reacts with the UV light

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.390
to turn into ozone, which
then can help actually

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.940
block the UV light.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.310
And I'll do another video maybe
on the ozone/oxygen cycle.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.060
So this oxygen
production, it's crucial,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.370
one, to having an ozone
layer so that eventually life

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.030
can exist on the land.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.190
And it's also crucial
because eukaryotic organisms

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.802
need that oxygen.

00:08:25.802 --> 00:08:27.260
Now, the third
thing that happened,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.950
and this is also pretty
significant event,

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.200
we believe that that
oxygen that started

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.240
to accumulate in the
atmosphere, reacted with methane

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.710
in the atmosphere.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.700
So it reacted with methane.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.970
And methane is an
ozone-- not an ozone.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.590
It's a greenhouse gas.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.920
It helps retain heat
in the atmosphere.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.590
And once it reacts
with the oxygen

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.310
and starts dropping out of
the atmosphere as methane,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.210
we believe the
Earth cooled down.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.510
And it entered its
first, and some people

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.590
believe it's longest,
snowball period.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.490
So that's what they
talk about right here

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.170
on this diagram, the
first snowball Earth.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.640
It's sometimes called
the Huronic glaciation.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.400
And that happened
because we weren't

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.370
able to retain our heat,
if that theory is correct.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.910
And so the whole-- as the
theory goes-- the whole Earth

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.010
essentially just iced over.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.210
So as we go through
the Proterozoic Eon,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.620
I guess the big markers of it is
it's the first time that we now

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.760
have an oxygen-rich atmosphere.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.300
It's the first time
that eukaryotes can now

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.400
come into existence
because they now

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.920
have oxygen to, I guess
we could say, breathe.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.260
And the other big thing is now
this is where the ozone forms.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.840
So this kind of sets the
stage for in the next eon,

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.690
for animals or living things, to
eventually get on to the land.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.690
And we'll talk about
that in the next video.
