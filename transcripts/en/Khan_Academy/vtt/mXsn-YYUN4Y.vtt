00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.290
Graphs of e of x
equals e to the x and r

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.910
of x is equal to 1 over x
times x minus 1 times x minus 2

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.730
are shown below.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.960
Estimate the solution to e
to the x-- so that's e of x--

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.260
being equal to essentially
r of x within 0.01.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.790
So we want to
figure out for what

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.457
value does e of x equal r of x?

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:28.790
And they want us to estimate it.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.310
We can either just try
to get as close as we can

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.439
from this graph.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.610
They want us to be within 0.01.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.140
And we can also
use a calculator,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.320
kind of try numbers out
to hopefully zero in

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.390
on this point right
over here, where e of x

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.960
is equal to r of x.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.220
So what I want to do is, let
me draw a little table here.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.510
Let's try out some x values.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.300
And then for each
of these x values,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:04.110
let's see where we land on e of
x and where we land on r of x,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.125
and then we can decide whether
we are too high or too low.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:09.500
And I encourage you to pause
this video before I actually

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.100
go ahead and do this, and
try to do this on your own.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.190
But I do suggest using
some form of calculator

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.179
or, well, probably a calculator.

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.720
I'm assuming you've
given a go at it,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.870
and now I will attempt it.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.690
Now just eyeballing
it-- and eyeballing it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.350
is helpful, because that'll
give us kind of our first order

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.350
approximation of at what x value
are these two functions equal.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.120
If I just look at this
graph the way it's drawn,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:40.130
it looks like this is
pretty close to 2.1.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.580
It looks like when x is
2.1, both of those functions

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.960
look pretty close
to-- I don't know.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.140
This looks like about 7.7 or
7.8 or something like that.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.310
But let's figure out
what they're doing.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.310
So let's see, when
x is equal to 2.1--

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.210
get my calculator out-- when
x is equal to 2.1, well,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.880
e of x is just e to the x power.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.430
So e to the 2.1 power
is equal to 8.166.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.320
Let me write that down, 8.166.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.006
And what is r of x?

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:29.700
r of x is 1 divided by x,
so that's going to be 2.1.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.020
Times x minus 1.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.460
Well, that's going to be
1.1, so that's times 1.1.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.660
Times x minus 2.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.660
Well, that's just going
to be 0.1, times 0.1.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.770
And that is equal to
4-- did I do that right?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.080
No, that can't be.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:58.006
2.1 over-- 2.1
times 1.1 times 0.1.

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:00.090
1 over all of that.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.810
4.32?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.380
Let's see, 2.1 r
of x is 4 point-- I

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.440
guess that's possible.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.190
Actually, that looks
right, because r of x

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.850
declines so sharply
right over here.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.830
So it's actually, at 2.1
where actually r of x

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.290
is actually closer to right
over here, give or take.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.520
So it's equal to 4.32.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.370
So 2.1 e of x is actually a
much larger value than r of x.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.250
So e of x is clearly
too high. r of x

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.960
is already dropped
a good bit by then.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.860
If I were to go all
the way down to 2, at 2

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.470
it looks like actually r
of x kind of spikes up.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.780
It just goes to infinity
as we approach 2.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.940
So we're not going to go
all the way down to 2,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.648
but why don't we lower
this a little bit.

00:03:52.648 --> 00:03:55.360
Why don't we try 2.05?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.390
So 2.05, what is e of x?

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.670
e of x is e to the x, right?

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:11.380
So e to the 2.05 power gets
us 7.76-- I'll round it,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.070
8-- 7.768.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.160
Approximately 7--
actually, all these

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.860
are approximate, so
I'll just write 7.768.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.790
And what is r of x?

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.980
I'll just keep rounding
to the thousands.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.570
Here, well, we didn't have
to round too much just

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.560
because that was so far
off, but I'll put it there.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.080
Actually, it was
329, so I could--

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.660
let me write it this way-- 3290.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.160
So let me throw
that 9 here, just so

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.800
everything-- we evaluate
the function to thousandths.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.900
So let's evaluate r of
x, when we're at 2.05,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.420
it's going to be 1 divided by
x, which is now 2.05, times x

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:02.290
minus 1, which is 1.05, times
x minus 2, which is 0.05.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:14.270
And that gets us to 9.29-- I'll
round to 2-- 9.292, so 9.292.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.450
So now we're on this
side, where r of x

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.840
is roughly right over
here and it's more than e

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.930
of x, which is at 7.7,
which is right around here.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.050
So now our x value is too low.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.670
So maybe let's see if we
can go a little bit higher.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.182
And let's try to go roughly
halfway between these two,

00:05:35.182 --> 00:05:37.390
but I don't want to get too
precise, because you have

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.170
to get to the nearest hundredth.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:45.730
So let's go to 2.07.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:06:00.740
So e to the 2.07 is equal to
7.925 if I round it, 7.925.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.970
I want to do all this in green
just to be color consistent.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.300
And now let's evaluate r
of x at that same value.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.880
So 1 divided by x, which is
2.07, times that minus 1,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.170
which is 1.07, times that
minus 2, which is 0.07,

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:34.120
which gives us 6.44, I
guess we could say 6.450.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.130
So at 2.05 that was too
low, 2.07 is too high.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.100
Now, r of x has
dropped below e of x.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.870
So we know the right answer is
in between these two numbers,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.820
and so if we select
2.06 that's definitely

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.940
going to be within 0.01
of the right answer.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:01.380
So I would go with
2.06 is definitely

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.429
going to be within the 0.01 of
the correct solution to this.

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:08.470
But just for fun, let's
actually just try it out.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:16.460
So e to the 2.06 is 7.84--
I guess we could round to 6.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.380
And if we were to
evaluate r of x,

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.380
it's 1 divided by 2.06
times that minus 1,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.120
which is 1.06, times 0.06.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.500
It gets us to 7.632.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.410
So we're also
getting pretty close,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.120
but our precision
that they gave,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.420
they don't say that they have
to be within each other of that,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.070
they say, let's
estimate the solution.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.110
So there's some actual
precise solution

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.710
to this right over here, some x
value, where these are actually

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.690
equal to each other.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.590
That's the x value, which gives
us this point of intersection.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.990
We just have to get within
0.01 of that x value,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.900
and 2.06 definitely
does the trick.
