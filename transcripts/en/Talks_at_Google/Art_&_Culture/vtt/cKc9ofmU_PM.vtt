[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.130
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Come on up, Luis.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.977
LUIS MIRANDA: Thank you.

00:00:14.977 --> 00:00:17.060
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: So
welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.840
We have about 800 folks on the
Livestream from Mountain View,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.840
Seattle, Chicago, New
York City, and hopefully

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.210
Washington, DC, my home office.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.930
It's a treat to have
you, Luis, here today--

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.320
LUIS MIRANDA: Thank
you, pleasure.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.028
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
--and Luz, your wife,

00:00:31.028 --> 00:00:33.180
Lin-Manuel's mom,
here with us today.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.720
And that you've been a
part of the conversation

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.540
that we've been having
around bringing students

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.020
into this experience and how we
can use and leverage technology

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.860
to do so.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.350
A little bit about your
background, which I think

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.490
is super fascinating.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.790
And I think as we think about
how your life and experience

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.670
and legacy connects to the
work that Lin-Manuel has done,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.320
we'll talk a little
bit about that today.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.042
You're from New York City.

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:58.500
LUIS MIRANDA: I'm
from Puerto Rico.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.041
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Puerto Rico, yes,

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.450
but has spent the last
30, 40 years of your life

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.330
in New York City working
for three mayors--

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.884
Giuliani, Ed Koch,
and David Dinkins.

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:12.550
You were the founding
president of the--

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.090
LUIS MIRANDA: And thank you
for making me 10 years younger.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.966
44 years in New York.

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.173
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: 44 years.

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:18.740
OK, it must have
been an old bio.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.198
You were the founding president
of the Hispanic Federation,

00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:23.049
one of the country's largest--

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.590
and what I would
say most impactful--

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.690
Latino organizations
out of New York City

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.590
serving Latinos in New
York and in Florida.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.960
You founded a political
consulting firm

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.940
called the MirRam
Group where you've

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.140
worked on lots of
successful campaigns,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.100
including Senator Clinton,
and Senator Schumer,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.974
and Senator Gillibrand
in New York.

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:44.390
So we're so glad
to have you here.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.720
And we really want to talk today
a little bit about politics,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.812
history, and legacy, and
really community empowerment,

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.770
and kind of the role that
you've played in that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.370
and how the work that Lin-Manuel
is doing through his work

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.730
is helping to do
that for so many.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.100
So I was mentioning to
you in the Green Room

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.350
that we first met in 2009
in the summer of 2009

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.380
when President Obama
nominated Justice

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.170
Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.330
She handed me a
list of people who

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.950
were going to help
get her confirmed,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.140
who were going to help
to provide validation

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.590
of her kind of contribution
to the community in New York

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.640
and nationally.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.790
And at the top of that
list was your name,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.510
along with about a dozen
other very prominent New York

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.795
political leaders.

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:33.670
So let's start there.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.730
How did you become so
involved in politics,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.020
in community empowerment.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.840
LUIS MIRANDA: I don't recall
ever not being in a campaign.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.400
My family, it's a very
political family in Puerto Rico

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.310
more so then than now.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.060
We had-- those of you who know
a little bit about Puerto Rico--

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.730
there is always politics.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.280
Everything is politics
in Puerto Rico.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.210
And we had people in different
parties who had run for Senate.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.160
And my uncle is the founder of
the Puerto Rican Independence

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.660
Party.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.090
So we were always in a campaign.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.060
So it was logical then when
I came to New York at 18

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.950
in '73 to get involved,
initially in the Puerto Rican

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.280
Socialist Party.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.260
I sold "Claridad" which was
the paper of the Puerto Rican

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.080
Socialist Party in the streets
of the lower East Side.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.160
And then sort of little
by little, sort of main

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.230
streamed myself into
democratic politics.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.190
So I don't recall ever not
being involved in a campaign.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.650
And that's why my
views are also a bit

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.532
to the left than that
most of my contemporaries.

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:52.990
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Do you remember

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.780
what that issue was that
you read in "La Claridad"

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.400
or what really drove you
to want to get involved?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.530
LUIS MIRANDA: Every issue.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.590
Injustice just pisses me off.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.820
It doesn't energize me.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.130
It pisses me off and it makes me
have to do something about it.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.110
Many times my wife
will tell me someone

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.290
it's been unjust in the
street in some dispute.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.860
I want to intervene.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.090
And she's like the
hell, let it be.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.017
So probably injustice is
what pushes my buttons.

00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:36.100
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Right.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.050
And I think that
that's part of what's

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.420
so beautiful in your
relationship with,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.150
and influence, on Lin-Manuel's
kind of creativity

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.050
and his career, because we're
all products of our family

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.380
history and the legacies of
our parents and their struggles

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.540
and what they
fought to be, right?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.840
And Lin-Manuel has talked about
your involvement in politics

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.150
and how that made him more
awoke like to what was happening

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.650
in the world around him and the
injustice that was happening

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.150
in the world around him.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.667
And so talk about how you
think your civic engagement

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:08.875
and political participation--

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:12.730
I even read that I think you
recruited when Lin-Manuel was

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.120
a lot younger to do a jingle for
one of the campaigns that you--

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.750
LUIS MIRANDA: You know,
we always worried--

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.640
we don't worry
anymore-- but we always

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.932
worried how he was going to
pay his next meal and rent.

00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:25.931
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: He
could have been a lawyer.

00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:26.707
Imagine that.

00:05:26.707 --> 00:05:28.540
That would have been a
travesty for society.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.910
LUIS MIRANDA: I thought
that Ruben Blades

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.850
was the perfect example.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.760
Graduate, law, Harvard,
and a singer, a famous one.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.240
I figured and I kept telling
you could be like Ruben Blades.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.020
You could go to law
school become a lawyer

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.710
and then have this gig
until that gig takes off.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.700
The gig took off
before the law part.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.650
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Were you ever worried?

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.358
LUIS MIRANDA: Oh, we
were always worried.

00:06:01.358 --> 00:06:07.030
And that's why any time I had
a gig in my office, something

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.900
that I knew he could do, we will
tell him to write this jingle.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.820
Write this piece of music.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.810
And then we will pay him.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.140
Now I actually
have the copyrights

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.014
to all of those that
I paid 500 bucks

00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:24.180
and they're worth much more.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.070
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: I want
to know which candidates have

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.816
their-- they should say that.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.670
LUIS MIRANDA: He remembers he
did jingles for Eliot Spitzer.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.640
And when Eliot--
who's a friend--

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.160
got into a bit of
trouble and had

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.540
to resign from the governorship,
Lin-Manuel asked me,

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.740
didn't I do a jingle for him?

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.150
I said you did.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.780
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Well, so folks

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.000
start getting your
questions ready,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.916
because we're going to
open up to audience Q&amp;A

00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:00.890
here in a minute.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.750
But you know you spent
a lot of your time--

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.150
you helped to found that
Hispanic Federation,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.130
as I mentioned, one of
the country's largest

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.410
Latino advocacy organizations.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.560
What do you think
is the current state

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.420
of play for the Latino
community in New York

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.462
and in the United States.

00:07:16.462 --> 00:07:18.336
LUIS MIRANDA: Oh, please,
don't let me start.

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:20.540
Remember I told you
injustice pissed me off.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.610
Trump is the embodiment
of injustice.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:31.230
So I just think that this
guy's such a nightmare.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.710
It's unbelievable
that we're still days

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.620
away from a hundred days.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:44.660
I was counting the other
day, 1,340 more days to go.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.020
I think I'm going to do a
clock or something in my room

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.380
to sort of go one by one and
sort of feel a little better.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.980
It sort of reminds me a bit of--

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.510
I don't know how many
of you read "One Hundred

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.940
Years of Solitude" Gabriel
Garcia Marquez, a 1967 novel.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.130
And the families,
the Buendia family

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.340
where he creates his
own Macondo town.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.780
So I feel all the time
like I'm in my condo

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:20.450
that Trump creates his own life,
his own reality, his own shit.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.280
And somehow we're
supposed to swallow it so.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.620
All of that to say that
we must redouble efforts.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.159
When Luz and I, when my wife
and I, were having breakfast

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.120
this morning, I was
telling her that I always

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.030
thought that, OK, I am
as busiest as I can get.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:49.730
But every time something else
comes up and I take it on,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.530
and somehow you're able
to do it because we're

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.910
able to do many, many things.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.730
And I think that every single
one or us during the next 1,342

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:08.070
days need to do even more to
move the community forward

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:14.330
and fight this avalanche of crap
that this misguided government

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.130
has on us.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.950
Not that I have an
opinion about it.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.290
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Tell
me how you really feel.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.970
So before I open
it up to Q&amp;A, I'll

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.100
ask one last quick question.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.440
I think-- and I've kind
of seen you do interviews

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.730
with Lin-Manuel and you and
your wife interacting with him.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.480
And I think it's a
very-- and we were just

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.960
kind of talking back there
about your daughter and son

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.470
as kids and this beautiful
relationship of, I think,

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.170
admiration and respect and what
really seems like friendship

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.010
that you guys have.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.640
Which is a beautiful
thing to see.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.450
It seems very grounded and
kind of where he comes from

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.610
and what you fought for.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.570
That's really beautiful.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.270
So back in 2009, kind
of the famous anecdote

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.460
around when he first debuted
"Hamilton" at the White

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.350
House at a Poetry Jam with
President Obama and the First

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.190
Lady Michelle Obama, from
a father's point of view

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.180
or a parent's
point-of-view, talk

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.100
about how you have seen him from
"In The Heights" to "Hamilton"

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.340
to writing music for "Moana"
and now Mary Poppins".

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.980
Like what have you seen
about his work style

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.290
and how he struggled and
what is from a fath--

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.650
LUIS MIRANDA: First,
my shot was not

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.250
supposed to be the number
in the White House.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.920
I had gotten a call
from David Axelrod

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.960
with whom I had done campaigns.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.180
And he had just finished
doing the Obama campaign.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.350
They said the First Lady's
have having this night

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.800
and can Lin-Manuel do a
number from "In the Heights"

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.520
because he had gotten the
Tony for "In the Heights"

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.970
And so I told Lin-Manuel, you're
invited at the White House.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.800
They want a number
from "In the Heights."

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.080
He's like, do you think that
I could do this number that--

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.820
and I stop him and I
said, no, you can't.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.720
They want a number from
me "In the Heights."

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.250
But do--

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.450
And I have learned--

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.290
and more and more
as he gets older--

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.280
to trust his judgment.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.920
He is such a mature soul.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.510
And I say, you know what
I mean, it's my own crap.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.220
What is it that you want me
to send to the White House?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.530
He said so I'm going
to send you the lyrics.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:36.420
And I sent you the music to
this song that I just wrote.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.660
So I send it to them.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.320
And they love it.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.100
Not only did they
ask him to do it,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.990
but he closed the night with
"My Shot," which had never

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.660
been any where before.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.060
But it tells you--

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.140
not only that I
trust his judgment--

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.220
but through his own creativity
that he knew many, many,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.270
many years ago, now we
know where "Hamilton" is--

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.740
that there was something
special about this music.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:14.290
So I have learned
through the years

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.230
to sort of trust his judgment.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.730
And when I fight
back, and I do often,

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:26.440
half of the time he ends up
convincing me that his way

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.800
it's the best way for him.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.560
And he will-- because
he's actually very sweet

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.560
that way-- he will
say, for you, this

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.010
is the best course of
action, for me, this

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.640
is the best course of action.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.480
So we have grown to sort
of respect each other

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.810
and do things our way.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.800
Sometimes agreeing,
sometimes disagreeing,

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.930
but always respecting
that this is the path

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.180
that we're going to follow.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.555
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Would you say

00:13:01.555 --> 00:13:04.720
you agree most of the time,
half the time, or less than half

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.230
the time.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.210
LUIS MIRANDA: I think that
his way, for him, it's

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.360
the best way 90%
percent of the time.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:19.000
He really has a very
good sense of who he is,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.220
of how he conducts himself, and
what works for his audience.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.830
Sometimes I send
him a tweet before I

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.160
tweet because I don't think.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.290
I just watch some piece of
news and someone pissed me off.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.620
And I write a tweet.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.760
Sometimes I send
before I should.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.300
But when it involves
him, I actually

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.550
send him the tweet to sanitize
and sort of read first

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.090
before I tweet it because
I trust his judgment.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.620
For him, he's right
90% of the time.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.370
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Well, congratulations,

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.411
because as a parents that's
what you want, right?

00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:04.180
For your kids to
have good judgment,

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.510
you want them to be confident
in who they are and grounded.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.970
And so congratulations
to both for that.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.680
LUIS MIRANDA: Thank
you, thank you.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.000
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Any audience questions?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.040
In the room?

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.360
In the back.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.223
Into the mic up front
so they can hear you.

00:14:20.223 --> 00:14:22.556
AUDIENCE: So you've worked
on a lot of Clinton campaigns

00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:23.690
through your whole career.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.770
And I think that one of the
more energizing things that's

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.977
come out of this last election
is that a lot more people now

00:14:30.977 --> 00:14:33.185
are considering running for
office for the first time

00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:35.195
or our communities that
haven't been politically

00:14:35.195 --> 00:14:37.672
been represented in politics.

00:14:37.672 --> 00:14:39.380
For people who are
thinking about getting

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.050
involved, even running for
office for the first time,

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.350
what would you have as advice
for a first time candidate?

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.630
LUIS MIRANDA: That
they should run.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.970
You know you get
good at repetition.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.370
When you do the same
thing many times,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.810
you get better at it
every single time.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.780
So sometimes you don't win.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.430
It really doesn't matter.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.010
But you begin to
create a machine.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.700
You begin to create a cadre
of people who help you,

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.620
who believe like you.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.340
You begin to get good at
speaking in public, which

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.510
is something that I'm
surprised so many people have

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.430
difficulties with.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:27.670
But running-- it's like for
my son, it's rehearsing.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.160
And rehearsing makes perfect.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.690
Running makes perfect.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.400
And you get better
every time you do it.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.140
If people have the confidence
to do it, they should do it.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.700
It doesn't matter if
they come in last.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.890
There's also name recognition.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.780
If you don't have a
lot of money to run--

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.350
and most cities in
the country don't

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.860
have campaign finance
where they help candidates

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.660
with dollars to run--

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.240
running several
times is the best way

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.330
to be known in a
particular community.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.540
But also to be realistic.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.360
You know don't start
running for president

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.690
before you run for
state assembly.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.990
Also find your place
and what you think

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.560
makes the most sense
at a particular time.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:24.400
But I believe that running also
makes people better and makes

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.286
more people wanting to
be engaged politically.

00:16:28.286 --> 00:16:29.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.800
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Any
other audience question?

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.830
Yes, please come up.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.824
Be Somebody may need to
help you with the mic.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.750
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Sidarth.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.930
And did you encourage
Lin-Manuel Miranda

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.560
to get involved with politics?

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.520
LUIS MIRANDA: No.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.150
Because I will fail.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:59.380
And I fail at enough things at
62 I don't want to a big one

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.650
to my repertoire of failures.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:10.150
Lin-Manuel's call in life
is not elected office.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.599
He gets interviewed all
the time and he said, oh, I

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.760
don't like politics.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.780
Not true.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.990
He loves politics,
because politics

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.839
it's the art of getting
involved in the day today

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.740
and making a difference.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.550
And that's what he
does every single day.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.730
But he will never run
for elective office,

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.790
though he will always
be involved in politics

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:39.220
particularly in the whole
fight for immigrant rights

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.110
that we're going
to have to fight

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:46.392
in this country over
the next 1,342 days.

00:17:46.392 --> 00:17:47.100
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.308
LUIS MIRANDA: You're welcome.

00:17:49.654 --> 00:17:51.820
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Part
of yesterday's announcement

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.660
was the virtual
reality experience

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:00.250
and the six kind of places
of the experiences that

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.880
can bring students closer
to the "Hamilton" experience

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.380
without leaving their classroom
or their home, which I think

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:05.921
is very cool.

00:18:05.921 --> 00:18:07.930
And I think it's a
great example of how

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.290
you can use technology to open
up access and opportunities.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.190
So what do you see as like
the role of opportunity

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.340
of technology to open up some of
these opportunities to the arts

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.000
or to certain communities
who may not necessarily

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.390
have the resources to access
or experience certain things?

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.280
LUIS MIRANDA: I'll
start by saying--

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.190
and that's why we're doing the
"Hamilton" Education Program.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:37.780
I probably told Justin
and Daisy 1,000 times

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.020
when we were having discussions
of how Google can get involved,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.900
there's nothing like an
audience in a theater.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.950
There's nothing
that changes that.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.840
The connection with the
actor, the connection

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.610
with the audience, the
feelings that sort of come out

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:02.260
of that relationship in
"Hamilton" for two hours and 50

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.040
minutes.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.170
It's unique.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:10.780
But we realize that at the end
of four years, $20 millions

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.910
into this initiative,
we're going

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:17.080
to be able to bring
only 200,000 high school

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.360
students to the theater
to have that experience.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:28.510
So anything that can help bring
that experience to many more

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.850
people, it's very important.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.400
The virtual reality that
we just saw a little bit,

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.540
it's incredible.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:44.050
It's places that I have now
visited in all this "Hamilton"

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.500
tour that our lives have become.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.820
I tell people all the
time I never realized

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.550
that this Puerto
Rican family was

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.545
in charge of Hamilton's legacy.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.260
If someone would have said
to me in Vega Alta when

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.750
I was 17 years old, you know
the guy on the $10 bill,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.090
you're going to be responsible
for his legacy, I would say,

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.110
right.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.790
But.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:17.260
So seeing the virtual
reality of the places

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.680
that I have now experienced
in this "Hamilton" journey

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.300
that we have been in for a
while is a magnificent way

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.650
of kids and people
to realize this

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.870
is the house where Alexander--

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.990
the only house he owned--

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:39.880
and this is what the house looks
like in the middle of Harlem,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.940
because the house is in
the middle of Harlem.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:50.290
So mixing that with interviews,
with YouTubes, with the music,

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.730
it's the second best
to being in a theater

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.730
and experiencing the magic of
an audience-actor relationship.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.647
And anything you
guys can do, welcome.

00:21:03.647 --> 00:21:04.730
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Great.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.420
Other questions?

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.224
Yeah.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:09.550
AUDIENCE: Hey, my name's Becca.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.750
Within my Latin social
circle, two conversations

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.690
have come up a lot.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.950
One, the term LatinX
and then there's

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.160
this controversy around
Justin Bieber showing up

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.002
in a Luis Fonsi song.

00:21:20.002 --> 00:21:21.460
And they seem really
trivial, but I

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.970
think underneath is like this
struggle of our generation

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.730
to preserve our roots
and like our heritage,

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.960
but also bend to the
needs that we have.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.630
And I think it's so
important now, especially

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.510
under this Administration,
that we find a balance.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.860
And I'd love to just hear
your thoughts on what you do

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.150
or advice around that topic.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.690
LUIS MIRANDA: And I
start with what I said,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.500
Lin-Manuel is right 90%
of the time for him.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:57.010
Because he's looking at it from
his perspective, from his age

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.710
cord, from his reality.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.750
And as much as I
try hard to do that,

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.640
there is always a difference.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.450
I'm the result of
my own experiences.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:19.690
And I think I'm also trying to
understand younger people is

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.460
the only way to run
campaigns, because you

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:27.490
have to begin to put yourselves
not only your age cohort--

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.940
though unfortunately so far,
they're like 50% of the vote.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.180
That's why people don't
think about younger

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.700
people and younger
needs, because when

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.350
you look at the electorate,
you say, you know what?

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.680
If I get 60% of the 55
plus vote, I'm home free.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.370
So as long as we begin to
vote like the normal curve

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.490
and represent that in
the right percentage,

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.890
that's what's going to happen.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:07.090
And I believe that more and more
you need to preserve history,

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.350
but you need to show
it and present it

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.010
the way we are right now.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:18.630
And I think that that's
the beauty of "Hamilton."

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.230
I remember when I
was 18 years old.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.950
I went to a "Sound
of Music" performance

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.300
at New York University.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.460
I came here to study.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:35.660
And Maria Von Trapp was black.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.520
in this performance.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.940
Because it was student
theater and it was a vanguard.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.800
And I'm sitting
there after seeing

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.980
the "Sound of Music"
at 18 100 times,

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.860
this is just Maria Von Trapp.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:58.860
And it took me a while to wrap
my head around the possibility

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:04.290
that Maria Van Trapp was
just an entrepreneur who

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.590
sang beautifully and
tried to save a family.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:11.940
It didn't matter the color
that Maria Van Trapp was.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.240
And that's what "Hamilton"
does for this generation.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.950
No longer George
Washington is going

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:25.630
to be a white dude with white
hair for generations to come.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:31.110
The most exciting moment
of all this "Hamilton" trip

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.990
that my wife and I and my
family have gone through

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:38.700
was being in the White House
listening to Chris Jackson,

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.240
a black man, with
a George Washington

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.870
picture, an actual
portrait in the back,

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.420
singing a George
Washington song.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.400
And that's what
you're talking about.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.010
It's how do we actualize
for this generation what

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.105
our history is?

00:24:57.105 --> 00:24:58.980
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Well
in yesterday's show,

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.740
all three male leads were black.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.150
And it was not lost on
me thinking about all

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:08.100
of the kids in the room and just
what they must been thinking

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.780
experiencing the
show in that way

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.460
and seeing themselves on stage.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.180
And you know what that does
even just for that 200,000 kids

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.390
who will see it and
experience the show.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:25.060
LUIS MIRANDA: And in the music,
that is not Broadway tunes.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:29.090
So that it's not
only that they're

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:34.440
a multi-colored diverse,
but they're also

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.970
seeing in the vernacular
that young people understand.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.680
I remember for
"In the Heights" I

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:53.340
did a lot of numbers in my
head how long will it run.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.240
How much to recoup
your investment?

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.540
Because at the end of the
day, I'm also a businessman.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.140
How much to recoup your
investments and all of that.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:10.030
And understanding that the
average Broadway theater goer

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:15.810
is a 55-year-old
woman from suburbia

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:20.430
earning an average of $140,000.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:25.070
So when you think about
the audiences on Broadway,

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.610
"Hamilton" should
have never made it.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.580
But it did.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.270
And we sat there,
Luz 100 times--

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.790
I don't even know how
many times she has gone--

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.790
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: 106?

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.510
LUZ MIRANDA: 36.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.720
LUIS MIRANDA: 36 times.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.300
And we sit there
with many people

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.410
who are like our
contemporaries in terms of age

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.400
enjoying this feast
that can not be

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.750
more different from their taste
and from their daily living.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.030
So there's something
special that you

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:05.800
can do to bring different people
together to appreciate art.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.800
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: And
that's one of the things

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.258
that you're spending
time on is how

00:27:09.258 --> 00:27:12.290
to expand the
audiences on Broadway

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.510
to more diverse audiences.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.310
LUIS MIRANDA: We
didn't have a lot

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:22.990
of money for
Lin-Manuel and Lucecita

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:28.840
so we usually went to
Broadway once a year.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.440
So, of course, we took poor
Lin-Manuel see Les Mis at seven

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.680
because we wanted
to see Les Mis.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.860
At the end of the day, you know
all the age appropriate things

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.050
that you guys think
about today, you're

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.980
bring your kids
to school-- ah, we

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.370
didn't think age appropriate.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.430
We wanted to see Les Mis.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.160
We're going to drag him
along to see Les Mis.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.460
So we went to see a
show like once a year.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:59.250
We had a lot of show tune LPs,
records in the house which

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:03.600
is how Lin-Manuel and
my daughter Lucecita

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.990
learned their appreciation.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:12.780
But it's difficult
to dish out the money

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.390
to go and see a Broadway show.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.240
So anything we could do-- we
have the "Hamilton" Education

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.400
Initiative as part of Viva
Broadway that I'm on the chair

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.830
for the Broadway League,
we bring families.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:32.160
Sort of we select three shows
and then an entire family

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.830
comes to see the shows.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.720
And there is then a talk
with the actors at the end,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:45.840
just like you saw yesterday
at the Orpheum here.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.650
So any way that we could
encourage and give access

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.770
to theater, we will.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.010
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Great.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.360
Let me just ask if we have
other audience questions,

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.192
please line up at the mic.

00:28:58.192 --> 00:29:00.650
"In the Heights," how many
folks have seen "In the Heights"

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:01.530
also?

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.820
How much of that was based on
your experience, your family

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.560
experience?

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.670
And what he--

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:15.230
LUIS MIRANDA: It was a
bit autobiographical.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:20.790
Quiara Alegria Hudes,
who wrote the libretto,

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.950
it's partly also her story.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.370
She also comes from a
Puerto Rican family,

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.060
but in Philadelphia.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.040
Lin-Manuel from New York.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.210
But when we were looking--

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.420
we were both NYU students,
that's where we met.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.390
And we were living in
university housing.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.810
And when Lin-Manuel
was born, we were

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:51.030
sort of the typical Puerto Rican
family, five in a one bedroom

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.800
apartment.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.480
We sort of figured
out we probably

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.502
need to get out of here.

00:29:56.502 --> 00:29:58.980
If not, they were going
to kick us out anyway.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.400
So when we started
looking at neighborhoods,

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:08.970
Washington Heights reminded
me the most of Vega Alta.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:13.110
It was a Latino
neighborhood where

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:17.280
people are in every window
checking what everyone

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:23.970
is doing, where everyone is
sort of in everyone's business,

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:28.950
where in the bodega in the back,
there were slot machines so

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.350
that you didn't have
to go to Atlantic City,

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.580
but there's some illegal
way of playing the numbers

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.840
in the neighborhood.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.350
And I said this is my
perfect neighborhood.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.980
I'm in New York, the A
and the 1 come up here

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:48.600
and I could go anywhere in New
York with these two trains.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.820
So that was Lin-Manuel's
neighborhood.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.790
He was there.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.530
We moved when he was one.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.450
And that's where he grew up.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:02.120
So obviously that had
an incredible impact.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.970
When you see the
generational dilemmas

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.859
that are presented
in "In the Heights."

00:31:09.859 --> 00:31:10.400
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.899
So I'm actually
asking this question

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:14.080
on behalf of my teammate
who's in Sunnyvale.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.340
Her grandmother actually
lives in Washington Heights.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.880
And so her question is
how can we as Googlers

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.130
use our products to better
connect with the Latino

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.040
community, including for
older Hispanic generations

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.890
like her grandmother,
who really don't use

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.152
social media that much but--

00:31:29.152 --> 00:31:30.735
and who can't afford
to see "Hamilton"

00:31:30.735 --> 00:31:32.900
but who really feel strongly
about making a change

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.710
in this political climate.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:40.880
LUIS MIRANDA: Well people don't
have to tweet and Facebook

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.240
or create content for you to--

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.490
though all of that is welcome.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.890
And if your
grandmother wants to do

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:52.290
a YouTube of how
much she hates Trump,

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.421
I think we all can
agree to retweet.

00:31:55.421 --> 00:31:56.420
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Yes.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.310
That would go viral.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.950
I think that would go viral.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:04.090
LUIS MIRANDA: So I will
encourage her to do that also.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:07.910
But I think we should
use anything we can.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:13.700
I remember when we were in the
midst of trying to get the US

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.550
Navy out of Vieques,
Puerto Rico,

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:20.450
it was a big struggle
with the US Navy taking

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:24.670
this island, which is also
a municipality, outside

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:28.280
of the east coast
in Puerto Rico.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.150
And there were many,
many, many fights.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:33.200
And we did a survey
to see what people

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.900
were willing to do from writing
a letter to making a phone

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:45.390
call to going to a demonstration
to doing a number of things.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:49.010
And what I learned and
continue to learn in practice

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.310
is you have to meet
people where they're at.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.320
You try to move them to do more.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.950
You should never be content with
just allowing your grandmother

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:01.820
to just talk to her friends
or talk to them on the phone.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.890
You've got to push
them to do more,

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:08.460
because that's the only
way social change happen.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.370
But from in Washington
Heights, when its made first--

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.210
I don't even know
the day I'm in--

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.660
AUDIENCE: Monday.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.310
LUIS MIRANDA: There is a
big rally Sunday and Monday,

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.190
pro immigrant, against Trump.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.950
So if she is in
Washington Heights,

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.270
I would encourage her
to go to the rally.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:36.440
And people really need to
do anything they can do.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.230
I thought we had
agreed-- we have

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:45.140
been doing a lot of
fundraising in social media

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:50.160
with sweepstakes, virtual
sweepstakes, and all of that.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:57.020
And we were going to do
sweepstakes for ACLU.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.970
And then the weekend,
of the madness

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:09.699
occurs in every airport and ACLU
in three days get $25 million

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:14.340
from little
donations from people

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:18.500
who were outraged that
this shit was happening.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.639
And they just clicked and
gave whatever they could.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:26.719
So helping our causes
is another way in which

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.974
everyone should participate.

00:34:28.974 --> 00:34:30.759
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:30.759 --> 00:34:31.884
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Justin.

00:34:31.884 --> 00:34:35.770
AUDIENCE: I've got to
move this up for myself.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.987
Luis and Luz, thank you
so much for being here.

00:34:38.987 --> 00:34:40.570
There were some great
tweets yesterday

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.110
between Lin-Manuel
and our CEO Sundar.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.199
I wonder if you were
CEO of Google for a day

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:50.679
how might you steer this ship to
bring more equity in the Latino

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:51.260
community?

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.520
And I think about Stephanie's
work in DC and the work

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.746
that we do at google.org.

00:34:55.746 --> 00:34:58.120
We'll be together at the Latino
Community Foundation Gala

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:58.640
tonight.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.350
So there's all these
ways that Google

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.890
is trying to lean into
the Latino community

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:03.790
and do good things.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.180
But if you were Sundar
for a day, how would

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.460
you try to get this
company-- and like what

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.957
issues, what topics,
how would you

00:35:10.957 --> 00:35:12.790
want us to put our
weight behind some these?

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.248
LUIS MIRANDA: First
thing I will do

00:35:14.248 --> 00:35:17.710
is that I will tweet
denouncing Trump.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:23.830
So that's the first thing,
the first item on the agenda.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:29.650
I believe that this
Administration is so bad

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:33.670
that any business
that allows a picture

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:38.980
to be taken with this
pig should be denounced.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:45.130
So again, that's the
first thing I would do.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.907
After that tweet, that would
take all of 15 seconds,

00:35:47.907 --> 00:35:48.990
it's only 140 characters--

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.220
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: You
still have the full day.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.670
You still have the full day.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:58.900
LUIS MIRANDA: I still have 23
hours plus to do other stuff.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.930
I think that you are
involved in the right issues,

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:05.560
because every company
has to pick their lane.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.790
You should not be doing
what your lane is not.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.040
Whatever company
is in that lane,

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.790
that's what you should be doing.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.660
But you should be
involved, I believe,

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.790
initially in education because.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.710
At the end of the
day, education is

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.980
the equalizer in this country.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:29.570
I am who I am, Lin-Manuel
is who he is because we

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.900
got a great public education.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:39.610
And less and less public
education opportunities

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:42.070
for our kids to be great.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.340
It's amazing to me,
god, I wish I could not

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.900
talk this much what Trump.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.870
We'll call him X from now on.

00:36:49.870 --> 00:37:01.040
That X budget cuts 0.022%
arts, humanities, and history.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.590
It's not even a freaking
penny in the budget.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.810
But they're so mean.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.990
Now they just add a cut for
the sake of adding a cut.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:17.320
So education is obviously a lane
in which you guys have a lot

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.310
to offer, a lot to offer,
because you have so many tools

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:25.030
to enhance that
process in a unique way

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.340
that that ought to be your lane.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.090
And then candidate-wise,
part is what

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.730
you should be doing
anyway in education,

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:38.410
and also checking the ties,
what's happening in the world

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.188
right now and do that
from the education lane.

00:37:42.188 --> 00:37:43.472
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Great.

00:37:43.472 --> 00:37:45.264
Last audience question.

00:37:45.264 --> 00:37:47.580
AUDIENCE: Take the
mic down a little bit.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.760
Not that tall.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.380
LUIS MIRANDA: Six inches.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.880
AUDIENCE: So my
question is actually

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.245
more related to the
Latino community.

00:37:54.245 --> 00:37:56.110
So my name is Olga
and I actually

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.760
run our Latino Employee
Resource Group here at Google

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.210
called Hola.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.650
And you know I would
love some words of wisdom

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:08.670
of even sparking this interest
inside of our communities.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.850
I think typically
we see that there's

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.470
some people that are very
passionate about these issues

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:17.770
and others that haven't
quite found their place yet.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.044
So I would love--

00:38:19.044 --> 00:38:21.335
hopefully we have some Hola
members watching this too--

00:38:21.335 --> 00:38:23.660
to hear some words of wisdom.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.400
LUIS MIRANDA: I start by
probably there's not enough

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.270
of you Latinos in this company.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.390
AUDIENCE: Nope.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:34.200
LUIS MIRANDA: And
I'll start by saying

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.500
if you look at our
society, white people

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.230
marry whites, Asians marry
Asians, blacks marry blacks.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.420
And once in a while
there are intermarriages.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.520
But they are the
small percentage

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.740
of who we are as a society.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.100
And that's what happens.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.210
White people hire white people.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:57.580
And you really need to
get out of your skin

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.900
to create a diverse
working force.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.740
And I believe something that I
didn't do that your CEO needs

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.950
to do is you incentivize
your managers

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.840
for having a diverse workforce.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.340
If you have an entire
white male force,

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.250
you're not getting a
freaking bonus this year,

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:23.000
because that is not what we
should be doing as a company

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.370
and as a society.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:29.790
So certainly there is, I'm sure
Hola can use many, many more

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:30.660
members.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:34.140
And it's up to managers
to do their job.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.460
And it's up to us--

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.040
unfortunately it really
should not up to us,

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.200
it should be up
to Human Resources

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.085
to fill this room with Latinos.

00:39:42.085 --> 00:39:44.460
But they're not going to do
it, because for the most part

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.360
they're white.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.580
And they're hiring people
who look like them.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:53.500
So it's our responsibility
to then constantly be saying,

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.000
I have this friend,
I know this person.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.920
You give him an
interview, please.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.030
She's really good.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.930
He's really good.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.520
And you plead a little.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.886
And you sort of
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:40:05.886 --> 00:40:10.590
just to ask for mercy
from your counterpart.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.270
And then they're good.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.960
But then our responsibility
is to be great.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.310
Not just good, just
to be great, to show

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.440
that we could do the work.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:27.510
That they didn't hand
us some mercy job

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.090
because we're Latinos,
but because we

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:33.000
are good in what we do.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.280
And that's our responsibility.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:42.050
When I see a kid who's doing C
or B, I'm like man, you suck.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:45.150
You're a bright kid,
you should be doing A

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:51.165
and you're doing C. Well, the
system, the teacher, oh, god,

00:40:51.165 --> 00:40:54.870
enough of [SPEAKING SPANISH]
to explain why we're not

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.150
as good as we should be.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:01.590
So that's our
responsibility to do that.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.910
And Hola, as it is
in so many companies,

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.140
it's really to
create this sense--

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.760
because sometimes
you feel isolated.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:18.030
And I went to NYU, oh,
my god, to a PhD program

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.453
in clinical psychology.

00:41:20.453 --> 00:41:24.180
Did I feel lonely?

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:29.250
So Hola, it's your
support system.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.950
And it should exist.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.750
It should have the
resources to expand.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:36.787
And I'm glad you're here.

00:41:36.787 --> 00:41:37.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.080
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: I want
to give an applause to you.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.064
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.350
And I think just given
the changing nature

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.120
of the demographics
of a country--

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.080
like Silicon Valley and tech
can't ignore this issue.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.140
It won't fix itself.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.350
And I think that given
the fact that one

00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:02.680
in three children in pre-K today
are Latino for the first time

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.290
ever, I think it was
last year, more than 50%

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:08.290
of new births in the United
States were minority.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:11.980
So this is coming, it's here.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.660
LUIS MIRANDA: And
little things like

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:18.310
I remember I was in the
Nielsen Advisory Council.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.830
And they couldn't find Latinos.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.430
Every time someone tells me
that they can not find Latinos,

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.910
I want to shoot that person.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:31.120
Because I never want to shoot
myself, should that person.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.700
Then I look at the
universities where

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.570
they were recruiting from.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.190
I'm like you got to be joking.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:44.240
There is an
association of Latino

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.990
where Latino students are 40%
or more of the graduating class.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.470
The same thing in the
African-American community.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.490
Just begin to look at
those all the universities

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.700
and begin to look at
the world differently.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:04.330
It doesn't have to be
the Ivy Leagues only.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:09.100
Many of those universities
turn out great students.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.890
So it's little
things like that that

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.080
begin to change
the rhythm of what

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.870
happens in corporate America.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:17.110
And this one they did.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.900
And then they had
to recruit more.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.816
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: And
we talked a little bit

00:43:20.816 --> 00:43:23.219
about this earlier, but
how through "Hamilton"

00:43:23.219 --> 00:43:25.510
you know Lin-Manuel has kind
of changed the way that we

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:30.250
perceive and look at history
by who he casts in his shows.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.860
And part of another kind
of key part for Google

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.980
on the education piece is we
work with the entertainment

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.680
industry to try to
change the face of who

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.330
are playing engineers
on television,

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:41.800
who's playing scientists.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.290
And so a Latina can see a
Latina engineer on television

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.770
on one of the major networks
or on a YouTube or a Hulu show

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.854
and to see that that
can be them, too.

00:43:52.854 --> 00:43:54.520
And I think that
that's really important

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.010
too that in the kind
of mainstream media

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:01.610
that we see those also
change not just on corporate.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.500
LUIS MIRANDA: In 1982, I
was Director of Research

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:11.140
over the National Action Council
for Minorities in Engineering,

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.520
NACME.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:18.160
That was before most
of you were born.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:25.090
And the struggle was how do we
bring more African-Americans

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:28.900
and Latinos just
into the schools.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.480
And schools were
willing to admit them.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.880
Then how do we keep them there?

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.360
And how do we assist them
in graduating and not

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.130
feeling isolated?

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:47.880
But clearly media now has
this unbelievable impact.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.400
Lin-Manuel says
it best that if he

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.000
wanted to be in a
Broadway show, he

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.860
was going to have to create it.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.410
Because he did not--

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:04.930
he had to be a gang member in
"West Side Story," "Zoot Suit,"

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.670
or "Capeman."

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.040
Those were the only
roles for Latinos.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.369
And they were all gang members.

00:45:10.369 --> 00:45:12.160
Said if you don't want
to be a gang member,

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.710
create your own show and then
you could be whomever you want.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.350
And entertainment
has that power.

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:21.730
And you guys have that
power to sort of show

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:26.677
a very different face of who
different communities are.

00:45:26.677 --> 00:45:28.510
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: So
we're almost at time.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:31.180
I want to show one
really quick last clip.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.711
And then we'll end a little
bit more on a high note here.

00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:36.184
Just give me a second.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.754
This may bring back
some memories for you.

00:45:44.754 --> 00:45:45.420
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.830
[MUSIC - "FOOTLOOSE"]

00:45:57.514 --> 00:45:59.222
We're not going to
watch the whole video,

00:45:59.222 --> 00:46:01.570
but just to give you
a little bit of a--

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:03.528
LUIS MIRANDA: No, there
are thousands of these.

00:46:03.528 --> 00:46:04.653
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: I know.

00:46:07.237 --> 00:46:07.820
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.780
So this was one
that-- you're right--

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.560
one of many videos that
in my research today--

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.080
or research for today
I was looking through.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.930
There was also a really
great one of the pushcart--

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:21.930
LUIS MIRANDA: The
push carts wars.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.180
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Where he--

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.020
you were the cameraman and
you, Luz were a protester.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.860
LUIS MIRANDA: Half of the
people in that video are dead,

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.096
my grandmother and
all them, their dead.

00:46:32.096 --> 00:46:34.720
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: But I think
I guess my just question to you

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.620
to end on that higher
note is clearly you

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.110
guys gave him the
space to be who he was

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.780
and what he wanted to do and
be creative in your home.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.520
And you guys were active
participants in that,

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.000
whether you wanted to be or not.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.310
And so, looking back
at that with you,

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:52.550
I know that Lin-Manuel
talked about how Luz always

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.960
used to say that he would
win an Oscar some day.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.280
And he took you to the
Oscars this year, right?

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.030
LUZ MIRANDA: Yes.

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:00.529
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
And so would you

00:47:00.529 --> 00:47:02.960
say what when he was
that age and forcing

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.420
you guys to be his camera
person and his actresses

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.330
in his little shows,
did you predict

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:11.060
he would be where he was today?

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.710
LUIS MIRANDA: It's very diff--

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:17.150
we always knew that
he will be big.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.810
In my house, we have
the two extremes.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:25.110
My daughter is an engineer
and a finance person.

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.500
And so she needed that space.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.355
And we needed to
give her that space.

00:47:30.355 --> 00:47:35.990
And Lin-Manuel was that dorky
guy that you saw on that video.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:37.880
And we needed to
give him that space.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:42.290
We had to go the full spectrum
to make sure that we met them

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.810
where they were as kids.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:52.310
And we always knew
that he would be great.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:48:00.470
You can never imagine that
it will be this madness where

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:05.420
we worry if we buy a little
house in Puerto Rico how

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.570
much security it should have.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:14.000
We never thought that those
would be worries of ours.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.210
That no longer can he take
the subway, which he loves.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.460
He learned how to
drive, literally

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.670
he got his license the day
before he went to college

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.170
because he had no other choice.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.190
He always took the
subway in New York.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.580
He's a New York baby.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:38.810
So to that level, I don't
think anybody ever thinks

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:41.720
that their kids will be there.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.830
I guess if you're very rich
and very powerful you take it

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:47.040
for granted.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.460
But we both come from
humble beginnings.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:54.004
So that was never
the expectation.

00:48:54.004 --> 00:48:56.045
Now we expect that from
all of our grandchildren,

00:48:56.045 --> 00:48:57.292
the poor kids.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:03.712
Anything else will be failure.

00:49:03.712 --> 00:49:06.170
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: So we're
going just to wrap finish with

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:10.252
a couple fill-in-the-blank
questions.

00:49:10.252 --> 00:49:11.960
I just want you to
say kind of what first

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.740
comes to mind for all of them.

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.448
LUIS MIRANDA: OK.

00:49:13.448 --> 00:49:14.750
That's fine.

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.771
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: What's
your favorite "Hamilton" song?

00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:18.770
LUIS MIRANDA: "My Shot."

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:19.728
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: OK.

00:49:19.728 --> 00:49:23.540
In 10 years, I see Lin-Manuel--

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:29.470
LUIS MIRANDA: Having three kids
and spending time with them.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:34.460
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: In 10 years,
I see the Latino community--

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:37.200
LUIS MIRANDA: Better
than we are today

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.850
because this new generation
has much more kohonas

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:44.240
that my generation had.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.730
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
Last question or last

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:50.670
fill-in-the-blank, I
hope my legacy will be--

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:55.460
LUIS MIRANDA: That the future
generations of Mirandas

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.252
are committed to social change.

00:49:58.252 --> 00:50:00.710
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: Well you
have done a great job at that.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:01.570
LUIS MIRANDA: Thank you.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.111
STEPHANIE VALENCIA:
So thank you guys

00:50:03.111 --> 00:50:06.090
for both being here and for this
greater partnership with Google

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.830
and the "Hamilton"
Education Project.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.750
And welcome to Google.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:12.480
Thank you for everybody who came
in and for those who tuned in.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.910
LUIS MIRANDA: You guys
have a cool place here.

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:18.330
STEPHANIE VALENCIA: And you
can hang out here all day.

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.530
Let's go raid the snack cabinet.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:21.130
So thank you.

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.280
[APPLAUSE]
