00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.680
Let me introduce you to a very interesting
effect known as the Doppler effect.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.420
Which we can illustrate first of all,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.640
becuase the engineers have recorded the sound
of a police car siren.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.680
If we can have that?

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.820
[Siren sounds]

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.220
As it goes past you'll hear the drop in tone.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.560
Well, we can simulate that by...

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.060
The police car is sending waves to us

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.480
and if I transmit waves, in imagination, along
this medium here.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.160
We pretend that this is the air carrying the
sound waves to us.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.680
One. Oh well that one...

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.440
I've got to do it in time with the metronome.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.540
[Metronome ticks in the background]

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.320
Well, I think you've seen enough now to see
that,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.660
the receiver hears exactly the same frequency
as I'm transmitting.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.680
Now, if I'm moving away from him...

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580
Sorry, I have to get that one on there like
that.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.580
You'll see, he now has a lower frequency.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.780
This corresponds to a change in the sound,

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.560
the sound is of a lower note.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.540
But let me know, let me know do if I can,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.700
go towards him, and you'll see the problem
rather increases for him.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.840
If I increase my speed like that

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.040
you can have quite a job...

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.700
[Audience laughter]

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.110
Well, you see.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.700
[Audience applause]

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.600
That is the doppler effect which enables us
to measure speeds.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.160
And the beauty of it is that we measure speeds
at any distance

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.980
at optics we can't actually get to.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.020
And it shows us that in our phrase, the universe
is expanding.
