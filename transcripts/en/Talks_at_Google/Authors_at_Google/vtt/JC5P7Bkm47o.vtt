00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.580
&gt;&gt; I'm happy to introduce Eddie Sarfaty, stand-up
comedian turned writer, whose new book, "Mental"

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.219
 -- he'll be reading briefly from and talking
about today.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.890
He effortlessly captures the everyday absurdities
of life, blending self-deprecation and sarcasm,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.920
which I'm sure, we all will appreciate.
His autobiographical essays touch on career

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.340
lows, cheapskate exes, the wonder and hell
of family psychopathic cats, and so much more.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.800
That just sounds funny, describing it.
And so, without further ado, Eddie Sarfaty.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.730
Eddie Sarfaty: Hi. Thanks for coming today
on your lunch hour to the Google Author Series.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.140
As he'd said, I am a stand up comic.
I've been working as a stand up comic for

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.170
the past nine years full-time.
And like a lot of stand up comics, I've written

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.899
a book.
And a lot of people express sort of concern

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.070
about that.
Like, "What's he doing writing a book?

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.690
He's a stand up comic.”
And I wanted to talk a little bit today about

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.350
how I felt that that prepared me to write
a book.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.770
I certainly, you know, I'm educated enough
and can write a sentence clearly enough that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.050
I could have attempted to write a book nine
years ago.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.750
But I don't think that, without my experience
of being a stand up, that it would have been

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.781
nearly as good and nearly as funny and or
nearly as smart of poignant or anything that

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:41.100
it's turned out to be.
And I have to take a little side note and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.010
say it's kind of unusual for me to say nice
things about myself, because I'm a stand up

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.200
comic and a neurotic Jew who's completely
self-deprecating.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.619
So if I'm saying that it's smart and funny
and poignant, it's probably smart and funny

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.620
and poignant.
One of the things that I think really was

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.200
helpful about being a stand up comic is that
it let the book end up sounding like me.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.110
Several people have e-mailed me, called me,
told me in person that, "I read your book

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.780
and I could hear you saying it.”
And that was a really huge compliment.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.510
Because, you know, if you can't her me saying
it, I don't know that you are going to get

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.680
it.
And I think that's a hard thing to do, because

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.140
we're not used to writing to be heard.
We're used to writing to be read.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.690
And stand up is all, of course, about writing
to be heard.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.920
And especially when writing a book in the
first person, nonfiction voice.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.710
I think that's really key.
If you're writing a novel or something fictitious

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.890
or in an omniscient voice, I guess it's not
as important.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:01.780
But writing from your own point of view, it's
got to sound like you.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.959
One of the things I really feel strongly about
in writing comedy -- in being a stand up -- was

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.040
the idea of being an outsider.
Now, as a Jew and gay -- I was a fat kid growing

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.440
up, I never felt like I quite fit in, which
I think is really kind of important -- necessary

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.349
 -- when doing comedy.
You know, every comic who's successful, who

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.580
people relate to, is an outsider in some fundamental
way.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.050
You know, there are a million Jewish comics
and African-American comics and women comics

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.720
and gay comics.
There's not a whole lot of heterosexual, white,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.420
Anglo-Saxon, Protestant male comics.
And if you're funny looking -- unless they're

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.349
funny looking -- or they're had some horrible
experience.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.709
So if you're a heterosexual, white, Anglo-Saxon,
Protestant male with a full bank account and

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.940
wears a 42 regular, you're probably not a
laugh riot.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.680
And the thing about being an outsider can
happen in a bunch of different ways.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.549
It could happen culturally, you know, which
is why Jews are completely over-represented

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.450
in the comedy world.
I mean, Jews are the ultimate outsiders throughout

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.830
history.
It can happen -- your family.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.819
You can be from a broken home.
You can be -- personally, being a fat kid

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:34.979
was a very horrible at the time but, you know,
humor -- my sense of humor developed as a

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.160
survival technique.
And I think that was very instrumental in

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:46.559
helping me create a comic voice.
And I think that, in America -- there's a

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.430
guy who wrote a book.
His name is Ted Cohen.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.879
And it's another great book called Jokes.
He's a professor at the University of Chicago.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.469
And he -- it's a short little book which is
filled with great jokes.

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.259
But it also talks about the function of jokes
in American society.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:07.139
And how, it's this little moment of intimacy
that we can all, you know, use to connect

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.740
with each other when we're all so different,
from different parts of the world, different

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.259
cultures, with different beliefs.
You know, it lets everything else flow away

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.710
for a minute.
There's a very cohesive thing in American

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.110
culture.
So I think that being an outsider and being

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.680
lucky enough to be in the U.S. has been really
helpful to me in figuring out how to connect

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.270
to people who are very different than me.
One of the surprising things about the book

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:44.310
is that, I've gotten e-mails from people completely
outside of who -- the audience that I thought

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.129
would be interested in it.
You know, I had a letter from a housewife

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:56.400
in Virginia who said, "I was at the bookstore
in the romance section where I always go,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.460
and my 14-year-old daughter came bounding
over with your book and said, 'Let's get this'."

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.710
And she said, "What is this?"
And the daughter said, "I don't know. It looks

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.930
silly.”
And she said, "I never in a million years

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.189
would have picked it up, but I looked at it
and I picked it up.”

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:15.270
And really made her laugh and made her think
outside her experience.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:23.169
And so, that was a really rewarding thing.
One of the other things about doing stand

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.539
up in preparation for writing a book was that
it enabled me to figure out who I was.

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:33.139
You'll see stand up comics often say, "Oh,
it took me ten years to find my voice.”

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.949
And I think that part of that's getting older.
You become more yourself as you get older.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.760
You become more the person you're meant to
be.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.080
And a lot of people attempt stand up comedy
with an idea of what they're going to be.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.759
People come in saying, "I'm going to be the
neurotic Jew.”

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.870
Or, "I'm going to be the angry, young man."
Or, "I'm going to be the put-upon housewife.”

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.091
And all those things are fine, and they may
be part of who you are.

00:06:56.091 --> 00:07:03.860
But it's kind of like decorating a house and
you say, "I'm going to have a house that's

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.640
decorated in French country.”
And then, you go out and buy all the right

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.219
things and you end up with a house that's
a beautiful house that looks like every other

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:17.219
house that's decorated that way.
Whereas if you just went out and bought the

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:25.370
things that you thought were attractive, interesting,
funny, smart, pretty, then at the end of ten

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.559
years or whatever, you have a house that says,
"You.”

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:31.389
And I think stand up comedy is kind of like
that.

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:38.610
You have to not be afraid to just do what
you think is funny and not try to be something

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.979
else.
Because, you know, you'll get people who will

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:45.459
try to be the next Roseanne Barr or try to
be the next Joan Rivers or the next Richard

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:48.110
Pryor or Henny Youngman.
And I think it doesn't work.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.189
I think it just makes you generic.
Because if you try to be everything, you're

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:57.219
nothing.
And, you know, you have to be something specific.

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:05.890
Which is something else about stand up comedy
that I think helped me write this book, which

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.461
is specificity.
You know, people get up and do stand up comedy

00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:16.009
and just think that they're going to talk.
You get a lot of people who do stand up comedy

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:22.809
who are hysterical at the water cooler or
the class clown or the life of the cocktail

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:26.779
party and they are.
And certainly, if you are that person, that's

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:29.529
great.
And I've been that person and loved those

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:34.980
people.
But you're operating at -- you have a head

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.949
start in those situations, because more often
than not, you're saying something funny in

00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:45.259
response to something that someone's just
said or something that's just happened or

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:49.970
requires -- is based upon you having some
shared information.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.860
And when you're a comic, you don't have that.
I don't know any of you.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.470
You know, your lives could be so different
from mine and then, I have to figure out how

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:11.040
to connect to you quickly and specifically.
So that -- the thing is the specificity -- I'm

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:18.280
getting a little lost here myself, so please
bear with me -- writing a joke is kind of

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.209
like writing a poem.
You know, people think you just get up and

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:25.850
talk.
And it's not. It's very specific.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:35.480
When you write a poem, if you read a Shakespeare
sonnet, every word is chosen specifically

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.560
for the sound, for the emotional content,
for the number of syllables.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.040
It's all very, very carefully planned.
And I believe -- and probably there are people

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.740
that disagree with me -- that a joke should
be the same way.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:55.790
I mean, if you can say something effectively
in ten words, don't say it in 12.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:03.400
Pick the words specifically.
The trick of stand up is making it seem like

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:09.459
it's effortless, but there's so many machinations
that go into the structure of the joke.

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:13.230
I mean, hiding the machinery I think is really
the art of joke telling.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:23.399
So all of those things were really helpful
to me in writing the book.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:30.560
I think a couple of things that were also
helpful were, Learning how to tell the story

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.350
with immediacy.
You know, if you're doing stand up comedy,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.889
you can't be as affected if you tell things
in the past tense.

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:46.130
No matter what you say, I always recommend,
put it in the present.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:52.779
Of course, we know that what happened on the
subway this afternoon happened six hours ago,

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:57.800
or whatever.
But if I start the sentence, "So I'm on the

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.400
subway," rather than, "I was on the subway.”
Everyone's right with you.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:08.120
It's right there. It's immediate.
And nine out of the ten short stories in the

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:18.009
book are written in the present tense.
And also, I think one of the other things

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:23.649
that was helpful was to make it be about me,
which sounds kind of narcissistic.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:30.290
But it's more interesting for me to talk about
my point of view rather than try to guess

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.649
other people's, because mine can be specific
and I don't know what theirs is necessarily.

00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:43.189
So in terms of writing, all of the exercises
in writing stand up comedy really helped me

00:11:43.189 --> 00:11:45.810
write the book, because I learned how to be
specific.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:51.269
I don't think that, without that, I would
have taken the care to choose just the right

00:11:51.269 --> 00:12:04.019
words in so many places that I did.
The other thing is that, in stand up, you

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:07.839
have to know your audience, or at least be
able to read them.

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:12.079
You know, being an open-the-gate comic, there's
definitely jokes I'm not going to tell if

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:14.410
it's a mixed or straight crowd just, because
they wouldn't get it.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.189
It doesn't mean I'm going to closet myself.
There's definitely things that I wouldn't

00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:22.110
tell an audience where there are no Jews,
because they're not going to get it.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:27.310
Again, it doesn't mean that I pretend not
to be Jewish or try to ignore it.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.060
One of the freeing things I found about trying
to write the book was, there is no audience

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.221
sitting there.
And I didn't really have to worry about that.

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:40.980
And it's good, because if I did worry about
that, I think it would have hindered me being

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.560
me and, you know, worrying about, "Will the
book sell?”

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.749
Or "Who's going to read it?”
Or "Are people going to like it?”

00:12:48.749 --> 00:12:54.019
And quite frankly, maybe a big goal of the
book was just to have it 'not suck'.

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:57.910
That was the only goal that I could make myself
live with.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.350
Otherwise, I would have never -- I would have
been freaking out every day trying to write

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:08.050
it.
The other thing is, you know, we've all heard

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:13.699
"Brevity is the soul of wit." And that's very
true.

00:13:13.699 --> 00:13:19.439
You know, I teach a comedy workshop.
And people come in with the joke.

00:13:19.439 --> 00:13:25.939
It's a great idea, but it's 50 words before
it gets to the punch line and basically, one

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:36.160
of the keys to humor is that, the impact of
the punch line is inversely proportional to

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.720
the length of the set up.
You know, if it takes you 50 words to get

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.199
to the punch line, you probably lost your
audience and it's hard to get them back.

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:52.569
Or you better have a really great punch line
if it's 50 words to get there.

00:13:52.569 --> 00:13:56.180
The other thing that I think people don't
talk about a lot in comedy is an emotional

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:03.660
component.
You know, you can be smart.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.269
I think you have to be somewhat smart to be
a decent comic.

00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:10.600
And I'm not necessarily saying educated or
book smart, but you have to have some kind

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:17.819
of intuitive sense of people and an awareness
of the absurdity of things in general and

00:14:17.819 --> 00:14:25.129
hopefully of yourself.
But if you're not -- if there's no emotional

00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:30.009
component in what you're talking about -- you're
clever at best.

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:33.589
You can't really be funny.
You can't really connect with people in that

00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:40.480
intimate way, which I think is really important.
And you can, you know, I'm fine with 'clever'.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:48.170
I love clever. I love bad puns. I love silliness.
But, at the end of the day, a 300-page book

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:56.050
of just that is kind of a snore.
And that also requires you being able to be

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:05.199
willing to mock yourself and to expose things
that maybe aren't so pretty.

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:10.800
And I think that that's really the gift of
humor is that it lets you get through things

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.540
that are difficult and horrible.
I mean, you know, I've had hard times in my

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.540
life.
I talk about them in the book.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:24.540
The book covers, you know, my troubles with
depression, bad relationships, you know, my

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:33.029
father's illness, just money problems and
drug use and all these other things and, quite

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:36.019
frankly, if I hadn't had a sense of humor,
I don't know that I could have gotten through

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.800
any of that.
You know, if there's anything that's so completely

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:46.610
horrible that I can't find something to laugh
about it, I rather don't want to know what

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:52.899
that is.
And this book was really -- has been really

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:58.149
well-received I think, because I was willing
to do that.

00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:01.709
And that brings me to sort of the idea of
fearlessness.

00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:08.390
One of the things about learning to be funny.
People say, "Can you learn to be funny?”

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:15.910
And as I said, some people are funny at the
office or in the classroom, but -- and you

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.430
know people say, "Can you learn to be funny?"
"Can you learn to do stand up comedy?

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.689
Can you learn to be funny?”
And you can learn to put things in the right

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:24.999
form for it.
I think it's hard to be funny if you're not

00:16:24.999 --> 00:16:29.470
funny.
But learning to be funny in a way that connects

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:37.499
to people requires a kind of fearlessness.
I mean stand up comedy is hard.

00:16:37.499 --> 00:16:41.629
You know, they say in all the polls that public
speaking is the worst fear that people have

00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:46.369
 -- it's worse than snakes or drowning or
plane crashes or anything.

00:16:46.369 --> 00:16:52.569
And stand up comedy is public speaking made
a hundred times more terrifying.

00:16:52.569 --> 00:17:00.499
And so, you have to go up there with the willingness
to be completely disliked and to make a complete

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:07.300
fool of yourself.
And that's, you know, a little bit of bravery

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.730
that a lot of people can't seem to muster.
Although, I do have to say, it's one of the

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:21.110
things -- like most things that people are
afraid of that's more terrifying in theory.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.280
You know, because the big fear is you'll get
up there, you'll tell a joke, and people won't

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.140
laugh.
And it will be horrible.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.120
And the worst thing that ever really happens
is that you get up there, you tell a joke,

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.010
no one laughs, and it's horrible.
And then, okay.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:38.590
It's horrible, it's over, you're still alive,
you're in one piece, and it's not as bad as

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:44.740
you thought it was going to be.
And I think one of the things about stand

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:53.600
up is that you really have to be willing to
know that 95 percent of everything you do

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.320
is going to suck.
And I think that's particularly true of comedy.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.179
I think it's true of all creative endeavors.
I mean, people make bad paintings, people

00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:06.299
write bad books, people make bad movies.
You know, all kinds of stuff.

00:18:06.299 --> 00:18:11.830
But once you get past the fact that 95 percent
of everything you do is going to suck, you're

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:18.990
okay.
Because then when it sucks, it's to be expected.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:24.080
In college, I was very fortunate to take an
acting class with a woman named Nancy Marchand,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.500
who was a wonderful actress on Broadway who
also played the grandmother in the Sopranos.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:36.520
And she said something one time about how,
as an actor, you can't expect the audience

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.970
to suspend their disbelief unless you can
suspend your shame.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.490
Meaning, just that.
And I think that's true of any art form.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:52.890
You can't worry. You can't hold back.
You can't be afraid and expect people to connect

00:18:52.890 --> 00:19:00.010
to you.
And, you know, I think that's been so important

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:05.480
with comedy and so important with the writing.
Is this a really serious lecture for a comedy

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:12.100
book; isn't it?
But the point is, comedy is a serious business.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:17.870
You know, the torture and the agony and the
self-doubt and everything that goes into every

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:22.890
joke, you know, is there.
It's just hiding the machinery and having

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.691
the joke come out and people think it's effortless.
That's really the art.

00:19:25.691 --> 00:19:38.260
Now, one of the things about stand up vs.
the book which I liked -- or I liked more

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.490
about the book was that -- stand up you know
you fail immediately.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.779
You tell a joke, it bombs, and you have to
address it.

00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:49.679
Everyone in the room is uncomfortable, you
know.

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:54.470
Hopefully, it's one joke and not the entire
set, because that's the worst.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:20:01.179
And with the book, it was kind of nice not
to have to worry about that.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.950
"I think this is funny. Oh yeah, it looks
funny.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:08.600
I've reworked it. I can move on.”
And then, it grew actually to reverse where,

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.360
you know, a joke bombs, it's over.
The audience in the room didn't like the joke;

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.190
maybe the next audience will.
The world doesn't think you suck.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.890
Whereas, you know, you write a bad book, it's
kind of permanent, it's out there.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.020
You know, my big fear was that I would walk
down the street and people would be like,

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.380
"Oh, there's that guy Eddie; he wrote that
horrible book.”

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.690
You know?
Or, you see it in the clearance bin in every

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:36.210
store I passed.
And so, I really.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:41.799
I was glad I had the fearlessness or the erratic
fearlessness -- I must admit there are times

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:45.779
when I am terrified -- but the erratic fearlessness
of stand up when writing the book.

00:20:45.779 --> 00:20:47.679
Because otherwise it would have been completely
overwhelming.

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:58.510
I guess one of the other things I wanted to
talk about is, writing comedy is sort of luck.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:04.970
Sort of, you know, you want to be aware of
who's in your audience, but you can't really

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:10.740
change who you are completely.
And you have to just sort of hope that someone's

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:17.649
going to connect to you.
You know, I don't think you can be a good

00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:24.620
comic and be dishonest.
You know, I can't pretend to be some straight

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:34.230
WASPy guy who doesn't have depression, who
didn't go through what he went through.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:42.300
And, you know, with writing the book, I just
had to hope people would find it, you know,

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:48.480
that it would click with someone.
And luckily it has, but I was sort of prepared

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:57.720
for it not to be -- not to happen.
And so, it's been a really good prep for writing

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.690
the book, I have to say.
And the book -- tell you a little bit about

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:08.630
the book -- the book is ten short stories,
autobiographical, humorous, yet also smart

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.720
and funny.
Ranging from everything -- adopting the world's

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.350
worst shelter cat.
My quest for unconditional love from an animal.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:22.029
Having the biggest cheapskate in the world
as a boyfriend.

00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:28.309
I took my parents on a trip to London and
Paris for their anniversary when my father

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:32.179
was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, which is really
my favorite story in the book.

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:36.080
And I think quite poignant because a lot of
people deal with that.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:42.740
It was very accessible to everyone.
I talk about having my heartbroken going online

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:48.400
dating.
Going online screwing, actually, for a period

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.260
of months -- to try and drown my sorrows and
the craziness that happens there.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:23:03.529
Luckily my mother was online dating at the
same time, you know, which was kind of a trip.

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:10.960
And other stories include, I worked at a -- I
had the good fortune in retrospect -- the

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:16.740
misfortune I thought, at the time -- to work
at an upscale gentleman's bar on the Upper

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:27.429
East Side, which was filled with men in their
sixties who were bitter, drunk, old, nasty

00:23:27.429 --> 00:23:32.100
queens.
And I thought, "Oh, you know" -- and as a

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.649
20-something gay guy -- I was like, "Oh, is
this the future? I'm out of here.” You know?

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:45.019
And it really made me be able to see everyone's
struggling, everyone's trying, everyone's

00:23:45.019 --> 00:23:50.850
got something, you know, fantastic about them.
Everyone has a story that would break your

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:54.330
heart.
Everyone has a reason for who they are, and

00:23:54.330 --> 00:24:03.429
it's fascinating.
And it made me, I think, be more aware of

00:24:03.429 --> 00:24:08.130
my own level of sympathy, my own level of
judgmentalness.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.940
So those are some of the things that I cover
in the book.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:21.600
It's -- Oh, I talk about -- I was talking
about my depression, about -- I was also unfortunate

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.450
enough to be the company manager for an ill-fated
Portuguese production of Phantom of the Opera,

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:30.260
which was by far, the worst experience of
my adult life.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:39.480
And ended calamitously in an emergency room.
But, you know, comedy is born of pain, and

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:48.190
it made me stronger.
And I think that that's covers a little bit

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:53.100
about what the book is about.
And what's inspired me to write it and what

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:59.169
prepared me to write it.
And I guess you guys have some questions about

00:24:59.169 --> 00:25:02.600
it?
We can talk about that.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.030
Thanks for participating. That's really helpful.
All right.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:13.529
Q I was interested to hear you talk about
stand up in terms of writing jokes, because

00:25:13.529 --> 00:25:18.060
I've actually heard other stand up comics
say very specifically, they don't write jokes.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.139
They don't tell jokes.

00:25:19.139 --> 00:25:21.830
Eddie Sarfaty: What do they do?

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:29.730
Q I think their point was that what they're
doing is more, you know, situational stories

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.409
that are funny rather than jokes as such.
I wonder if that distinction.

00:25:34.409 --> 00:25:38.779
I kind of wondered if you were getting at
that with your comment about "hiding the machinery.”

00:25:38.779 --> 00:25:41.812
I'd like to know a little bit more what you
mean by that.

00:25:41.812 --> 00:25:47.600
Eddie Sarfaty: Well, I think that as I said,
I really do believe that the impact of the

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:53.010
punch line is inversely proportional to the
length of the set up.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.130
And that if you have a joke and you're taking
a paragraph to get to the punch line, the

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:02.530
punch line is dilluted.
Unless, of course, your paragraph is peppered

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.950
with other jokes.
You know, then it's a series of jokes, it's

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:10.299
not.
I think storytelling is a great thing.

00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:18.010
I wish that the American tradition of storytelling
was more widespread than it is, because there

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:22.919
are wonderful places like The Moth, here in
New York and Speakeasy in D.C., where people

00:26:22.919 --> 00:26:26.450
tell wonderful stories.
Some of them are comedic.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:37.149
Some of them are certainly not.
People have a different definition of what

00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:41.049
they term a joke.
You know A priest, a minister, and a rabbi

00:26:41.049 --> 00:26:44.601
go into a bar.
People think that's a joke.

00:26:44.601 --> 00:26:46.179
Or a knock knock joke, people think that's
a joke.

00:26:46.179 --> 00:26:51.190
People think that jokes aren't serious.
That they're not, you know, that there's no

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:53.880
depth to them.
And I dispute that.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.700
I think a real joke has to have an emotional
component.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:07.210
You know, and I love a joke that draws you
in because of the emotion and then twists

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:20.059
at the end.
You know, a joke I tell is about my boyfriend,

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:22.380
you know, he was from this Christian right
family in Idaho.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.030
And his parents couldn't deal with the gay
issue; they couldn't deal with sex issues

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.580
at all.
You know, when he was 12 years old, his mother

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.100
caught him masturbating.
And she was so stressed about it that she

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.120
smacked him so hard that she knocked him out
of their pew.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:43.000
Now, that's a joke that has emotional content
to it, because people understand that.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.470
The stress of dealing with a child sexuality.
It's something no one's comfortable with -- acknowledging

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.000
that children are sexual beings.
And then, it twists at the end.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.919
So it gets people to think about the subject,
but also makes it safe, because it's absurd.

00:27:58.919 --> 00:28:03.519
So I like jokes.
I think jokes are, as I said, a wonderful

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:06.620
American vehicle to connect with people and
relieve stress.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.409
And in our multicultural world, there's a
lot of stress.

00:28:10.409 --> 00:28:17.179
Anybody else? Please.

00:28:17.179 --> 00:28:26.860
Q Something I have often wondered about when
I listen to a stand up comic is, How much

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.720
of the persona they're presenting is character
and how much of it is them?

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:38.570
Eddie Sarfaty: Well, as I said, there are
some people, you know, there's a range of

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.690
what's considered stand up comedy and I certainly
embrace the range, because I think people

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.529
have different strengths in bringing different
things to the stage.

00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:52.720
Some people are definite characters.
Some people are great mimics.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.460
I have a friend who can go from being Joan
Rivers to being Robert Muir to being a Hoover

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:03.960
Upright in ten minutes, and it's brilliant.
I can't do that.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:09.960
There are some people who've created a persona.
You know, like when Roseanne Barr first began

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:16.350
doing that whole Domestic goddess thing she
did was a persona, but it's based on her.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.570
You know, there's got to be some truth in
what you're doing.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:27.210
You don't want to see somebody be -- I mean,
you go see a play if you want to see somebody

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.850
be somebody different.
The thing that fascinates me is that, people

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:37.370
as diverse as Richard Pryor and Henny Youngman
and Roseanne Barr can all touch the same audience

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.710
and connect to the same group of people.
If they were all on the same bill, it would

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.420
be a fantastic night.
They're all completely different.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:49.610
And their stories are so different.
But they're touching people.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:53.230
For me, the big pleasure about stand up comedy
is that I get to be me.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.940
I was a theater major in college.
I thought I wanted to be an actor since I

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:04.149
was a little kid.
And I discovered that it was much more fun

00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:09.289
to get up and say what I wanted to say, the
way I wanted to say it, rather than trying

00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:12.820
to figure out what the author's intent was,
and take into consideration the director's

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:21.669
point of view and all this stuff.
I think that.

00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:24.399
Yeah, I guess that's about it on that. Go
further.

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:30.429
But I hope you have another question, because
no one else is talking.

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:31.750
Q [inaudible]

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:41.159
Eddie Sarfaty: I'd be happy to read. Something
short.

00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:49.460
I'll read the first piece in the book. It's
only four pages.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:57.429
And this was a story about when I, at 21,
told my grandmother that I was gay.

00:30:57.429 --> 00:31:01.090
And the book -- although I'm reading the gay
section -- is not only gay.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.020
There's a lot of stuff for everybody.
And people worry about, "It's a gay book.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:09.179
I can't read it.”
[reading now] I make my grandmother cry.

00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:13.379
I come out to her, and her fists close and
her eyes fill up.

00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:18.450
And she's silent for the longest moment.
And then, speaking through the tears, she

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:23.529
astonishes me, "It's that gym where you go.
That's where they all are.”

00:31:23.529 --> 00:31:29.269
Her assertion makes me laugh.
How could she possibly know that?

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:34.059
She's never been to my gym.
How could my frail, little grandma, a sheltered

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:38.620
girl from an orthodox family, a woman who
has barely left the house for the past 30

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:44.440
years, have any kind of insight on the subject?
The conversation continues with her becoming

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.860
progressively more and more upset.
She's perched on the upholstered, green rocker

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:54.000
from J.C. Penney, a half-finished afghan in
her lap, and I'm sitting Indian-style on the

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.980
wall-to-wall carpet facing her.
I'm peripherally aware of my mom and dad listening

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:04.250
helplessly to the whole exchange as they pretend
to wash dishes in the next room.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:10.700
Though I came out to my parents at college,
as a rule, I manage to find a million nonsexual

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.610
things to talk about when visiting them, a
relief since when I was with my friends, sex

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.299
was the only thing we ever seemed to talk
about.

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:24.549
But this time, Granny brings up the issue
and continues pressing it, until I have no

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:28.830
choice but to come clean.
She also confesses to having purposely avoided

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:35.530
the subject of my sexuality until now, but
has finally decided to take the leap.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.269
"Well, I thought that you were.
And I made up my mind I was going to ask you.”

00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:44.259
"Well, how do you feel?”
"It's a shock.”

00:32:44.259 --> 00:32:50.049
She sheds more tears, and my soothing accelerates
to match her distress.

00:32:50.049 --> 00:32:54.889
I hand her a Kleenex, and I hold her hand.
My mother, accustomed to taking charge in

00:32:54.889 --> 00:33:00.830
a crisis, takes advantage of my grandmother's
poor hearing, tiptoes behind her rocker, shakes

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:04.300
her head, and mouths to me, "You shouldn't
have told her.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.210
You shouldn't have told her.”
That's a big help.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:11.870
With an evil stare, I sent her back to the
sink and continued my comforting.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.840
Two seconds later, the phone rings.
I hear my mother pick it up and I can tell

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.240
from her voice, it's my brother Jack, who's
in grad school in Chicago.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:26.019
I turn my attention back to Granny as my mother
calls from the kitchen, "Ed, Ed, pick up the

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:29.269
phone.”
Annoyed, I yell back, "Not now, for God's

00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:32.399
sake.”
And then, I hear my mother announcing, as

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:37.120
if into a public address system, "He can't
come to the phone.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:42.100
He's telling Grandma that he's gay.”
And so, I'm outed to my brother, and I think,

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.630
"Okay, one less call to make.”
I spend the next hour or so quietly seated

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.400
on the floor, and then leave my grandmother
to catch the train back to New York and the

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:58.029
apartment that I share with three other 20-somethings
 -- all gay, and in various stages of self-loathing.

00:33:58.029 --> 00:34:01.620
The incident is constantly on my mind the
entire week.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.290
It's still on her mind too when I call two
days later, "Hi, Granny, how are you?”

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:12.500
"How do you think I am?” A pin drops.
"What are you doing? Watching TV?”

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.470
"No, I'm just thinking.”
Crickets.

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:19.200
"Well, what are you thinking about?”
"WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M THINKING ABOUT?"

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.770
Similar stressful exchanges occur on days
three, four, and five.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.470
Now, being the youngest, the favorite, and
the only one who still lives close enough

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:31.560
to visit regularly, I feel a special devotion
to my grandmother.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.020
Our relationship is one of the most wonderful
things in my life.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:40.560
She lived with us while I was growing up,
my maturation coinciding with her decline.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.120
At the age of 95 -- although she'll only admit
to being 92 -- her mind is sharp, but her

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.070
body is brittle.
As time passes, I find myself more and more

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:54.570
in the role of the adult, keeping her informed,
preparing her meals, and helping her into

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.570
bed.
The possibility that the bond between us could

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:04.000
be permanently damaged is crippling to me.
After almost two weeks of tense, awkward phone

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.950
calls, I again go home for a visit.
There's no reference to my revelation.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:14.600
The day passes far more easily than I expect.
And it isn't until late at night when it even

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.180
comes up.
I'm tucking Granny in, gently, rotating her

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:24.280
fragile legs on to the bed while I cradle
her back and slowly lower her on to the mattress.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.150
As I smooth out the corner, she brings up
the subject that we've managed to avoid the

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:33.330
entire day.
"So, you don't like a girl to get married.”

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.960
My body tenses. "No.”
"You prefer a boy.”

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:44.790
I breathe deeply, "Yes.”
She pauses and then says resolutely, "Well,

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.310
then that'll be your life and you will be
happy that way.” "Yes.”

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:54.640
My tension melts away but returns when she
says, "But it's not like making love with

00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.570
a girl. What can you do?"
I see where this is leading, and I try to

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.610
head it off.
"Well, Grandma, it's not about sex.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:07.340
It's about who you love and who you care for.”
But she will not be deterred, "Yes, yes. I

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.680
know that, but it's not like with a girl.
What can you do?”

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.700
I dodge the question, she presses, I parry,
she asks again.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.160
I change the subject.
She changes it back.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.650
And finally after the fifth, "But what can
you do?”

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:25.030
I blurt out, "Well, I have two hands.”
"So, what are you -- just jerp each other

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:31.110
off?" I'm stunned, horrified, and amused all
at the same time.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:37.120
"Grandma!" She laughs to break the tension.
But then continues, "You know, I hear that

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.990
some of the boys use the behind.”
I laugh to break the tension.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:49.160
I toyed with a couple of comebacks.
"Wow, Grandma, what a great idea.”

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:54.280
Or "Yeah, some of them do."
But settled for planting a simple kiss on

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:59.450
her forehead and saying, "Goodnight.”
Thereafter that, our relationship is almost

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:03.330
back to normal.
She's totally accepting, but it isn't clear

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:07.150
how much she understands the specifics of
the situation.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:12.020
She knows I'm gay, but appears hopeful whenever
I even mention a woman by name.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.830
She repeatedly asks my brother, "What made
him that way?”

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:21.280
And confides to my mother her worries that
I'm destined to become a prostitute -- proposition

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.200
that, given my precarious finances, occasionally
worries me too.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.750
My mother, who joined PFLAG -- the parents
and friends of lesbians and gays -- immediately

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:35.800
after I came out suggests giving my grandmother
a copy of, "Now that you know" -- a book that

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.990
the group recommends, and that I cynically
refer to as, "Everything you always wanted

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.560
to know about homosexuality, but were afraid
to hear.”

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.420
I pick up a copy for my grandmother.
Two weeks later, I'm home for a visit and

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.960
to do some laundry.
I see the book lying on the night stand.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.400
The wrinkled spine and folded corners tell
me it's been read.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.600
I turn to Granny, who's busily working on
yet another afghan,

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.880
"Hey, Granny, did you read that book?”
The crochet hook stops.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:09.780
She looks up, and says point-blank, "Yes,
and it's disgusting."

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.760
My heart sinks and my guard goes up.
"Disgusting?"

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.050
"Yes. It's disgusting.
It says that some of the parents don't love

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.490
their children anymore.”
And she makes me cry.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:22.490
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:29.680
&gt;&gt; Thanks. That's a little taste.
That's the first story in the book.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:35.050
As I tell you it goes onto other things at
other points in my life ranging -- that's

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:40.820
the story that takes place in 1986 and goes
all the way up to 2006.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:44.530
And I guess we're done here.
And thank you so much for taking your lunch

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.339
hour to spend time with me.
I appreciate it. And enjoy the book.

00:38:47.339 --> 00:38:47.460
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
