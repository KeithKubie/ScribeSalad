Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:26.090
[ Silence ]

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.770
&gt;&gt; Mekaella Vailu'u:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.170
Seeing a lot of familiar faces,
so thank you for coming again.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.500
This will be our third and
final event that I have planned.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.540
If this is your first
one that you've attended,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.890
I wanted to take a second
to introduce myself.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.680
I'm a student from EKU which
is Eastern Kentucky University.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.030
My major is deaf studies,
and the ITP that we have.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.380
Political science is my minor.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.050
So, yes, I'm an interpreting
student at Eastern.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.780
During my tenure at the
Library, I have hosted

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630
and planned three events.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.930
They're listed on the board.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.150
The first dealt with technology

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.330
and how it influenced deaf
culture in the deaf world.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.620
And then, second, it was
Divia [phonetic] Art.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.110
And then, third, we'll be talking
about preserving deaf culture.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.910
There will be a fourth
that is not related

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.980
to deaf culture, but
it is another event.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.660
It will focus on my
family heritage and lineage

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.680
which is of the Samoan culture.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.110 position:56%
A Congress woman will be coming,
and she will be a part of the event.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.740
Her name is Amata, and she will be
coming during that presentation.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.900
For today, we invited
Max Williamson.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.800
He used to actually
be one of my teachers,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.730
and he moved to the DC area.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.980
And so very honored to have him
come and to talk about his culture,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.880
his experience, and his community.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.400 position:56%
Without further ado, Mr. Williamson.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.620
&gt;&gt; Max Williamson: Hello.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.920
So like she said, previously
I was an employee

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.920
at Eastern Kentucky University.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.720
I graduated from Gallaudet with
my master's, and right now I'm

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.080
on my track to get my PhD.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.270
I do work with a lot of
deaf/blind consumers,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.670
and that is my specialty right now.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.540
So recently Mekaella asked me if
I would come and do a presentation

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.220
and just kind of comment on
how to preserve deaf culture.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.610
And I'm really honored
to be here and meet many

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.910
of you that have come today.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.950
So today's focus is
going to be on how

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.200
to preserve American deaf culture.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.290
And within that, I'm going to
touch on a few subtopics as well,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.060
and we'll go through that as
the presentation goes along.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.560
So many of you might be
asking, what is deaf culture?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.270
And really deaf culture consists
of many different cultures.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.450
There's black deaf culture,
deaf/blind, deaf culture, LGBT.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.460
And so there are many
facets within deaf culture,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.370
but one thing that we all have
in common is that we're deaf.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.120
So at the same time, the black deaf
community has their own language

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.220
variances as well as the
deaf/blind community.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.820
So deaf culture can, in some
ways, be very all consuming.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.720
So right now you are going to have
a chance to see George Veditz.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.540
This is the his sign name.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.900
And I'm just going to show a short
clip of it, about one minute.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.320
Just so that you can
kind of get an idea

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.130
of what this looked
like way back then.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.850
And this was recorded in 1913.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.060
It was the first time that
ASL was ever recorded.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.510
It's a short clip.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:29.040
[ Background Sounds ]

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.420
So I actually made a mistake.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.510
Sorry, it was on the August 1913.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:59.170
[ Background Sounds ]

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.470
I'm not sure if you can see it.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.770
Let's try to dim the lights.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.570
Is that any better?

00:05:03.570 --> 00:07:59.310
[ Silence ]

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.390
If you're curious about the video,

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.490
you can access this link
on Gallaudet's website.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.570
We were having problems before
connecting it with the PowerPoint,

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.130
but if you're interested
in finishing the video,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.440
you can find that at Gallaudet.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.270
So the next slide we're going to
talk about the Milan conference,

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:26.630
and that happened in 1880 in Italy.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.650
And what this was was there
was a conference that decided

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.280
that deaf language and community

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.740
and culture would not be
included in education.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:46.570
And so Veditz recorded this video
to point out that we do need

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.740
to preserve the language.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.050
And so that's why we
recorded the video in 1913.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.200
And Veditz felt that
a lot of the jobs

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.220
that deaf individuals were
holding were starting to be lost,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.490
and he predicted that
eventually ASL would be gone.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.240
Sorry, I'm allowing the
interpreter to catch up.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.280
So his purpose was to preserve it.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:32.300
So here you see a picture of
Alexander Graham Bell, AG Bell.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.570
And you know him as the man
who invented the telephone.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.940
But actually that was a
mistake after he was working

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.390
with the Milan conference and
he agreed with oral education,

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.510
he wasn't too supportive
of sign language.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.370
Even Veditz talked about
the oppression in his video.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:02.530
And so the suppression
of sign language.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.620
And he felt that sign language was
important, and that it was a part

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.310
of deaf culture and
that it was something

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.520
that needed to be continued.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:18.420
Alexander Graham Bell
had a deaf wife, and so,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:26.100
and she actually felt similar to AG
Bell in supporting oral education.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.520
In fact, she herself was
oral, and she thought

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.510
that everyone else
should be the same.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:40.690
[ Silence ]

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.800
So NAD, the National
Association of the Deaf,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.580
they did more historical
research for AG Bell.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.960
And currently NAD is near
Gallaudet University.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.730
So I just want to go back a
little bit and mention Veditz

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.340
and that he's one of the
grandfathers of deaf culture

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.390
as well as Laurent Clerc.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.500
And still to this day, they
really affect deaf culture

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.400
and Laurent Clerc came from France,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.210
and then you see this
development of sign language.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.570 position:56%
And so the video that we showed, the
language is a little bit different.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.150
And so it's similar
to English and that

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.140
as the language develops you see
some changes and the influence

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.550 position:56%
of culture changes and advancements
in technology, and things like that.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:53.910
So we really do value both of them,
both Veditz and Laurent Clerc.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.640
So how do we preserve culture?

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.090
There's two ways.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.820
One, through advocacy with
organizations such as NAD,

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.230
the National Association of Deaf.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:14.110
There's RID, and they do
a lot of advocacy work

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.660
with the deaf community,
hard of hearing individuals.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.860
They're very supportive.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:28.480
DHH and Deaf and Hard of Hearing
Commission are very similar.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.230
Each state has their own commission
that works within the state,

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.470
so those are very similar.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.480
So there is KCDHH, I
think Texas has one.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.070
So each of the states
has their own DHH.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.190
And then there's LEAD K [phonetic].

00:12:54.790 --> 00:13:05.470
And that is Language Education
Acquisition of Deaf Children.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.050
So you can also preserve
through actions.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.510
If you notice the first
point is Deafhood.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:23.500
[ Background Sounds ]

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.290
And Deafhood does collaborations
and workshops

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.050
and they hold a lot
of training events.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.640
And so they have two focuses.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.330
They focus within the community
and sharing about deaf experience,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.400
and then they also have
a more general focus

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.920
on just educating people
on Deafhood.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:56.020
And now there's the grass
roots movement, DGM.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.660
Oh, there's a question.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.170
The question was?

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.510
Do you mind explaining what
the grass roots movement is?

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:12.290
[ Silence ]

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.380
The grass roots movement is based
on people who are very immersed

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.600
in deaf culture and who have
experienced that oppression

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.580
and oddism throughout
their deaf walk of life.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.630
And so this is now a formal
organization that touches

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.180
on all of their experiences.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.800
So the grass roots is actually part
of Deafhood, and deaf could be used

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.460
as a general word to describe just
the life of somebody who's deaf

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.310
and their deaf experience.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:52.470
And the grass roots movement
kind of shows that, you know,

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.500
we might be deaf, but we
have all of these skills,

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.800
and we're capable of doing a lot.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.510
And I actually put this one
down a little bit wrong.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:08.470
[ Background Sounds ]

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.480
And this one focuses on teaching
ablism within the culture

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.980
and promoting all of the things
that we are actually able to do.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:24.580
And then these last two, I
mean, these are very popular,

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.910
they're used a lot, and I will
expand on both the hashtag

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.570
and the vlog in just a little bit.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.950
So and these aren't all of
the pathways to advocacy.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.280
There are many more
ways to get involved,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.340
and you can do lot more research

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.690
and find many advocacy
groups that are available.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.860
So here are a few things that I
think would be helpful to know.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.930
And I just found a few pictures
just to kind of explain each one.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.700
The picture over here on
your left is a picture

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.880
of the first deaf school that
was established in America,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.710
it's called the American
school for the deaf.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.370
It's in Connecticut.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.720
And then this one here on
the bottom is a deaf club.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.580
And right now, unfortunately, we
see a lot of deaf clubs closing,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.480
and there's not as
much socialization.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:25.260
And then we notice also that a
lot of the students aren't going

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.940
to deaf schools, they're
actually being mainstreams,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:33.520 position:56%
and then now we have the interpreter
education programs and degrees.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.960 position:56%
And then this picture up here on
top is a picture of tactile signing,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.700
and that can be done with
deaf/blind or deaf people

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.050
who have a loss of
vision or low vision.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:52.700
And it's another subset of
language within the community.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.340
And it's still prevalent today.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.620
So and we have deaf/blind clubs
as well where they get together

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.620
and share information
and talk about advances

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.960
in technology and things like that.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.930
And so there's a lot
of different groups.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.230
There's a question
from the audience.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.510
He will copy sign.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:38.040

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.660
So the question is asking about
deaf clubs and how it's the comment

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.580
on how there are many
in Maryland and DC

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.510
because now they have
happy hours [laughs].

00:17:48.510 --> 00:18:01.040
[ Background Sounds ]

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.140
So happy hours are like
a get together, right.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.470
So we do see the closure
of deaf clubs,

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.140
and they're just kind
of disappearing.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.810
But the language and the culture is
still prevalent, it still exists.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:20.580
And so you see the switch of
focus to maybe happy hours in bars

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.700
or restaurants, things like that,

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.340
different establishments
around the DC area.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.370
But those are still places that
deaf individuals can gather.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.900
As well as provide exposure
to people who are hearing

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.330 position:56%
and haven't seen sign language, they
now see people signing at a table,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.660
and that provides a
source of interest for them

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.450
to learn or to possibly join in.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.780
And then we can kind of expose them
to our language and our culture

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.020
and show them that this is
something that's worth preserving,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.510 position:56%
and we really do tend to welcome
people into our culture in that way.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:19:00.430
[ Background Sounds ]

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.520
So what happens when kef
culture is preserved?

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.980
You know, we can have kind of
a forward looking view on this.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.220
Right here, a lot of people know.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:14.210
Or before I mention LEAD K, Nyle
DiMarco, he's involved with LEAD K.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.170
And major advocate of
children and language

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.030
and culture exposure
at an early age.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.660
So we see a lot of advocacy.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:26.150
He's from, in California
they recently passed a law

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.680
that required language
acquisition for students

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.140 position:56%
that were deaf, and that they would.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.930
It was about a month ago.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.830 position:56%
And all of these people were worked,

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.650
they had a collaborative
effort to all work together.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.100
Nyle, he won America's
Next Top Model.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.340
And everybody had such
a great exposure to ASL

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.000
and to culture at that time.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.940
Now, he's on the other show,
Dancing with the Stars.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.800
And that's the continued exposure
that, no, the language is not gone

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.860
and that the advocacy still exists.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.320
And so they did pass that law,
and then he was an advocate

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.870
of that bill because it was passed.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.340
And Iowa as well passed
a piece of legislation.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.640
A question, who was that?

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.510 position:56%
That's Nyle, and he has a sign name.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:24.040
[ Silence ]

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.050
So the comment from the audience
was that Nyle DiMarco is his name.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.840
There is a foundation that was just
established, and he set that up

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.330
that would provide resource
and materials for people

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.220
for hearing individuals
to how to work with people

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.070
that are deaf and students.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:50.490
Similar to how AG Bell had written
an article about, he was hearing

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.020
who decided how education
should happen

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.460
for individuals that are deaf.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.410
And that we would see a decrease
in the language and exposure.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:02.630
But now Nyle has spoken
in opposition of that.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.890
He's signing on TV, he's
signing in the media,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.270
and along with his foundation shows
the importance of the preservation.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:16.200
So he is the modern day
Veditz, and that deaf children

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.550
with hearing parents that we
should encourage them to sign.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:26.540
It's the same with deaf parents who
have hearing children that the more

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.470 position:56%
and more that we expose them to
this language and that the language,

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.720
that they can succeed
in the same ways.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.020
So it's the preservation
of the culture

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.320
and the preservation
of the language.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.870 position:56%
So a lot of AG Bell had disseminated
some incorrect information

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.320 position:56%
about the importance of making sure
that we do keep this language alive.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:54.720
So these are just more and
more news and there's the guy

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.370
in the corner called Moth Man.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:01.720 position:56%
We have I-News, deaf publications,
and we're seeing a lot more and more

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.290 position:56%
of the education and the
information sharing that's happening

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.320
because of the integration
of social media

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.220
and its true take off
in our society.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.020
You know, we have Facebook,
Twitter, vlogs.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:18.770
And I had mentioned vlogs
before that we're making sure

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.680
that the language there
is able to be kept.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.950
And it's not disappearing.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.880
Because we have our
online resources,

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.220
we're able to teach children and
have them exposed to a wide range

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.550
of language and a wide
range of styles of language.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:38.050
We have Deaf Nation.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:42.770
They have different events that
happen and booths all set up.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.430
They're open to the public.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.120
People are all welcome to
come and see the culture.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.780
So people are like, they
happened to see what's new,

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.270
what's new in the world,
what's up and coming.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.360 position:56%
And that's a Deaf Nation, the expos.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.100
Also, deaf art, there
are deaf artists

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.610
that use the language
to represent art.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.350
So being able to see some
of the language meshed

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:15.720 position:56%
with art is a great way to really
showcase the beauty of the language.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.960
So before we talked about hashtag,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.820
and that's the new
thing that's coming up.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.160
There's one that's
hashtag why I sign.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.110
There's another one, hashtag
dancing with the stars.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.960
And, right, the audience
member said, yeah,

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.980
there is a hashtag AGB for AG Bell.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.470
So before I had talked about AG
Bell how he wrote a very negative,

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.960 position:56%
there was a negative article written

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.340
from the foundation
that was sent out.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.080
And so there was a hashtag
there where people were speaking

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.750
in opposition trying to get the
message back to the foundation

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.870
that this is not the current
climate and the environment

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.880
in which we want the
language to disseminate.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.340
And so we're looking around
saying, wow, all of these people

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.850
that are deaf, that are
using sign language.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.350
So because of social media and
the technological advances,

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.860
we really are able to
spread our message.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.970
So in historical mindset,
we had Veditz.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.350
And then now we have
hashtags and vlogs in a way

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:25.440
to preserve the culture
and language.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.580
I have some other comments and
some other stories, but if anybody

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.340
from the audience wanted to share.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:38.660
So, yeah, a member of the
audience said, could you describe

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.780
about deaf schools and deaf
education and what happened

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.180
in Iowa and New Mexico as well.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.520
Some of these schools
are being closed.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:57.900
Do you mind to talk about that?

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.420
Yeah, we're noticing a lot
of deaf schools and a lot

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.290
of deaf school closures as well
as the decrease in numbers.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.460
So people are trying to figure out
how do we keep them from closing?

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.830
How do we stress the importance
of these institutions and that

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:15.870
with LEAD K and other advocacy
groups, we're able to document

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.290
and support through justification
the need to keep these schools.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.170
And it's important to keep.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:26.870
In New Mexico, actually, they
are fighting it right now.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.270
Pennsylvania School for the Deaf,

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:33.820
there's some issues
with the president.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.790
And in Pennsylvania, they
have a superintendent,

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.550
and there's some issues
there with the politics

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.750
of how the school is being ran.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.630
And understand this is
not just a domestic issue.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.480
We're seeing it in Canada as well,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.540
and across borders we're
seeing it in Portugal.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:55.480 position:56%
And there's a lot of deaf oppression
that's happening worldwide.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.990
Coming from the audience
is, how about Sweden?

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.290
Have you heard anything
about Sweden?

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:10.230
Yeah, in Sweden there
are some people

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.830
that are experiencing oppression.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:21.410
There was a videotape, something
had happened many years ago

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.470
that there was a big building

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:28.610
because of funding they
had bought it to replace

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.690
and demolish the deaf school.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.380
But there still is some
socialization issues

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.240
with the deaf students.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.570
Hang on one second while he's
getting the audience comment.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:51.860
At deaf schools, there were
hearing teachers in Sweden.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.920
You know, a lot of that
is happening in Sweden.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.030
Seeing a lot of decrease in numbers
of deaf students and deaf schools.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:05.830
So, yes, that is a way
to share information.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.720
It's a way that Sweden has been
looking at some of our structures

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.250
and our systems in here of
how to use us as a model

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.300
for their school systems.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.790
So, yeah, he had just mentioned
before about mainstream schools

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.030
which are just the
general public schools.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.860
And a lot of hearing parents have
a predilection to put them in,

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.600
to put their deaf children
into schools.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.170
They just think that
communication, you know,

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.310
they'll have an interpreter
should it should be fine.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.540
But we're seeing now that a
deaf school is the best place.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.470 position:56%
It has the emersion, and it's the
best place for language acquisition.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.110
Communication at a mainstream
school will have to be facilitated

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.200
through an interpreter
most of the time.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.540
And at those schools, they're
not learning the cultures,

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.840
they're not having
that insemination.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.070 position:56%
But at deaf schools, they have the
deaf clubs, they're able to graduate

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.440
and learn and really feel that
they're a proud deaf person

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.910
and to have the language
and culture inside of them.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.360
They don't feel dismissed
from society,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.710 position:56%
and as well as the language, they're
still able to acquire and to keep.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.240
So now, again, I will stress
the importance of social media

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.580
and what its takeoff has meant.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.940
Technology, what it has
done for the language

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:25.690
that we're forever able
to keep it with us?

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.390
&gt;&gt; I have a question
about deaf culture.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:35.190
It's about the content
of deaf culture.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.730
I was trained to be a
cataloger at a GPO when I worked

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.070
at GPO by a deaf cataloger.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:46.440
And there was no interpreting
services there at the time.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:53.010
And I had a wonderful experience
learning from her, and afterwards,

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.110
I wondered when I was
this training so good.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:02.900
And I came to understand that
hearing people like to talk a lot.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.150
There's a lot of BS.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.660
And this is my question
as an outsider.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.840
And I realized that
she taught me in a way

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:19.490
where her words were very important
and very short and concise.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:24.030
So my question is, as a hearing
person, if I would listen

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:30.910
to deaf poetry, for example, or
deaf comedy, would it be something

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.880
that would be more compressed
or shorter in content

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:50.780
if you understand my question?

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.680
&gt;&gt; Max Williamson: Yeah, maybe
ask it again in a different way.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:01.130
Yeah, if that's okay, ask it again.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:06.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My experience learning from a
deaf teacher as a hearing person was

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:12.180
that she was very concise
and to the point.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.840
Very little BS.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:23.380 position:56%
And I'm wondering if I went to a
deaf cultural event like deaf comedy

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:30.460
or deaf poetry, whether the
expression would be that same way,

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:36.460
more concise and shorter
in terms of its content?

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.620
&gt;&gt; Max Williamson: Okay, so you
think that maybe like deaf culture

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.480 position:56%
and the deaf language is more
concise and to the point on its own?

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.780
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.020
&gt;&gt; Max Williamson: Okay, sure.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:11.040
[ Silence ]

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.290
The language is structured
differently.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:18.390 position:56%
There are different grammatical
rules in everything than in English.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.820
So it does tend to start out with
the point and then it's explained.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:27.290
So what is the point,
expansion, talk about what it is,

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.760
and then summarize the point.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.390
But in terms of comedy and poetry,
there are some very specific

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:39.260
and idiosyncratic portions of that
that we can see that English has,

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.550
but to interpret between
them is different.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.860
So the cultural part, understand

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.420
that deaf typically are more
direct, blunt, and to the point.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.390
Whereas hearing try to kind of
obfuscate a little bit, maybe,

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.380
you know, oh, skirt around
the question or the point.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.890
It's like, oh, a deaf
person said, wow,

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.310
it looks like you've gained weight.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:03.320
You know, so there
could be that as well.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.860
Does that make sense?

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.940
&gt;&gt; Yes. And I noticed the deaf
community here is very blunt

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.740
and to the point.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:28.360
Yeah, and the point isn't
to insult or to be rude.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.870
It's just to, it doesn't
offend us, it's just kind of.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.560
In the deaf community when we
socialize with hearing people,

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.110
they'll look at us like, whoa, that
was way too blunt, way too direct.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.400
But it's really just part of our
culture in how we communicate

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.700
and interact with each other.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.160
Hearing people, they understand
me totally fine or with the things

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.890 position:56%
that I might say to other deaf, they
could take it in a much better they

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.510
than when I communicate
with my hearing cohorts.

[ Silence ]

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.640
&gt;&gt; So we have just mentioned before
about the preservation of language.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.650
And why do we cherish the language?

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:33.540
I think before let's back up for a
little bit and talk about a child

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.230
that is born deaf to
hearing parents.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.530
They don't have sign language.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:45.270
So they're obviously going
to be on a language delay.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:55.530
And we want these deaf children to
be able to acquire their language.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.880
That's why they have to start
signing at an early age.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.990
We had mentioned that there
was the new law that was passed

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.580
that immediately out of
hospital, a baby has to go

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.070
through a hearing test, and they
will be screened for hearing.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.810
That way they can find what is
the best modality to expose them

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.750
to language at an early age.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:18.760
Often, hearing parents,
they have hearing children.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.060
It's not a problem.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.990
Hearing children have
language acquisition

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:27.390
because of their hearing
parents, and they're able

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:29.410
to share the same language.

00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:31.760
You know, if they don't
understand something, they can cry.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.690
The hearing parents are able to
realize that there is some type

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.650
of communication with them.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.960 position:56%
We have started to see that they're
signing, hearing parents are signing

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.400
with their hearing babies.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.700
Some of the basic signs.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.000
Because they're seeing

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.690
that communication can
happen easier that way.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.630
So it's another reason
why we cherish and want

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.930
to preserve our language.

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:57.040

Right, thank you for that.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.950
It really is about the language.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.880
There is one videotape
that I had seen

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.120
that juxtaposes two children
being raised in an environment.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.960
One is exposed to sign
language and the other is not.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.000
We see the success, they
graduate, have a job,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.040
and are able to take off, while the
other one continues to struggle.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.400
And that video really
emphasizes the importance

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.040
of early language exposure.
