[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:07.220
MANUSHI SHAH: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.320
Welcome to the Talks
at Google event.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.890
I am Manushi Shah.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.190
And I would like
to introduce Isaac.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.670
So we are here for his
book "Eyes Wide Open."

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.900
Isaac was born with a rare
degenerative disease of retina

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.870
that caused him to
gradually lose his sight.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.640
Despite all the hurdles that his
disease has brought upon him,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.200
Isaac has led a very
successful life.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.420
He played Weasel on
"Saved by the Bell."

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.900
He graduated from Harvard
College at age of 19

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.570
with a degree in mathematics
and computer science.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.090
He also graduated from
Harvard Law School

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.310
and served as a law clerk for
Supreme Court Justice Sandra

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.820
O'Connor and Ruth Ginsburg.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.000
He also transformed a struggling
concrete subcontractor

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.670
into an industry leading
with $150 million business.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.100
And along with this, he has
also founded Hope for Vision

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.640
which is a nonprofit that funds
the development of treatments

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.580
for binding diseases.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.950
In "Eyes Wide Open," which is
part autobiography and part

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.240
self-help, Isaac Lidsky
shares a very inspiring story

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.500
of achieving
success in his life.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.045
So I would like to
introduce Isaac.

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:17.045
ISAAC LIDSKY: Thank you.

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:17.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.260
All right.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.540
Excellent.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.294
How's everybody doing?

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:24.210
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.560
ISAAC LIDSKY: All right.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.720
Yeah.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.303
I was going to say,
I got to hear you,

00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:28.820
because I obviously
can't see you.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.040
I say that sighted people
are terrified of speaking

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.052
to big crowds,
but us blind folks

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.760
are terrified of
speaking to empty rooms.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.530
So I want to know
you're out there.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.430
All right.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280
So I'm going to ask
you to take a car

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.464
ride with me this afternoon.

00:01:45.464 --> 00:01:47.880
Imagine yourself taking a car
ride with me this afternoon.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.950
So let me give you the context.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.030
You are 13 years old.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.800
So I know for some
of you Googlers,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.160
that's not that far back, but
for others it's a while back.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.770
So take a second, think
back to who you were at 13,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.200
what was going on your
life at that time.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.300
All right, so you're 13.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.389
And your sibling has always
been a little clumsy.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.060
It's sort of part of her sunny,
absent minded disposition.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.600
It's kind of cute.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.860
But not recently.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.120
Recently, there have been some
pretty nasty bumps and bruises

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.860
and some serious scares.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.294
Tragedy was narrowly
avoided a couple times.

00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:27.960
It seems the problem
has something to do

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.720
with your sibling's eyesight.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.420
Your mom takes you all to the
neighborhood ophthalmologist

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.490
office for a checkup.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.551
Now there's nothing
wrong with your eyes.

00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:39.050
Right?

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.730
Remember you're 13 years
old, so you're perfect,

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.190
at least you think you are.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.430
And everything's going well.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.200
Nothing wrong with your eyes,
but still the ophthalmologist

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.270
is clearly troubled
by something he sees.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.510
And he tells your mom
to take all of you kids

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.630
to the Medical
Research Institute

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.840
at the medical school at
the university in town.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.400
So off you go.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.850
And after a very
long day of strange

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.390
and sort of grueling
eye exams, the expert

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.110
tells you that,
like your sibling,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.220
you have a eye disease that
causes progressive loss

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.270
of sight and blindness.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.520
So that's what happened to me.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.740
The sibling was my sister Daria.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.030
The research institute was the
Bascom Palmer Eye Institute

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.860
at the University of Miami.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.060
It was 1993.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.460
And I was 13 years old.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.110
Now before that day, I was
living a Hollywood fairy tale.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.730
I was born to a middle
class family in America

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.060
to parents who loved
me and nurtured me

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.806
and cared for my education.

00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:45.430
I loved school.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.360
It came easy to me.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.144
And I enjoyed it very much.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.560
And as you heard, the Hollywood
part, I mean it literally.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.460
I grew up acting.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.329
I did about 100 to
150 commercials,

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.870
got some lucky breaks
here and there,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.200
and was ultimately
cast as Weasel Wyzell

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.380
on NBC TV'S "Saved by
the Bell: The New Class."

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.920
I was the sort of dorky
character, the nerd,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.170
so it was quite a challenge
for me as an actor.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.220
Nonetheless, I played that role.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.140
So that was before.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.300
At the end of the long day at
Bascom Palmer Eye Institute,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.490
everything changed.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.339
Right?

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.980
Dr. W. called us
into his office.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.550
He took a medical textbook
off the shelf behind his desk.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.730
He flipped through the pages,
found the one he wanted,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.740
put the book on
the desk facing us.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.790
And he pointed to
some photographs.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.010
He said those are pictures
of the retinas of patients

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.210
with a disease called
retinitis pigmentosa, or RP.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.250
RP causes progressive loss of
sight and ultimately blindness.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.590
Daria and Isaac have
RP and will go blind.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.270
There are no treatments.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.620
There are no cures.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.780
We don't really know
much about the disease.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.150
Good luck.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.200
That was it.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.970
We got up and we left.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.245
And we got back my mom's
car for a long ride home.

00:05:05.245 --> 00:05:06.620
So that's the car
ride I want you

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.230
to imagine yourselves taking
with me this afternoon, please.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.360
So you sit in the
back of the car.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.690
Your mom tries very hard not
to cry, with little success.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.880
Your siblings are crying, too.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.480
And you are trying
to make some sense

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.300
of the diagnosis of the
information you've just

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.760
gained for miles and miles.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.880
So how do you feel?

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.560
And what is it that you're
thinking in that car?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.820
Fear is a powerfully
destructive force in our lives.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.670
Fear distorts our reality.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.730
Under the warped logic
of fear, anything

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.860
is better than the uncertain.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.440
Fear will fill the
void at all costs,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.650
passing off what you
dread for what you know,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.160
offering up the worst in
place of the ambiguous,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.820
substituting
assumption for reason.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.010
Psychologists call
it awfulizing.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.510
Fear replaces the
unknown with the awful.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.270
Now fear is self-realizing.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.930
When we face the greatest
need to look beyond ourselves,

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.350
to gain more information,
to think critically,

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.650
fear beats a retreat
deep inside your mind

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.029
shrinking and
distorting your view,

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.820
drowning your capacity
for critical thought

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.120
with a flood of
disruptive emotions.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.160
When you face a
compelling opportunity

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.360
to transcend, to
thrive, to overcome,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.590
fear lulls you into
inaction enticing

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.824
you to passively watch its
prophecies fulfill themselves.

00:06:48.824 --> 00:06:50.740
So how did I feel in the
back of my mom's car?

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.690
I felt terrified.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.430
And what was I thinking?

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.740
I was thinking blindness
will absolutely ruin my life.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.700
In fact, I wasn't thinking
that so much as I knew it.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.020
I didn't think it, I knew it.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.250
Here's what I knew in the
back of that car that day.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.780
Blindness will ruin my life.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.780
Blindness is a death
sentence for my independence.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.630
Blindness is the end
of achievement for me.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.240
It means that I am going
to live an unremarkable

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.510
life, small and sad.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.040
I'm going to live
that life alone.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.080
No woman is going to
love or respect me.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.920
I'm not going to love
or respect myself.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.460
So I won't have any kids, which
is probably for the better,

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.620
because no child deserves that.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.900
And in a sense, I'm always
going to be a child.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.600
So that's what I knew in the
back of that car that day.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.790
Now fear's work doesn't end
with the baseless reality

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.870
it concocts in your mind.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.620
That's where fear's
work really begins.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.190
To perpetuate this reality,
fear must trick you

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.010
into playing your part.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.450
Now fear's accomplices in this
con are heroes and villains.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.540
Fear conjures up a world in
which heroes and villains

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.820
do battle for your fate like
gods of Greek mythology acting

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.620
from Mount Olympus.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.920
Blame your villains, fear
will whisper in your ear.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.860
The fault lies with others, the
problem is your circumstances.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.040
Worship your heroes,
fear will admonish you.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.429
They have the power to fix
this, they can save you.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.260
Your heroes will make you happy.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.750
The drama is epic and endless.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.860
Heroes and villains doing
battle for your fate.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.940
You sit back.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.110
You try to take it all in.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.820
You try to keep it all straight.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.611
You try to figure out
where it's all going.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.230
But it's all smoke and mirrors.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.010
It's a diversion.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.410
It's special effects.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.210
What really matters
is that you have

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.072
become a cooperative
participant in fear's reality.

00:09:02.072 --> 00:09:03.490
Right?

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.410
You play nice.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.970
You don't question the premise.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.170
You abdicate responsibility.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.990
You blame and credit others.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.540
Meanwhile, fear's
spell remains unbroken.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.700
So my villain was Blindness,
not with a lowercase

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.340
b as in the condition
of sightlessness,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.240
but Blindness with a capital
B, this amorphous bogeyman

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.950
that was going to hunt me
down and destroy my life.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.010
My heroes were the brilliant
research scientists

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.970
working so hard to deliver
a cure for my disease.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.020
They would do it in time.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.550
They would save me.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.110
They simply had to.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.810
Living in the
reality of my fears,

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.195
my life became a race
against the clock.

00:09:50.195 --> 00:09:51.070
I wasn't in the race.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.570
I was on the sidelines, right?

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.430
Watching as Blindness
was out way in front

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.250
and only widening the gap.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.230
Didn't look very good for me.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.020
Now those were some really
dark years of my life.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.850
Then I learned to see through
my fear, eyes wide open.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.980
If you can believe it, it
began with my mother-in-law,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.119
though she's an unlikely
heroine in the story,

00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:15.660
though at the time
she was the mother

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.280
of my girlfriend, Dorothy.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.387
So Brenda is an
occupational therapist.

00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:25.220
She was the director
of occupational therapy

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.290
at the Lucerne
Spinal Injury Center.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.770
Her typical patient was a woman
who was thrown by a horse,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.260
instantly became a quadriplegic.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.990
Brenda's patient meets
with doctors and nurses

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.770
has some surgeries, mourns
with friends and family.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.390
Then she meets Brenda.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.740
Brenda's job is the rest
of the patient's life.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.414
So Brenda assesses the
patient's capabilities,

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.330
surveys the myriad tools
and technologies that

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.360
are available to supplement
those capabilities.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.220
She develops discrete solutions
for concrete problems.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.230
Maybe she rigs up a
homemade attachment

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.500
to make a joystick on a
wheelchair more accessible.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.860
Or she introduces tools to
help her patient feed herself,

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.200
grooming and hygiene, getting in
and out of bed, reading a book.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.700
Right?

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.190
Take the problems one at a
time, figure out a solution.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.650
That's Brenda's perspective.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.289
So when Dorothy
and I were dating,

00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:22.830
without us knowing
anything about it,

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.454
Brenda began to
research some solutions

00:11:24.454 --> 00:11:26.840
for the partially
sighted and the blind.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.160
And one thing led to another.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.220
And she found Chris.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.300
Chris was an expert in the
field who worked in Boston where

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.910
Dorothy and I were living.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.530
I went to go meet with Chris.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.720
And it completely
changed my life.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.760
So I walk into Chris's office.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.230
And right away she asks me,
Isaac, do you ever use a cane?

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.240
I'm a little confused
and I'm really annoyed.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.250
I'm thinking to myself,
no, I don't use a cane.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.250
I mean I still see too well
to use a cane, don't I?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.380
I mean isn't she's
supposed to be the expert?

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.531
Besides I'm not here
to talk about a cane.

00:12:01.531 --> 00:12:03.280
A cane is like an
arbitrary detail, right?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.750
We were talking about blindness.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.190
I say her, no, Chris,
I don't use cane.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.626
She says, well, do you bump
into things and hurt yourself?

00:12:12.626 --> 00:12:14.360
I'm thinking of course
I bump into things

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.510
and hurt myself all the time.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.960
In fact, two days ago, I walked
right into a fire hydrant,

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.540
splitting my pants
against my shin.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.120
It bled a ton and it left
me with a heinous bruise.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.395
So I rolled up the
leg of my jeans,

00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:30.520
showed the bruise to Chris.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.690
I said, Chris, yeah, you
could say I bump into things

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.620
and hurt myself.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.340
No big deal.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.220
I really want Chris to
understand how little I

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.170
care about bumping into things.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.700
Right?

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.870
Now is not my problem.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.897
Today is not my problem.

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:45.480
Bumping into things
is not my problem.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.050
My problem is tomorrow,
the future, is blindness.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.715
My life is going to end, right?

00:12:51.715 --> 00:12:53.340
My problem is that
I am losing my sight

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.923
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:03.190
Chris says to me, you know
Isaac, if you used a cane,

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.870
you'd bump into things less
and you'd hurt yourself less.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.576
Man, it was an
obvious point, right?

00:13:10.576 --> 00:13:11.450
Pretty obvious point.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.199
Now I know you guys
are all Googlers here,

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:14.350
so you're very smart.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.492
I'm only a little
embarrassed to admit

00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:18.950
it was such an obvious point
for me that day that it really

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.980
was like an epiphany.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.170
And I realized that
there is only now.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.920
There is only
today, this moment.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.620
In that moment, I
saw that everything

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:38.650
I thought I knew about blindness
was a complete fiction borne

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.300
of my fears, lies.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.640
What did I really know about
going blind or being blind?

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.080
Absolutely nothing.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.920
What had I done
to learn about it?

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.690
Nothing.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.430
So I was trapped
in fear's tunnel

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.470
unable to see the unbounded
potential, the vast landscape,

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.260
that lay just beyond.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.530
Chris's point about the cane
was a pinprick of bright light

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.780
that led me out of that tunnel.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.270
There was something that I
could do right away, right now,

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.810
today, to make my life a little
easier, to make my life better.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.700
I caught on quickly.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.783
I said what else can I do?

00:14:15.783 --> 00:14:17.040
Chris had all sorts of ideas--

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.700
screen reading software to
interact with my computer using

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.010
my ears instead of
my eyes, a technique

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.140
called sighted
guide to walk around

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.090
with people more
naturally and more

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.170
safely, techniques and
systems to organize

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.480
my clothing and my shoes
so I could dress myself

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.220
and match, or at least
wear what I wanted to wear.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.720
Simple solutions for discrete,
specific, practical problems.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.580
So I decided that day
in Chris's office,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.550
made myself a promise,
whenever I feel afraid,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.810
I'm going to ask
myself two questions--

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:58.350
one, what precisely is
my problem, right now,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.360
broken down into its
smallest, most discrete,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.830
most manageable form?

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.200
Right now, what's my problem?

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.750
Two, what precisely
can I do about it?

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.180
No heroes, no villains, me.

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:14.990
Now a word of caution, you
have to answer those questions

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.270
for yourself in the
vein of like C-SPAN

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.040
coverage of some boring and
mundane procedural committee

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.340
hearing or something like that.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.820
You can't answer that question
in the vein of a Hollywood

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.430
blockbuster.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.930
OK?

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.440
There's no action sequences, no
special effects, no soundtrack.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.730
It's just dialogue, no drama.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.790
When I committed to answer
those two questions for myself

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.380
in that way whenever I faced
fear, my life turned around.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.610
I took control of my reality.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:50.320
I chose how I wanted to live
my life and who I wanted to be.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.270
I broke fear's spell.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.910
I went on to build a very
blessed life for myself

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.050
on that uncharted terrain
beyond fear's tunnel.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.570
I did marry.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:08.160
Dorothy and I had triplets.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.040
And we enjoy that so much
that we had a fourth child,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.020
sweet baby Clementine.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.170
So 6 and 1/2 year old triplets
and a 15-month-old baby.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:23.040
I am immensely blessed
and happy and fulfilled.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:30.290
But if I had not seen through
the reality of my fears,

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.110
I would have lived that reality.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.700
I'm absolutely
certain of that fact.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.160
So I want to say
it one more time.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.300
If I hadn't seen
through my fears,

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.050
I would have lived that really.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.940
So.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.481
Thank you.

00:16:45.481 --> 00:16:46.016
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:46.016 --> 00:16:47.349
MANUSHI SHAH: Thank you so much.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.510
Thank you so much for
a great introduction.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.580
I would also like to open
the floor for any Q&amp;A

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.254
that people would have.

00:16:58.254 --> 00:17:00.045
In the meantime, I have
a question for you.

00:17:00.045 --> 00:17:01.394
ISAAC LIDSKY: Sure.

00:17:01.394 --> 00:17:03.060
MANUSHI SHAH: Despite
all these hurdles,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.450
it's very difficult to even
imagine being in that situation

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.450
that you were in, what
kept you motivated?

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:17.589
ISAAC LIDSKY: So the way
in which I lost my sight,

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.680
it was a progressive condition.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.190
If you picture like a
jumbotron screen at an arena,

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.869
so imagine that the
LED bulbs on the screen

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.790
are randomly breaking
slowly over time.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.020
And so you're watching my life
as a movie on this screen.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.020
And at first, you might
not even notice it.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.280
Then it becomes annoying.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.400
Certain parts of the screen
are better than others.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.640
It created all these
bizarre effects.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.820
Objects would sort of appear
and morph and disappear.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.547
If I got information
through other means,

00:17:48.547 --> 00:17:50.130
through my fingers,
if someone told me

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.940
what I was looking at,
then suddenly I saw it.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.450
So the experience, it was
challenging to put it mildly.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.010
But it was also a real gift.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.760
It turned out to be a
real gift, because I

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.843
got a peek behind the
curtain into sort of the way

00:18:04.843 --> 00:18:05.520
the mind works.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.510
And this illusion of sight
was shattered for me.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:14.040
So sight is something we
experience as objective truth,

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.630
as reality, as something
that's out there,

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.160
when it's totally a creation
of our own mind, which

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.690
is built on much more than
just data from the eyes.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.120
So anyway, having sort
of seeing first hand,

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.270
literally seeing, the
way we are empowered

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.790
to create an experience
for ourselves that

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.640
is so immersive and complete
that we then believe it to be

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.110
true and objective, that was
this sort of eye opening,

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.557
you know eyes wide open
vision, that like I said

00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:45.640
turned out to be the
greatest blessing in my life.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.771
Because we create our
realities in so many ways,

00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.930
self-limiting assumptions,
our fears, our misconceptions

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:58.100
about success and failure,
strength and weakness,

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.075
the way we sort of misperceive
luck, oversimplify luck,

00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:01.950
and on and on and on.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:07.350
So what kept me going was
really at the end of the day,

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.890
this certainty that in every
moment, in every moment,

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.300
we choose who we
are and how we want

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:18.940
to live our lives independent
of the circumstances we face.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.480
MANUSHI SHAH: Absolutely.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.980
You mentioned
briefly about luck.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.899
How much do you think luck
plays a role in our lives?

00:19:25.899 --> 00:19:27.440
ISAAC LIDSKY: So
there is no question

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.320
that luck, happenstances,
circumstances

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.810
beyond our control play
a major factor in life.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:38.120
I think, however, that we tend
to if not misperceive luck,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.810
then certainly oversimplify it.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.100
So what do I mean?

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.600
For example, the notion that
there's good luck and bad luck,

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.850
or that there are events
that have an independent sort

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.880
of value of good or bad.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.030
I think the truth is a lot
more nuanced and complex,

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.010
and events are events.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.450
And whether they're
good or bad, who knows?

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.540
And better than who knows, it's
kind of within our control.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:09.100
So for example, I was
lucky to go blind.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.080
It may sound like a
weird thing to say.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.950
But in my experience, in
my life, the blessings,

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.879
the perspective, the life
that it has given me,

00:20:16.879 --> 00:20:19.170
there's just no question, it
was one of the best things

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.980
that ever happened to me.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.680
Another way we tend to
misperceive luck, I think, is,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.330
again, we think that
there's a pretty clear,

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.427
bright line between
circumstances within

00:20:30.427 --> 00:20:32.510
our control and circumstances
without our control,

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.940
you know circumstances
we cannot control.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.950
And again, I think the
truth is really far more

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.030
nuanced and complex.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.740
Really most things are
kind of in that gray area.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.819
And we have a lot more control
over events in our lives,

00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:48.860
and certainly the way we
experience those events,

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.770
how they manifest themselves
in our lives than we think.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.120
MANUSHI SHAH: OK.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.661
We have a question
from the audience.

00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:56.202
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:56.202 --> 00:20:57.655
ISAAC LIDSKY: Hi.

00:20:57.655 --> 00:21:00.280
AUDIENCE: That day when you were
13 when you got the diagnosis,

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.010
how long did it
take for your vision

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:07.610
to degenerate to the point
where you were legally blind?

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.209
And then how long until you
totally lost your sight?

00:21:10.209 --> 00:21:11.000
ISAAC LIDSKY: Sure.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.260
Thanks.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.260
That's a great question.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.070
I mean the short
answer is who knows?

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.330
It's hard to say.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.050
This really is the sort
of progressive and sort

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.040
of slow death of
photoreceptor cells.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.470
So when did it start?

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:24.100
Who knows.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.940
When did it end?

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.440
Hard to say.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.820
I know that when I was diagnosed
when I was 13, at the time,

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.514
I would have said I see as
well as any of my peers.

00:21:34.514 --> 00:21:35.930
I'm not sure that's
actually true.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:36.970
I literally don't know.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.590
There's some little
stories or anecdotes.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.800
Maybe I was already starting
to lose a meaningful amount

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.230
of cells, maybe not.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.540
But so, 13, wouldn't have
said I had any problems.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.090
In my mid to late
teens, it started

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.380
to become a real nuisance,
kind of transitioning

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.690
into a disability.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.830
And then by my early to
mid 20s, I was essentially

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.120
living as a blind person.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.780
By the time I was like 25,
I had really no useful sight

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.107
to speak of.

00:22:07.107 --> 00:22:07.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.720
ISAAC LIDSKY: Sure.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.094
MANUSHI SHAH: We have another
question from the audience.

00:22:11.094 --> 00:22:11.940
ISAAC LIDSKY: Sure.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.550
AUDIENCE: It's been almost
30 years since you've

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.360
been diagnosed.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.120
In that time, has there been
any medical breakthroughs

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.990
in this condition?

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.752
Or is it still kind of
a blindness sentence?

00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:22.960
ISAAC LIDSKY: Well, first
of all, it's been 24 years.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.249
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:24.748 --> 00:22:25.840
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.340
ISAAC LIDSKY: Definitely older
than most of the people here,

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.770
but it's not been 30 years.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.805
OK.

00:22:33.805 --> 00:22:35.180
I'm sorry, what
was the question?

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:35.680
No.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.200
So yeah.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.491
There's been a lot of progress.

00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:40.580
It's really actually
quite remarkable.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.010
Without boring you
with all the details,

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:49.170
I am convinced I will regain
a substantial amount of sight.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.880
Whether it's three
years from now,

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.060
or five years, or
10 years, who knows?

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.710
And how much sight and
how useful, who knows?

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:04.260
But I tell all those
researchers that I've

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.060
been lucky to get to
know over the years

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.300
that if I could see my
kids' faces, I'm set.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.100
That's all I need.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.310
And Dorothy has saved
a lot of great pictures

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.690
for me, so I look forward to
going through all of those

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.985
someday.

00:23:18.985 --> 00:23:19.818
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:22.514 --> 00:23:24.180
MANUSHI SHAH: I have
a question for you.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.340
So is there anything
you wish you

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.140
had known earlier in your
life that would have helped

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.330
or at least eased
your struggles a bit?

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.500
ISAAC LIDSKY: Yeah, you
know it took some time

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.752
to get to Chris's office.

00:23:37.752 --> 00:23:39.710
And there were some dark
years, as I mentioned.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.070
And you know whether
we call it denial,

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.154
or whatever it was, it
would have been nicer

00:23:46.154 --> 00:23:47.570
a little earlier
on to maybe start

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.610
focusing on the practical,
immediate solutions

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:59.530
to my day-by-day instead
of really insisting

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.330
that my challenge
began and ended

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.340
with the crusade for a cure.

00:24:08.257 --> 00:24:09.340
MANUSHI SHAH: Makes sense.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.246
Do you have a question?

00:24:11.246 --> 00:24:12.960
OK.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.100
AUDIENCE: I came to your
talk today because--

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.740
I have to confess,
I didn't know who

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.460
you were until two days
ago, and I read an op-ed

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.510
that you had written, I believe
it was in the "New York Times."

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:31.060
And you recounted an anecdote
in which you were making coffee

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.700
in the kitchen in the office.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.510
Right?

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.750
And a woman came up to you
and she said, here, let me--

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.275
she was going to sort of--

00:24:41.275 --> 00:24:42.670
ISAAC LIDSKY: She took over.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:42.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.810
She took over, right?

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.610
And you said, you know,
I can make coffee myself,

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:46.443
thank you very much.

00:24:46.443 --> 00:24:48.440
And she says, sure,
I know you can.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.587
But you always put the
grounds in the wrong bin.

00:24:51.587 --> 00:24:53.170
ISAAC LIDSKY: The
paper recycling bin.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.070
AUDIENCE: So that anecdote
sort of resonated with me

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.610
because you know there are--

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:05.500
we all kind of when we
interact with people,

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.320
perhaps there are a certain set
of assumptions that we hold.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.950
And so I think in that
anecdote, you sort of

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:18.620
said, well, your
assumptions were, I guess,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.230
you had this sort of
realization that an assumption

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:27.170
you had made about why she was
intervening was perhaps wrong.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.570
What would you say--

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.765
like what other kinds
of insights has--

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.300
like what would
you say is like--

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.040
you know, if blindness
is a gift, what

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.880
other kinds of insights would
you say it has given you?

00:25:51.880 --> 00:26:05.500
ISAAC LIDSKY: Well, so the
insight into our awesome power.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.780
I mean awesome in the
sort of more literal way

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.120
than the conventional
use of the term.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.670
But our power to shape our own
realities, the insights that I

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.880
gained into that
are invaluable to me

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:27.330
and has had such a powerful
positive effect in my life.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.340
I'll say that I'm
certain, I'm convinced,

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.220
I'm passionate about the
fact that this vision,

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.365
this sort of insight into
the way our brains work,

00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:37.470
it's for everybody.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.020
It's not about blindness.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.290
It's not about disability.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.380
It's not even necessarily only
about challenges or obstacles

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.080
in life.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:52.220
It's an opportunity to live with
awareness and accountability

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.610
and intention that has
been so liberating for me

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.954
and so empowering in my life.

00:26:57.954 --> 00:26:59.120
That's why I wrote the book.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.800
I wrote the book
really because I

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.170
wanted to share this
perspective with folks.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:09.230
Frankly, I wanted to put
it down in words on paper

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.440
for my children to
read, maybe when

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.230
they get a little bit
older and more sensible,

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.330
because they don't make
any good decisions today.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.154
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.520
So I guess I hesitate
to say blindness per se

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.020
is the source or the
sort of the locus

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.987
of the insight or
the perspective

00:27:31.987 --> 00:27:32.820
if that makes sense.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:37.470
Cool.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.950
MANUSHI SHAH: Thank you so much.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.800
What advice would
you give to people

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.640
who are either going
through this or just

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.890
in general for people?

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.450
Like there are lots of fears
that everyone fears, right?

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:53.380
ISAAC LIDSKY: Sure

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.671
MANUSHI SHAH: It could be
physical, it could be mental,

00:27:55.671 --> 00:27:57.040
it could be anything.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.850
If you were to tell them
small steps they could take

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:05.050
to get to the point where
you have been at this point,

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.110
what would it be?

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.901
ISAAC LIDSKY: Sure.

00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:10.420
So if we're talking about fear
specifically, as I was saying,

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.592
focus on what's
precisely the problem,

00:28:12.592 --> 00:28:13.800
break it down to small parts.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.460
Focus on what you
can do about it.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.670
Search your life for
heroes and villains,

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:23.110
because they're figments
in your mind that

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.900
can be very pernicious.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:31.240
Generally, I think that we
would we would all do better

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.890
to pay attention to the profound
difference between what we know

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:37.930
and what we think we know.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.180
We get ourselves into a lot
of trouble that with fear.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:46.790
But the fear stuff and
overcoming fear is obviously

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.240
is a key theme in the
book, and it's obviously

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.780
what I chose to
talk about today,

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:57.490
but really more generally
it's this idea that whatever

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:02.157
circumstances we encounter,
what we do with it

00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.490
and how we manifest them our
lives, what we make of them

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.280
is entirely within our control.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:13.640
And for me, I need no more
proof of that than the fact

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.410
that always there
are people who have

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:23.460
done far more with far less and
been a lot happier doing it.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.470
Right?

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.320
So if that's true, it just
can't be the circumstances

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.640
that's the problem.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.980
MANUSHI SHAH: Right.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.060
Makes sense.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.210
Thank you so much
for your account.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.849
It was wonderful
having you here well.

00:29:35.849 --> 00:29:37.390
ISAAC LIDSKY: Thanks
for inviting me.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.800
MANUSHI SHAH: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.410
I encourage everyone
to read his book.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.080
It's very inspiring.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.440
It's an autobiography,
yet it's very inspiring.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.030
I think I found it very useful
and amazing to read through it.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.030
ISAAC LIDSKY: Thank you.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.315
MANUSHI SHAH: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:29:53.315 --> 00:29:54.000
ISAAC LIDSKY: Thanks
for having me.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.875
MANUSHI SHAH: Thanks.

00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:57.050
