00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:09.181
All animals communicate.

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:12.645
Crabs wave their claws at each other
to signal that they're healthy

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:13.964
and ready to mate.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.468
Cuttlefish use pigmented skin cells
called chromatophores

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:21.556
to create patterns on their skin
that act as camouflage

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.476
or warnings to rivals.

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:25.889
Honeybees perform complex dances

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:31.061
to let other bees know the location
and quality of a food source.

00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:34.889
All of these animals have impressive
communication systems,

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:37.266
but do they have language?

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.555
To answer that question,

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:43.052
we can look at four specific qualities
that are often associated with language:

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:44.232
discreteness,

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:46.356
grammar,

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:48.054
productivity,

00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:50.180
and displacement.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.330
Discreteness means that there is a set
of individual units,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.473
such as sounds or words,

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:59.044
that can be combined
to communicate new ideas,

00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:02.158
like a set of refrigerator poetry magnets
you can rearrange

00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:04.506
to create different phrases.

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:06.433
Grammar provides a system of rules

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.841
that tells you how to combine 
those individual units.

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.954
Productivity is the ability 
to use language

00:01:12.954 --> 00:01:16.942
to create an infinite number of messages.

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:19.798
And displacement is the ability 
to talk about things

00:01:19.798 --> 00:01:21.722
that aren't right in front of you,

00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:25.809
such as past, future, or fictional events.

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:30.045
So, does animal communication exhibit 
any of these qualities?

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:33.097
For crabs and cuttlefish, 
the answer is no.

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:36.313
They don't combine their signals 
in creative ways.

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:39.747
Those signals also don't have to be 
in a grammatical order,

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:42.704
and they only communicate 
current conditions,

00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:46.175
like, "I am healthy," 
or "I am poisonous."

00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:50.447
But some animals actually do display
some of these properties.

00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:55.558
Bees use the moves, angle, duration,
and intensity of their waggle dance

00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:59.694
to describe the location and richness
of a food source.

00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:01.920
That source is outside the hive,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.190
so they exhibit the property 
of displacement.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.408
They share that language trait
with prairie dogs,

00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:10.494
which live in towns of thousands,

00:02:10.494 --> 00:02:16.156
and are hunted by coyotes, hawks,
badgers, snakes, and humans.

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:20.617
Their alarms calls indicate
the predator's size, shape, speed,

00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:24.832
and, even for human predators,
what the person is wearing

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:27.593
and if he's carrying a gun.

00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:31.765
Great apes, like chimps and gorillas,
are great communicators, too.

00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:34.656
Some have even learned 
a modified sign language.

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:38.513
A chimpanzee named Washoe
demonstrated discreteness

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:42.118
by combining multiple signs
into original phrases,

00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:44.422
like, "Please open. Hurry."

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:48.558
Coco, a female gorilla who understands
more than 1000 signs,

00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:51.736
and around 2000 words of spoken English

00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:54.892
referred to a beloved kitten 
that had died.

00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:57.514
In doing so, she displayed displacement,

00:02:57.514 --> 00:03:00.517
though it's worth noting that the apes
in both of these examples

00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:03.502
were using a human communication system,

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:06.648
not one that appeared 
naturally in the wild.

00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:10.367
There are many other examples
of sophisticated animal communication,

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:11.716
such as in dolphins,

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:17.442
which use whistles to identify age, 
location, names, and gender.

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:19.370
They can also understand some grammar

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.481
in a gestural language researchers use
to communicate with them.

00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:28.347
However, grammar is not seen 
in the dolphin's natural communication.

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:30.004
While these communication systems

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:33.439
may have some of the qualities 
of language we've identified,

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.913
none display all four.

00:03:35.913 --> 00:03:40.002
Even Washoe and Coco's impressive 
abilities are still outpaced

00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:43.890
by the language skills 
of most three-year-old humans.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.163
And animals' topics of conversation
are usually limited.

00:03:47.163 --> 00:03:48.672
Bees talk about food,

00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:50.799
prairie dogs talk about predators,

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.911
and crabs talk about themselves.

00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:56.196
Human language stands alone

00:03:56.196 --> 00:04:00.051
due to the powerful combination
of grammar and productivity,

00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:03.305
on top of discreteness and displacement.

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.880
The human brain can take 
a finite number of elements

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.864
and create an infinite number of messages.

00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:11.561
We can craft and understand 
complex sentences,

00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:15.004
as well as words that have never
been spoken before.

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:18.576
We can use language to communicate
about an endless range of subjects,

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:20.594
talk about imaginary things,

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.750
and even lie.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.096
Research continues to reveal more
and more about animal communication.

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:30.783
It may turn out that human language
and animal communication

00:04:30.783 --> 00:04:34.449
aren't entirely different
but exist on a continuum.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.921
After all, we are all animals.
