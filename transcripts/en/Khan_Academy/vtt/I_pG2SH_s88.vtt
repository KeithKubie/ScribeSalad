00:00:00.081 --> 00:00:01.592
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.592 --> 00:00:03.333
is look at the tangible example

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.814
where we calculate angular velocity,

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:08.316
but then we're going to
see if we can connect that

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:10.554
to the notion of speed.

00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:13.085
So let's start with this
example where once again

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:15.606
we have some type of a ball tethered

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:18.689
to some type of center of
rotation right over here.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.161
Let's say this is connected with a string.

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:22.776
And so if you were to
move the ball around,

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:27.356
it would move along this blue
circle in either direction.

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:28.958
Let's just say for the sake of argument,

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:32.154
the length of the string is seven meters.

00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:36.071
We know that at time is
equal to three seconds,

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:39.058
our angle is equal to,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.871
theta is equal to pi over two radians,

00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:46.286
which we've seen in previous videos.

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:51.063
We would measure from the
positive x-axis, just like that.

00:00:51.063 --> 00:00:55.888
And let's say that at T
is equal to six seconds,

00:00:55.888 --> 00:01:00.055
T is equal to six seconds,
theta is equal to pi radians.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.797
And so after three seconds, the
ball is now right over here.

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:12.158
And so if we wanted to actually
visualize how that happens,

00:01:12.158 --> 00:01:15.893
let me see if I can rotate
this ball in three seconds.

00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:17.571
So it would look like this.

00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.897
One Mississippi, two
Mississippi, three Mississippi.

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:22.261
Let's do that again.

00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:23.428
It would be...

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:28.679
One Mississippi, two
Mississippi, three Mississippi.

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.822
So now that we can visualize

00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:33.175
or conceptualize what's going on,

00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:37.018
see if you can pause this
video and calculate two things.

00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:40.007
So the first thing that I
want you to calculate is

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:43.424
what is the angular velocity of the ball?

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:45.388
And actually, it would be the ball

00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:47.372
and every point on that string.

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:51.437
What is that angular velocity
which we denote with omega?

00:01:51.437 --> 00:01:53.202
And then I want you to figure out

00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:56.324
what is the speed of the ball?

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.389
So what is the speed?

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.406
See if you can figure
out both of those things,

00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:03.005
and for extra points,
see if you can figure out

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.555
a relationship between the two.

00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:07.906
Alright, well let's go
angular velocity first.

00:02:07.906 --> 00:02:09.897
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.742
Angular velocity, you might remember

00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:16.968
is just going to be equal
to our angular displacement,

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:19.417
which we could say is delta theta,

00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:21.894
and it is a vector quantity.

00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:26.061
And we are going to divide
that by our change in time.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.580
So delta T.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.869
And so what is this going to be?

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:34.102
Well this is going to be
our angular displacement.

00:02:34.102 --> 00:02:35.935
Our final angle is pi.

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:41.824
Pi radians minus our initial
angle, pi over two radians.

00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:45.017
And then all of that's going
to be over our change in time,

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:47.530
which is six seconds,
which is our final time

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.978
minus our initial time,
minus three seconds.

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:53.080
And so we are going to
get in the numerator,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.140
we have been rotated in
the positive direction,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.067
Pi over two radians.

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:01.631
Because it's positive, we
know it's counterclockwise.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.714
And that happened over three seconds.

00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.197
And so we could rewrite this as

00:03:08.197 --> 00:03:11.457
this is going to be equal to pi over six.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.740
And let's remind
ourselves about the units.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.159
Our change in angle, that's
going to be in radians,

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.997
and then that is going to be per second.

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:23.596
So we're going pi over
six radians per second,

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:25.400
and if you do that over three seconds,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.483
well then you're going to
go pi over two radians.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.930
Now with that out of the way,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.696
let's see if we can calculate speed.

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:36.958
If you haven't done so
already, pause this video

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.031
and see if you can calculate it.

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:43.003
Well speed is going to
be equal to the distance

00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:45.691
the ball travels, and we've
touched on that in other videos.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:48.257
I encourage you to watch
those if you haven't already.

00:03:48.257 --> 00:03:52.823
The distance that we travel
we could denote with S.

00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:55.065
S is sometimes used to denote arc length,

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:57.345
or the distance traveled right over here.

00:03:57.345 --> 00:03:59.841
So the speed is going to be our arc length

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:02.839
divided by our change in time.

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.449
Divided by our change in time.

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.148
But what is our arc length going to be?

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:09.898
Well we saw in a previous video

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:13.253
where we related angular
displacement to arc length,

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.144
or distance, that our arc
length is nothing more

00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:20.311
than the absolute value of
our angular displacement,

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:27.576
of our angular displacement,
times the radius.

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:29.120
Times the radius.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.807
And in this case, our radius
would be seven meters.

00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:34.756
So if we substitute all of this up here,

00:04:34.756 --> 00:04:36.310
what are we going to get?

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.227
We are going to get that our speed,

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:42.459
I'm writing it out because
I don't want to overuse,

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:43.655
well I am overusing S,

00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:45.257
but I don't want people to get confused.

00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:48.153
Our speed is going to be equal
to the distance we travel,

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:50.788
which we just wrote is the magnitude

00:04:50.788 --> 00:04:52.182
of our angular displacement.

00:04:52.182 --> 00:04:53.546
And this is all fancy notation,

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:56.432
but when you actually apply it,
it's pretty straightforward.

00:04:56.432 --> 00:04:59.015
Times the radius of the circle.

00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:03.921
I guess you can say we
are traveling along.

00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:06.142
Let me write that in a different color.

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:08.634
So times the radius.

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:11.634
All of that over our change in time.

00:05:12.657 --> 00:05:15.066
All of that over our change in time.

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:17.480
Well we could put in the
numbers right over here.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.028
We know that this is
going to be pi over two.

00:05:21.028 --> 00:05:22.211
You take the absolute value of that.

00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.981
It's still going to be pi over two.

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.413
We know that our radius in this case

00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:27.762
is the length of that string.

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:29.286
It is seven meters.

00:05:29.286 --> 00:05:31.628
And we know that our change in time here,

00:05:31.628 --> 00:05:34.836
we know that this over here
is going to be three seconds,

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.678
and we can calculate everything.

00:05:36.678 --> 00:05:39.665
But what's even more
interesting is to recognize

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:42.498
that what is this right over here?

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.503
What is the absolute value
of our angular displacement

00:05:48.503 --> 00:05:50.170
over change in time?

00:05:51.057 --> 00:05:53.066
Well, this is just the absolute value

00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:55.568
of our angular velocity.

00:05:55.568 --> 00:05:57.735
So we could say that speed

00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:04.715
is equal to the absolute
value of our angular velocity.

00:06:04.715 --> 00:06:09.604
Absolute value of our angular
velocity, times our radius.

00:06:09.604 --> 00:06:11.021
Times our radius.

00:06:12.296 --> 00:06:14.428
And now so this is super useful.

00:06:14.428 --> 00:06:19.281
Our speed in this case,
is going to be pi over six

00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.864
radians per second.

00:06:22.373 --> 00:06:23.290
So pi over,

00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:26.966
pi over six.

00:06:28.273 --> 00:06:30.146
Times the radius.

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:32.404
Times seven meters.

00:06:32.404 --> 00:06:34.472
Times seven meters.

00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:36.304
And so what do we get?

00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:40.387
We are going to get seven
pi over six meters per,

00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:47.928
meters per second, which will
be our units for speed here.

00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:50.936
And the reason why we're
doing the absolute value

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:53.612
is 'cause remember, speed
is a scalar quantity.

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:55.490
We're not specifying the direction.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.849
In fact, the whole time we're traveling,

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.225
our direction is constantly changing.

00:06:59.225 --> 00:07:00.414
So there you have it.

00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:03.489
There's multiple ways to approach
these types of questions,

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.476
but the big takeaway here is one,

00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:07.683
how we calculated angular velocity,

00:07:07.683 --> 00:07:12.592
and then how we can relate
angular velocity to speed.

00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:15.849
And what's nice is there's a
nice, simple formula for it.

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:18.004
And all of this just came out of something

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.082
that relates to what we
learned in seventh grade

00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:21.811
around the circumference of the circle,

00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:23.836
which we touched on in the video

00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:27.675
relating angular
displacement to arc length,

00:07:27.675 --> 00:07:29.425
or distance traveled.
