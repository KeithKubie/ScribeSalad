00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.580
Let us look at abduction more closely.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.110
To understand the similarities and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.300
differences between deduction,
abduction and induction,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.600
let us look at the relationship
between a rule, cause and effect.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.550
Let's consider a simple rule like,
if it cloudy, it rains.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.520
So it is cloudy, is the cause.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.620
It rains, is the effect.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.450
If it's cloudy and
it rains, it's a rule.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.080
&gt;&gt; Another example of a rule,
would be the rule that Bob hates Joe.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.960
So Bob hates Joe, so
whenever Joe walks in, Bob leaves.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.070
The cause is Joe walking in.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.360
The effect is Bob leaving.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.560
And the rule is Bob hates Joe.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.600
You already come across yet another
instance of this particular arrangement,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.050
when we were talking about flu and
fever.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.120
So the rule might be; if flu then fever.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.350
Flue is the cause.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.785
Fever is the effect.

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:51.535
Non-deduction, in one
fundamental kind of inference.

00:00:51.535 --> 00:00:55.785
We know the rule and the cause,
and we need to deduce the effect.

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:58.815
So, given the rule,
if it is cloudy, then it rains, and

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:03.455
given the cause, it is cloudy,
we can deduce that it rains.

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:05.375
&gt;&gt; Similarly,
in our rule that Bob hates Joe,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:09.465
we can say that if Joe just walked in,
we can deduce that Bob will leave.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.360
Part of the rule is, if flu, then fever.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.850
And we know that a shortcut's flu, then
we can deduce that, a shortcut's fever.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.010
This is simply an instance
of more despondence, and

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.570
we discussed this in detail when
we were talking about logic.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.010
Now let us look at induction.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.660
Given a relationship between a cause and
an effect, we can try to induce a rule.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.360
For example, if we observe
repeatedly that when it is cloudy,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.740
it rains, and we may induce a rule.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.910
If it is cloudy, then it rains.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.060
&gt;&gt; Same thing with Bob and Joe.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.780
If we observe repeatedly that every
time Joe arrives, Bob leaves.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.840
we can induce a rule
that Bob must hate Joe.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.840
If every time a patient
goes to a doctor with flu,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.320
and the patient has fever, then we
can induce a rule if flu then fever.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.060
In can of abduction, given a rule and
an effect, we can abduce a cause.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.410
As an example, given the rule if
it is cloudy then it rains, and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.220
the effect that it is raining,
we can ask of ourselves is it cloudy.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.220
And once again with Bob and Joe,
given our rule that Bob hates Joe, and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.800
given that we just arrived at the party,
and we see that Joe is here but

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.260
not Bob, we might be able to adduce
that Bob left when Joe arrived.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.550
&gt;&gt; Or given the rule,
if flu then fever and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.480
that fact Ashok that has fever, we might
be able to adduce that Ashok has flu.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.430
First of all notice that
we are back to diagnosis.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.450
Diagnosis is an instance of abduction.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.520
But notice several of the properties.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.940
First, deduction is truth preserving.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.790
If the rule is true,
and the cause is true,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.820
we can always guarantee that
the effect is true as well.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.690
Induction and
abduction are not truth-preserving.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.110
If we know something of the relations
between cause and effect for

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.940
some sample, that does not mean that
the same relationship holds for

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.980
the entire population.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.370
Induction does not always
guarantee correctness.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.820
Same for abduction.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.050
We may know the rule and the effect, and
we may suppose that the cause is true.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.210
But that need not necessarily be true.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.092
It may be the case the flu then fever.

00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:15.590
And Ashark may have fever, but

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.550
that does not necessarily
mean that a shark has flu.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.020
Fever can be caused by many many things.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.750
The reason that fever does not
necessarily mean that Ashkk has flu is

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.160
because there can be multiple causes for
the same effect.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.170
Multiple hypothesis for the same data.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.610
This is exactly the problem that
we had encountered earlier,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.200
when we were talking about
what makes diagnosis hard.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.810
We said that deduction, induction, and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.250
abduction, are three of
the fundamental forms of inference.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.920
We can of course also combine these
inferences, science is a good example,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.560
you and I as scientists,
observe some data about the world.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.600
Then we induced some explanation for it.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.090
Having induced such an explanation for
it, we induce a rule.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.935
Having induced a rule, now we can use
production to predict new data elements.

00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:12.020
We going to observe some more.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.370
Again, we adduce, induce, deduce.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.420
And we continue the cycle.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.100
Might the cycle also explain
a significant part of cognition?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.500
Is this what you and
I do on a daily basis?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.530
Adduce, induce, deduce?
