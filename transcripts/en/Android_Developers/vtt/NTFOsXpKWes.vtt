00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.680
I’m Ke Ge, CEO of WPS

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.580
WPS was established in 1998, with the aim of

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.440
providing our users with a friendly and convenient way of working.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.620
Furthermore, we were the first company to offer a portable working experience in 2011.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.620
And the mobile edition of WPS Office has

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.240
a user growth rate of over 300% since its launch.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.240
Google Play’s global influence and reach

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.580
makes WPS Office now has more than 100 million daily active users

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.860
on mobile devices across more than 200 countries.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
Combining the innovative features of Android and working experience

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.400
led WPS Office to the App of 2015.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.360
We have also been named as a top developer and editor’s choice in the Google Play store,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.480
and have recently reached 100 million downloads.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.620
Google's continuous innovation provides us with more possibilities to succeed.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.020
I’m the CTO of WPS, Qingyuan Zhang.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.360
Listening to our user's feedback is key to optimizing our product.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.820
The translation service in the  Developer Console

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.160
has helped us communicate freely with users worldwide.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.980
We use Store Listing Experiments

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.760
to help us understand global user’s preferences,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.540
so we can choose the best screenshots, descriptions, and highlight features

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.080
for every update on Google Play.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.580
By using Google Play's in-app product feature

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.760
we have been able to offer many value-added services to our users,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760
and in turn received significant benefits.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.760
Our monthly orders are growing by 86.2%

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.840
and our monthly revenue has improved by 61.9%.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.940
I’m Dong Wang, Product Manager at WPS.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.020
Keeping up with the Android platform’s latest features and design

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.960
enables us to grow rapidly in international markets.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.680
WPS Office was the very first Chinese app 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.880
to support Multi-window view 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
after Android 7.0 Nougat officially launched.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.160
This feature improves user's productivity by allowing them

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.880
to open two documents for reference checking or editing

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880
and browsing the internet simultaneously.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.060
The Material Design guidelines rendered

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.920
a more intuitive and clearer interface for our product,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.640
and this is also a key reason why users love WPS.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.100
With the growing number of people using WPS Office,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.120
it is important that we continue to adapt to users needs.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.480
We are able to do this with the help of Google Play

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.340
and because of the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.340
innovations and consistent support from Google,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.120
we believe that WPS Office will grow to be

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.400
a one-stop working solution

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.120
for more people around the world.
