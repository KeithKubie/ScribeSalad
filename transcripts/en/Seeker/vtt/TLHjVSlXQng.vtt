00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.100
Air travel used to be the dream of mankind,
but today it’s a pretty standard part of

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.100
our reality.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.640
Now with all those jets zipping around, the
sky is a lot more crowded than it was in 1903

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.450
when it was just one guy up there named Orville.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.760
How do we share the skies safely?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.250
Hi flyers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.189
It’s getting mighty crowded in our skies,
look up right now, I bet you’ll see an airplane.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.189
Or your ceiling.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.470
But above that...an airplane.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.720
So, how do we make sure we have enough space
up there to stretch our wings?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.390
To keep the skies safe there needs to be an
interplay between regulations and technology.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.040
I won’t get too into it, but suffice it
to say, there are a lot of rules aircraft

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.680
have to obey, both in flight and before take
off.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.739
To start with, they need to file a flight
plan with information like departure and arrival

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.770
points, estimated flight time, alternate destinations
in case of emergency, passengers on board,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.610
and info about the aircraft itself.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
Then, air traffic controllers will take that
flight plan into consideration with other

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.559
flight plans, and run it through a computer
algorithm, which helps determine the fastest

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.789
and safest route to take.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.930
At a minimum, flight paths are kept 1000 feet
(305 meters) from each other, because c'mon

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.890
you don't want to get too close -- your pilot
is good but he's not Maverick.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.890
Unless his name is Maverick.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.410
And then he is.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.670
Once it’s time to kick the tires and light
the fires, the airspace itself is divided

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.230
into different classes based on altitude and
proximity to airports.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.910
Obviously, airspace near larger airports is
going to be the busiest, so it has the most

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.910
rules.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.880
On top of that it also has the most failsafes
for tracking incoming and outgoing aircraft

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.250
to make sure nobody’s swapping paint, like
radar.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.280
Radar is actually an acronym that stands for
RAdio Detection And Ranging.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.680
It works by sending out radio waves that bounce
off of objects and come back to a receiver.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.600
Based on the time delay between sending and
receiving transmissions, it’s possible to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.530
calculate where an object is.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.850
And based on how much of the signal gets returned,
an object's size can be determined.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.772
This is why stealth aircraft are shaped the
way they are: they’re scattering the radio

00:01:57.772 --> 00:01:59.500
waves away from the receiver.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.660
But radar doesn’t work on every kind of
object, it usually works best with metal,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.890
but not all planes are made that way; smaller
composite planes just don’t show up.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.400
The radar typically used for commercial air
travel also has a limited range over the ocean,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.910
extending about 200 miles (321 kilometers)
off the coast.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.250
Plus radar can’t tell air traffic control
an object’s altitude, which is a pretty

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.850
important consideration when you’re moving
in 3 dimensions.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.820
To overcome these problems, a Secondary Surveillance
Radar system is used.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.120
Commercial aircraft and many smaller private
planes are equipped with a device called a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120
transponder.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.320
The device is so important, commercial aircraft
actually carry two.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.900
Air traffic control’s radar pings the transponder
with a request for information with a regular

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.700
radio signal -- the pings can teach Air Traffic
Control a lot, but even more importantly,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.580
transponders are hooked into the aircraft’s
on-board systems.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.240
So, the altimeter can relay its information
to the ground.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.480
Pilots are also given a code by air traffic
control which the plug into their transponder

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.440
to make sure they correlate this information
with their flight plan.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.530
Transponders can even be used so aircraft
can communicate with each other, which is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.840
handy over the ocean and out of range of Air
Traffic Control’s eyes.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.750
Commercial jets don’t have radar for detecting
other aircraft, but they can detect each other’s

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.780
transponders and calculate if they’re on
an unsafe course.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.590
If they are, the aircraft will alert the pilots
and suggest a course correction.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.140
They can even coordinate the two planes’
adjustments, avoiding both of them doing that

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.470
awkward dance we all do when walking towards
someone in a hallway.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.650
Communication technology keeps aircraft a
safe distance from each other, but newer materials

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.320
make aircraft stronger and more comfortable.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:55.790

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.110
So knowing air traffic safety depends on radio
frequencies, are you worried about your cell

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.709
phone mucking everything up?
