This one's a run-time error, and it's pretty small. So it might have been hard

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:07.960
to find. I can test it out in BlueJ. Into my program I'm going to write the

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.375
lines. Then I'll compile it. It said no syntax errors. So right away we can see

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:18.152
there aren't any compile time errors. And when I run it, I get my lucky number

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:23.731
is 12. With no space right here. Since the program still compiles and the error

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.010
occurs when we run the program this is a run-time or a logic error. How would

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.914
you fix this one? You don't have to submit an answer, just good to think about.
