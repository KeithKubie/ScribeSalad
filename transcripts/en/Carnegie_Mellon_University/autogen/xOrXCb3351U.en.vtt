this is a question that I get asked many

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
this is a question that I get asked many
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.440
this is a question that I get asked many
many times in the extreme the three

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
many times in the extreme the three
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.140
many times in the extreme the three

points that I would make
 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.880
points that I would make
that the building needs to be zero

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890
that the building needs to be zero
 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.649
that the building needs to be zero
energy it needs to be zero carbon and it

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659
energy it needs to be zero carbon and it
 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.470
energy it needs to be zero carbon and it
needs to be zero water is that

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480
needs to be zero water is that
 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.500

achievable only in the rarest of

achievable only in the rarest of
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.199
achievable only in the rarest of
circumstances but it really clearly
