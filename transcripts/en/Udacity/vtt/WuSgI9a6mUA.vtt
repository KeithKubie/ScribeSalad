00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.499
The HERC2 allele could affect the promoter of

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:06.577
OCA2 because the genes are so close together

00:00:06.577 --> 00:00:09.655
or the allele could alter the HERC2 proteins

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:12.652
so that it interacts with OCA2 and directly

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:15.877
blocks its action. Now the other options are

00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:19.362
not possible here because they change the coding

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:24.887
region on OCA2 but we know that the mutation is within the HERC2 gene which is

00:00:24.887 --> 00:00:26.952
beside OCA2. So this is kind of a tough

00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:29.344
question It's really putting together a lot of the knowledge

00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:31.130
we talked about up to this point. About the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.420
coding regions and non coding regions and possible interactions among

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.030
different proteins, as well as their locations on the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.660
chromosome. If the two genes are beside each other. Then

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.940
alleles changing the coding region of OCA2 aren't really possible

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.790
because we're not saying they're overlapping. They're beside each other.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.900
And so, the two options that are left are

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.240
that perhaps we know that non coding regions, the

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.620
regulatory regions of the OCA2 gene surround the gene.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.580
They can even be thousands of base pairs away.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.269
So mutation in the HERC2 gene. Could actually be

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.740
in one of the non coding regulatory regions of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.750
OCA2, that reduces its transcription. And the other alternative

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.210
is that we actually change the HERC2 protein itself.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.190
And the HERC2 protein physically interacts

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.410
with the OCA2 protein elsewhere in the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.650
cell. And it inhibits or reduces its activity. Both of those are plausible.
