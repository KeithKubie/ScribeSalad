00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Evans] The answer is the second choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If a guest checks in but never enters the room, here's what goes wrong.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If Alice never enters the room, then the next guest--who's very tall--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
who checks in, she'll get a key that is the next value here,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which is going to be hashing m - 2 times,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but the value of the stored x is still hash of m + 1,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and that means the value of hashing of the hashing this new key

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
will only be the hash of m, which won't match the value of x.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So the new guest won't be able to open the door.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The hotel operator would need to do something to reset the value of n

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or resynchronize the door and the check-in.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And apparently, the hotels that adopted this way of doing keying

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
never imagined the possibility that a guest would check in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but never actually enter their room with their key.

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Apparently, this happens more often than you might think, though.
