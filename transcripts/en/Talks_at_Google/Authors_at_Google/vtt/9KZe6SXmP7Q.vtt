00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.100
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Hi.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.260
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.000
And thanks for that
lovely introduction.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.880
IRIN CARMON: Yes.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.250
We also wanted to give a special
shout-out to Google Docs,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.970
without which this collaborative
book would never been written.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.410
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Seriously.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.650
IRIN CARMON: Seriously.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.770
At one point, we were in
two different countries.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.269
That's how you write
a book together

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.728
in two different countries, so
thank you to any folks here.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.269
SHANA KNIZHNIK: And
this presentation

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.584
is actually on Google Slides.

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:34.500
IRIN CARMON: We didn't
do that just because we

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.030
were coming to Google.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.610
We legit our fans, so thank you.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.260
So we want to talk about
how Ruth Bader Ginsburg won

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.850
the internet and why it matters.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.280
And I want to start out by
setting a scene for you.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.560
It's June, 2013.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.650
It's the last week of
the Supreme Court term.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.730
As many of you know,
that is the week

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.100
that the most important
decisions come down.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
On this particular day,
the Voting Rights Act

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
is on the chopping block.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.400
As you may know, this is one
of the most important pieces

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.640
of civil rights legislation.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.960
Chief Justice John
Roberts has the opinion.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.600
And he says, "Any racial
discrimination in voting

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.430
is too much, but our country has
changed in the last 50 years."

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.180
We have a comic in the book that
depicts this argument as, "LOL,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.610
racism is over."

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.400
Now, something that's
customary in the court

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.290
bringing its opinions is that
the Chief Justice will say,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.940
Justice Blank has the opinion.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.630
And that opinion will be
read by the justice who

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.990
wrote the opinion, in this
case, the Chief Justice himself.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.410
The impact of this decision was
to gut an important provision

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.900
of this piece of civil
rights legislation

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.390
that made it-- this piece of
legislation, which is referred

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.660
to as pre-clearance
forced states

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.500
with discriminatory
histories to bring

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.700
their laws, the changes
in their voting laws,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.460
to the federal
government ahead of time

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.130
so that the federal government
could monitor whether these

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.320
would have a
discriminatory impact,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.620
especially on historically
oppressed groups.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.490
So by undermining this
piece of legislation,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.260
by saying that it
was no longer needed

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.570
on a very questionable
legal grounding,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.700
essentially it was
opening the door

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.190
and has subsequently
opened the door

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.102
for more racial
discrimination in voting.

00:02:38.102 --> 00:02:43.100
SHANA KNIZHNIK: So in this case,
Justice Ginsburg has a dissent.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.400
And like Irin mentioned, it's
customary for the majority

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.600
opinion to be read
from the bench.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.120
But what's more unusual
is for a dissent

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.550
to be read from the bench.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.460
And in this case,
Justice Ginsburg

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.590
decided to read her
dissent out loud.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.870
And not only that,
she had actually

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.270
done so twice before
in the same week,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.550
once in a case regarding
affirmative action,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.300
and once in a combined
two cases involving

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.160
workplace discrimination.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.230
Now this is unusual,
and she actually

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.710
broke Supreme Court records
with the number of oral dissents

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.610
that she gave that week.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.790
And in this case, when you read
the dissent from the bench,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.980
it means something.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.280
It has an import.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.790
It sends a message.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.470
And that message is
that something is wrong.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.110
It's sounding the alarm.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.510
It's like, as the "New York
Times" actually put it,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.460
it's like embarrassing
your spouse at a dinner

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.660
party in front of the guests.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.840
So in this case, I was in my
second year of law school.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.740
I was going into my
second year at that time.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.880
And as a future
public defender, I

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.520
was appalled at the gutting
of this central tool

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.690
for racial justice advocates.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.316
So everyone I knew was
sort of angry about what

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:00.440
was happening on the court.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.302
But the light amidst this anger
was Justice Ginsburg's words.

00:04:05.302 --> 00:04:06.760
IRIN CARMON: This
is a court sketch

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.880
that was that drawn
live, which we actually

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.250
include in the book.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.230
And if you look around
Justice Ginsburg's neck,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.430
a funny thing
about-- a light thing

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.420
that we include in the book
is that a lot of people

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.495
recognize these neck collars,
the jabots or necklaces

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:27.820
that she wears with
her judicial robes.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.710
Many people don't know
that she chooses them

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.790
based on what her
opinion is that day.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.990
So this is her dissent jabot.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.300
So if she comes out
to the bench wearing

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.720
this spiky, aggressive,
sparkly, dissenting collar,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.440
it's bad news for liberals
because she's about to dissent.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.560
SHANA KNIZHNIK: And her
words, in this case one

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.080
of the most famous lines,
was actually the first post

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.720
on the Notorious RBG Tumblr.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.730
"Throwing out pre-clearance when
it has worked and is continuing

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.030
to work to stop
discriminatory changes

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.820
is like throwing away your
umbrella in a rainstorm

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.795
because you're not getting wet."

00:05:06.795 --> 00:05:11.980
IRIN CARMON: And we think that
Justice Ginsburg's clear words,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.960
which speak to be people
who are not just attorneys,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.090
and are fierce and
reasoned at the same time,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.600
are part of the
reason why she has

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.770
drawn so many people to her.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.600
This is such an
elegant analogy that

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.690
uses absolutely no legal jargon
to draw people's attention

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.245
to what was a major upending
of a core civil rights law.

00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:37.740
SHANA KNIZHNIK: And so
when this case came out,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.950
I was inspired by
Justice Ginsburg's words.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.570
And at the same time, I
had already taken con law

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.610
as a 1L, constitutional law.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.550
I knew about Justice
Ginsburg's work

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.300
as an advocate at the Women's
Rights Project at the ACLU.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.580
And I knew something about
her story, her life story.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.670
And I realized there was no
space on the internet that

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.300
was just dedicated to
celebrating this amazing figure

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.710
in our history.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.230
And so I figured, what
better way to celebrate her

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.750
than to juxtapose her with
a larger than life figure

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.840
in our history as well, the
late, great Notorious B.I.G.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.210
So I started a Tumblr
and I designed a t-shirt.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.760
And this is-- as
you can see, this

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.910
was the Notorious RBG t-shirt.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.750
And let's just say
that it took off.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.960
IRIN CARMON: Yeah,
to say the least.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.750
Here's an iconic image of
Biggie Smalls that has found

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.860
its way onto our book cover.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.980
And in the center are some--
those posters and stickers

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.350
blanketed Washington, DC
on the same week that we're

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.000
talking about, June, 2013,
the week of the Shelby County

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.720
decision and the other oral
dissents that we mentioned

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.920
that also concerned civil rights
and remedies to discrimination.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.870
And the middle image is "Can't
Spell Truth Without Ruth"

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.090
and it's a Basquiat crown,
so definitely taking

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.140
this kind of vernacular
of the hip-hop movement.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.170
And that's a little plug for our
t-shirts, the Notorious R.B.G.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.670
t-shirt.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.711
That's my little brother.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.940
Nail art-- there is Ruth
Bader Ginsburg nail art.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.794
SHANA KNIZHNIK:
There's also art art.

00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:29.460
IRIN CARMON: This illustration's
in the Times today, by the way.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.150
We were all very excited.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.410
That one is called "Ruth
Bader Ginsburg-- Smiting

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.200
Her Enemies," which, as I
tried to explain in my op-ed

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.880
in the "New York Times" this
weekend, she would never do.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.100
She would just very gently
argue with her enemies.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.395
But she would smite them
with the force of her reason.

00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:48.311
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Right.

00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:51.280
She likes to say that the
way that you take down

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.870
your adversaries is by painting
their arguments in the best

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.595
light possible and then--

00:07:56.595 --> 00:07:57.980
IRIN CARMON: Knocking them down.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.855
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Yeah.

00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:03.758
So there was also
embroidery and needlepoint.

00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:05.214
IRIN CARMON: Legos.

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:06.880
SHANA KNIZHNIK: We
actually got a chance

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.610
to meet the R.B.G. Lego
and her creator yesterday.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:12.580
IRIN CARMON: Yes.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:18.285
Just like Justice Ginsburg
herself, small but powerful.

00:08:18.285 --> 00:08:19.750
SHANA KNIZHNIK:
And as mentioned,

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.240
lots of Halloween costumes.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.332
We're thinking about
doing a contest this year.

00:08:24.332 --> 00:08:25.040
IRIN CARMON: Yes.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.080
Keep in mind when you're
choosing your Halloween

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.060
costumes.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.050
Tag us, Notorious R.B.G.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.805
SHANA KNIZHNIK: And of course--

00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:34.320
IRIN CARMON: Weekend Update.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.190
You got Ginsburned.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.335
Kate McKinnon, the
brilliant tattoos.

00:08:38.335 --> 00:08:40.140
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Several tattoos.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.830
But Justice Ginsburg
is still, after all,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.720
an 82-year-old
Jewish grandmother.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.800
This was her reaction to
seeing tattoos on her face.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.040
IRIN CARMON: She said-- this is
in my interview with her-- she

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.580
said, why would you
do that to yourself?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.350
It's permanent.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.790
And actually, another
occasion in which I saw her,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.240
she had just read the book.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.910
And she said, you know, there's
something I have to tell you.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.940
And I was so worried.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.390
She has famously high standards.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.500
And she said, listen.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.920
No one should ever
get a tattoo of me.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.345
This has gone too far.

00:09:17.345 --> 00:09:22.190
SHANA KNIZHNIK: So why is it
that people of our generation

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.620
have become so excited
about Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.600
almost obsessive?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.780
Was it just a passing meme,
like Menswear Dog or LOLcats?

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.840
IRIN CARMON: I
love Menswear Dog.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.090
But I think that this is
something-- there's something

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.060
more going on here
than just fun memes.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:47.700
I think specifically, what
Justice Ginsburg has devoted

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.550
her life to, and
what she represents,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.430
at a moment in which
important civil rights

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.840
laws and the
women's rights gains

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.510
that she had devoted her career
to are on the chopping block.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.630
At a point in which
there are still

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.990
too few women in positions
of authority and power,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.950
she is a woman who has devoted
her entire career to bringing

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.650
along other women
and other people who

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.410
are historically disadvantaged.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.720
She has done so with
intellectual integrity,

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.860
with grace.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.940
And as we learned from
writing this book,

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.910
she knows of which she speaks.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.920
The causes she's devoted her
life to have also inflected

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.260
her own life.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.110
SHANA KNIZHNIK: So obviously,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.820
is more than just a
hilarious Jewish bubbe

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.740
who talks about getting
drunk on California

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.760
wine before the State
of the Union address.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.267
That was the reason she
gave for why she fell asleep

00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:48.350
at the State of the Union.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.960
But we also know that in
fact, she was up all night

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.730
working before.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.330
She's a famous night owl.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.760
So she often gets about
two hours of sleep,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.930
even to this day.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.570
And we have so much
to learn from her.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.720
And we're so in debt to her.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.080
So we wanted to bring
what we learned about her

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.670
in writing this book to
you guys and to everyone

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.520
who able to read it.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.990
First of all, her life story
is absolutely fascinating.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.800
She's gone through so much.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.240
Actually, her sister died
when she was six years old,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.980
so she ended up being an
only child after that.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.750
And her mother
passed away the day

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.740
before her high
school graduation--

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.740
IRIN CARMON: --where she
was scheduled to speak.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.656
SHANA KNIZHNIK: And she
ended up not attending

00:11:33.656 --> 00:11:38.030
as a result. In law school,
she went to Harvard Law

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.620
with her husband, who
was a year above her.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.240
She had a one-year-old
child when she started.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.790
And in addition to all
of that, her husband

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.050
actually got cancer while
they were in law school.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.367
IRIN CARMON: I think we have
a photo of them together.

00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:53.200
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Yep.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.930
And she actually would
type his papers for him

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.780
and take his notes that
were taken by his classmates

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.290
after doing all of her work,
after taking care of him,

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.430
of her, of her child Jane.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.040
So we really couldn't-- we took
inspiration in her work ethic

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.915
when we were doing
this book, for sure.

00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:16.250
IRIN CARMON: Cancer has been
something that has inflected

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.440
Justice Ginsburg's life.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.110
As you may know, she herself
has had cancer twice.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.590
And yet with the
same kind of stamina

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:28.880
that she showed while she was a
law student and caring for both

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.150
her cancer-stricken
husband and her daughter,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.790
her young daughter
at the time, she

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.504
has never missed a
day on the bench.

00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:38.420
SHANA KNIZHNIK: That
actually includes the day

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.000
after her husband of
nearly 60 years passed away

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.270
from cancer in 2010.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.540
IRIN CARMON: Even while
she was at law school,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.090
just down the road
from here, she--

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.990
I think getting
to law school was

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.540
the point in which this very
studious, quiet young woman

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.210
hoped that she could
finally be seen

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.440
as an intellectual person
who had contributions

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.500
to offer, and not
just as a girl who

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.626
would get married, get pregnant,
and leave the workforce.

00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:15.450
SHANA KNIZHNIK: And she
did make law review.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.720
She was one of two women
to make law review here.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.970
You can see her on
the right there.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.090
They separated the two
women in this picture

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.520
and said that they were the
two roses amidst the thorns.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.870
IRIN CARMON: But even
at Harvard Law School,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.570
where she had a chance to pursue
her interests and her dreams,

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.750
the first week of
law school, the dean

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.610
summoned all of the
women to a dinner.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.740
There were nine of
them in the class.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.560
And they all sat
around in a circle.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.710
And she was sitting
next to a professor who

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.980
had written a fundamental
textbook, who she described

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.390
as looking like a god to me.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.220
She couldn't have been more
thrilled to be at this dinner,

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.000
and more nervous.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.320
And the dean, Erwin
Griswold, who gave himself

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.820
a lot of credit for having
brought women to the Harvard

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:09.420
Law School, looks around and
said, "Now, ladies, each of

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.940
you have to tell me,
how can you justify

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.200
taking the place of a man?"

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.000
And Justice Ginsburg was so
flummoxed that she stood up.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.130
She had an ashtray.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.100
She was a chain
smoker at the time.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.190
She had an ashtray on
her lap and the ashes

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.530
scattered everywhere.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.350
And when she stood up
to answer, she said,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.140
"I thought it would
be good to know

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.070
what it is my husband does."

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.820
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Erwin
Griswold would later

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.950
say that that question was
not meant to be serious,

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.310
that he was actually just trying
to prepare the women for what

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.120
they would face
in the workforce,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.369
or that he was just kidding.

00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:50.410
We don't know about that.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.910
IRIN CARMON: There
was another woman

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.070
who answered the
question by saying,

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.760
what better place
to catch a man?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.430
But that was not actually what
Justice Ginsburg was there

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.830
to do.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.870
And what's so interesting about
her life is that had she not

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.670
experienced the kind of
discrimination that she did,

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.620
she might have gone along
the path of just becoming

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.560
a very good lawyer, of just
becoming a civil procedure

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.770
professor.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:21.070
But in fact, because of the ways
that she was denied the chance

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.490
to fulfill her
potential, it put her

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.200
on the path of
fighting for justice.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.220
On the left is a photo
of Justice Ginsburg

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.320
and her husband when
they were stationed

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.440
at a military base in Oklahoma.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.350
That's when, about a year
after they got married,

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.670
she got pregnant and was
working in the civil service

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.970
while her was in the
military, before law school.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:50.070
And she placed within a certain
ranking as a civil servant,

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.390
but then they found
out she was pregnant.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.770
And they told her,
but you can't travel.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.700
She was only three
months pregnant.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.500
So they demoted her.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.480
And when her pregnancy
became more advanced,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.710
they made it very clear that
it was time for her to go.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.980
She would later go on to
bring important cases in which

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.010
service members and other women
were fired from their jobs,

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.460
told that they had to
get an abortion or quit,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.690
or just placed on what they
called maternity leave, which

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.690
was unpaid, basically, getting
kicked out of your job.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.674
But it would be a while until
she would get to that point.

00:16:25.674 --> 00:16:27.340
On the right is a
photo of her while she

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.490
was a professor at Rutgers.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.780
10 years later, she
became pregnant again

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:37.230
in a happy accident, and
still, not having tenure,

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:42.770
was afraid to tell her
superiors, lest she be fired.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.550
That's when she went to
her mother-in-law's closet

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.560
and wore baggy clothing.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.930
This was a job, by the way,
in which she had already

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.290
been told, well, we
couldn't possibly

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:56.240
pay you as much as Mr.
X, because your husband

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.050
makes a good living.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.990
She would later bring
a sex discrimination

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.250
case, class action lawsuit,
with the other women of Rutgers.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.638
And they won.

00:17:06.638 --> 00:17:09.540
SHANA KNIZHNIK: And even
before she was a professor--

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.079
she graduated at the top of
her class at Columbia Law,

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.890
where she was forced to transfer
because Harvard Law wouldn't

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.390
give her a degree
if she completed

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.018
her third year at Columbia.

00:17:21.018 --> 00:17:23.309
So she graduated from Columbia
at the top of her class.

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:25.267
She was at the top of
our class at Harvard Law,

00:17:25.267 --> 00:17:26.560
on both law reviews.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.980
And yet still, she was unable
to get a job at any law firm.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.670
And actually, a professor
of hers at Columbia

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.360
had to bribe, basically, a
district court judge in New

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.680
York to take her on as a clerk.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.080
He said, if you don't take
on Mrs. Ruth Ginsburg,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.590
I will never send you
another Columbia clerk again.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.590
That was the stick.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:53.920
The carrot was that
if he didn't like her,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.337
the professor would be able
to send a replacement Columbia

00:17:56.337 --> 00:17:56.836
clerk.

00:17:56.836 --> 00:17:57.650
IRIN CARMON: A man.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:58.720
SHANA KNIZHNIK: A man.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.170
But let's just say
she did all right.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.840
IRIN CARMON: He did not look
for a male backup for that role.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.370
10 years later, in the
'70s, Justice Ginsburg

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.800
co-founded the ACLU
Women's Rights Project,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.990
where her experiences with pay
discrimination and pregnancy

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:21.690
discrimination, being
denied jobs just because she

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.040
was a woman were
all brought to bear

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.510
as she built a series of cases
that successfully convinced

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:32.220
the Supreme Court that women
were equal under the law.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.920
Something didn't happen until
the '70s were well underway,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.220
it was perfectly legal to treat
women as if their contributions

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.940
in the economic and political
spheres mattered less.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.360
SHANA KNIZHNIK:
She brought cases

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.360
on behalf of men as well as
women, which she received

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.400
criticism about, because
it was after all called

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.340
the Women's Rights Project.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.500
But she knew that
in order for there

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.350
to be true equality and
liberty for all people,

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.910
that-- her vision of
feminism was that you needed

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.040
to be free to be you and me.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.670
So that meant bringing
cases on behalf

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.110
of men who wanted to
shatter stereotypes

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.340
by being primary caregivers
for their elderly parents

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.360
and for their children.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.818
IRIN CARMON: In
essence, what we've

00:19:17.818 --> 00:19:20.970
learned is that Justice
Ginsburg's version of feminism

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.600
still has a lot
to teach us today.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.540
This is, by the way, a meme
from the Beyonce voters Tumblr.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.760
We think that one reason that
Justice Ginsburg has struck

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.390
a chord among young
people and the reason

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.590
that we're excited to tell
people more about her life

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.420
is because we still have so much
unfinished business of gender

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.610
equality and the principles
for which she fought for,

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.190
which was she always said, it's
not just women's liberation.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.170
It's men's and
women's liberation.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.430
It also formed the groundwork
for her support of LGBT rights.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.450
It formed the groundwork of
her support for racial justice.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.250
Those are all very
much struggles

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.100
that remain unfinished.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.780
And in fact, many of the
gains that she fought for

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.950
are now being rolled back.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.540
So I think people respond to
this sort of righteous passion.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.410
And something that
we really want

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.460
to convey through the
book, what we really

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:29.740
want to tell as a story is
how much more there is to her

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.230
and how deeply
committed she remains

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.802
to the cause of equal
citizenship stature.

00:20:35.802 --> 00:20:37.510
SHANA KNIZHNIK: And
I think another point

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:42.230
is that anyone can be
revolutionary in their own way.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:46.660
And for Justice Ginsburg, that's
always been doing the work.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:51.906
Getting angry is a waste of
time, as she likes to say.

00:20:51.906 --> 00:20:53.655
IRIN CARMON: She wants
you to get to work.

00:20:53.655 --> 00:20:55.380
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Exactly.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.150
So after the notorious
R.B.G meme took off,

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:03.520
I actually got a chance to go
to Justice Ginsburg's chambers.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.110
And for a minute, I
didn't know that it

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.840
was going to happen
because she actually

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.130
had a heart procedure done
just a couple weeks before I

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.290
was supposed to go there.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:17.740
And again, she never
missed a day on the bench.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.980
And we went to her
chambers and I asked her

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:26.745
how she was doing, if she had
a message to send to your fans,

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:28.520
to her followers.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.720
And what she told me was
that I could tell them

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.160
that she'd be back doing
pushups within a week.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.550
IRIN CARMON: Anyway,
that's all out of us.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.666
We would love to
take your questions.

00:21:41.666 --> 00:21:45.602
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:48.062 --> 00:21:51.014
AUDIENCE: Both of you guys have
met her, or interviewed her.

00:21:51.014 --> 00:21:56.457
How has she responded to,
other than tattoos [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:56.457 --> 00:21:59.201
internet celebrity that has
been happening around her.

00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:02.370
SHANA KNIZHNIK: I think
that she enjoys it.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:07.690
But she's also not a very
outgoing person in real life,

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.480
I think.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.530
As she's gotten older,
she's grown into her role

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.870
as a public figure.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.310
But what's interesting
about it is

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.460
that most of the people that
know her well that we've

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:22.880
talked to in this process
are very surprised

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.650
by her role as this
icon at this point.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.260
And so is she.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.250
She said, to think,
me, an icon at 82.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.200
Because she's sort of
the least likely person

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.740
to want that for herself.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.160
And so I think that's
part of the appeal,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.300
is that she is this
unassuming person.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.625
But she means so much
to so many people.

00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:49.100
IRIN CARMON: That said, I
think she appreciates it,

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.700
because she really wants
to engage as many people as

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.060
possible in the project of the
court and the broader issues

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.930
that she fought for.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.430
So one thing that we
were surprised to learn

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.890
when we were
reporting the book was

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.480
that throughout the '80s, when
Justice Ginsburg became a lower

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.820
court judge and left
the movement formally,

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.330
she was repudiated by the
feminists of the '80s, who

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:16.290
said that her focus on equality
was ill-thought out, because it

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.680
didn't account for how men
and women were fundamentally

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.990
different.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.590
And this was a-- it was
called difference feminism

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.251
at the time.

00:23:23.251 --> 00:23:25.500
And the idea was that women
spoke in a different voice

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.099
and that we needed to celebrate
the fundamental differences.

00:23:28.099 --> 00:23:30.390
And something that Justice
Ginsburg has always resisted

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.520
is saying that men and women are
essentially one way or another.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.190
So I think for now for her to
become the hot young feminist,

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.020
so to speak, must be--
I don't know this,

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.860
but I speculate that it is kind
of a sweet validation for her.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.940
And her clerks also told
us that when she's writing,

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.240
and when they're
writing on her behalf,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:57.160
she always instructs them
to write for the public

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.580
and to just think about how to
engage people who are outside

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.130
of the courtroom
and whose lives are

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.880
going to be affected by this.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.170
So I think she's
amused and flattered.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.580
And ultimately, anything that
engages people more profoundly

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.725
with her work I believe
is something she values.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.495
AUDIENCE: I'm one of
the many people who

00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:25.725
wake up every morning
praying for the continued

00:24:25.725 --> 00:24:27.465
health of Ruth Ginsburg.

00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:30.447
I wonder if you could
say a couple of words

00:24:30.447 --> 00:24:33.429
about the contrast
between her and Sandra Day

00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:36.162
O'Connor, the first woman
on the Supreme Court who

00:24:36.162 --> 00:24:39.393
also faced immense
difficulties as a woman

00:24:39.393 --> 00:24:41.381
and yet developed
of course a very

00:24:41.381 --> 00:24:43.369
different judicial philosophy.

00:24:43.369 --> 00:24:47.462
I'm wondering how do you
explain-- how much of this

00:24:47.462 --> 00:24:49.712
is due, for example, due to
Ruth Ginsburg's growing up

00:24:49.712 --> 00:24:55.230
as a Jew in New York, or other
differences in background.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.328
Why did they, both of them
pioneers in certain ways,

00:24:59.328 --> 00:25:02.172
why did they end up with such
different judicial opinions?

00:25:02.172 --> 00:25:05.730
SHANA KNIZHNIK: So one
thing-- for example,

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.210
when Justice Sotomayor was
appointed to the court,

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.586
she got in some trouble.

00:25:11.586 --> 00:25:13.210
There was a controversy
about a comment

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.350
she made that said that a
wise Latina justice would come

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.260
to a different conclusion
than, say, a white male justice

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.010
or judge.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.670
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg was
asked about that comment.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:30.620
And she was quick to defend
Justice Sotomayor, then

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.240
Judge Sotomayor.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.350
And she said, well, of course
your life experiences are

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.480
very valuable to the
decision-making process.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.300
But that doesn't mean
they're better or worse.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.850
It just means that everything
that you've experienced

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.360
goes into the
decision-making process.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.200
And I think for her, she valued
the differences between her

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.990
and Sandra Day
O'Connor, because it

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.700
showed that women are not
all the same, that women

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.930
can have different opinions.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.980
And yet it's important for
women to be in the room.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.420
One of the most
upsetting things for her

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.780
was when she was the
only woman on the bench

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.190
after Justice O'Connor
retired and was

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.237
replaced by Samuel Alito.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:14.570
IRIN CARMON: I do think it's
really interesting to think

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.630
about the differences
between them.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.460
Linda Hirshman, who we're
doing an event with this week,

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.640
has a great book out that is
a dual biography of Justice

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.980
O'Connor and Justice Ginsburg
that we like and appreciate

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.840
also, because it has a chapter
in it called "Notorious RBG."

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.030
And Linda argues, I
think, that a lot of it

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.390
had to do with
specifically the fact

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.240
that Justice O'Connor grew
up as a frontierswoman

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.180
in this kind of self-reliant
mythology of the West.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.060
Justice Ginsburg
very much grew up

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.480
within a tradition
of American Jews

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.640
that was horrified by
McCarthyism, in particular.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.580
While she was a
student at Cornell,

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.930
there were teachers
and other members

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.160
of the community who
were blacklisted.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.380
So I think that that gave
her a deep appreciation

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.050
for civil liberties.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.390
The feminism part came
later, but actually

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:10.760
what first drew her to
the law was the censorship

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.760
and oppression that was
happening within the United

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.890
States.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.560
And it haunted
her in particular,

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.400
because her understanding
of World War

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.470
II-- she was born in
1933-- was that it

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.650
had been a war against racism.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.970
And then she learned that the
troops had been segregated.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.340
And then she saw McCarthyism.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:38.540
So I think that shaped her
profoundly, in addition to all

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.500
of the gendered
experiences that she

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.230
would have as she
grew up and gave her

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:48.076
a real strong appreciation
for civil liberties.

00:27:48.076 --> 00:27:50.350
AUDIENCE: What's your
advice for young people,

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.910
or any person for
that matter, who

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.630
don't work in the legal system,
that could have an impact

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.160
or voice when it comes to
upholding things that we don't

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.410
want to see go away like
exactly what you were talking

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.350
about at the start of the talk?

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.670
IRIN CARMON: From where
I'm sitting as a reporter

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.600
on-- focusing a
lot on the battle

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.150
over reproductive rights,
that is something--

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.270
it's not happening in
Massachusetts so much,

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.280
but that is something
that Justice Ginsburg has

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.620
talked a lot about in
terms of her worry.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.730
And I think honestly,
in places where

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.010
it's not such a dire issue,
lending support to places

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.620
where is a dire issue if that
is something that you support.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.700
Justice Ginsburg often talks
about how the law is not

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.100
the engine of social change.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.210
It's social movements, and
it's people making change

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.230
through the legislature
and through movements.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.500
And so I think getting engaged
in that process is probably

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.809
something that she
would recommend.

00:28:49.809 --> 00:28:51.350
She always says,
fight for the things

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.390
you care about, but
do so in a way that

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.910
would lead others to join you.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.930
So I think she
wants to see people

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.600
move beyond that initial
anger and channel it

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.410
towards something productive.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:11.300
And of course, I would say,
within your own spheres here--

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.140
I mean, I saw a lot
of awesome things

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.950
at Google Diversity--
of course we

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.470
know that women are
still underrepresented

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.630
in many of these fields.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:23.050
And something that she's
really committed her life to

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.720
is busting stereotypes.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.080
The opinion, the majority
opinion that she's proud of

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.540
is the United States
versus Virginia,

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.780
where she wrote the opinion that
forced the Virginia Military

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.040
Academy to go co-ed.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.720
And people would say
to her, what woman

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.830
would want to go to VMI?

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.350
And she said, there are
women who want to go.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.610
All that matters
is that getting in

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.650
is not on the basis
of your gender.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.900
So I think she would probably
encourage people to continue

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.050
the good work that's being
done, to get more women

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:03.391
and people of color in the STEM
fields, since we are at Google.

00:30:03.391 --> 00:30:06.410
AUDIENCE: I was going to ask
something similar about what

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:10.410
does she consider her most proud
case, which you just mentioned,

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:14.190
or what she considers maybe
the most important case she's

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.790
worked on, or something similar
about another favorite of hers?

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.540
SHANA KNIZHNIK: United
States vs. Virginia

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:23.350
is one of her favorites, because
it allowed her to actually cite

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.831
a number of the cases that
she argued before the Supreme

00:30:25.831 --> 00:30:26.330
Court.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.510
It was really the culmination
of her own legal strategy

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.610
at the ACLU, applying
equal protection

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.330
to gender discrimination.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.420
So that was obviously something
that she was really proud of.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.050
Another case that
she always mentions

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.970
is the Lilly
Ledbetter case, which

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.860
was a case about equal pay.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.215
And in particular, she was
in the dissent in that case.

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:51.590
She wrote the
dissenting opinion.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:57.090
And she basically called out
Congress and said, fix this.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.730
The court has got it wrong here.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.500
We need you, Congress,
to do something about it.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.460
Luckily at that
time for her, there

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.950
was a Democratic Congress
and a Democratic President.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.410
So they actually were able to
pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.370
Pay Act.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.270
And in her chambers,
she has a picture

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.480
of the signing of that act.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.490
And to her, beyond the
substance of that case

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.190
itself, the fact
that it's about equal

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:24.330
pay and how obviously important
that is in her career,

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:27.670
in her life, it also exhibits
something that she really

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.950
cares about, which is the
value of the institutions

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:35.100
and the interplay between
those branches of government,

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.360
the Supreme Court actually
speaking to Congress

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.160
and Congress responding.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.590
And I think when Irin asked
her in Irin's interview

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:47.220
with her what she thinks
about the current Congress,

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:52.190
she is not so optimistic about
the current Congress's ability

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.790
to do that sort of thing,
to get things done.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.165
IRIN CARMON: And I think as a
litigator, her favorite case

00:31:58.165 --> 00:32:01.020
is-- I think there were
two favorite cases that I

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.340
think are worth talking about.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.240
And one was the case
that she thought

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.260
would guarantee the right
to reproductive freedom,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.000
before Roe vs. Wade.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.590
And for her, it's the
case that got away.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:18.860
So Susan Struck was
in Air Force nurse.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.210
She became pregnant
while on active duty.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.010
At that point, the
rule was, you have

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.450
to choose-- you either
have to have an abortion

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.880
or you have to leave.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.850
And this was pretty remarkable,
because abortion was still

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.520
illegal throughout
the United States.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.020
But the Army was actually
requiring female service

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.360
members to have
abortions if they

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.630
wanted to stay in their jobs.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.750
So Justice Ginsburg represented
Susan Struck in a brief

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.650
to the Supreme Court.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.400
The Supreme Court took the case.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.540
And her argument was that
it violates a woman's

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.800
equal protection
under the law to say

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.260
that she has to
treat her pregnancy

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.290
in a particular way or another.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.500
If she can take
disability leave,

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.330
she should be treated
just like a man who

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.900
needs disability leave.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.560
And only women are
punished for having sex.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.780
That was sort of the bottom
line of her argument.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.680
And she hoped that by
bringing a case of a woman who

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.150
didn't want to have an abortion
just like the male cases

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.400
that she brought that were
also about vindicating women's

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.710
rights, that she would be able
to lay the groundwork that

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.350
would eventually lead
to the full range

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.530
of reproductive options.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.390
But Erwin Griswold,
the same dean

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:32.460
who had demanded of her that
she justify her presence,

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.490
happened to be the Solicitor
General, the top lawyer,

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:38.360
for the United
States of America,

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.015
and went to the
military and said,

00:33:40.015 --> 00:33:41.390
you've got to
change this policy,

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.250
because I'm going
to lose this case.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.760
Yeah, this guy pops up
again and again in her life.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.620
We also have this very
mansplaining letter

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.850
that we quote in the book from
him, where he starts to worry,

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.260
roughly 1978, that
white men aren't

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.557
going to be able to get into
Harvard Law School anymore.

00:33:58.557 --> 00:34:00.140
She assures him that
there will always

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.970
be a place for white
men with merit.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.470
So the Struck case
ended up being mooted.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:12.260
And as a result, in that same
term, Roe v Wade was decided.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.590
So Justice Ginsburg always
bemoans Roe v Wade because she

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.754
feels it went too far too fast.

00:34:17.754 --> 00:34:19.170
Even though she
liked the outcome,

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.870
she thought that something
ground in women's equality

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:22.880
would be better.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.250
And the other case
that she loves,

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.170
her favorite client, who she's
stayed in touch with for years,

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.320
started with a
letter to the editor.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.840
And it was a man who had
recently lost his wife.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.820
She had died in childbirth,
but the child survived.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:41.550
And he wanted to be the
primary caregiver for his son.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.929
But he could not get the
same widower benefits

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.679
that a widow could get.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.500
And the letter says, I
wonder if Gloria Steinem

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.798
knows about this.

00:34:52.798 --> 00:34:55.020
This is 1976.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.610
And Gloria Steinem did, in
fact, I think, know about it.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.850
And Justice Ginsburg, then the
head of the ACLU Women's Rights

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.670
Project, soon learned about
it and brought his case

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.890
all the way up to
the Supreme Court,

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:12.290
arguing that it violated his
rights, his dead wife's rights,

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.520
as a breadwinner, and
the rights of the child,

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.470
to equal protection
under the law.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.989
And the justices at
the time, all men,

00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:23.780
had trouble even
believing that a man would

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.054
want to care for their child.

00:35:25.054 --> 00:35:26.470
They were like,
is this case real?

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:27.250
Are you serious?

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.030
Who is this guy?

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.140
But she won.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.700
And she stayed in touch with
Stephen Weisenfeld for years.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:39.180
And many years later, she
performed his son's wedding.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:39.680
Great.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.940
Well, thank you guys so much.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.814
SHANA KNIZHNIK: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:35:42.814 --> 00:35:45.670
[APPPLAUSE]
