00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.614
- Hey, c'mon in!

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.951
(bouncy keyboard music)

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.255 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, push and
believe, you got it.

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.024 line:0%
- So Mike you're in Boston,

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.859 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
If you wanna get comfortable,
take the jacket off,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.293 line:0%
look at me.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.095 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I like the jacket, I'm
going for the single dad look.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.230
- Are you a single father?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.599 align:start size:88% position:13%
- No I just like
portraying the illusion.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.234 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Do you have a
significant other?

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.802 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah I do, I
have a girlfriend.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.836
- Where did you guys meet?

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:37.670
- The internet.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.838
- Is that a club?

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:39.672
- Yeah.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.907
- Where is that?

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.276 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Desperation.com,
ineedthis.org.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:45.645
- You do poetry.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.182 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah, I'm a recovering
slam poet, eight years sober.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.418
- Are you gonna go
back to your roots

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.585
for this comedy special?

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.620
- I do some rhyming.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.121
- Can you rhyme on the spot?

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.790 align:start size:94% position:6%
I know they say comedians,
like do a joke for me,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.925 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they go, don't
ever make me do a joke.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:00:59.993
- I could do, yeah yeah.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.327
- Okay so you can do the poetry.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.530 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So I'm Mike Lawrence,
I'm in this hotel,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.698
this conversation
is awkward as hell.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.534
I don't know where it's going,

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.736
and I don't know how it'll go,

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.505
let's be honest, this
poem fuckin' blows.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.207
- You think this is
an awkward interview?

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:15.708
It's different.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:18.378
- No, no, no, it's just,
I was just going with the.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:19.279
- You're going with it!

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.513
Let me try one.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.219 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hanging out in Boston,
doing what I do,

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.856
drinkin' Dunkin' Donuts
with with a morning dew,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:33.193
get out of my bed,
stretch and do that,

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.496
call my little mother,
she won't call me back,

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.599
jump into the shower,
scrub my little body,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.802
stare in to the mirror,
just like everybody,

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:46.406
I said body twice, that's
a thing you don't wanna do,

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.676
when you're doin' a
poem like a haiku.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.512 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yes! Push and
believe, you got it.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.749
- What I love is that that
started off as a slam poem

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.618 align:start size:84% position:16%
but you slowly
became more and more

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.788 align:start size:84% position:16%
like the lead
singer of the B-52s.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:02.989
- Oh I turned in to--

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.192 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I got me a car, it's
as big as a whale.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
It really became
like, 'you're what?!'

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.964
PoetiC.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.233 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Y'know you're talking
about Fred Schneider, y'know,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.834 align:start size:84% position:16%
I get that comparison
on occasion,

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:18.404 align:start size:97% position:3%
I am 10% gay, I'm open
about it, I went to Bangkok,

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.073
I pushed it to the limit,

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.875 align:start size:81% position:19%
anything you wanna
open up about?

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:26.212
- Yeah, I uh, I dated a dude
for three weeks in college

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:29.482
and dumped him because he
gave me the worst hand job

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:32.552
that I'd ever gotten in my life.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:35.121
They're supposed to be
good at that, right?

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.223
Like that's the reason
you're with another dude,

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:41.494 align:start size:97% position:3%
'cause he knows how to touch
stuff, it was horrible,

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.330
it was like if King Arthur

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.667
had had Parkinson's when
he pulled out Excalibur.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.169
That's how my dick felt.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.239
It was painful and I was
just like, I can't do this.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:57.043
And the sad thing was,
this was at Thanksgiving

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:59.612 align:start size:88% position:13%
after he had introduced
me to his family,

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:03.716 align:start size:97% position:3%
came out to 'em and said
this is the guy that I love.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.486
- Wow.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.855
I did, I, it was not in the bio.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.124 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I didn't know
who I was, y'know,

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.526
so I was like, I'll try
this, this sounds fun.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.895 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I feel like we're connected,
we've been too far apart,

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.932
let's angle it and get closer.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:19.766
Michael thank you.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.134
- Yeah how's it going?

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.536
- I want you to
open up, and say,

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.839 align:start size:97% position:3%
'Brody, I'm there, I'm
comfortable with my gayness.'

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.241
- I was gay in the same way

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.743 align:start size:84% position:16%
that Michael Jordan
was a baseball player.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:31.978
- Are you a baseball fan?

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:33.213
Maybe that's something
we could connect on.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.415 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, no, no, no, I
don't like any sports.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:36.249
- You don't like sports.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.083
- No.

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.017
- Do you exercise?

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:38.851
- No.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.119
- Are you depressed?

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.621
- Yeah.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.923 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Do you think exercise
will help your depression?

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:44.757
- No.

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:45.592
- Michael.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:46.526
- Yes.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:47.727
- I've been where you're at.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.496 align:start size:88% position:13%
I've been depressed,
I've been on medication,

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:53.566 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've been under
doctor's supervision,

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.805
and what they tell me is,
exercise is the way to go.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.309
Will you do that
with me right now?

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.143
- Yeah.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.812
- Let's do it.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.281 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yes, we're exercising,
we're pushing,

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.683
I'm here with Mike, how do
you feel right now Mike?

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.518
- Uh this is so uncomfortable.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.288
- You'll push through it,
the depression is fading.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:18.458 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We're going to the
love shack, baby.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.361
- Oh we're back to that,

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:24.197
how dare you call me Schneider.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.065 line:0%
