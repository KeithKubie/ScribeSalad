00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.290
- My name is Brendan
Lowry and I'm the creator

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.010
and founder of Peopledelphia.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.850
What's exciting about capturing
people with photography

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.540
is that there are always
new stories to tell.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.710
I don't think people realize
how much is happening

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.380
in Philadelphia and how many
hidden gems there actually are.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.240
There's been a lot that's
changed over the past 10 years

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.390
in this city and it's really
exciting time to be here

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.490
whether that's in the arts
world, in the restaurant world

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.320
there's a lot of things
happening within a bunch

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.880
of different industries
that make Philly a really

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.070
exciting place to be.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.820
BOK is this old massive school building

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.320
which has now been turned
into essentially a massive

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590
makers space, so it's
exciting to see this thing

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.220
that was going to be
completely empty now full

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.380
of life and something
that's actually impacting

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.590
the community, the
economy and really a place

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.860
where anyone can go and be inspired.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.500
I'm really excited for the event.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.060
I don't think there's been
anything like this in Philly.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.940
It's super unique.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.790
It's rare that we're able
to have all these artists

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.554
in the same room at the same time

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:19.500
in this amazing auditorium that was empty

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.333
a couple of years ago.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.366
And now we're using it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.240
to celebrate Philadelphia
artists, celebrate Philadelphia

00:01:26.248 --> 00:01:29.555
film makers and really just
show why Philly is such

00:01:29.647 --> 00:01:31.499
a unique place.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.860
- It's a really great
building and a great culture.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.750
And honestly this event
represents it really well.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.580
- When I walked into the
building tonight I saw

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.167
this amazing blue light
and I said, "What did Chase

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:43.608
put on tonight?"

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.690
The level of curiosity that I
have is what really drives me

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.820
to try and find these moments
and to capture these moments.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.900
Forcing myself to not always look

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.490
at what everyone else is looking at

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.700
and to sort of look the
other way and point my camera

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.800
in that direction is exciting to me

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.340
and it leads me down a
bunch of different paths

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.090
that I never thought
that I would maybe take.
