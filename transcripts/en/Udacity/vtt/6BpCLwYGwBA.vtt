00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The correct answer is--you should be looking at the HTTP request.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll try it myself--okay--we have our form, I click submit,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and--boom--here we are.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is actually--what we're looking at--is the HTTP request.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We'll look at the code in a sec to remind ourselves how all of this happened.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But do you remember from our first lesson when we talked about

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
HTTP requests and how they look?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well--here's our request line--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
GET--and then our URL--/testform,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and then q equals the text we typed in the field.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You can see a couple more headers,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Accept and what languages we are expecting to receive--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
what character sets are okay.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We can see the host header--we're familiar with that one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can see the referer header--referer header is interesting.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This refers to the URL that sent this request.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So--the URL of our form is localhost8080/

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and the URL we're on right now is /testform,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but this header is helpful for telling the server where the request came from.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You'll notice that referer is misspelled here,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that's because in the original HTTP spec

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the word referrer was spelled wrong. It normally has two Rs.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But it's lived on for backwards compatibility reasons,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
for nearly 20 years now.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And--this is actually symptomatic of how a lot of things

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in HTTP or on the web are, which is--you know--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
somebody made a decision--you know--20 years ago

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that still haunts us today,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and it's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
a side effect of when things grow organically over time.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Another header we've talked about--our user agent--

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in this case I'm using Chrome--you can see that here--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
amidst a bunch of version information on Mac OSX.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Looking at our code--here's what we did.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We set the content type to text plain.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If we hadn't done that, the response we were looking at in HTML,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
or in the browser would have looked weird,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because the browser would have assumed it was HTML,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and a lot of that text wouldn't have shown up.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, we set it to plain because I knew what we were going to do.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Then instead of writing text or writing out our q parameter,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we actually wrote out this request object itself,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which is the Python object that represents the request,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
but conveniently it prints out very much like HTTP looks,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
which is not a coincidence.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So--it's a handy little tool though when you're writing web applications

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and debugging, you want to see--you know--where something broke

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
or what's going on, you can just print out the request and see.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So--let's replace these two lines again, back to the way they were,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and move on to something else.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm just going to comment these lines out, however,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
because we're going to need them for later.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So--this is how our file was before, let's move on to a new section.
