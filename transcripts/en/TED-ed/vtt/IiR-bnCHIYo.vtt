00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.452
Great weather we're having!

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:19.332
Awesome job!

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:22.603
You're a tremendous athlete!

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:25.013
Compliments, right?

00:00:25.013 --> 00:00:27.766
Well, maybe.

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.935
Depending on the attitude

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.020
and tone of voice behind these lines,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.648
they very well may be compliments.

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:35.260
They may also be, though,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.820
pointed and attacking lines.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.906
This slight change of attitude behind the lines

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:44.995
reveals what we call verbal irony.

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:48.570
So when someone says, "Great weather we're having,"

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.126
it is quite possible that the person really means that

00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:53.259
if the sun is shining,

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:54.625
the birds are singing,

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:56.611
and the wind is calm.

00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.043
But if the weather is horrible,

00:00:58.043 --> 00:00:59.074
the clouds are looming,

00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:01.178
and the wind is a raging tempest,

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:05.381
and someone says, "Great weather we're having,"

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:07.720
he probably doesn't actually mean that.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.529
He probably means that the weather is horrible,

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.725
but he has said the opposite.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:15.035
This is verbal irony

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:18.105
when the speaker says the opposite of what he means.

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:18.814
I know what you're thinking.

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:20.064
Isn't this sarcasm,

00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:22.324
isn't the speaker being sarcastic?

00:01:22.324 --> 00:01:23.441
Yes.

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:25.838
When a speaker says the opposite of what he means,

00:01:25.838 --> 00:01:28.032
that is verbal irony.

00:01:28.032 --> 00:01:30.413
When a speaker then goes the step farther

00:01:30.413 --> 00:01:32.089
to mean the opposite of what he says

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:35.294
and seeks to be a little pointed and mean,

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.137
like he's making fun of something,

00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:38.797
then you have sarcasm.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.465
Take the second example:

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:41.548
"Awesome job!"

00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:43.954
Someone accomplishing his life-long dream:

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:44.748
awesome!

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:46.810
Someone winning a sports championship:

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.667
awesome!

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:50.047
Someone rear-ends another car:

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:52.724
not awesome.

00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:56.441
So when the passenger says, "Awesome job!"

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:57.969
they probably mean the opposite

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.191
with a hint of poking fun.

00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:03.655
That is verbal irony and that is sarcastic.

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:06.450
"You're a talented athlete," said to an Olympian:

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.334
authentic, no verbal irony present.

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:11.619
Said to the klutzy kid tripping into English class

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.420
and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.137
now that is just harsh and verbally ironic

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:21.421
because what you said is not what you meant.

00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:23.550
That is verbal irony.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.436
You have said the opposite of what you mean.

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.323
Additionally, since you have the intention

00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:29.303
of mocking this poor person,

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:31.849
you have not only been verbally ironic,

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.144
but sarcastic as well.

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:35.354
Beware, though.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:38.525
While all sarcasm fits the definition of verbal irony,

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:42.069
not all verbal irony is sarcastic.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.363
Verbal irony is where what is meant

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:46.844
is the opposite of what is said,

00:02:46.844 --> 00:02:50.284
while sarcasm adds that little punch of attitude.

00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:51.263
There are times, though,

00:02:51.263 --> 00:02:53.847
where another layer of meaning can be present

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:56.877
without that sarcastic tone.

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.576
Alright, now go out there

00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:02.594
and find those examples of verbal irony and sarcasm.

00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:04.383
Good luck!

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:06.929
No, seriously, I mean it, good luck.

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:07.969
No, no, really,

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.129
I truly want to wish you luck on this difficult task.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.960
Ok, ok, sincerely good luck.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.838
You can do it!

00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:17.057
No verbal irony here.
