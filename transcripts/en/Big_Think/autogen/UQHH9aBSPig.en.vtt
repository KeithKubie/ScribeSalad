invention of the alphabet and for a long
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.300
invention of the alphabet and for a long
time reading was really just a kind of

through speech and so one of the
 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.990
through speech and so one of the
fascinating things about early writing

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000

lot of your mental energy goes to

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290
lot of your mental energy goes to
 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.900
lot of your mental energy goes to
figuring out where does one word end and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
figuring out where does one word end and
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.850
figuring out where does one word end and
the next begin and as a result all

as silent reading because you had to

as silent reading because you had to
read out loud in order to figure out you

read out loud in order to figure out you
know where is a word ending and whereas

in around the Year 800 or 900 that we

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
in around the Year 800 or 900 that we
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.990
in around the Year 800 or 900 that we
saw the introduction of word spaces and

and suddenly you had this whole ideal of
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.960
and suddenly you had this whole ideal of
the silent solitary reader who was

the silent solitary reader who was
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.609
the silent solitary reader who was
improving their mind expanding the

what that served to do is take this new
