00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is such a beautiful equation. There is so much intuition goes in here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And there is a few reasons why I love this equation.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First, it says that acceleration is just your normal acceleration due to gravity times some multiplier

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and then we can think about, what is this multiplier.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well, this multiplier depends on the difference of the two masses.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If this masses are identical, well subtracting them will give you zero and you'll have no motion.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Acceleration will be zero exactly like we expected.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If m₂ is bigger than m₁, well this will be positive in the denominator

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that means we'll have positive acceleration which we defined as clockwise

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Exactly what we expected when m₂ &gt; m₁.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Likewise, if m₁ &gt; m₂, it will be negative which becomes counterclockwise

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and finally, in the case where let's say m₂ is &gt;&gt;&gt; m₁.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's say m₂ was 1000 kg and m₁ was 1

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
1000-1, might as well just call it 1000 and ignore the 1.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Likewise,1000+1, who cares about the 1, ignore it. We have the a = g  m₂/m₂, that cancels.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Our acceleration is equal to g 10 m/s². I love that problem. I hope you like it as much as I do.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There is going to be a lot more learning to do on the problem set.

00:01:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You are not done here, I promise, but I think what you've done today is really amazing. Good work.
