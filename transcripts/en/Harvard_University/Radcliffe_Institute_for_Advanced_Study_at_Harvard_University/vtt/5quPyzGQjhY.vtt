00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.872
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.750
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.140
So wonderful to see you.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.320
Thank you for braving
the rain to be here

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.630
on this very special evening.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.320
I'm Tomiko Brown-Nagin,
the Dean of the Radcliffe

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.770
Institute for Advanced
Study at Harvard University.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.670
Welcome to the biannual
Rama S. Mehta lecture,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.300
which focuses our attention
on topics related to women

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.460
in the developing world.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.280
This lectureship was established
in Rama Mehta's memory

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.730
by Catherine Atwater Galbraith
and John Kenneth Galbraith,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.515
along with the Mehta family.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.630
The lecture is supported
by the Harvard Radcliffe

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.800
Class of 1973, through the
Benazir Bhutto leadership

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.760
program.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.250
So let me extend a
special thanks to them.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.210
I'm also happy to welcome all
the members of the Harvard

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.690
Radcliffe classes of 1973, 1978,
and 1988, who are celebrating

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.420
reunions this week.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.960
I'm also grateful to the members
of the Radcliffe Institute

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.470
Leadership Society, and all
our dedicated annual donors.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.810
Thank you.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.940
This afternoon, we
have the pleasure

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.630
of hearing from NPR
international correspondent,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.140
Ofeibea Quist-Arcton,
live and in person,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.505
rather than over the radio.

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:24.734
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.090
The title of Ofeibea's lecture
is both a statement of fact

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.400
and a call to action.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.830
The voices of African women
and girls matter deeply,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.450
and far too often,
they go unheard.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.120
But it's not just the women
and girls' voices that are

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.940
excluded.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.390
It's also what we
find in their place

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.820
that we need to worry about.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.940
It's not a coincidence that
we're often presented with,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.270
and sometimes too
easily persuaded by,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.140
a distorted view of
the African continent.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.220
A view that's narrowly focused
on conflict, corruption,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.990
and disease.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.950
A view that's devoid of
the nuance and complexity

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.320
we expect in other contexts.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.330
And a view that's
frequently just plain wrong.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.760
In 2015, President Barack
Obama visited Nairobi, Kenya

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.960
to co-host a summit on
global entrepreneurship.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.410
The choice of location
wasn't an accident.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.010
Nairobi was then,
and is now, a hub

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.220
of entrepreneurial
innovation in East Africa.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.590
And it boasts an
inspiring community

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.110
of women entrepreneurs.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.230
Yet, one prominent news
network covered the visit

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.010
under the banner headline,
Obama's trip to Kenya--

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.040
a Terror Hotbed.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.490
The article itself
wasn't much better.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.060
Tired and damaging cliches
about the African continent

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.420
are not limited
to the news media.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.900
During the 2014 World
Cup, an American airline

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.110
tweeted their congratulations
to the US team

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.830
for its win over Ghana.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.080
The airline represented
the United States

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.950
with the Statue of Liberty,
an iconic national symbol

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.640
and a representation
of universal freedom.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.610
For Ghana, a West
African democracy

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.060
with a population larger
than Australia's, they

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.590
used a giraffe.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.260
The first problem is that
Ghana doesn't have giraffes--

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.502
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.420
--a fact that the Twitterverse
was quick to point out.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.710
But we also should
ask ourselves,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.680
what it is in our discourse
that would lead a marketing

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.330
team to turn to any stock
image of a wild animal

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.110
to represent an African country?

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.140
These kinds of
characterizations both reflect

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.870
and fuel widespread
misperceptions

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.030
about the African
continent, which

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.890
is home to over 1.2 billion
people across 54 countries,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.740
including 14 that achieved
economic growth rates above 5%

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.760
last year.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.630
It's the work of dedicated,
thoughtful journalists

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.080
like Ofeibea
Quist-Arcton that disrupt

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.430
this pattern by focusing on the
important, nuanced stories that

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.490
often go uncovered, and by
amplifying the voices of women,

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.810
girls, and others we're
least likely to hear,

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.770
whether due to oversight,
unconscious bias,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.920
or overt discrimination.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.910
Ofeibea's is a familiar
and a trusted voice,

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.870
and one that many of us
will immediately recognize.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.740
She neither forgoes complexity
for clarity, nor clarity

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.770
for complexity.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.970
As NPR's Africa
reporter, Ofeibea

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.630
covers social and political
developments, the arts,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.840
culture, technology,
and so much more.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.910
The breadth of her knowledge
and of her work is exceptional.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.090
And a consistent thread
in Ofeibea's reporting

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.000
is the foregrounding of
lesser-known stories,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.540
and those of women and girls.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.010
Ofeibea received the 2015
Edward R Murrow award

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.860
for outstanding contributions
to public radio,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.070
including her coverage of
Boko Haram's kidnapping

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.520
and exploitation of girls,
which has continued long

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.300
after the international
spotlight dimmed.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.390
She also was a part of
the team of NPR reporters

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.570
who received a
2014 Peabody Award

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.130
for their coverage of the
Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.740
Before joining NPR, Ofeibea
reported for the BBC

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.180
on flagship programs in
radio and television,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.010
and covered 24 countries, as
head of the BBC's West Africa

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.150
bureau.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.990
She also had a stint here in
Cambridge as a roving North

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.350
American reporter for
Public Radio International's

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.756
The World.

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:17.750
I'll welcome Ofeibea to
the stage in just a moment.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.390
After the lecture, she'll
be joined in conversation

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.160
by another award-winning
journalist, Marco Werman, who

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.680
began his radio
career in West Africa

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.160
and has hosted The
World since 2013.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.390
Five times a week,
Marco brings world news

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.620
into our homes, our
cars, and our earbuds

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.860
of Public Radio listeners across
the United States and Canada.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.540
Like Ofeibea, he's committed
to amplifying less-heard voices

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.190
and little-known stories.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.960
I'm so glad Marco is
here with us, too.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.210
Now, please join me in
welcoming Ofeibea Quist-Arcton.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.532
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.020
- Good evening, friends.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.738
Why didn't you talk to the
weather gods on my behalf?

00:07:28.738 --> 00:07:29.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.270
Greetings.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.410
Greetings from West Africa, from
Dakar, where I'm based from,

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.290
Ghana, where I come from,
from the whole continent.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.320
That is such a
spectacular continent.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.550
Thank you very much, Tomiko.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.710
What a wonderful,
wonderful welcome for us.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.890
And it's super to be
back here in Cambridge,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.660
where I spent a couple of years
and learnt all sorts of snowy

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.520
language, like a sprinkling
of snow, and digging out.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.940
I haven't forgotten, but I don't
miss the snow and the cold.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.010
Thanks, all, for
coming this evening.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.990
Wonderful to see you.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:10.170
Yes, African women,
African girls--

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.030
what they have to
say is important,

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.380
but we don't hear enough of it.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.560
And I blame myself
amongst reporters

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:23.860
for not reporting enough
about these important views.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.800
Women hold up half the sky.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.230
I believe that's what
Mao Zedong once said.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.970
And it's so true.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.020
So true.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.970
Yet, too often, women
still do not get their due.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.760
And that's the world over.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.030
Africa-- the continent I come
from and where I report from--

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.179
is no exception.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.540
We're working on it.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.890
When Congolese gynecologist
surgeon Dr. Denis Mukwege,

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.760
was announced with fellow
Yazidi activist Nadia

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.650
Morad as the latest co-recipient
of the Nobel Peace Prize,

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.070
at last, a week ago,
it was heartening

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.840
to see dozens of
women and young girls

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.600
cheering and ululating outside
his Panzi Hospital in Bukavu

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.070
in eastern Congo.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.930
Dr. Mukwege-- who has literally
surgically been fixing,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:25.450
for 20-plus years, women's
vaginas after they've survived

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.740
sexual violence, rape and
fistula complications--

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.100
was conducting his second
operation of the day

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.580
when the news filtered through
that the Nobel Committee had

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.350
chosen him as a co-laureate
of the annual Peace Prize.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.440
The women, especially
of eastern Congo,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.360
immediately owned that honor
along with Dr. Mukwege.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.750
Dr. Miracle, Dr.
Miracle, they call him.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.490
The man who has, through
reconstructive surgery,

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:03.670
stitched and repaired the damage
inflicted on women and girls

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:09.040
who have been sexually violated
by rival armed men in conflicts

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.620
in the phenomenon now dubbed
rape as a weapon of war.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.580
Damage to their bodies
and their psyche.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.960
These women feel now that
their pain, their suffering,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.590
and their troubles are
being acknowledged and taken

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.430
seriously.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.540
So in a perverse
sort of way, perhaps

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.380
they have triumphed with
this Nobel endorsement

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.870
of the work of Dr.
Mukwege and his team,

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.160
as well as a myriad women
supporters, survivors,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.620
of sexual violence, and others.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.720
There are, no doubt, some of the
same Congolese women who gather

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.070
together their meager resources
in a potentially wealthy

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.420
but pitifully poor country,
where the coltan used

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.320
to manufacture the smartphone--
which is perhaps in your pocket

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.300
right now-- where it's mined--

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.610
they paid for a plane
ticket to bring home Dr.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.260
Mukwege from overseas,
where he had taken refuge

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.670
from eastern Congo.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.270
That was after he was
driven into exile by threats

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.940
to his family and to him.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.740
He was forced to stop his work
as a gynecologist and outspoken

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.810
campaigner for women's rights.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.440
The women wanted Dr.
Miracle back home

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.730
to continue his hugely
important surgical work

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.750
and his unswerving,
unwavering support,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.870
and they made it happen,
through their solidarity,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:46.700
their determination, and,
yes, their love and admiration

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.330
for him.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.900
I mention the women and girls
of Bukavu in eastern Congo

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:58.920
because these are the very
people I look for and seek out

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.070
when I'm reporting in Africa.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:06.240
And we don't hear enough
about or from them.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.720
So you've got to cut through
the lines of eager young men who

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.640
zoom up to your microphone--

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.810
all with their views, opinions,
grievances, and, of course,

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.380
their aspirations.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.500
Of course their views matter.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.330
I'm not saying they don't.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.270
But push back the masses.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.830
Part those clamoring to talk
and dominate the conversation.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.610
Walk through the crowds
beyond the thrusting youth,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.450
to the back.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.310
And that's where you'll find
the women in the compound,

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.250
or behind the pots
and market stalls,

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.080
with babies strapped to their
backs, with colorful cloth,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.000
and husbands to keep happy.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.500
They're busy.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.550
They have to work, and they
have families to provide for.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.280
They don't have time to go
rushing up to reporters.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.840
But they know what's going on.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.500
They're not just talking,
or seeking out journalists.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.220
They're listening, and
assessing, and monitoring.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.120
Make the effort to find
these women, and sometimes

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.780
younger women and girls
too, because they, too,

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.190
have a story to tell.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.880
Give them time,
spend time with them,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.710
and it may well be a different
story you'll find to the one

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.850
the young men rushed to share
with you in the first flush

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.110
of reporting.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.100
You must make the effort
to find these other voices.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.960
It's what I try to do.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.790
Like Dr. Mukwege's mainly
women patients and supporters,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.180
you can sometimes be
surprised, astonished,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.160
by what they have to tell you.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.740
This year's Nobel
Peace Prize winners,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.230
as a dear friend
puts it, reminds us

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.420
of women throughout
the ages who've

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:03.110
been used as ways of
punishing men and communities.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.230
Or, used for victory
celebrations as the trophies

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.060
of marauding men.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.520
Let me give you one
example-- nine years ago,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.690
we rushed to Guinea--

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.110
Guinea Conakry-- on
the West African coast.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.110
After hearing that human
rights and peace campaigners,

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.510
including many
women, had gathered

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.380
in the national stadium
in the capital Conakry,

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.680
they had come under
a hail of gunfire

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:35.190
by soldiers trying to stop them
gathering and demonstrating.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.530
This happened under
the short-lived watch

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.360
of the military leader
Captain Moussa Dadis Camara.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.470
What later emerged was, as
one doctor told journalists,

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.500
her voice trembling,
a view echoed

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.860
by many, many other
Guineans we spoke to--

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.950
C'est du jamais vu.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.240
This is unheard of in Guinea.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.770
Unprecedented.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:04.910
Never before have we witnessed
such brutal acts, she told.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:11.600
The doctor said, I have never
seen such violence in my life.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.180
This is the first
time we have witnessed

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.170
women's bodies being treated
like battlefields in Guinea.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.220
It goes against our
culture and traditions.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.920
I am horrified.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.300
Familiar reports spoke of men
in uniform reeking of alcohol,

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.940
and high on other substances.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.600
Whether they were hired guns,
homemade presidential red

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.740
berries, or rogue soldiers,
as Dadis, the unelected head

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.020
of state, would have
us believe, they

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.260
were armed and
looking for trouble.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.730
Women protesters became
their target that day.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.550
The shocking trend
of sexual assault

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.820
on women by uniformed
men wielding power

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.460
had landed in
Guinea that Monday.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.160
There were horrifying
reports of soldiers

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.480
using rifle butts, even
bayonets, to rape women,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.570
while other women,
stripped of their clothing

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.700
and their dignity, were
violated, humiliated, raped,

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.580
right there in the stadium by
the security forces, brazenly

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.060
and brutally, in broad daylight.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.970
But when I look back to my
reporting of the troubles

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.560
in Guinea, which had political
problems, and still have,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.800
I remembered the
fearless, diminutive

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.030
in size, and the giant in
courage, trade union leader,

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.950
labor leader Hajah
Rabiatou Serah

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.990
Diallo, With her quiet
authority and steely gaze

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.560
staring down soldiers
sent to intimidate her

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.990
and other rights and
labor campaigners,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.970
she courageously led marches
demanding sweeping government

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.150
reforms, and the military
back to barracks,

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.330
insisting there could
be no dialogue in Guinea

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.460
until the state of siege, as
she called it, was lifted.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.790
Hajah Rabiatou warned that the
army, with its unlimited powers

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.490
of search and detention,
was perpetrating

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:19.319
all manner of evil, committed
under the cover of darkness,

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:23.730
and that individuals were using
this time to rob others, rape

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.280
women, and commit
other atrocities.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.590
It has to stop, she pleaded.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.010
This is really very
serious indeed.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.070
Another woman leading the way.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.640
A year later, in 2009,
it was in this climate

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.630
of fear, intimidation,
and repression described

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.840
by Haja Rabiatou that
women in Guinea's capital

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.390
were raped, robbed,
and sexually assaulted

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.410
with guns by soldiers.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.790
This is where, as a reporter,
you cannot simply jet

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.790
in and, after being parachuted
in for, say, 48 hours,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.040
do the story, cover
the fallout, fly out.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.650
And I thank NPR
for allowing us--

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.800
NPR's reporters-- the
time and the space

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.870
to be able to report
stories deeply and fully.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.320
It's so important.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.790
So I had to find out more.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.990
Who were these women who had
left their homes in the morning

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.720
to attend a protest
march starting

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.160
at Conakry Stadium on a Monday?

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.120
I'm not a full-time
investigative journalist.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.060
I'm a jobbing journalist.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.840
An all-purpose Africa
reporter, I describe myself as.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.050
I will try to turn
my hand to any story.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.620
You'll find me in
open-air markets,

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.680
which I love, talking
to the women who

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.090
make Africa's
economies tick, and who

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.910
are, for me, the real barometer
of a nation and a continent.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.260
Market women in Africa are like
taxi drivers here in the West--

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.060
they know what's
going on and have

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:04.160
an informed opinion on almost
everything that matters.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.680
I certainly listen to them.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.090
They're full of advice
and timely guidance.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.412
And everybody who knows Ofeibea
knows, I'm a bit of a shopper.

00:19:12.412 --> 00:19:13.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.170
Nowhere better than the
market, exchanging everything

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.140
from compliments about
a Nigerian batik,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.500
as I'm wearing tonight, or
Senegalese or Ghanian woven

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.580
fabric, or Ghanian colorful
kente I might be wearing,

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.400
or her printed wax
cloth, or sometimes

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.940
spontaneously exchanging gifts.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.390
I love jewelry.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.240
I love it chunky.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.780
And it's wonderful
to be able to share

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:47.950
a love of Africa's beauty, be it
a design or a creative fabric.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.770
In South Africa,
they call it ubuntu--

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.260
a shared humanity.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.770
And sharing something
beyond measure,

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.740
but it's an exchange
that can suddenly

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.910
make what might have been
a tricky interview doable.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.900
Why?

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.780
Because you found a link that
you have in common, and you're

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.330
away.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:14.290
I can also be found on the
front line reporting conflicts,

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.020
or in the boardroom, talking
to the continent's women

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.220
movers and shakers, creators,
innovators, and inventors,

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.347
or, in educational institutions,
urban and village settings.

00:20:26.347 --> 00:20:27.430
I'll give everything a go.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.060
Why not?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.480
You'll find me in creative
spaces or sacred places,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.140
listening to women, and
girls, and men, and boys,

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.090
talk to us reporters.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.090
Talk to each other
and to many others

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:45.550
about their communities, the
continent, the world, and what

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.090
matters to them.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.930
I think, to be a
good reporter, you've

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.490
got to be a good listener.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:58.600
But sometimes, as in Guinea
in 2009, it isn't so simple.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.790
The horror of the
shocking attacks

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.480
on women who were raped
in the open by soldiers

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.040
affected the entire nation,
but that was not the end.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.810
A number of women, some of whom
I later found and spoke to,

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.690
were marched off to
a villa somewhere,

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.880
and the horror continued.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.490
It took time to
find these women,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.620
going through an
intermediary who

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.890
was herself terrified
that she would

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.680
be discovered and punished.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.260
Eventually, I met
some of the women

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.680
in a small room in a
safe house in Guinea,

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.600
which is a country where it
is totally shameful to talk

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.500
about taboo subjects such
as rape or sexual violence.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.470
So these women have not been
able to discuss their ordeal

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.850
with even family members,
or they were too frightened

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:02.220
to even consult doctors,
yet they had been raped.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.190
One woman, a gently-spoken
professional,

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.870
told me she was praying she
hadn't been infected with HIV,

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.420
or wasn't pregnant,
after the hell she'd

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.000
endured once they were
taken away from the stadium.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.450
She described how the
soldiers had driven them

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.180
to a villa where
they were drugged

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.520
and didn't know where they were.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.130
She hadn't been able
to discuss all this

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.660
with her sister, her husband,
or any family member or friend.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.730
Why?

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.545
I asked.

00:22:32.545 --> 00:22:35.220
Out of shame, she replied.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.150
She only managed to escape when
a soldier walked into the room,

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.210
probably to join in, she said.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.100
Only to realize
that he knew her.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.270
He got her out.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.960
The courage of these
women to share their hell

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.750
with a journalist like me--

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.230
someone they did not know
and had never met before--

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:04.380
was, for me, proof of immense
and immeasurable bravery.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.920
To tell others that this
was happening in Guinea,

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.490
where the rule of law
had been jettisoned,

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:19.020
abandoned, and they felt their
nation and the world must know.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.760
I know we journalists
stand accused

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:26.220
of focusing far too much on
conflict, disease, poverty--

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.375
the negatives about Africa
that Tomiko mentioned.

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:33.860
Mea maxima culpa.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.240
I agree.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.820
But we have to tell Africa's
truth, good and bad.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.460
Pretty and sad.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.490
Ugly and enriching.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:51.230
And women are often the
holders of these truths.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.860
Of course, there are many,
many, many positive stories--

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.910
powerful, influential,
inspiring, strong, creative,

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:04.850
resourceful, resilient,
charming, compassionate,

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.690
fabulous African women
and girls abound.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.800
African crown jewels,
they are treasures.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.550
And they're taking the
world by storm, all quietly,

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.330
getting things done and making
a difference and a change

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.590
to the lives of girls,
women, boys, and men.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.060
Girls are coding, and they're
loving it, and building

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.420
smartphone apps that help
reunite children who've got

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.930
lost, reuniting them
with their families.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:40.830
Women innovators in Africa are
making a difference 24/7, be it

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.680
in technology, the arts,
music, literature, publishing.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.430
They're setting up bespoke
chocolate enterprises

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.910
on the continent, where
most of the world's cocoa,

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.480
probably used to make
your favorite choccy bar,

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.050
is produced.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.460
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana,
are some examples.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.090
They're doing even more.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.800
Take the 2011 Nobel
Peace joint winners,

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.860
Africa's first elected
female president,

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.270
Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf from Liberia,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.870
and her compatriot,
Leymah Gbowee,

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.010
who led the Women in White
protest campaign and marches

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:23.000
during Liberia's
protracted civil war.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.280
Civil wars, In fact.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.230
Or another Nobel Peace laureate,
the late Kenyan environmental

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.230
and political activist
Wangari Maathai,

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.685
who campaigned tirelessly for
a better Kenya and Africa.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.610
Then there are the names
you may not know so well--

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:48.390
national treasures
like Hauwa Magaji,

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.050
a psychosocial councilor
from northeast Nigeria.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:56.930
She comes from Chibok, a town
you've probably heard of,

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.750
where the mass abduction
of nearly 300 schoolgirls

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:06.650
by the extremist group Boko
Haram happened back in 2014.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.980
Hauwa Magaji moved from
Chibok to Maiduguri,

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.350
the regional hub
in the northeast,

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.260
to help young girls and women--

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.470
many barely in their
teens at the time

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.130
they were captured and sexually
enslaved by Boko Haram--

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.310
to help them reintegrate
into society.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:30.530
Many of these women
and young, young teens

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.170
are being rejected
or marginalized

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.300
by their families
and communities

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.780
when they return with babies
fathered by Boko Haram

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.680
fighters.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.220
Their babies are dubbed
Boko Haram babies,

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.510
and they Boko Haram wives.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:51.620
Talking of Chibok, in my
almost 35 years as a reporter,

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.130
one of the most
uplifting assignments

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.040
I can remember to
date was covering

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.790
students who were abducted from
their girls' boarding school

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.900
dorms in Chibok, reuniting
with their families in Abuja,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.030
Nigeria last year.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.850
Here's one such photo.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:15.630
Not half an hour earlier, we
were trying to comfort her.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.660
She couldn't find her parents.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.680
So many of the other young
women who had been released

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.570
were hugging and crying.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.060
She said, my parents are dead.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.300
My parents are--
she was hysterical,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.665
thinking that her
parents were dead.

00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:35.540
They said to her, no.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.690
They've just had a
problem with the car.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.710
They're on their way.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.830
They're on their way.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.680
And when she saw her parents,
she sank to the ground,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.060
weeping.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.440
And half an hour later, there
she was with her friends.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.440
They were singing and dancing.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.910
Look at her.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:59.320
It was an extraordinary,
extraordinary event,

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.140
watching this reunion.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.750
Sometimes, as a reporter,
love is on your side,

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:09.320
and you're in the right
place at the right time.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.450
I was lucky that day.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.480
Happened to be in
Abuja and to cover

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:19.420
this remarkable, remarkable
story of families

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.950
who had been through pain,
the agony of separation.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.920
It ended there, the tears.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:31.390
Fathers, mothers, daughters,
hugging and weeping,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.520
and weeping and hugging.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.130
There was barely a
dry eye, me included.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.920
After three years with
barely any contact,

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.090
families were reunited in
relief and thanksgiving.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.640
The joy was palpable.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.780
Everyone present felt blessed.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.160
But spare a thought
for Leah Sharibu, who

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.350
was 15 when she was abducted
from Dapchi Girls' Technical

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.990
College in northeast
Nigeria earlier this year.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:07.690
Dozens of her fellow students
were bundled off by Boko Haram.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.370
President Muhammadu
Buhari's government

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:14.090
negotiated an early release
of most of the abducted girls,

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.020
but we are told that
Leah Sharibu, the only

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:22.120
Christian among mainly
Muslim girls kidnapped,

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.210
refused to renounce
Christianity.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:29.720
While the others have been
released, Leah has not.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.960
When we traveled to Dapchi
on assignment in March,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.570
we met Leah's mother Rebecca.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.850
We only found out
that her daughter

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.640
had been abducted in
Dapchi when we sat down

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.450
on a mat in the dusty square
in front of the emir's palace

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.580
with a group of
women and mothers

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.490
from the community
to find out more.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.460
Leah is still missing.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:57.770
So my advice is, take
the time to talk.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.350
You will make contacts
that may prove

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:04.430
to be invaluable, as in this
case of the Sharibu family.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.850
We've kept in touch with
Mr. And Mrs. Sharibu.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.980
Just last week, the
Nigerian president

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.580
called up Leah's
mother to again pledge

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.690
that he will do all he can to
bring her daughter back safely

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.390
from Boko Haram captivity.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.870
Working your
contacts is crucial,

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.620
but it makes such
a difference when

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.840
you have met the
person with whom

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.580
you're talking about
sensitive, painful, often

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.615
difficult topics.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.290
This portrait of reporting
on women and girls in Africa

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.420
is somewhat scattershot.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.910
I've picked on some
of the examples that

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.670
have stayed with
me of why I find

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.750
it's critical to reflect the
importance of women and girls

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.010
in Africa.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.690
I guess I gravitate
towards them,

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.590
because there are so
many untold stories,

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.560
perhaps because
we, the reporters,

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.830
don't dig deep enough.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.190
A couple of years ago, I
met documentary photographer

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.610
and chronicler Fati
Abubakar in Maiduguri,

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:16.210
the birthplace of Boko Haram,
and the capital of Borno State

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.530
in northeast Nigeria.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.670
She trained as a nurse
and worked as a nurse.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:25.240
Fati said she was frustrated
and fed up with out

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.770
of towners like me--

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.570
I didn't take it
personally, though--

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:33.160
painting such a negative
picture of her home state

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.220
and its ties with
the extremist group.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.870
So she set up on Instagram,
and Twitter, and Facebook,

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.590
and posts extraordinary
portraits of Borno

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.560
under the hashtag bits of Borno.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.620
She photographs random
people, children.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.120
She says they make her smile.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.140
Women, men, you name it.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.580
Fati Abubakar is
determined to give us

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.220
a rounded picture
of Borno that she

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.850
says the local and
international media

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:08.830
neglect, choosing to focus on
bomb blasts, suicide attacks,

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.110
death, and destruction.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.210
It's wonderful to
watch Fati at work.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:20.710
She's dainty, and wears long,
colorful, elegant dresses,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.770
with her camera slung
over her shoulder,

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:28.320
squatting and leaning
perilously close to the railing

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.530
separating her and the road
from a three-foot plunge

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:33.970
into a trash dump.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:35.260
She's inspiring.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.640
She doesn't seem to see it.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.680
She just bends down
her skirts in the dust,

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.496
and, snap, snap, snap, snap.

00:32:43.496 --> 00:32:44.662
Then out comes her notebook.

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:46.630
Note, note, note, note.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.480
And then she posts these
extraordinary pictures.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.270
Hashtag bits of Borno.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.140
Look her up.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.020
Let me conclude with an
assignment in South Africa

00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.370
in April this year that
could have been sorrowful

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:03.670
if it hadn't been
such a celebration

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:07.150
of the remarkable life of
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:12.220
Mourners, female and
male, adults and children,

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:17.030
were everywhere, and
they were weeping openly.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:23.690
In many ways, the Winnie story
crystallizes precisely why

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:28.280
the voices of women
and girls matter.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.860
It was extraordinary to witness,
on the ground after she died,

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:39.950
the full impact and effect of
her influence and inspiration

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.390
over the years.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.900
Women and girls-- especially
black, South African,

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.640
young women and girls--

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.040
just burst forth with
grief and gratitude,

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.750
thanking Winnie Mandela for
her enormous contribution

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.570
to the struggle for
freedom in South Africa,

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.450
despite the negatives
and the lows in her life.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.950
And there were many.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.670
Almost every girl
and woman I spoke to

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:12.560
talked about what Winnie
Mandela meant to them.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:18.139
They said they now understood
what it is to be a woman

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.360
in South Africa-- in Africa--

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.620
living in a mainly,
predominantly patriarchal

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.429
society.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.600
Movements mushroomed.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.969
And especially
for younger women,

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.060
the passing of Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela spurred

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.250
the mantra, she didn't die.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.130
She multiplied.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:42.150
They donned dhukus,
head wraps, as they're

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.870
called in South Africa,
that Madikizela-Mandela

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.350
made her trademark and
joined the hashtag,

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.350
I am Winnie, movement.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.710
Wearing a fetching and
simple Winnie-style head tie

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:59.430
when I met her outside Mrs.
Madikizela-Mandela's Soweto

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.510
home, a 22-year-old
student, Neo Ngcobo,

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.960
said she had joined the
flourishing, unofficial

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.250
movements.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.110
My Ma Winnie didn't die.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:15.370
She did indeed
multiply, said Neo,

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.360
adding, because what
she left us with

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.910
is the spirit to fight for what
we want as women, especially

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.526
as young women.

00:35:26.526 --> 00:35:30.940
Neo said there were many
challenges facing young South

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.610
Africans, but that
Winnie Mandela had

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:37.450
given all young
women the inspiration

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:42.130
to get up and fight for what
they really want in life.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:46.580
Women empowerment, she said,
and lifting each other up.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:52.430
This, said Neo, is exactly what
we mean by, she did not die.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.410
She multiplied.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:58.160
Neo's shy, 10-year-old
sister, Andisiwe,

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.830
was also proudly
wearing a Winnie dhuku,

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:04.700
and said she, too, was inspired
as a South African girl,

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.910
adding, I respect and love her.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.100
Rest in peace, Mama.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:18.290
And the incredibly
articulate 22-year-old Neo--

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:22.790
I mean, it just summed
up what the feeling

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:26.690
in South Africa in Johannesburg
during Winnie Mandela's

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.390
funeral, and that period.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:33.110
Young women were
standing up and saying,

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.000
our voices must be heard.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.360
And then you have this
10-year-old also adding

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.310
her contribution.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.980
In a eulogy to her mother
during her funeral,

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.040
Winnie Mandela's daughter
Zenani Mandela-Dlamini

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.940
made a point of thanking young
South Africans, especially

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.090
young women,
saying, as a family,

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:58.010
they had watched in awe as
young women stood up and took

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:02.300
a stand of deep solidarity
with their mother, who

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.710
had been judged, she said,
by much harsher standards

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.400
than her male counterparts.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.620
A dear South African friend,
the BBC's Audrey Brown,

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.780
with whom I covered
Winnie Mandela's funeral,

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.530
put it this way.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:20.630
She said, an understanding
of how "Wee-nee,"

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.980
as they call her there, was
terrorized as a woman alone--

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.840
a young woman alone--

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.690
and slandered as a
beautiful woman--

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:36.850
came roaring out of the grief
people felt at her passing.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:41.080
There's something pretty
special about witnessing history

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.090
and reporting it.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:47.560
And there's something equally
special about recording

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:52.610
what women and girls
have to say about it all.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.650
I guess that's why
I do the job I do.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.290
It's an honor and a privilege.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.790
Thank you.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:59.266
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:18.454 --> 00:38:20.414
- Thank you, sir.

00:38:20.414 --> 00:38:20.914
Good.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.261
Thank you.

00:38:29.261 --> 00:38:29.760
- Thank you.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.090
- Wonderful comments,
inspiring and wise.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.140
Thank you, Ofeibea.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.880
And thank you to the
Radcliffe Institute

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.340
for giving me the
honor and the pleasure

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.252
to speak with, honestly,
an old dear friend, and one

00:38:44.252 --> 00:38:45.960
of my favorite people
in the whole world.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.180
And I mean that from
the bottom of my heart.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.620
So we've known each
other a long time.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.240
I want to get
personal in a second,

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.239
but I just want to pick
up on a couple of things

00:38:57.239 --> 00:39:02.320
that you said in your talk.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.460
The women in Guinea
that you spoke with--

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:10.230
I mean, there are very few
people who can go in a room

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.910
and sit down with
women who've been

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.130
through that kind of trauma--

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:17.220
with anybody who's been
through that kind of trauma--

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.549
and get them to open up.

00:39:19.549 --> 00:39:21.090
You talked about
their courage, but I

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.092
think, especially in this
day and age, when journalists

00:39:24.092 --> 00:39:26.550
are not really appreciated by
governments around the world,

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.700
it takes a lot of courage to,
A, go in to speak with them--

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:37.370
but also, I want to know how you
kind of frame your own attitude

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.440
and your own psyche.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.570
Because not everybody
can go in that room

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.970
and get the kind of
responses that you get.

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:48.980
So what is it about you,
Ofeibea, that allows people--

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.962
these women, these girls--

00:39:50.962 --> 00:39:53.420
who've been through so much--
traumatized to the point that

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.270
life itself seems futile--

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.650
what do you do?

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.290
What do you say to
get them to open up?

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.240
And what is it about you
that makes them talk?

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.250
- Well one thing
you don't do is,

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.150
you don't breeze in and
say, I've got 10 minutes.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.230
Cough up.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.116
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:11.116 --> 00:40:14.940
No, I mean, this is why I say,
you've really got to take time.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.770
Before I met the women--

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.440
before I met them
to interview them--

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.570
I had been there a few hours.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.580
I had been there the day before.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.110
People have got to
get used to you.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.990
They don't know you.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.500
What do they know?

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.630
They don't know what
you're going to be saying.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.530
So you know, Marco, I
met some of the students

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:40.190
from the colleges at lunchtime.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.550
And I said, I think the
most important thing is,

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:49.390
you've got to show compassion.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.770
You've got to show compassion.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:55.000
If you're only interested in
these women, or girls, or men,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.027
or boys, because of the
story you're going to get,

00:41:00.027 --> 00:41:01.110
they may not speak to you.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.300
People are instinctive.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.000
They know if you're
only coming for a story,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.700
or if you really care about
what they have been through.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:15.580
So some people weren't able
to give their full story.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.020
There was one woman who
talked in the third person.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:22.970
She was in the
stadium, and she talked

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:28.520
as if she had seen someone
else being violated and raped.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:34.130
And the go between who helped
me set up these interviews later

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:38.800
said to me, she was actually
talking about herself.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:44.524
But she's so ashamed
about this taboo,

00:41:44.524 --> 00:41:45.940
and there were
other women around.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.510
She didn't want them to
know she had been raped.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:53.500
If you don't empathize,
what's the point?

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.190
Somebody said to me, well,
don't you get empathy fatigue?

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.410
I said, the day I
have empathy fatigue,

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.390
I stop being a reporter.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.020
- I mean, that's a great
bar to hold up, but, I mean,

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.140
so much of journalism is about
competition, and getting it

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.920
first, but getting it
right, but getting it first.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.380
Nobody talks about, get
it first, get it right,

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.850
and be compassionate and
empathetic along the way.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.527
So how many people--

00:42:20.527 --> 00:42:21.860
how many journalists in Africa--

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.120
have all those qualities?

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.030
- Oh my god.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:29.630
I think you have a lot of
compassionate journalists,

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.720
but you also have those who
just go for the jugular.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.190
And they're not
really interested.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:38.800
And I think it maybe
shows in the reporting.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.840
They may get stock answers.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.140
They may get answers
that you might expect.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.547
But if you give people time
to get to know you a little--

00:42:46.547 --> 00:42:48.880
and I'm not saying they're
going to know me for a month,

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.950
or three months, no--

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:54.260
but even for a full
day or a week--

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.512
people get a bit
more comfortable.

00:42:56.512 --> 00:42:58.220
And then they feel
that they can tell you

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.980
more because, hopefully,
they trust you a little.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.540
It's so important.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.600
I put myself in their positions.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.290
Would I talk to
somebody I didn't know?

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:10.470
If it was Marco, and I knew
him, I would feel confident.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.260
But somebody who comes
out of nowhere asking you

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.280
such personal questions?

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.580
I think we owe it
to those people who

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:25.320
are sharing such intimate
and difficult details with us

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.022
to give them that compassion.

00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:28.730
- I mean, I know it's
no problem for you,

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.740
when you go to the
back of the mob

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.490
and you find the women
in the marketplace.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:33.520
I mean, I've seen
you in the field.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.620
I've seen you in action.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.570
You're just a natural.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:38.630
I mean, you are one of them.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.370
Do you see it that way?

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:43.740
- Of course I am, because
I'm an African woman.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.140
But I think more
importantly, I mean,

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.480
you can do all the
reporting from here

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.970
with the people
in the front row.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:55.360
But what about
those at the back?

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.320
If you only interview
people in the front row,

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.620
you'll get front row
comments the whole time.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.870
But if you dig a bit
deeper and go to--

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.970
you'll see people that you
wouldn't, perhaps, even

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:11.520
expect to be listening
to what's going on,

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.380
because they're busy, as I said.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.860
But they're there.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.020
And sometimes you say hello.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:17.790
You sit down.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.970
You ask after their
family and their children.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:21.995
And, boop!

00:44:21.995 --> 00:44:23.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:24.585 --> 00:44:25.960
Maybe, they say,
this is somebody

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.810
who's actually interested
in me, and in my life,

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.530
and in my family.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.110
- So you brought up the fact
that the Nobel Peace Prize

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.010
this week went to Dr. Denis
Mukwege and to Nadia Morad,

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:43.560
for their work fighting
rape as a weapon of war.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.740
And in Dr. Mukwege's case--

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.480
Dr. Miracle-- I mean, his
ability, not only as a surgeon,

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.800
but also to bring these women
back around from trauma--

00:44:56.979 --> 00:44:58.520
Your talk was about
women, but I want

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.200
to know about men in Africa.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:05.750
And how many men are looking at
somebody like Dr. Denis Mukwege

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.730
and are saying, I
want to be like him.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.740
I want to be a
better man for women.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.570
How many men do
you find in Africa

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.460
who are leaning
in that direction?

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.467
I know this is a
massive generalization.

00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:20.050
I know you don't
like generalizations.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.320
I'm going to put you
on the spot anyway.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:21.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.360
Where do men stand on this?

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.130
And how are men changing?

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.560
- The rapists see him
as a threat, and not

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.120
just the rapists--

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.980
the government of Congo.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.960
They don't like Denis Mukwege.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.740
He had to hotfoot it out
of eastern Congo because

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.500
of threats on his life,
and the life of his family.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.720
His bodyguard was killed.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.210
- But was that because
he was essentially

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.867
trying a sop against
fighters in the military?

00:45:47.867 --> 00:45:48.950
And they didn't like that?

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:52.138
Or because he was
focusing on helping women?

00:45:52.138 --> 00:45:54.610
- Both.

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:55.440
Both.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.986
Of course there are men
who sympathize, many men.

00:45:58.986 --> 00:46:00.360
They may not come
out and say it.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.490
And there again,
Marco, maybe that's

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:06.300
for me to go and
find out from them.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.550
What do you think of the
work of Denis Mukwege?

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.250
You feel it enhances
the community?

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.520
Or do you feel that it
brings shame to the community

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.380
that this has happened?

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.880
Of course I speak to men.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.350
I speak to young men.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.500
I speak to older men.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:29.400
I just think that they get more
of a voice in Africa-- in fact,

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.826
all over the world--

00:46:30.826 --> 00:46:31.700
than women and girls.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.510
So I make a special effort to
hear more from women and girls.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.070
But I speak to men.

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:40.205
I speak to them about
difficult subjects.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:47.780
I spoke to men after
the rapes in Guinea.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:53.069
I mean, some of them couldn't
stop the tears from flowing,

00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:54.360
because they witnessed it, too.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.120
It wasn't just women who
saw women being raped.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.550
What do you do
when you can't help

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.820
somebody who is being violated?

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:09.380
You must feel not only helpless,
but, in a way, redundant.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.020
Why couldn't I help?

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:16.360
Why couldn't I grab a
machete or a bayonet,

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.670
and stop the soldiers from
doing what they were doing?

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.270
We do come from
patriarchal societies.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:28.260
So men are expected to protect,
be it a woman, be it children.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.550
So it's a tough call.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.470
- Let's update the
situation in Chibok

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:39.920
just briefly, because
you talked about how

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.890
joyous the celebration was,
the reuniting of these girls

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.420
with their families.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.820
You spoke briefly about
how some of these girls

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:47.660
were being rejected.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.010
Their children that they
birthed after being impregnated

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:55.640
by the Boko Haram militants--
how they're being rejected.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.540
We recently, on the program,
spoke with Adaobi Tricia

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.780
Nwaubani about some of the
girls who are now at university,

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.190
and getting these bourses.

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.450
But they're also having trouble.

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.720
So where does this all go?

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.575
I mean, what does life look like
for these girls in the future?

00:48:12.575 --> 00:48:14.540
- We'll only know in
the future, Marco.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.720
Those who are able to
go back to education,

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.090
at least they will
have an education.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:23.600
And I spoke only briefly,
but I have reported

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.970
at length on young women--

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.910
they're no longer girls,
because they are 18, 19, 20.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:30.410
- Right.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.810
- But if you go back five
years when they were abducted,

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:36.440
they were 13, 14, 15.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.300
Because those who have children
often say that has saved them.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.430
Because, even though
their families,

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:47.600
even though the
community, may reject them

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.490
they have someone to love.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:51.890
And they have
someone to protect.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:55.580
But I don't think they're
under any illusions

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.097
that life is going
to be difficult.

00:48:58.097 --> 00:48:59.930
- Are their social
workers and psychologists

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:01.250
that attend to them?

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:04.190
Because I know a lot of
people that I met in Africa

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.510
rejected talk therapy.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:07.940
But Dr. Mukwege's
experience shows

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:12.472
that it's obviously helpful in
an universal kind of context.

00:49:12.472 --> 00:49:14.430
- Indeed, and Hauwa
Magaji, who I spoke about--

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:14.530
- Right.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:17.030
- --the psychosocial counselor,
who moved from Chibok,

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:19.560
where she comes from--

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.990
these are precisely the
African men and women

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:27.980
who are trying to help
not only the young women

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.200
reintegrate into society, but
the communities to accept them,

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.160
saying, you can't
punish them twice.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.840
They didn't ask to be raped.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.240
They didn't ask to be
abducted by Boko Haram.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.360
Look what they
have been through.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.220
If anything, we the
community should

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:48.850
be welcoming them with open
arms and saying, sorry.

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:51.130
So they're working
with those who

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:53.560
have been affected
and have survived,

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.280
and also with those
who are finding

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.650
it difficult to accept these--

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.160
and not just young women,
sometimes children.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:09.920
Yeah, because they're seen as
being tainted by Boko Haram.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.020
It's tough.

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:13.040
And you have other
organizations,

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.410
like the Neem Foundation.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:19.550
There is a Nigerian psychologist
who trained outside.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:22.760
And she said she got
into psychology because

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.070
of the big cases that
were happening here

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.680
in the US and Britain.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.685
And she was with
the government--

00:50:29.685 --> 00:50:32.060
the previous government, now,
has set up this foundation.

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.080
They're trying.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.410
But it's difficult, because
these are such taboo subjects

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.222
that a lot of people
don't want to touch them.

00:50:39.222 --> 00:50:40.180
- Bring back our girls.

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:40.870
Big hashtag.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:44.210
What about me too, as a
hashtag, as a movement.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.410
What does it mean to
the women and girls

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.020
that you've met
in the last year?

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.360
- Women in urban
areas have caught on,

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.730
because everybody is on
social media except Ofeibea.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:58.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:59.390
- This is true.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.640
It's maddening, but it's true.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.650
- Everybody is on social media.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:09.700
So in a different way, I think
me too has had an effect.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.490
In many African
countries, I think

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:15.610
it has given especially
young women a voice

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.190
to stand up and say, no.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.230
We're not going to
put up with this.

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:22.810
And that really maybe
isn't the African way.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:27.740
You don't challenge your elders
because of the respect factor.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.660
And I think respect is good.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.360
But now, more questions
are being asked.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.725
More pressure is
being put on people

00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:38.240
who use power in this way.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.520
And young people are saying no.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.580
But on the other hand,
you have the phenomenon

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.740
of the sugar daddy--

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:51.500
other names-- who are
financing young women who

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.236
are maybe at university,
or college, or even school.

00:51:55.236 --> 00:51:56.110
- That's very common.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.150
- Finanacing their studies.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:03.490
So it's a real contradiction,
because you have me too.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:06.110
And we stand up for our rights.

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:12.220
But if somebody is paying
your education for sex,

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.570
that's a tough one.

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.460
Unresolved.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.860
- I should say that Ofeibea
and I have known each other

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:24.080
since 1987, and it's not
like you went to Africa

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.230
and carved out this niche of
women and girls for yourself.

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.830
The first time we met was on
the phone a couple of months

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:33.350
after Captain Thomas
Sankara had been killed

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.350
as president of Burkina Faso.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:39.020
And Ofeibea was hosting
Network Africa, the breakfast

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.170
show for the African continent
on the BBC World Service.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:44.570
And I was the AP
stringer in Ouagadougou,

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:47.930
and you wanted to do an
interview on a piece of cloth

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:49.070
that was going around.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:50.690
Les larmes de Mariam.

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:53.370
The tears of Mariam, The
widow of Thomas Sankara.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.560
Mariam Sankara.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.610
And it was a
shocking coup d'etat.

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:00.080
Nobody had ever seen a bloody
coup d'etat in ex Upper

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.304
Volta, Burkina Faso before.

00:53:02.304 --> 00:53:04.220
And so people were really
scared to speak out.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.490
And one of the ways they
spoke out was through cloth.

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:08.327
- Wearing this--

00:53:08.327 --> 00:53:09.410
- This cloth with peppers.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:10.850
- Specially printed cloth.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.059
- Little peppers, and
it looked like tears.

00:53:13.059 --> 00:53:14.600
So it was called
the tears of Miriam.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.641
And that's when we spoke.

00:53:15.641 --> 00:53:18.050
But I want to kind
of pick up there,

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:22.480
because we want to know the
more personal side of Ofeibea.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.332
We know Dakar.

00:53:24.332 --> 00:53:25.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.506
You do it.

00:53:27.506 --> 00:53:28.850
Come on.

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:29.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.720
- Shall I tell you
how that started?

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.300
It was this--

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:38.050
There's Dhaka, Bangladesh.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.374
Then there's Dakar, Senegal.

00:53:40.374 --> 00:53:42.790
Well, people were saying it
as if it was the same capital.

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:43.415
And I said, no.

00:53:43.415 --> 00:53:44.296
Hell no.

00:53:44.296 --> 00:53:45.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:47.227
I'm happy to report
from Dhaka, Bangladesh,

00:53:47.227 --> 00:53:48.310
but that's not where I am.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.741
So I think I started
emphasizing--

00:53:50.741 --> 00:53:51.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.200
And the rest is history.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.590
It's a wonderful city.

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:57.250
Come and visit.

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:57.749
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:57.749 --> 00:53:58.710
Lovely place to live.

00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:59.290
Yeah.

00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:02.462
- So there's the reporter
that we Americans know,

00:54:02.462 --> 00:54:03.920
and then there's
the other Ofeibea.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.470
And I just want to
dive into that Ofeibea

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:06.490
for a couple of minutes.

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:10.190
Because with the exception of my
friends [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:14.530
from college, you were the first
Afropolitan who I'd ever met.

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:17.800
Born in Accra, yes?

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.440
- Oxford.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.940
Born in Oxford,
moved back to Accra.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:20.920
- By coincidence.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.120
- Rome, London-- you're
comfortable in many worlds.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.840
So just tell me about your life.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.490
You're born under this
postcolonial world-- not even,

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.990
barely.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.820
When did you first
get to Africa,

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.560
and how much back and forth did
you do between Accra and Europe

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.060
growing up?

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.689
- Let me just say, for a
start, doesn't matter where

00:54:44.689 --> 00:54:45.980
you're brought up in the world.

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.940
If you've got
Ghanian parents, you

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.860
are going to be
brought up Ghanian.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.110
It didn't matter that
we lived in Rome,

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:55.840
that I was born in Oxford.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.490
There are certain
Ghanian things,

00:54:57.490 --> 00:55:00.270
and you don't
deviate from those.

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.984
And actually, no.

00:55:00.984 --> 00:55:01.900
It's been really good.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:05.500
Because it gives you
roots and an identity,

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.760
which is really important.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.160
So although we've lived
in different places,

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.360
and I've worked in
different places,

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.230
I never have to think
twice if somebody asks me,

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.880
where are you from.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.260
Ghana's back home.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.240
Dhaka is Dhaka base.

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.130
London is other home.

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:23.981
Cambridge is other home.

00:55:23.981 --> 00:55:24.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.660
- But I mean, you were traveling
a lot, though, as a girl.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.699
I mean, to Nairobi.

00:55:28.699 --> 00:55:29.490
All over the place.

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:30.000
- It's true.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.410
But we went to
school in Britain.

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:31.500
- Right.

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.850
- So there was that continuity.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.570
I was born a year after--

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:37.410
I'm 60.

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:37.920
Yeah.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.550
I turned 60 in August.

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:40.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:45.930
So I was born a year after
the end of the colonial rule

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:47.260
in Britain.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.660
And I mean, of
course, I was a baby.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.770
But from the stories we hear,
it was such a happy time,

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:54.420
getting freedom.

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.100
So we then went back home.

00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.790
So I did my nursery
school, would have been.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.450
And then we went
off to live in Rome.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.950
And then--

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:03.200
- Nairobi.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.020
- Your father worked
for forestries--

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:04.790
- My father worked for the UN.

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:05.596
- --under Nkrumah.

00:56:05.596 --> 00:56:06.512
But then went to Rome.

00:56:06.512 --> 00:56:08.990
- He was the first chief
conservator of forests.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:11.480
So I guess that gives
me my love of wood.

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.117
It didn't sort of click for a
long while, but I love wood.

00:56:16.117 --> 00:56:16.700
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.246
- I know we're meant to
be conserving it, but--

00:56:19.246 --> 00:56:20.870
- Especially the
tropical woods, right?

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:21.370
- Yes.

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:22.520
Indeed.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.750
Yeah.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:27.267
But because we were a
family unit wherever.

00:56:27.267 --> 00:56:28.850
It didn't really
matter where we were.

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:32.300
And then going home every two
years to Ghana on home leave

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.090
meant that we caught up--

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:37.470
our late mother was the
eldest of 10 children.

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:40.670
So we're about 50-odd
cousins, give or take,

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:43.070
and we had a grandmother
we all adored.

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:47.840
So all we all wanted to do
was congregate at her home.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:52.730
And Ghana has always
been back home.

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:54.570
Your father was
in public service.

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.830
I know your aunt
[INAUDIBLE] was ambassador

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.600
to Rome, and Paris,
and the Vatican.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.420
Did you ever think
about doing government,

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.970
or some sort of public service,
as opposed to journalism?

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:07.760
- I wanted to be a diplomat.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.210
I thought either
diplomat or interpreter.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.560
When I saw the booths that
the interpreters had to--

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.060
I said, no.

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:14.809
That's not for me.

00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:15.905
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:17.510
That's not for me.

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:20.510
And I think I might have
gone the route of the Foreign

00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:21.320
Service.

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.080
But Ghana, at the time,
was a military leadership.

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.482
And of course you
represent your government.

00:57:26.482 --> 00:57:28.190
I didn't feel like I
could quite do that.

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:29.810
Plus, I come from
a political family.

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:37.190
So I thought, you're
weaned on the BBC

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:40.084
if your parents are expatriates
from most of Africa--

00:57:40.084 --> 00:57:41.000
- Yeah, World Service.

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:43.030
- Yeah, the BBC World Service.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.930
So that was the
background noise.

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:48.652
And I thought, well,
maybe I could do that.

00:57:48.652 --> 00:57:49.860
And that's how it came to be.

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.229
- Worked out pretty well.

00:57:51.229 --> 00:57:52.770
I'm going to open
it up to the floor,

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.980
but I have one more question.

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.310
And I know this is such
American exceptionalism.

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:59.310
Let's talk about the
United States for a second.

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:00.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:02.430
I'm going to do it
because you were

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:05.490
the world's first roving
American correspondent.

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:08.010
I think it was a
fantastic experiment.

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:09.690
And I think now,
more than ever, we

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:12.389
need that kind of-- would
you come back and work

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:12.930
for us again?

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:13.080
I'm--

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:13.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.600
--it's just a play for that.

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:22.550
But I think of the demonization
of a free press right now.

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:25.160
The laissez-faire kind
of attitude toward rules,

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.230
governing, conflict of
interest, and nepotism,

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:30.410
corruption writ large--

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:33.050
not to mention the casual
attitudes toward women's place

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.090
in the world.

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:37.250
We're also watching the
US-Saudi relationship

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:38.870
come to some sort
of inflection point

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:41.900
with the disappearance
and sad possibility

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:45.080
that Jamal Khashoggi
has been killed,

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:49.127
and what that's going to do to
Trump and the Saudi monarchy.

00:58:49.127 --> 00:58:51.710
And it doesn't look like Trump
is rushing to pick up the phone

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.000
to find out what happened.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.020
So how much of this modeling
in the White House right now

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.060
do you think is seeping
into African politics?

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:03.472
And how empowering is it
for authoritarians in Africa

00:59:03.472 --> 00:59:05.930
to see what's happening with
Trump in the White House right

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:06.990
now?

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:10.150
- I think if you talk
to African people,

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:13.210
they're wondering
what's going on here.

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:17.460
This isn't the
America they know.

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.010
And a lot of the
things happening,

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:20.700
people say, well, hang on.

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:25.440
If that's happening where we
come from, there's criticism.

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.910
But I think President
Trump is probably

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:30.360
a [? fillet ?] for a
lot of African leaders

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:34.536
who want to do it their way,
come what may, regardless.

00:59:34.536 --> 00:59:35.910
Although President
Trump has only

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:38.910
been in power for two years,
you have Paul Biya in Cameroon.

00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:41.190
He's 85.

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:44.107
He was back in elections
at the weekend.

00:59:44.107 --> 00:59:45.690
- And those monitors
from transparency

00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:49.620
were crisis actors, apparently.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:54.420
- So people who aren't leaders,
who are not being criticized,

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:57.540
I think are pretty happy
with President Trump.

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.450
Apart from his one something
whole countries comment,

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:03.360
and a few others, there
hasn't been much said.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.660
But if his eyes go to
you, and he doesn't

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.090
like what you're doing, hey.

01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:11.830
Watch out, because
he speaks his mind.

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:16.560
But for those who are
trashing their countries

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.370
with poor leadership--

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:23.520
and you've mentioned things
like corruption and cupidity--

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.730
they're thinking, ooh.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.730
This isn't somebody who's going
to dictate those things to us.

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:31.980
He wants to talk about trade.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.790
He says his friends have done
some pretty good business

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:36.030
deals in Africa.

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:38.540
That's the sort of
thing they want to hear.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.631
But let's see how
things pan out.

01:00:40.631 --> 01:00:43.130
But there are lots of question
marks about the US right now.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:47.660
I think people are a
little destabilized.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.750
- Everywhere.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.940
All right.

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.280
My friends, the
floor is open to you.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.510
The microphone is here.

01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:59.130
Please step up and make your
question succinct, please.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:06.330
- Thank you very much for
this quite inspiring talk.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:10.650
I brought my students here
from the School of Divinity,

01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:14.760
so we are going to talk
about the journalists

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.860
as an ethnographer when
we get back next week.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.750
So thanks for that background.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:25.350
I'd like you to
respond to an issue

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:29.970
that I think is very central
to your conversation.

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:33.660
A group of Africans
are saying that we

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:39.540
don't want the ICC in Hague
to abdicate matters relating

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.530
to some of the crisis
that we're faced with.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:48.390
Governments who are protecting
soldiers who are raping women,

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:49.900
and so on, and so forth.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:53.130
They are calling
for an African ICC,

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:57.270
and Ghana has been suggested as
a possible place to build it.

01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:00.000
So when a person
like you, who is

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.760
so passionate about Africa, is
faced with this type of dilemma

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.550
of the African identity--

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:11.370
the idea that it
has to be African--

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:14.660
at the same time, we realize
that, at the end of the day,

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.940
it's going to be something we
may call police investigation

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.040
of police conduct.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.600
Because we are not
sure that justice

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.420
would be done if such cases
are brought to an African ICC

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.440
court.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.850
So how do you, as a journalist,
deal with similar situations,

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.650
or even this particular one?

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.140
Caught between
wanting to be faithful

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:43.110
to one's own nation, and
legitimate complaints about ICC

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.290
being pretty pro-European?

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.900
But at the same time,
knowing fully well that,

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:52.550
if they do this, it's going
to be a serious problem?

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:54.420
What's your response to that?

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.540
- I think Africa is
capable of having

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:03.780
its own continental court
to try tyrants, to try

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.870
those who violate human rights.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:10.200
But the problem, I think,
is that African governments

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.400
change.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.580
So now, you may have a
quorum, and you may have

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.270
leaders who will not interfere.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.790
But what about a few
years down the road?

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:23.970
I know the International
Criminal Court

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.670
has issues and has problems.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:30.300
And there are many criticisms,
especially from Africans,

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:33.480
that it just picks on Africans.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.000
But its justification
is that it has

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.610
to be asked by an
African country

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:42.480
to try, say, Laurent
Gbagbo in Cote d'Ivoire.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.875
Then you have those who are
the former president of Cote

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:46.980
d'Ivoire.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.930
You have those who say, well,
they pick on their enemies

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:52.850
and send them to the ICC.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.800
So it's a difficult one.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.500
Because I think we
have come of age.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:04.910
We have judges who are of
course able to try cases.

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:08.960
Look at the example of Hissene
Habre, the former president

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:14.930
of Chad who was held responsible
for atrocities and war crimes.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:18.050
That happened at a special
international court

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:20.630
sitting in Dakar, Senegal.

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:24.140
So there are examples
of where it does work.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.500
But whether there is
the continental goodwill

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.690
amongst African leaders
is really the issue.

01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:32.510
But I'm not sure that
I'm 100% with you

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:36.330
that such an African
court will fail.

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:39.020
I think it has to
be given a chance.

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.330
Thank you.

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:40.830
- Hi.

01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:42.955
Thank you so much for
being here tonight.

01:04:42.955 --> 01:04:44.330
My name is Nick
Diamond, and I've

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:47.970
spent time interviewing
gay men and lesbian

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:50.280
women in Dakar, Senegal.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.880
And I'm wondering if you could
share a little bit of advice

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.700
for other journalists,
and those in the room

01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:00.210
who are interviewing vulnerable
populations like women

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:03.600
and girls that you spoke
about, in terms of safeguarding

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.240
their safety and security
when you're conducting

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.520
these types of interviews?

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.990
- I think it's really important.

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:11.865
As you know-- you say
you've been in Senegal,

01:05:11.865 --> 01:05:16.650
which is a very conservative,
in a positive sense, country--

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:21.510
but when it comes
to LGBT issues,

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:25.450
almost everywhere you go in
Africa, there's pushback.

01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:30.660
And especially people saying,
the West can't dictate to us.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.700
We have our own mores.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.260
We have our own values.

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.884
And we're going
to stick to them.

01:05:35.884 --> 01:05:37.800
And you have countries
like South Africa, that

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.750
have very liberal
constitutions, where you have

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:46.235
what they call corrective rape.

01:05:46.235 --> 01:05:50.330
Gay women are being
forced to have sex

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:53.950
with men, because they say,
no, women can't be lesbians.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:58.920
We'll correct it by showing you
that a man can make you happy.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.910
I think it's really important
to keep the identities.

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:05.870
Unless they choose, and
even if they choose,

01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:07.100
to speak out in the open.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:11.035
Because there is such--

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.090
I wouldn't say it's hatred.

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:19.190
But there's such
denial on the continent

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:23.510
about almost everything LGBT.

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:24.500
People say, no.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.240
This is un-African.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.130
Why are you bringing
this from abroad?

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:34.280
But those who are willing to
speak out and let people know--

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.350
their stories must be told.

01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:38.950
But it's not always
going to be possible to--

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:41.420
I know the normal
journalistic routine is

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.850
that you give people's names.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:46.040
But to protect
people's security,

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.480
I think it's important
to keep their anonymity,

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.990
if it means that they're going
to be in any danger at all.

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:55.670
How long were you in Senegal?

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:56.690
- Nine months.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:57.780
- Nine months.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.280
OK.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.330
Sorry we didn't meet there.

01:06:59.330 --> 01:06:59.700
Come back.

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.070
- That's OK.

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:00.570
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:02.090
- Next time.

01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:04.331
- Thank you.

01:07:04.331 --> 01:07:04.830
- Hi.

01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:07.190
I want to thank you both
very much for being here.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.134
And I listen to The
World every day, Marco.

01:07:09.134 --> 01:07:09.800
It's wonderful--

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.010
- Good.

01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.635
- --to see you.

01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:11.960
- Thank you.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.780
- Last week, I saw
a documentary on HBO

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.250
called Queen of the World.

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:20.870
And it was a celebration of
Queen Elizabeth of England,

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.020
and the fact that she brings
53 countries, who are part

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.570
of the Commonwealth, to the UK.

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:30.020
And the way that this
documentary was slanted,

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.120
it was all this big celebration.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.680
And we're all a big family.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.930
And there was no mention
of the exploitative nature

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:42.350
of colonialism, and
imperialism, and racism.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:47.390
And I was kind of appalled that
it was such an unbalanced film.

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:49.640
So I don't know if you
saw it, but because you

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.430
are a daughter of
Ghana, I just would

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:55.040
like to know, what do you
think about the Commonwealth?

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.190
And are we drinking
the Kool-Aid here?

01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:59.370
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:59.852 --> 01:08:01.310
- When you said
Queen of the World,

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:04.100
I thought you were talking
about a documentary,

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.715
perhaps of Miriam Makeba?

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:06.960
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:08.930
- My point exactly.

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:10.026
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:12.680
- A little reveal here, too.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.790
One of your many
names is Regina.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:15.290
- Ah.

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.090
That's true.

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:16.310
- Your Christian name.

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.330
- My Christian name.

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:18.380
- There we go.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.370
- I didn't see it.

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.680
I've just got into town.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.189
I think it's good
to maintain links.

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:29.306
Colonialism was
globally bad for Africa.

01:08:29.306 --> 01:08:31.430
But some good things,
perhaps, have come out of it.

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:36.319
I'm surprised to hear of a
film that was so uncritical.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.240
- It really
surprised me as well.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.819
I think it's a
British production.

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:42.800
It didn't even seem like
a typical HBO documentary.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.080
I think they probably
just acquired it.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.939
But I'm sure it's
running on on demand.

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:48.380
You should check
it out, because--

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.361
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:49.361 --> 01:08:50.069
- --but I think--

01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:51.485
- I don't consider
Queen Elizabeth

01:08:51.485 --> 01:08:53.290
the Queen of the world.

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:55.340
But that's the
name of the show--

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.260
- There has to be
a bit of honesty.

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:02.479
The Commonwealth has become,
if not redundant, it's--

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.270
I don't know whether
its days are numbered.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:07.750
But I think it does
some good things.

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:12.760
But how much do Americans know
about the British Commonwealth,

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.130
as well as any more--

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.979
when we were in the
80s, the Commonwealth

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:21.640
seemed to be quite a
powerful, influential voice.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:26.649
But it seems to be paring
off and slipping away.

01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:28.899
- I wasn't born
under colonialism.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:31.420
Our forefathers
brought us freedom,

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:35.140
and I'm very grateful for that,
because I've had a good life.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:38.109
But I think people should
be honest about what went on

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:40.090
during the colonial years.

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:40.930
Reparations?

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.540
That's another
question altogether.

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.040
Thank you.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:43.920
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:48.870
- OK.

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:50.609
Let me try it this way.

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:52.080
My name is Roberta Logan.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.070
I live in Dorchester, which is
the African-American community

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.010
of Boston.

01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:58.760
And there are people
who live beyond that,

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.740
but I live right in the heart.

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:04.620
And my question-- since you've
spoken well and thoroughly

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.900
about the young
women of Boko Haram,

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:11.310
and the young women who have
been affected by rape through

01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:12.910
war--

01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:15.010
but what are the rest of
the girls thinking about?

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.880
What are the girls in
Senegal thinking about?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.560
What are your
nieces and nephews--

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.480
well, your nieces--
talking about?

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.860
What are their joys?

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:25.400
And what are their concerns?

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.700
- They're talking
about becoming coders.

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:34.560
Tech seems to be taking
over the youth in Africa.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.600
They are rapping in
Wolof, or Twi, or Swahili.

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:45.180
Young people are
hugely confident,

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:47.730
which I think is extraordinary.

01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:51.977
They feel-- we can be a bit
hangdog when we get to our age.

01:10:51.977 --> 01:10:52.560
This and that.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.640
Groaning, moaning.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.870
No, no, no.

01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:57.780
They feel their
future is bright.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:01.860
And they don't feel,
as perhaps in our day,

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.350
that it's bright if
you go to the US,

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:07.860
or if you go to Britain,
or if you go to Europe.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:12.580
Now, China, opportunity knocks.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:16.060
Or stay right home
and build at home.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:19.920
They do feel that
they are the leaders.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.370
They feel that it's time for us
to move over and let them take

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:28.510
over, because they feel
confident that they

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:31.510
are the leaders
Africa needs now,

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:35.410
for Africa really
to be propelled

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:39.760
into the 21st century,
in all its magnificence.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.000
So not only young
girls, young boys--

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.290
I love talking to them.

01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:45.790
I should interview them more.

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:49.060
I was chatting with the
students earlier, and saying,

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.490
the voices of young
people are so important.

01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:53.260
Because they give me
another perspective

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:55.150
It was like that
parting the waters

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:57.690
to talk to those who
were at the back.

01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.660
The people at the front
will have one of view.

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:02.280
The young people at
the back will say, no.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.520
You can't speak for us.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.710
Not on this subject.

01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:06.460
We know better than you.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.310
So marvelous things happening.

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:09.960
- I could carry
this on for ages,

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.310
but I'm going to let
the next person speak.

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.430
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.970
- Thank you.

01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:14.870
- Hi.

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:16.610
Thank you so much
for all your remarks.

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:20.186
It's been really wonderful
to see you in person.

01:12:20.186 --> 01:12:21.310
My name is Sue [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:22.640
I'm a doctoral student here.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.290
And I also lived in
Senegal for six years.

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:25.880
Nangadef.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.041
- [SPEAKING FRENCH]

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:33.950
- [SPEAKING FRENCH] I'm doing my
research on-- and I think this

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:35.690
is good news--

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:38.870
female parliamentarians in
Senegal and South Africa.

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:39.410
- Female?

01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:42.980
- Parliamentarians in
Senegal in South Africa.

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.020
And as you know,
across the continent,

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.690
because of the quota
systems, number of women

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:51.380
have infused previously
patriarchal governments,

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.150
and are starting--

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:54.650
at least my research
is showing--

01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:57.380
are starting to make
a difference in terms

01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.540
of the leadership
in the country.

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.490
And here in the
US, we're kind of

01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:03.500
on the brink of maybe
a few more women

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.530
getting involved
in the government.

01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:10.560
But I'm just wondering your
thoughts on female leadership

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.620
and in public service in Africa.

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.950
Not necessarily the presidents,
but the people who are actually

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:19.460
in the government,
and women's voices

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:22.280
that are in the government,
what your impressions are.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.390
- I would say, government,
one thing, leadership another.

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:30.830
I mean, there's no question
that women make Africa tick.

01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:35.700
And they may not make
a big deal about it,

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.830
but it's happening,
from market traders,

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:42.740
to those who run businesses,
to those who run homes.

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.520
There's no doubt
that it's happening.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.320
But more and more, in the years
I've been covering Africa,

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.440
I'm hearing more and
more women's voices,

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.370
women speaking out.

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:55.250
Because you've had women
in parliaments all over

01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:56.000
for quite a while.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.230
South Africa, as you know.

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:58.460
Rwanda.

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.350
Ghana getting a few more.

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:02.636
But often they don't speak out.

01:14:02.636 --> 01:14:03.760
It's the men who speak out.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.090
But that is changing.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:12.470
And not just about issues
of women, and children,

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:13.880
and gender, and so on.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.560
About other issues.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.100
Women are speaking out, and
their voices are being heard.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:26.630
But they don't always feel that
the public forum is the place

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.254
to speak.

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:28.670
They feel that,
sometimes, they're

01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:33.280
more influential talking
behind the scenes.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.510
But I think that's changing.

01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:37.830
And I think the
younger generation

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:39.840
don't feel that way at all.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:44.640
They feel their voice is just
as important and must be heard.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.960
So that's a good thing.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.062
Thank you.

01:14:48.062 --> 01:14:50.442
- We've got time for one more--

01:14:50.442 --> 01:14:51.400
- We've got two people.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.152
- Angola-sized question, or
two Togo-sized questions.

01:14:54.152 --> 01:14:55.461
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:55.461 --> 01:14:55.960
- Hello.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.070
My name is Bonnie.

01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:59.060
I'm an undergraduate at Harvard.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.880
And I was really
excited to hear that you

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.020
would be speaking today.

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:04.510
And I'm so glad
that I got to come.

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:10.202
I wanted to ask you about
the economic changes that

01:15:10.202 --> 01:15:11.410
have been going on in Africa.

01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:14.890
My family is from Ethiopia,
and we got to visit back home

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:16.700
this summer for the first time.

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:20.620
And it was really eye opening
to see a lot of my cousins who--

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.290
I have cousins who are
living in urban areas,

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:24.890
and in more rural areas.

01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:28.060
And I can see in my family
that lives in more urban areas,

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.130
the changes that you
were talking about,

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:33.730
about technology, and the
openness of opportunities,

01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:36.670
and the willingness
to stay in the country

01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:38.260
and make differences there.

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.180
But I was just wondering
if you had anything

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.220
to say about the opportunities
available to girls especially

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:48.880
in the rural areas, because
those opportunities are often

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.660
more limited, simply because
of logistics, money, and so on,

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:56.140
in a more dramatic way
than they are limited

01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:01.810
by the parts of
Africa that are more

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:06.950
urbanized and fortunate in
these growing economic times.

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:12.250
- I can't talk globally,
but I think rural Africa

01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:14.390
is an untapped resource.

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:17.650
And I think-- still,
Ethiopia being an example,

01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:20.800
although there have been rapid
changes in Ethiopia this year

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.750
that people can hardly
believe politically,

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.670
which is going to
open up the country--

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:27.850
I think you do have--

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:32.440
because in the countryside,
young boys and girls

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:40.030
are part of farming, for
example, getting them to school

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.660
is an issue.

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:45.450
And these days, without
formal education,

01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:49.810
it's hard to advance
in the urban areas.

01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:53.550
So I think that
is a real problem.

01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:56.790
And not just in Ethiopia, in
many African countries where

01:16:56.790 --> 01:17:00.630
not only girls, but boys
are not going to school--

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:03.210
although there's meant to
be universal primary school

01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:07.200
education-- because they're
needed to tend the fields

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.780
or to tend the cattle.

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:11.130
How do we change that?

01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:13.320
I think it comes
through leadership.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.920
And it'll be interesting to
see whether, in Ethiopia, that

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.210
will change.

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:21.664
Everybody is all smiles with
the new prime minister who seems

01:17:21.664 --> 01:17:26.600
to be making a difference.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.740
Reaching out to Eritrea, for
example, and making peace.

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:33.980
But what will it mean
for ordinary Ethiopians

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.584
in the long run, especially
people in the rural areas?

01:17:36.584 --> 01:17:38.250
I guess we're going
to have to find out.

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:40.010
But it remains a problem.

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:42.890
- I would like to add on, do you
think it would be an economic

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:45.400
solution or a more
education-focused solution?

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.650
- I think both.

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:49.620
Thank you.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:50.260
- And one more.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:53.560
That was it.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.460
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.860
- Please join me in thanking.

01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:57.760
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.810
