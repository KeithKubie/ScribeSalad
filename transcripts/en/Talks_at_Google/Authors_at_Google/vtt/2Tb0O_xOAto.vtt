00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.690
&gt;&gt;presenter: Hello, everyone and welcome to
another AuthorsGoogle event in the San Francisco

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.660
office. Today, we are extremely pleased to
have Dr. Michael Krasny. Dr. Krasny has actually

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.920
been to Google before in both the Mountain
View and San Francisco offices to talk about

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:26.140
his first book, "Off Mike". And he is, as
everybody in this room knows, and probably

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.662
most people who listen to NPR across the nation,
is the host of KQEDs award-winning Forum program,

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.140
a news and public affairs program that concentrates
on arts, culture, health, business, and technology.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.730
The Forum is actually KQEDs most popular local
radio program that's produced in the San Francisco

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.720
Bay area and broadcast nationally. Since 1970,
Dr. Krasny has been a professor of English

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.710
at Stanford--pardon me-- at San Francisco
State University and he's also taught at University

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.860
of California, San Francisco and Stanford
University. He's also the recipient of numerous

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.280
awards and honors, including the S. Y. Agnon
Gold Medal for Intellectual Distinction, the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.540
Eugene Block Award for Human Rights in Journalism,
the Inclusiveness in Media Award from the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.820
National Conference of Community and Justice,
and the Koret Foundation Fellowship. Over

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.630
the years, Dr. Krasny has interviewed hundreds
of thinkers, writers, philosophers, atheists,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.510
and believers. But despite discussing countless
controversial issues with his guests, he has

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.790
yet to find satisfying answers to life's biggest
questions. This led him to write his latest

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.790
book, "Spiritual Envy: An Agnostic's Quest",
which he will be actually discussing here

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.400
today. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Michael
Krasny.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400
[applause]

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.830
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Thank you and thank you
for having me here. And try to get used to

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.549
this face with this voice, those of you who
know the voice through the medium of radio.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.630
It's nice to be back here, at Google, always
interesting to me. I was saying just yesterday

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.960
on the air, we had a program some of you may
have heard from 9 to 9:30. It's one of these

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.619
odd couplings that we sometimes do in public
radio at your NPR affiliate. We spent the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.310
second half hour talking about sea otters,
but before that, we talked about succession

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.790
in high-tech companies. And it seemed to me
to be one of those news stories whose time

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.230
had come, because Mackwell, who was in town,
but also because Steve Jobs going on temporary

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.670
medical leave again, as many of you know.
And because your own company, in April, will

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.410
change hands as far as the CEO leadership
and Eric Schmidt handing the baton over to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.470
Larry Page. I think that may mean some interesting
changes, but we'll have to wait and see. I

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.910
hope it's all to the good. What we do every
morning, for those of you who are not familiar

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.880
with the program, is talk about news issues
and also talk to people who are news makers,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.200
and certainly talk to people who are part
of whatever this zeitgeist is that's going

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.629
on. That is, tomorrow, for example, I'll be
talking with a novelist who’s originally

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:11.050
from Sierra Leone and be talking about shifts
in juvenile justice. This morning, we spent

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.210
an hour talking about President Obama's State
of the Union address and then talked with

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.580
Belva Davis, who is an African American icon
and legendary figure in the world of broadcast

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.800
journalism who's been at it for even longer
than I have. And that's what I do, day to

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.830
day. I mean, my other identity is as a college
professor and as a scholar, but I like when

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.180
I write books to go into different territory.
I mean, a lot of it's been scholarly territory;

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.709
I did write a book that I spoke about here
in Mountain View called "Off Mike", which

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.500
is essentially a memoir about both talk radio
and what I call "literary life," which amounted

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.459
to a self-expose of wanting to be a novelist
and failing and nevertheless, having the opportunity

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.720
to interview some of the greatest novelists
that are alive. This book was a very different

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.830
kind of book and it was a book, frankly, that
I didn't know I was gonna write and I was

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.440
surprised that I was writing. I started thinking
about what I believed or what I didn't believe

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.819
and thought, "Can I really get it down? Is
it something that I can explore? Am I gonna

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.060
be doing what I do day to day on the radio,
asking simply too many questions without having

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.270
answers?" I had a friend – I have a good
friend, who when he found out I was undertaking

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.930
this questioning, skeptical attitude about
what to believe as a magnum opus, or as a

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.590
writing project, he shook his head and gave
me a bit of pathos and said, "What are you

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.710
writing -- another scholarly book that has
no answers? Don't you know, Michael, that

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.150
book's not gonna make you any money." Well,
people want answers with books, it's true.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.400
But they also, I think, especially many thoughtful
people and seekers and everything, are interested

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.910
in the kinds of questions and the kinds of
questions which maybe keep you up at night,

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.950
or did when you were a college student. My
publisher likes to call them "3 o'clock in

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.900
the morning" questions and I realize that
certainly, most of my adult life has not only

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.220
been asking questions on the air, but reflectively
and reflexively thinking about these questions

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.770
and maybe ruminating and mulling on them perhaps
more than one should divest one's consciousness

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:21.560
to do. I began with a line from a British
novelist that I particularly found compelling.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.960
Julian Barnes, the novelist, if that name
means anything to some of you and it may,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.330
I hope, who said, "I don't believe in God,
but I miss Him." And I found that resonated

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.080
for me in so many different ways because well,
frankly, after talking to and reading the

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.270
athiests, and there is, of course, a whole
new viral strain of militant atheists, Christopher

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:48.710
Hitchens and Richard Dawkins and others who
have really taken that position rather forthrightly

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.740
and presented a formidable opposition to organized
religion as well as, along with Richard Dawkins,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:04.270
a very strong and scientific support for atheism.
And I found myself thinking about my interviews

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.550
with them and also thinking about interviews
I'd had with leading theologians and people

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.960
who had given themselves to lives of faith
and who had done some pretty extraordinary

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.970
things in light of their faith, or because
of their faith, or with their faith as a catalyst.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.539
And I thought, "Is there some way between
this kind of polarized debate that has gone

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.980
on in our country now for well, generations,
but certainly in recent years, particularly

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.020
with the kind of intensity that had never
before been seen?" And I started grappling

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.550
with the larger question, "Is there a God?"
And I found myself asking even tougher questions.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.390
"If there is a God, what's the nature of the
God?" and "Historically, how has God, as a

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.699
monotheistic or before that, in terms of polytheism,
Gods been viewed? Are there things we can

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:51.880
synthesize from that?" Because I like to think
of myself as a synthesizer. And I began to

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.990
ask questions that were even, in some ways,
more relevant because once you start thinking

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.229
about God, you find yourself thinking about
good and evil. You find yourself thinking

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:03.460
about these basic metaphysical questions:
Why we're here? What we're doing here? What

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:12.080
our purpose is here? Is there a reason for
our existence? And it began to be more than

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.580
contemplative; it began to be a quest. And
I realized that I came out of really a long

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.520
tradition of making this sort of quest in
terms of what I began to see as Agnosticism.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.860
And Agnosticism is something that's almost
made into a joke. I mean, people of religion

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.750
make it into a joke because you haven't made
the leap of faith if you're an Agnostic; you

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:39.190
simply doubt and you don't know, or you say,
"I don't know." And Atheists find it, in many

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:45.680
instances, contemptible because you are hedging
your bets and taking what Pascal, Blaise Pascal,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.000
the philosopher, called The Pascal Wager.
Pascal, who was a mathematician, but also

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.780
a philosopher, said, "The best thing to do
is to live a good, virtuous life because there

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.750
may be an afterlife. There may be Hell to
pay literally, or there may be rewards in

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.270
some kind of Divine sense. So, there may be
nothing also, but let's just hedge our bets

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.039
and do this wager and do it the right way
and be good." Because, certainly, most of

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:11.050
Scripture and most of religions have been
teaching us to try to be good and compassionate,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.349
despite or notwithstanding, all of the dreadful
and horrific things that have been done in

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:19.420
the name of religion. And I had to grapple
with that as well because I realized that

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.030
there was a reason that gave birth to a lot
of the strong, militant atrain of Atheism.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:33.329
It had to do with anger and indignation, and
a great deal of rebellion against what religion

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:38.409
had been. Particularly even recently, not
only because of 9/11 associated with religion,

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.149
but during the Bush Administration there were
many figures like Jerry Falwell and others

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:46.970
that young people particularly found themselves
contemptuous of and who felt that they didn't

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.509
really want to be identified with religion,
was identified with the Crusades and the Inquisition

00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:57.739
and all these horrible things of carnage;
many wars ongoing. And so, many people nowadays

00:08:57.739 --> 00:09:02.311
say, "Well, I'm spiritual, but I'm not religious,"
or, "I don't have a religion, but I'm spiritual."

00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:05.899
And I thought, "What does that mean to be
spiritual? What is it, in fact, that we mean

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:10.339
by spirituality?" It's a signifier that the
great Derrida, the deconstructionist, post-structuralist

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:13.790
thinker, would call a floating signifier,
because it's very hard to get a handle on

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.569
what we mean by spiritual. A lot of people
simply talk about spiritual-like, maybe George

00:09:17.569 --> 00:09:22.149
Lucas's the Force, or something that can't
really be defined. It's a quest for maybe

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:27.309
a higher meaning or more transcendent feeling.
So, all of this began to be, to come into

00:09:27.309 --> 00:09:29.970
perspective and I found myself quarreling
with people of faith and quarrelling with

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.730
the Atheists, and finding not necessarily
a middle passage, but at least finding some

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:40.529
sense of a tradition of skepticism, which
goes all the way back, not only to Western

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:45.619
cultures, but to Eastern cultures, which simply
questions. Einstein said, "The thing is to

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:51.510
never stop questioning," and I began to really
accept that. And I began to realize that the

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.989
idea of a God, which is not palpable necessarily
to me or which I can't make the leap of faith

00:09:55.989 --> 00:10:04.759
for, is by dint of history an idea that has
taken sway of so many civilizations, both

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:09.921
in the Western and Eastern world. Buddhism
has, to some extent, negated God, but there

00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:13.990
have been Gods in Buddhism and there is the
idea of Buddha as a God incarnate. Almost

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:18.790
really every major religion has the idea of
a God. And I had gone through a phase, which

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.179
many young people do--I'm not a young person
anymore, but when I was a young person certainly--

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:27.399
of being nihilistic and thinking nothing has
any meaning. And I read "The Existentialist"

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:31.939
and thought, "That makes about the most sense
to me." Some writers, like Hemingway and Sam

00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:36.610
Beckett and others, spoke to me personally
and it's a good pose to take that you believe

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.459
in nothing and nothing means anything and
we're all like Sisyphus, rolling that stone

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:44.810
up a hill for it to catapult us down and life
has no meaning and it's absurd and it's totally

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.920
irrational. And this is easy to wear as armor
for oneself. I thought, "No, I don't really

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.731
believe that." I did at one time, but I do
think life has meaning. I do think there are

00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:56.379
things in life that can provide meaning and
what are those? You begin to grapple with

00:10:56.379 --> 00:11:00.170
them on an individual level. They're different
to you than they may be to me, but nevertheless

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.499
they're worth exploring in a universal way.
And so, I thought, the real word that begins

00:11:04.499 --> 00:11:10.699
to apply to what I am is "Agnostic". And I
once interviewed Studs Terkel, who said he

00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:15.260
was an Agnostic, he was a great oral historian
and I said, "What do you mean you're an Agnostic?"

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.339
And he said, "Well, I'm a cowardly Atheist."

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:18.339
[laughter]

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:24.749
Maybe Agnosticism is a form of cowardly Atheism.
In fact, maybe Agnosticism has become a source,

00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:29.269
because it has indeed for a lot of jokes because
of this kind of almost contemptuousness that

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:34.680
comes, as I said, from both sides of the continuum,
or the spectrum. Mort Sahl came up with the

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.769
great line that some Atheists moved into an
all-White, Christian neighborhood and someone

00:11:38.769 --> 00:11:40.139
burned a question mark on their lawn.

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:42.179
[laughter]

00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:46.689
And there's also that Woody Allen line about
an Atheist and an Agnostic who got married

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:50.699
and the marriage didn't work out because they
didn't know what not to bring the child up

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:57.930
in. Well, actually, I found myself saying,
"What is Agnosticism?" Aside from the sense

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.079
of a tradition that goes back, as I said,
to skepticism and before, in Eastern and Western

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:05.939
cultures, besides Socrates, who said, "The
only thing I know is that I know nothing,"

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:10.709
and some of our greatest thinkers coming to
that kind of conclusion, Agnosticism began

00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:15.359
to resonate for me in different ways when
I began to study the Agnostics. And actually,

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:19.319
there are three. I call them, somewhat irreverently,
the Trinity of Agnostics. There are three

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:23.240
major Agnostic figures in the 20th Century.
One of them, of course, is Bertrand Russell,

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.589
a name many of you know, the Nobel Laureate,
mathematician, philosopher, who also called

00:12:27.589 --> 00:12:31.480
himself an Atheist depending on what his audience
was. There was a man named Robert Ingersol

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:37.769
who was known as the great Agnostic, who was
a stunning orator and an attorney by profession.

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:43.519
And there was also another Agnostic by the
name of T.H. Huxley, who gave us the word

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:49.649
"Agnostic." He was known also as Darwin's
Bulldog and he was the grandfather of Aldous

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:55.790
Huxley, a name probably familiar to more of
you. But T. H. Huxley began to define Agnostic

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:01.069
in terms of not having Gnosticism, not having
secret knowledge, not simply knowing. And

00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:05.790
he said, "You know what? I'm an Agnostic.
I call myself an Agnostic, but I'm open to

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.629
knowledge. In fact, I want knowledge. I seek
it. I welcome it. I would embrace it if I

00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:13.389
have an understanding of what these Higher
Powers are, or these things that a priori,

00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:17.769
I can't determine, that are beyond the metaphysical
realm, that is, above the physical realm,

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:21.730
the material realm. I wanna know what those
things are and I'm open constantly to the

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.839
possibility of being convinced of what they
are." And I began to realize that there were

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:32.569
some extraordinary and very-- I shouldn't
move away from the microphone-- significant

00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:38.490
analogies between Agnosticism and the paranormal
because we explore the paranormal and we try

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:43.559
to find out if indeed everything happens for
a reason, as some people say nowadays, or

00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:47.509
some things happen for a reason, or there's
synchronicity, or there's serendipity, or

00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:52.129
there's psychic power that you have, telekinesis,
all these kinds of things. None of them have

00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:56.939
been proven and there's, again, a strong skeptical
tradition that says, "Show me the proof,"

00:13:56.939 --> 00:14:01.369
essentially, where these things are concerned.
And so, I began writing about the paranormal

00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:06.889
as well and I began writing about spiritual
hunger, which I thought, is a real phenomenon

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:12.410
because I think people, and especially so
many of you who are young, want some sense

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:19.410
of answers, want to be able to name or be
able to find some sense of signifying meaning

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:25.319
that will give you purpose, that will give
you meaning, that will provide some elevation

00:14:25.319 --> 00:14:30.669
of spirit or of faith or of vitality or ignition
in your life that you, perhaps, have been

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:35.389
looking for or are seeking maybe even more
than you know. And I found myself exploring

00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:39.629
some other extraordinary lives. For example,
I was always curious about a man I interviewed

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:44.679
many years ago by the name of Brian Weiss,
who wrote a book called "Many Lives, Many

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:50.529
Masters". And he was a Princeton educated
 – excuse me – a Yale educated MD, who

00:14:50.529 --> 00:14:55.059
had been in charge of psychiatry at Miami
General Hospital and he believed that there

00:14:55.059 --> 00:15:02.179
were former lives. And he had every sense
of conviction that former lives existed and

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:06.499
he would take patients and take them back
to their former lives; past life regressions.

00:15:06.499 --> 00:15:10.919
Which, as a skeptic, of course I looked on
with some disfavor and skepticism, but I thought,

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:15.259
"What makes a guy like this tick?" I wanted
to figure him out. Bright guy, scientifically

00:15:15.259 --> 00:15:19.889
trained and so forth. And I had the same question
about John Mack, who was a Harvard professor,

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:23.000
whom some of you may know, who is a Pulitzer
Prize winning biographer, in fact, of Lawrence

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.239
of Arabia, was a leading psychiatrist and
head of the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard,

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:33.139
who had taken all of these people who felt
that they had been abducted by aliens, put

00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:39.580
them under hypnosis, and they were completely,
utterly traumatized by something that they

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.689
believed was alien abduction. And Mack was
saying, "There must be something there." And

00:15:43.689 --> 00:15:49.489
again, I looked upon this with a high degree
of skepticism; still do. But I wanted to know

00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:54.949
what made somebody as smart as Mack also tick.
What made him search for this meaning which

00:15:54.949 --> 00:16:03.399
he looked for with these abductees? I also
brought into this particular triad of subjects

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:09.369
of interest, a man named Ian Stevenson, who
spent more time zealously trying to recover

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:15.939
data that proved, again, former lives because
there was evidence he felt that people had

00:16:15.939 --> 00:16:19.549
died at a certain time and their souls had
transmigrated and they had gone into somebody

00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:24.490
else's soul because there was this xeniglossy,
which is a whole phenomenon where somebody

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.669
can supposedly speak a language that they've
never learned or they've never grown up in.

00:16:27.669 --> 00:16:32.290
And he had what he felt was incontrovertible
proof of xenoglossy. The proof doesn't convince

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.440
me, but I wanna know, again, what makes somebody
like that tick because I feel that all of

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.519
these men, brilliant men in their own ways.
And Stevenson, by the way, was Head of Psychiatry

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:44.439
at University of Virginia. You can conclude
from these three cases that all psychiatrists

00:16:44.439 --> 00:16:46.030
can be mental cases, but I wouldn't do that.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.030
[laughter]

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.410
That would be one syllogism. What I wanted
to find out is, as I said, what motivated

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.869
them? What compelled them? And I thought it
was spiritual hunger, and I began to look

00:16:53.869 --> 00:16:58.199
at their lives, especially someone like Brian
Weiss, who had lost a child at a fairly young

00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:05.380
age, and he and his wife were clearly in mourning
and grieving that needed some kind of meaning.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.980
And frankly, why I call my book "Spiritual
Envy" is because spiritual anchoring and faith

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:15.990
can, and indeed often do, provide not only
meaning, but wonderful consolation. Whatever

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:21.669
you want to say skeptically or nihilistically
or to downgrade or to derogate the idea of

00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:26.100
faith, or the idea of a spiritual anchoring,
there are people who find consolation and

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.610
there are people who get off of a life of
recidivistic felonies. I used to do work at

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.299
San Quentin with prisoners and I found that
those prisoners who adopted a faith, in many

00:17:35.299 --> 00:17:38.140
instances, got out of a life of crime much
more than they would have under different

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.990
circumstances. I discovered through research
and doing a number of programs on this, that

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.980
there are many young people and people of
middle age and even older, who are addicts.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.750
Addicts, in some instances, their whole lives,
who are able to give up their addiction because

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.490
of faith. I mean, faith doesn't necessarily
move mountains, but faith and belief and spirituality

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:02.360
can not only console bereavement, it can provide
an antidine or an antidote--whatever you wanna

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.840
call it-- or amelioration of some pretty severe
and serious and complex human problems. So,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.019
I found myself, curiously enough, in this
ambivalent situation about faith, because

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:18.250
one has to concede the fact that religion
has been misused and abused and people have

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:23.409
done dreadful things in its name, but I also
began to think of what religion or what has

00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:26.611
been done in the name of religion that's positive.
And I thought of the Abolition Movement and

00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:30.190
the Civil Rights Movement and they were very
tied to religion. I thought of the Solidarity

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.309
Movement in Poland, which is essentially a
Catholic movement, and the Catholic Theology

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:39.470
Liberation Movement in South and Central America,
all trying to ameliorate poverty and all dealing

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:45.450
with social problems. And so, I wanted to
give that kind of unbiased-- what I like to

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:50.419
think I do as a broadcast journalist in my
better moments-- view of faith, religion,

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:56.590
spirituality, and what is behind them. And
yet, this book in many ways, is a personal

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:02.941
quest. It's a personal quest to try to find
out why I lost my own belief and what happened,

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:08.750
because I said Julian Barnes' line had such
an effect on me. And I didn't know what was

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:15.370
still stirring in me in terms of desire. And
I have friends who say, "Who the hell cares?"

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.470
The novelist, Jane Smiley, whom some of you
may know, the Pulitzer Prize winning novelist

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.580
who lives now in Carmel, said to me, "You
know, Michael, I used to be an Agnostic, but

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:27.450
now I'm an Indifferentist cause now I really
don't give a shit."

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.450
[laughter]

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.960
Maybe there's something to be said for being
an Indifferentist. But some of us can't just

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.991
give that up, that search, or give up that
desire to have a higher meaning or to have

00:19:34.991 --> 00:19:40.490
some sensibility that will make sense to us
and will give order to our thinking or some

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:45.200
kind of pattern to our thinking that makes
maybe a more transcendent or higher and more

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.549
elevated sense. I thought, though, rather
than talk more about my book, I would read

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:56.919
a short passage because the book is very serious
and, as you can tell, it takes on some pretty

00:19:56.919 --> 00:20:01.210
serious questions. But Eric Idle of Monty
Python once said to me in an interview, "There

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.299
are two forces in this world. There's gravity
and levity." Which I like to this day.

00:20:05.299 --> 00:20:06.870
[laughter]

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:13.530
And I wrote a few things that I thought, I
guess I'm a frustrated novelist, so I wanted

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.350
to be a storyteller here as well, and I told
some stories and a few of them, I think, are

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:22.790
worth at least one, bringing to your attention
because I think it's pretty funny, and it

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:28.320
also gets to some questions about the paranormal
and about where skepticism and Agnosticism

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:36.080
play their role. It's also a story that I
simply like to tell, so I included it and

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.500
it's a short enough story that I'd like to
read it to you. But mainly I wanna read it

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.380
because it's funny. And I begin by saying
a funny and revealing story comes to mind.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.990
This is about a quarter of the way into the
book.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.879
[reads]
"I had an accountant named Bob Steiner, who

00:20:51.879 --> 00:20:57.809
was also a magician. I like saying my accountant
was a magician. Steiner became rather well-known

00:20:57.809 --> 00:21:04.240
in the world of skeptics and debunkers, and
he appeared many times on television and radio

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.720
as a bogus psychic. In fact, he worked with
the famous magician, James Randy, and he and

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.639
Randy exposed a phony faith healer named Peter
Popoff, who used an electronic device that

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:18.559
fed him information through an earpiece. Popoff's
wife would tell him, through the earpiece,

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:21.790
people’s ailments as he approached them
in the audience and he would amaze everyone

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:26.210
by noting, supposedly with help from God,
what they were suffering from, or where they

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.629
were in pain, or what they had been diagnosed
as having; all information acquired ahead

00:21:30.629 --> 00:21:35.690
of time by Mrs. Popoff. Steiner happened to
mention to me that he was doing a television

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:40.659
show for the Fox Network based on the life
of Harry Houdini. He informed me that they

00:21:40.659 --> 00:21:44.309
were going to do a séance, in which they
would attempt to get Houdini to speak from

00:21:44.309 --> 00:21:49.850
the dead because Houdini had debunked many
séances and swore he would communicate from

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.490
the afterlife, if one existed.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.020
[laughter]

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.559
"It all sounded like good entertainment to
me, and when I asked Steiner who was producing

00:21:57.559 --> 00:22:03.779
the show, he told me it was a fellow named
Ken Ehrlich. Now, Ken Ehrlich had, at one

00:22:03.779 --> 00:22:09.370
time, lived three houses away from me in Cleveland
and we had belonged to the same college fraternity.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:14.750
My sister had been his babysitter when he
was a child and our parents were friends.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:19.260
He had gone on to be the producer of the Emmys
and the Grammys, and Ehrlich had no way of

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:24.740
knowing I knew Steiner. Steiner had impersonated
a psychic on many occasions all over the world

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:30.970
as part of his debunking crusade, and he was
good at it. When set against others who claimed

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.539
they were real psychics, he inevitably got
audiences to believe in the superiority of

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:39.210
his psychic powers. Then he would reveal that
he was a skeptic--

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.210
[laughter]

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.159
"and a magician impersonating a psychic. I
asked him when he was planning to see Ehrlich,

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:48.659
and he told me they had a meeting set up for
a week later in Beverly Hills, and I proceeded

00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:52.799
to reveal to him many facts about Ehrlich
that few people, except those from Ehrlich's

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:53.799
past, could know.

00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:55.320
[laughter]

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:01.400
"When Steiner met with Ehrlich, then Erlich's
assistant producer, Steiner went almost immediately

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:06.200
into his psychic role, insisting right off
to two skeptical men that he possessed paranormal

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.769
powers. To the assistant producer, he made
general observations of that sort – of the

00:23:11.769 --> 00:23:15.870
sort that anyone might buy into, and then
he told Ehrlich that he had never before felt

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:21.009
such powerful psychic vibrations as he felt
with Ehrlich. He started off by saying he

00:23:21.009 --> 00:23:26.759
saw a diamond and couple of older people.
Did that have any significance? I had told

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:32.270
Steiner that Erlich's grandparents name was
Diamond. I had also told Steiner – excuse

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.679
me -- I had also heard from my mother, a few
months earlier, that she and my father, who

00:23:36.679 --> 00:23:40.400
were still friendly with Ehrlich's parents,
had attended the bar mitzvah of his brother

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.210
Steve's son in Cleveland. Steiner asked Ehrlich
if he had a brother, and when he did, Steiner

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:50.529
asked if there was a recent celebration or
ritual having to do with the brother's son.

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.049
All this was pretty surprising to Ehrlich.

00:23:52.049 --> 00:23:53.730
[chuckles]

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:58.039
"But he deduced that Steiner must have talked
to his wife.’You spoke to my wife, didn't

00:23:58.039 --> 00:24:02.570
you?' Ehrlich asked. Steiner looked Ehrlich
right in the eye and sternly said, 'I swear

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.929
on everything, including my own life and the
lives of my children, that I have never met

00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:10.750
or talked to your wife.' Whereupon he asked
Ehrlich another question gleaned from my supply

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:15.070
of information. Had Ehrlich dated a girl in
college with a peg leg?

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.450
[laughter]

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.320
"Ehrlich became, according to Steiner's description,
highly agitated--

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.269
[laughter]

00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:27.789
"exclaiming that his wife did not know about
this girl who, unfortunately, had come to

00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:28.789
be called 'Peg Leg Betty.'

00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:31.129
[laughter]

00:24:31.129 --> 00:24:34.370
"Steiner told me he felt compelled at this
point to let Ehrlich know the truth, because

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:38.480
Ehrlich was begging. Then Steiner blurted
out, 'Mike Krasny says hello.'"

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.559
[laughter]

00:24:39.559 --> 00:24:45.999
A little bit of a quasi-charming story and
funny, but also revealing in the sense that

00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:52.600
one can always present paranormal or parapsychological
as being real. And one can always make people

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.379
believe in ways that they didn't even think
they could believe, or would believe. They

00:24:57.379 --> 00:25:00.820
might have think -- they might have thought,
as many do, that they had a strong enough

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.900
skepticism to be a bulwark against that, but
that was the point of that story. And the

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:12.010
point of this book is to really illuminate,
educate about Agnosticism; to talk in ways

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:16.700
that are going to be catalysts and have been
catalysts, I'm proud to say, to many really

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:21.720
wonderful conversations about the nature of
spirituality, about the nature of meaning

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:28.150
in life. And I can tell you this because I
am at that stage of life now where, unfortunately,

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:38.580
I can be called an Elder, and have been. I
discovered that whether you believe in something

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:49.799
or not, maybe is less important than how you
guide and what you do and what you accomplish

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:54.700
and what you set out do to and what you make
of your life, of course. And I know that sounds

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.820
trite and it sounds like a platitude, but
lemme put it into a context. When the great

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:07.200
African American playwright, August Wilson,
died, I was very moved to read that a reporter

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.260
who had talked to him only weeks before his
death--and for those of you who don't know,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.590
he's the author of "Fences" and "Ma Rainey's
Black Bottom", and a number of works that

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:20.350
won him a couple of National Book Awards and
Pulitzers, both--he's a man who was, by the

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:27.279
way, I admired and was a tough interview;
a little bit surly and strong-minded in ways

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:32.080
that were almost slightly combative at times,
but nevertheless, I gleaned a lot from the

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.650
few times I got the privilege of interviewing
him. The reporter who talked to him before

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.740
he died was talking to him about life and
life's meaning and he knew that the death

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.009
sentence was hanging over him. In fact, he
thought he had a little more time than he

00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:57.320
had left. He was dying of pancreatic cancer--the
severe kind. And he said, "You know, my life,

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:06.860
when I look back on it, has been so filled
with blessings and that's what I have to say

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:11.240
as I know I'm on death's precipice, as I know
I'm going into what Dylan Thomas called 'that

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.419
good night of death.'" And I thought whether
you believe in blessings or not, if you can

00:27:16.419 --> 00:27:24.369
say that toward the end, then you're saying
a lot. You're saying an immense and abundant

00:27:24.369 --> 00:27:33.429
sense of what life can mean and what life
ought to mean. And so, the realization that,

00:27:33.429 --> 00:27:36.630
for example, to say to yourself at a certain
stage in your life, "I've lived a good life,'

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.420
whatever that means, and one hopes it means
a virtuous life, one hopes it means a noble

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.450
life, one hopes it means an ethical life,
but to say at a certain point that you lived

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:50.490
a good life, that you've made some kind of
contribution that's meaningful impact, that

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:56.700
you've been a good, decent, loving, compassionate
person, as opposed to saying, "Good or evil?

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.809
What's the difference? What's -- what does
it matter in the long run?" I mean, cause

00:28:01.809 --> 00:28:06.860
a nihilistic view and a view of say, what
Dostoyevsky gives us in The Brothers Karamazov,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.350
"If God does not exist, anything is permissible,"
is a legitimate intellectual view. There's

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:17.340
no gainsaying it, right? If you believe that
God should be involved in our human affairs,

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:24.159
for example, be that kind of omnipotent God
or a God who is entering into our lives, then

00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:29.200
you have to wrestle with some very considerable
questions, such as evil and why it exists;

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.059
the question we call theodicy in philosophy.
That is, how can God allow for carnage? How

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:39.759
can God allow for horror, child molestations,
children being beaten and so forth, like in

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:47.279
Karamazov? Regardless of what your own answers
are, what a sense of compromise you may come

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:52.809
to, it seems to me, and I wanted to make this
case, in a polemical way that there is a case

00:28:52.809 --> 00:28:59.450
to be made for living a good life, that there
is a case for choosing goodness. And in many

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.120
instances, it's very hard to even decide what
goodness is 'cause you know the road to hell

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.899
is paved with good intentions. You know that
sometimes when you choose to be good, it turns

00:29:07.899 --> 00:29:12.129
out to be not good at all. And sometimes when
you choose to be not good and your own free

00:29:12.129 --> 00:29:16.590
will is involved, goodness comes out of it.
So, it's always a challenge, especially with

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:21.610
the big questions in life. I remember interviewing
the Nobel Laureate, Issac Bashevis Singer,

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:27.100
and I said to him, "Free will in your work
means so much. Free will seems to mean everything.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:33.039
Do you believe in free will?" And he said,
"I have no choice."

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:34.039
[laughter]

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:37.169
But I think maybe we don't have any choice
but to believe in free will and to believe

00:29:37.169 --> 00:29:42.360
that choice is ours in many instances. Certainly,
you can feel that life is being shaped for

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.740
you, determined for you in forces that don't
allow for your own existential authenticity

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:52.520
or genuineness, but to a great degree you
have choice, you have will, and you have the

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.519
power of decision-making. And that means the
power to decide whether or not to do good,

00:29:57.519 --> 00:30:01.860
or to be compassionate, or to be loving, or
to give service, or to do something that has

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.901
a mission to it that makes life a better place
for all of us. Thank you.

00:30:05.901 --> 00:30:13.799
[applause]

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:18.254
I wanted to be brief because, obviously, this
is a topic that I can go on and on and on

00:30:18.254 --> 00:30:23.049
about. But I found that when I give talks,
there are not only questions about the conversations

00:30:23.049 --> 00:30:27.679
that I like to think the book and its content
starts, but there are usually questions or

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:33.071
comments about the work I do in radio, which
I'm certainly welcoming because the last time

00:30:33.071 --> 00:30:36.980
I was at Google, the last two times at Mountain
View and here, there were a lot of questions

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:43.149
about what I try to do in the way of public
service day to day. So, whatever's on your

00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:49.610
minds is certainly welcome. What I said was,
if any of you have questions or comments about

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:53.960
anything I've said related to my book, I'd
be certainly delighted to entertain them,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:59.980
hear them, welcome them. These ideas about
spirituality and about search for God and

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:05.279
all have, it seems to me, been, as I said
earlier, catalysts to more questions and more

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:09.999
conversation and I welcome it from you. But
also, if you have questions or anything you'd

00:31:09.999 --> 00:31:15.429
like to raise about. The Forum program and
I do on a daily basis, that's welcome as well.

00:31:15.429 --> 00:31:17.619
So, you have free will here.

00:31:17.619 --> 00:31:18.909
[laughter]

00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:20.210
Yes.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:24.309
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Have you done much exploring
in--

00:31:24.309 --> 00:31:25.309
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Pardon?

00:31:25.309 --> 00:31:26.309
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Have you explored many spiritual
schools of thought? Have you pursued practices

00:31:26.309 --> 00:31:28.340
of Buddhism or Islamic traditions or anything
of that nature and do your explorations get

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.730
closer to the answer?

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:37.549
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Did everybody hear the question?
Have I explored other spiritual roots and

00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:45.119
the answer is most affirmatively, I made a
lifetime study of religion, theology, philosophy

00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:50.520
because it happens to be -- some people like
to listen to U2, I like to listen to and read

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:58.960
theology. I'm quirky that way, I guess. But,
a more important segment of your question

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.549
is, have I tried some of the practices? And
yes, because I think there's a lot to be said

00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:07.789
for meditation. I think there's a lot to be
said for many of the Buddhist practices. I've

00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:13.299
gone to Spirit Rock; Jack Kornfield's a personal
friend who was nice enough to write some wonderful

00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:22.610
words about my book and I've looked into just
about every major spiritual form of transformation

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:27.619
and investigation. Have I embraced any of
them? No. Have I taken any as an anchor of

00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:35.549
faith? No. Do I think that they can provide
meaning in people's lives? Absolutely. Yes.

00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:48.250
&gt;&gt;audience #2: So, I have a question. It sounds
like this book is primarily about an individual’s

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:55.620
faith in God and lack thereof, but it seems
to me, I am British, so I come from a country

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.430
which basically gave up on Christianity about
40 years ago. And I grew up going to church

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.430
once a month because my parents--

00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.430
&gt;&gt;audience #3: 400 according to the Pope.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.430
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Yeah. Right. But the church
doesn't form a big role in Britain because

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.430
of--

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:03.900
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: No. No, many fewer Brits
go to church than Americans by far, by disproportionately.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.169
&gt;&gt;audience #2: There's the state and the trade
unions and so forth, which provide a big social

00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:13.090
staple structure of people who belong to.
Whereas, the States, I have friends from Tennessee

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:17.220
and so forth, and their parents, their families,
everyone belongs to the church because it's

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:21.929
kind of like the only safety net they have.
And so, do you address that or have you addressed

00:33:21.929 --> 00:33:25.559
that there's this double-sided thing – there's
being the individual spirit you have but it's

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:29.610
also this big social role that the churches
play across the world in Islam and Christianity.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.480
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Well, it's a very good question
and I'll come at it from a couple of perspectives.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:40.960
One is that churches, mosques, synagogues,
houses of worship really do provide community

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.201
for people. They also provide tradition; they
provide heritage. I mean, one of the things,

00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:48.150
I guess one of the quarrels I have with the
atheists is they wanna throw the babies out

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.799
with the bathwater, and there are things,
obviously, that organized religion does provide

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:57.080
people. The Evangelical woman is still extremely
strong in this country about, believe it or

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:01.519
not, one out of six Americans identify with
that movement and consider themselves, even

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:06.170
a larger number then, that believe in Heaven
and Hell, certainly believe in God, believe

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:11.820
in Jesus and the Resurrection and so forth.
And what you find is the younger generation

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.860
 -- there's a new book out in fact by Robert
Putnam, who wrote "Bowling Alone"; he was

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.119
on Forum, you can listen to the program--this
is not a plug--

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:19.119
[laughter]

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:24.770
but it's on iTunes and it's on the Web and
so forth; you can download it. But Putnam’s

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.879
really a good thinker and he did a lot of
research, a lot of deciduous research talking

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:34.700
to younger Americans who have been more eclectic,
taking Buddhist practice or taking forms of

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:39.770
spirituality of one sort or another without
necessarily joining a congregation, or belonging

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:45.960
to any kind of congregation or organized religion.
That seems to be part of the pattern in America,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:51.820
but the pattern is still very entrenched with
religion. By contrast, in the UK, or much

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.829
of Scandinavia, which has become very Agnostic,
by the way, I mean Denmark, particularly,

00:34:55.829 --> 00:35:02.230
but also Norway and Sweden, and to a lesser
extent Finland, these are countries that go

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.750
through all the rituals with religion, christenings
and confirmations and so forth, but they've

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:11.420
abandoned religion for the most part. I mean,
obviously Russia has abandoned religion, or

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:16.980
did under the Communist regime. The Chinese
have abandoned religion. Religion is not the

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:21.170
global force it once was, but in many ways,
of course, it remains an extraordinary global

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.421
force when you think of Islam and when you
think of Gnostic and Evangelical Christianity

00:35:25.421 --> 00:35:30.300
and Arden Christianity, and particularly as
I think you suggest, in this country. But

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.880
when you're talking about the generation divide,
you're talking about something that's, I think,

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:39.160
quite real. And how young people reconcile
the strong faith of their parents with what,

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:45.930
for many of them, is a breaking away, is,
I think, an individual matter. Because you

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:50.920
hear young people saying, "Well, I'm getting
married and I'm having a priest, even though

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.319
I think this priest may have buggered somebody."
I mean crazy things like this.

00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:54.319
[laughter]

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:58.930
I mean, there's all this ambivalence. In other
words, "I'm disdainful of religion, but at

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:05.359
the same time, I wanna do something for my
parents, so I have a priest marry us in a

00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:06.359
same-sex marriage." No.

00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:09.960
[laughter]

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.670
The sense of being fastened to the past and
wanting to please your parents and not wanting

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:20.809
to commit what, I'll harken back to a great
existentialist who is a nihilist, Jean-Paul

00:36:20.809 --> 00:36:24.270
Sartre, not wanting to commit bad faith. That
is, not wanting to do something that goes

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.061
against your own authenticity is, I think,
a battle. It's a battle again of free will

00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:31.180
and decision-making. I hope that provides
some light.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:36.650
&gt;&gt;audience #2: I was more wondering about
could you have Agnostic church? Like, if you

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.670
wanna be Agnostic but you wanted to belong,
how would you set up an Agnostic church?

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:43.771
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: There are Agnostic places
of worship; there are Unitarian churches.

00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:46.220
You know the joke about the--I write a lot
about the Ten Commandments—the joke about

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.980
the Unitarians is that they call them the
Ten Suggestions.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.869
[laughter]

00:36:51.869 --> 00:36:57.089
There are many forms of secularized worship
now and they're becoming, Kinderschules in

00:36:57.089 --> 00:37:01.220
the Jewish religion, for example, which abandoned
any idea of monotheism, but want that sense

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.950
of heritage and want that ongoing tradition
that is imbued with Jewishness as opposed

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:12.510
to Judaism, which is very rooted in monotheism
and belief in God. There are Agnostic societies.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.710
There are, in fact, AA, Alcoholics Anonymous,
used to say "I believe in a Higher Power.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:21.412
I'm subject to that Higher Power's power,
all that," there are Agnostics and Atheists

00:37:21.412 --> 00:37:25.400
who felt uncomfortable with that. So now,
there are Agnostic and Atheist chapters of

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.349
AA. So, yes. The answer is yes. Yes.

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:38.650
&gt;&gt;audience #3: [ ] often religious compared
to [ ] in a pejorative way, but one of the

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:51.900
things I found interesting about what you
were talking about is that you brought religion

00:37:51.900 --> 00:38:00.150
and paranormal activity together through the
pursuit of skepticism and that our skepticism

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:06.500
as it relates to those two topics is very
similar. How did you find having discussions

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.980
about paranormal activity, what religious
folks did and were you able to navigate that

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.980
without triggering that sense of "Oh, you
just think this is all psychics and whatnot"?

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.390
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Well, really deeply religious
people are extremely suspicious of the paranormal

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:16.680
because I have some friends, in fact, who
went around teaching yoga, and this isn't

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.400
the paranormal, but it’s a good example.
They were teaching yoga in elementary school

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:27.140
classes in places like Idaho and Nebraska
and parents were, the same kind of parents

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:31.599
who were really concerned about kids using
Ouija boards or maybe getting a little bit

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:36.390
too into Halloween or Black Sabbath or things
of that sort, these are parents who feel that

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:40.801
their kids' souls are at risk here. I mean,
whether it's yoga or whether it’s the paranormal,

00:38:40.801 --> 00:38:46.240
they do feel that way. And I think you have
to have a sense of, at least sensitivity to

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:54.180
that, or respect that as much as you can.
There - what I found in this debate is there

00:38:54.180 --> 00:39:02.010
is a dogmatism on both sides that I don't
like. That is, people of religion can be terrific

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.780
people; they go out and they do missionary
work and they try to help the poor and lift

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:12.339
up the struggling peoples of the world, sometimes
in ways that have been dastardly, to be sure,

00:39:12.339 --> 00:39:17.411
but sometimes in really significantly merciful
and kind and decent ways. But too many of

00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:25.320
them are off the scale in their dogmatism,
and are unwilling to be open to those of a

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.010
different turn of mind or belief system. And
the same has become true for many of the more

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:36.319
militant Atheists. When I interviewed Salman
Rushdie, for example, who has become an Atheist,

00:39:36.319 --> 00:39:44.069
he said, "I'm an Atheist but when people say
public policy, I believe fetuses are life,

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:47.970
for example, therefore I don't believe in
abortion. I believe that all these abortions

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:52.540
are a Holocaust of human life." He said, "I
have to recognize that that comes out of a

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:59.710
faith-based belief. That's policies. I don't
feel contemptuous toward their belief, but

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:04.360
I embrace the idea that God does not exist;
the absence of God." And by the way, Stephen

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.290
Hawking just came out with a new book where
he said, "I'm no longer an Agnostic; I'm an

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:13.330
Atheist because the Big Bang probably had
gravity before it." And I thought, "Steven,

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.780
you may be the most brilliant man on the planet,
but you still gotta ask the question, how

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.339
did gravity get here?" Anyway--

00:40:18.339 --> 00:40:21.470
[laughter]

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:26.030
if you talk to exceedingly religious people,
or exceedingly strong Agnostic – I mean

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:31.503
Atheist believers, Bill Maher is a good example
by the way. Bill Maher, if any of you saw

00:40:31.503 --> 00:40:36.110
"Religulous" or if you listen to him or see
him on his show, he's really very contemptuous

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:39.562
toward religion and it’s that dogmatism,
I think Maher is a brilliant comic and I have

00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:44.380
a lot of respect for him, but it's that dogmatism
that I enveigh against, that I am on my own

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:50.809
hobby horse enveighing against because I don't
think it's healthy. Look, this is a republic

00:40:50.809 --> 00:40:54.359
that believes in freedom of religion, even
though the Puritans came here and they burned

00:40:54.359 --> 00:40:59.990
witches and they punished Pagans and Indians
and all of that because they didn't conform

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.900
to their religious beliefs that they came
here to practice and believe in. But nevertheless,

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.670
it's a cornerstone of American belief. And
when I look back at the Founding Fathers,

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.109
and when I do that, I get very uncomfortable
because I begin to think, "Krasny, you're

00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:13.109
sounding a little like Glen Beck"--

00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:14.400
[laughter]

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:22.710
and Heaven forefend, if there is a Heaven.
But our Founding Fathers, for the most part,

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:27.760
I mean, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and everything,
they were deists. They believed that God maybe

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.349
created the Heavens and the Earth and then
He went MIA, or She went MIA, or something

00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:37.619
went missing in action. And then it became
up to us to make this shining city on the

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:41.859
hill and this republic into a great and ideal
place. And one of the things that's been the

00:41:41.859 --> 00:41:46.289
cornerstone of that ideal has been freedom
of religion, freedom to practice and be whatever

00:41:46.289 --> 00:41:50.289
you wanna be, or not be. There were always
village Atheists and they were, in some instances,

00:41:50.289 --> 00:41:53.640
really tarred and feathered and all that.
There were never village Agnostics. I tried

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.109
to trace that. I thought maybe, it was actually
almost an institutional phenomenon of the

00:41:58.109 --> 00:42:03.950
village Atheists, but nevertheless, Agnostics
were looked on with less scorn than Atheists,

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.940
and they were a little more accepted. But
people of strong faith, and this is in our

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.089
own American literature, people of strong
faith looked down upon them and still look

00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:14.089
down upon them. Yes.

00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:16.849
&gt;&gt;audience #4: I just had a brief comment
on that end, both on the side of Atheists

00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:26.059
and the church [ ]. I have a belief, after
years of listening to you on the radio, what

00:42:26.059 --> 00:42:27.520
you look like.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.520
[laughter]

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.240
I am struggling with this man, who does a
wonderful Michael Krasny impersonation, but

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:42.740
I believe he looks much different. So, it's
kind of neat to illustrate that.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:49.240
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Have you come to the conclusion
that I'm far more handsome than you had anticipated?

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.240
Yeah.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.240
[laughter]

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.240
That's, that's always the reaction.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.240
[laughter]

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.240
&gt;&gt;audience #4: Not the face for radio.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:58.100
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Well, sometimes it's a face
for radio, actually. Or, it feels like a face

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:03.790
for radio, but that's, that's kind of you.
And I like that as a metaphor because you

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:08.270
do have these notions in your mind. I mean,
some of you have a picture, probably, of God,

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.781
or you did when you were a kid; flowing beard
 -- whatever the case may be. If there is

00:43:12.781 --> 00:43:16.361
a God, and I'm not saying there isn't, it's
hard to prove it negative. But if there is

00:43:16.361 --> 00:43:22.250
a God, he, she, it may look nothing like you
imagined, in the same way that you experienced

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:29.080
this phenomena of looking at me. For example,
I found myself also exploring the notion of

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.950
extraterrestrial life because I thought to
myself, "Here again is something we don't

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:37.060
know." We don't know what's out there in interstellar
space. We don't know what's out there in the

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.510
small planets that look like Earth or beyond
our galaxy; there's an infinite number of

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:46.210
galaxies. Like Carl Sagan used to say, "Billions
and billions." We may even -- I'm interviewing

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.869
Brian Green on Monday, both on the air and
at the Herbst Theatre, and some of you may

00:43:49.869 --> 00:43:54.470
know his work, the string theorist, physicist
from Columbia and he's always been saying.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.480
His new book is, in fact, making an argument
about parallel universes and all of that,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.630
and they may exist, but we don't know. I mean,
that's what Agnosticism says ultimately. We

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:07.640
just don't know. Nancy Reagan said, "Just
say no to drugs," Krasny says, "Just say no,

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.109
I don't know," to some of these questions."
But we always thought that if there is life

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:17.680
out there, that it's life as we perceive it;
it's life, somehow, existing in oxygen or

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:23.230
some kind of atmosphere like our own. But
there may be life out there or some kind of

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:28.190
life as we don't know it. I mean, as a mystery
to something that we can't even conceive and

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.170
that, it seemed to me also, was a good metaphor
for just what you were saying about you have

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:37.440
an image in your mind of aliens. John Mack,
who I mentioned before, the Harvard professor

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.930
who thought all these people were actually
being abducted aboard spaceships and everything,

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.880
he didn't see the kind of data and research
that was done that showed that a lot of these

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.530
people who describe these aliens and everything
had these pictures in their minds once these

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:55.260
sci-fi movies started to come out and proliferate.
No accident, I think. These movies were being

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:59.440
made. There was an image of a certain kind
of alien. And people had that image in mind.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.190
There may be aliens out there, but you don't
know what they look like, right? You have

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:07.390
no idea what they look like. Now we're told,
and this is why God has always been so anthropomorphic,

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.510
we're told that we were made in the image
of God. We're told that when you look in the

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:18.369
mirror, you can see, in fact, the image of
God. In fact, Voltaire said, "God created

00:45:18.369 --> 00:45:19.851
man in his image, and man returned the favor."

00:45:19.851 --> 00:45:20.851
[laughter]

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:27.349
It's a good line. But if there is a single
God, and by the way there's an argument to

00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:32.599
be made that maybe the polytheists were right,
maybe there are many Gods. Maybe there's God

00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:37.819
with a pitchfork in the ocean, Neptune, Poseidon,
Apollo driving a chariot in with the sun.

00:45:37.819 --> 00:45:41.980
There's a new book out by Professor Dryfus,
whom some of you may know, he co-authored

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.940
with the Head of Philosophy Department at
Harvard [ ] where they make the argument that

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:51.050
we need to bring back a lot of that polytheism.
A lot of where we've gone wrong is with monotheism

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.940
because this God is such an angry God and
a vengeful God and there have been so many

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:59.400
things done in the name of war and aggression
in His name. And it was always His, His hegemony

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:07.181
and so forth. And I found myself thinking
that this anthropomorphic idea of a god may

00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:12.920
have nothing to do with, if there is a God.
What that force may be. That force may play

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:18.090
no role whatsoever in our lives. It may just
be a primal force that began to create out

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:23.420
of some great Sargasso Sea of netherness,
what we now call our very small, little, blue

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:29.690
planet. Human life may be just one of those
strange accidents that came about, but you

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:34.599
always find yourself going back to those questions
of, "Well, if there was a Big Bang, what was

00:46:34.599 --> 00:46:37.569
before the Big Bang? If there was gravity
before there was Big Bang, what was before

00:46:37.569 --> 00:46:42.190
gravity?" And these are questions that, right
now, we don't have the answers to, and we

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.380
may never have the answers to. However, I
don't know how many of you know Tyson, who

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:55.329
is the host of NOVA, but he said to me in
an interview that, he said, "They're just

00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:58.530
new frontiers, Michael. That's all they are.
They're just new frontiers that we have to

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:03.410
explore and that eventually we'll gain knowledge
about. We just don't have the epistemological

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:08.400
chops right now, but there's always, where
science is concerned, the possibility." Yes.

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:14.140
&gt;&gt;audience #5: Do you find the presence of
religion in certain theories in science, like

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:16.049
the string theory or multiverse?

00:47:16.049 --> 00:47:20.700
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Well, I do in string theory
to some degree because I think, and Bryan

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.240
and some of the other string theorists would
probably say as much, I think it requires

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.789
a certain leap of faith. I mean, if you're
gonna believe the hypotheses behind string

00:47:29.789 --> 00:47:36.050
theory. I did something a number of years
ago, it was really quite a--I write about

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:40.400
it in the book—quite an extraordinary experience.
I was asked by a fellow named Phil Clayton,

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:47.170
who is a philosopher, to be an interlocketer,
an interviewer at Harvard at the Trinity Church

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:53.140
there, for those of you who know Harvard.
And it was a conference on science and the

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:58.270
spiritual quest. And what they did was they
got a hold of some of the major scientists,

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:06.059
both biological and physical scientists, internationally
of our era, who had some sense of faith, belief,

00:48:06.059 --> 00:48:10.369
spirituality, or who were doing research that
seemed to bear out. And in most instances,

00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:16.720
those were the scientists who came. And these
are a pretty brilliant group of people. Now,

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.000
most scientists are either Agnostics or Atheists.
That's just a fact.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.150
[phone beeping]

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:27.299
But these scientists presented data, they
presented phenomenological research, they

00:48:27.299 --> 00:48:31.869
presented all kinds of things that suggested
that there may be like, the Tao of physics

00:48:31.869 --> 00:48:37.510
type of thing, if you read Fritjof Capra's
book, those sorts of things. A deeper possibility

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:44.980
of something spiritual behind what we can't
discern or make sense of. I wasn't convinced.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:52.869
I remained the perennial, the inviolable skeptic
and that's where I remain. Yeah.

00:48:52.869 --> 00:48:59.849
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Thanks for coming. Quick question,
when you were raised, you were raised in a

00:48:59.849 --> 00:49:04.380
severely religious family – sorry if I missed
this in the beginning – were you Bar Mitzvahed

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.270
and was there an acute reason, person, or
incident that led you to change your religious

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:11.900
past or was it over a period of time?

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:16.220
&gt;&gt;Michael Krasny: Now, how did you know I
was bar mitzvahed?

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.220
[laughter]

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:20.670
You could probably guess that I was circumcised,
too, wouldn't you?

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:21.670
[laughter]

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:28.640
Yeah, I was brought up in a Jewish faith and
I was brought up in a way that answered questions

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:35.000
for me when I was younger. And told me that
there was something higher to believe in.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:42.750
It was conservative Judaism, which is more,
in some ways, specifically observant than

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:49.970
reform. You know, the old Woody Allen joke
about the reform: My rabbi was so reformed,

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:50.970
he was a Nazi.

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:53.680
[laughter]

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.680
Dark humor.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680
[laughter]

00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:04.900
I'll tell you what happened 'cause I write
about it in the book. It had nothing to do

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.420
with my later change and shift in beliefs.
In fact, I think I went through probably something

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:14.731
that many people have gone through. There's
nothing even that unique. I just had an intellectual

00:50:14.731 --> 00:50:18.119
springboard in my life where I was reading
people like Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and

00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:25.069
Darwin and Bertrand Russell and I realized
that I'd become a doubter. I didn't have that

00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:31.250
faith that I wanted to cleave to, that I wanted
to hold fast to. And I missed it because I

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.549
think it is something to cherish, because
it gives you comfort and hope and certainty

00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:42.280
and can give you real purpose. What happened
to me when I was a boy though, I write about.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.369
And I've never talked about this and I'd never
written about this. It's funny, I interviewed

00:50:46.369 --> 00:50:51.609
Belva Davis. You all know who she is this
morning? Belva Davis was the first black journalist

00:50:51.609 --> 00:50:56.320
on the West Coast to be an anchor. She does
"This Week" in Northern California for KQED

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.500
television. She's an icon; she's a legendary
figure. She's 77 years old and she's a remarkable

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:07.339
woman who has been a kind of Walter Cronkite,
a trusted figure in broadcast journalism for

00:51:07.339 --> 00:51:13.610
many years and has written a memoir. And she
wrote this memoir and decided, although she

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.920
had never talked about it, that she wrote
about being molested. Because it was important

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:26.839
in telling her story. And I was never molested,
but when I was a sixth grader, I was a young

00:51:26.839 --> 00:51:35.920
kid with a lot of extroversion and desiring;
maybe I was even ADD, I don't know by today's

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.059
standards. I probably could've used some Ritalin;
had a lot of energy. It's all, I think, been

00:51:40.059 --> 00:51:42.681
channeled in better ways than it was when
I was younger, but when I was younger, it

00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:46.559
was being a class clown and acting up and
acting out. And I had a teacher who happened

00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:51.289
to be a Brit, who had taught at the private
schools there, and some of the stories about

00:51:51.289 --> 00:51:56.270
them are unfortunately true. And when I would
act up, or when I would act out, on a number

00:51:56.270 --> 00:52:00.510
of occasions, he would take me, literally
by the ear, or by the scruff of my neck, take

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:05.640
me across the hall into the boy's room and
beat the hell out of me. I mean, we're talking

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:11.250
about slapping and kicking and on a couple
of occasions, at least, I remember one quite

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:14.631
vividly and then I remember there was another
one when he put my head into a toilet. I mean

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:20.380
its dreadful stuff. When you tell it as an
anecdote, it almost sounds funny or farcical,

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:25.079
but when you're a kid and you're going through
that kind of stuff, it's horrible, traumatic.

00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:30.380
And I wasn't a stupid kid, so I decided, I
announced to my teacher one day and to the

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:35.630
class, like Richard Nixon did when he said
there was a new Richard Nixon, I said, "There's

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:40.030
a new Michael Krasny." It had nothing to do
with Nixon; that would be later. And I was

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:45.670
gonna be a good boy and not act up and I became
my teacher's helper and started cleaning the

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:49.730
blackboards and sweeping and doing all these
kinds of things. Trying to be a good boy,

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:54.079
trying to actually win his, to curry favor
with him so he wouldn't beat the hell outta

00:52:54.079 --> 00:53:00.810
me. And what happened was, he asked me to
take a can of yellow paint to a sixth grade

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:05.980
classroom, right across the hall, the other
side of the hall. And it was a big can of

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:11.780
paint and I tripped and the paint went whoosh
down, like a small miniature river down the

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:15.800
hall. And he used to come out and also, aside
from beating the hell out of me in the bathroom,

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.470
he would go into the bathroom to have a smoke,
came out of the room to have a smoke, saw

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:25.750
me standing there looking forlorn with this
yellow river, grabbed me and gave me the worst

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:35.310
beating I ever had and made me mop up the
river. And I went home. As a kid, I kept the

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:39.680
tears in because if you cry and anybody saw
you cry, you were a sissy and that was the

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:46.369
worst thing to have to withstand. Again, if
there's a Heaven, Heaven forefend that any

00:53:46.369 --> 00:53:51.589
one of your fellow boys in this working class
neighborhood I grew up in should see me cry.

00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:56.329
But I went home and there was a little, wooded
area and I went into the wooded area and I

00:53:56.329 --> 00:54:03.960
started sobbing. And I remember exactly what
I said. I said, "I was being good and God,

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:09.960
you know that I was being good. Maybe nobody
else knows. Maybe he didn't know 'cause he'd

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.789
beat the shit outta me, but You know that
I was being good." And that's how strongly

00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:18.190
I believed in God. I believed in God with
that kind of fervor and that absoluteness

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:27.010
of belief, that I felt His presence. And to
lose that because it made sense to me that

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:32.080
I couldn't put into perspective that kind
of God any longer, years later. I mean, I

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:37.180
could remember even just a quick, funny story,
when I was about 14; there was a guy, a character

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.310
in my neighborhood who had – who invited
me over to look at pornography.

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:43.740
[laughter]

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:47.630
Which, a 14 year old kid can be a turn on,
obviously. Especially a testosterone-driven

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:53.730
kid, and he had all this pornography. Nowadays,
you just go on the Web. You have to do everything

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:58.430
you can to protect your children from going
on the Web, it's so ubiquitous. But at the

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:02.039
time, it was pretty verboten and interesting.

00:55:02.039 --> 00:55:05.529
[laughter]

00:55:05.529 --> 00:55:10.260
And then he said to me, "You have to swear
on your mother's life that you won't say anything

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:15.829
about what I'm about to show you." And, being
a curious kid and of course, interested, I

00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:19.630
thought, "OK." He said, "Go ahead, swear on
your mother's life." "I swear on my mother's

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:23.099
life." "That you won't say anything about
what I'm going to show you." "All right."

00:55:23.099 --> 00:55:24.609
Well, this kid, who we called Tweezer--

00:55:24.609 --> 00:55:26.109
[laughter]

00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:35.279
-- so the nicknames, the etymology of some
of these nicknames have been lost in antiquity.

00:55:35.279 --> 00:55:39.359
Tweezer had a mother who you would call now,
a MILF.

00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:40.609
[laughter]

00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:50.180
And does everybody know what that is? OK.
Tweezer actually had photographs taken by

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:58.021
his father, of his mother, naked. He showed
me these photographs and I wanted to tell

00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:02.990
all the guys in the neighborhood that I saw
Tweezer's mother in the buff. But I thought

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:04.269
if I do, my mother'll die.

00:56:04.269 --> 00:56:05.269
[laughter]

00:56:05.269 --> 00:56:10.470
Because I'd sworn and I'd taken this oath
on my mother's life. And I never even breathed

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:15.410
a word of this story until my mother was laid
in the ground, until she died many, many years

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:19.340
later, because that kind of belief can be
that strong. And it's not a belief, in other

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:23.920
words, that God is there and God is rewarding,
but God is punishing, too. And to lose it,

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:29.049
I'm not so sure it's a bad idea to lose the
punishment side of it, but to lose the reward

00:56:29.049 --> 00:56:35.789
side of it, well, that's another story. The
toughest loss me for was the loss of the belief

00:56:35.789 --> 00:56:41.070
that simply, that presence was there. And
that's what I grappled with. Thank you again

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:42.240
so much.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:42.830
[applause]
