can set yourself straight and then you
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.790
can set yourself straight and then you
can prepare for it and that means maybe

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800
can prepare for it and that means maybe
 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.100
can prepare for it and that means maybe
you can stave it off but it also means

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
you can stave it off but it also means
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.870
you can stave it off but it also means
that maybe even if you don't stave it

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
that maybe even if you don't stave it
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.689
that maybe even if you don't stave it
off you can ride it out and that's

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
off you can ride it out and that's
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.090
off you can ride it out and that's
actually the story of Noah because what

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160
there's a flood coming and God is maybe
letting him know and it says in the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
letting him know and it says in the
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110
letting him know and it says in the
story that Noah walked with God remember

walked with God we'll talk about that
more next time but what that would mean

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
more next time but what that would mean
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.770
more next time but what that would mean
maybe is because Noah was straight and

says that that his antennae were working
and he could see a little farther into

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
and he could see a little farther into
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.080
and he could see a little farther into
the future than someone whose vision was

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
the future than someone whose vision was
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.020
the future than someone whose vision was
completely obscured by by fog and chaos

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
completely obscured by by fog and chaos
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.740

and he could tell that things were not
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.920
and he could tell that things were not
going to go well and so he prepared for

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
going to go well and so he prepared for
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.090
going to go well and so he prepared for
it and because he prepared for it well

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
it and because he prepared for it well
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.320
it and because he prepared for it well
then things actually went pretty well

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
then things actually went pretty well
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.719
then things actually went pretty well
for Noah even though the flood came and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
for Noah even though the flood came and
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.609
for Noah even though the flood came and
so that's an interesting thing because

so that's an interesting thing because
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.580
so that's an interesting thing because
that's a that's an indeterminant issue

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
that's a that's an indeterminant issue
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.090
that's a that's an indeterminant issue

problem because that's something that we
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.880
problem because that's something that we
could clearly deal with we know how to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
could clearly deal with we know how to
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.039

might be well do you have your act

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
might be well do you have your act
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.309

with enough advance warning so that you

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
with enough advance warning so that you
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.119
with enough advance warning so that you
can take proper measures maybe just

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129
can take proper measures maybe just
 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.429
can take proper measures maybe just
decide step it maybe just don't go where

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439
decide step it maybe just don't go where
 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.350
decide step it maybe just don't go where
the flood is going to be that's a simple

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
the flood is going to be that's a simple
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.970
the flood is going to be that's a simple
thing but maybe you don't have that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
thing but maybe you don't have that
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.030
thing but maybe you don't have that
luxury right and so it is going to be a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040
luxury right and so it is going to be a
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.160
luxury right and so it is going to be a
catastrophe maybe someone in your family

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
catastrophe maybe someone in your family
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.399
catastrophe maybe someone in your family
is going to get really really sick right

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409
is going to get really really sick right
 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.800
is going to get really really sick right
and maybe maybe there's just a tiny

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
and maybe maybe there's just a tiny
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.170
and maybe maybe there's just a tiny
pathway through that that everything

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
pathway through that that everything
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.420
pathway through that that everything
doesn't fall apart it doesn't end in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
doesn't fall apart it doesn't end in
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.550

catastrophe but the margin of error is

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
catastrophe but the margin of error is
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.869
catastrophe but the margin of error is
like slimmed down to virtually zero and

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879
like slimmed down to virtually zero and
 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.130
like slimmed down to virtually zero and
every imperfection that you bring to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
every imperfection that you bring to
 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.720
every imperfection that you bring to
that situation is going to increase the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
that situation is going to increase the
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.729
that situation is going to increase the
probability that that tragedy is going

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
probability that that tragedy is going
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.349
probability that that tragedy is going
to turn into something indistinguishable

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359
to turn into something indistinguishable
 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.930
to turn into something indistinguishable
from hell and that's coming it's coming

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
from hell and that's coming it's coming
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.240
from hell and that's coming it's coming
your way

your way
 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.009
your way
absolutely certainly and so then you

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019
absolutely certainly and so then you
 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.509
absolutely certainly and so then you
might think well since it's coming your

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519
might think well since it's coming your
 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.670
might think well since it's coming your
way maybe the best thing to do is to put

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
way maybe the best thing to do is to put
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.830
way maybe the best thing to do is to put
yourself together so that when it comes

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840
yourself together so that when it comes
 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.080
yourself together so that when it comes

and maybe it was good enough that's the
 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.290
and maybe it was good enough that's the
thing you know is that this is something

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300
thing you know is that this is something
 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.090

that I constantly wonder is that if

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100

hell that doesn't have to be
 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.930
hell that doesn't have to be
part of life and maybe we could actually

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940
part of life and maybe we could actually
 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.820
part of life and maybe we could actually
tolerate the tragedy and maybe we could

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830
tolerate the tragedy and maybe we could
 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.260
tolerate the tragedy and maybe we could
even rise above it and maybe we could

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270
even rise above it and maybe we could
 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.420
even rise above it and maybe we could
even mitigate it you know because we can

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430
even mitigate it you know because we can
 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.830
even mitigate it you know because we can
we do that sort of thing all the time

shouldn't make and make anyways they sin
right and that's to miss the mark right

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460
right and that's to miss the mark right
 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.040
right and that's to miss the mark right
because that's an archery term to sit

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:29.509
trigger warning every 15 seconds so like
 

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.089
trigger warning every 15 seconds so like

to this story is you know there's an

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:38.810
to this story is you know there's an
 

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.720
to this story is you know there's an
apocalyptic element to the

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:40.730
apocalyptic element to the
 

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.650
apocalyptic element to the
judeo-christian tradition there's an

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:44.660
judeo-christian tradition there's an
 

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.130
judeo-christian tradition there's an
idea that the end of the world is always

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:48.140
idea that the end of the world is always
 

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.410
idea that the end of the world is always
at hand and that you should prepare to

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:50.420
at hand and that you should prepare to
 

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.840
at hand and that you should prepare to
be judged and the thing about that is

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:52.850
be judged and the thing about that is
 

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.970
be judged and the thing about that is
it's true and the reason it's true is

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:54.980
it's true and the reason it's true is
 

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.690
it's true and the reason it's true is
because the end of your world is at hand

00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:58.700
because the end of your world is at hand
 

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.930
because the end of your world is at hand
and it will certainly come and when it

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:01.940
and it will certainly come and when it
 

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.410
and it will certainly come and when it
comes you will be judged because it will

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:05.420
comes you will be judged because it will
 

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.090
comes you will be judged because it will
be up to you to figure out what to do

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:07.100
be up to you to figure out what to do
 

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.470
be up to you to figure out what to do
with the fact that your world just

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480
with the fact that your world just
 

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.050
with the fact that your world just
collapsed and that'll be a moral problem

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:11.060
collapsed and that'll be a moral problem
 

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.960
collapsed and that'll be a moral problem
of ultimate severity because it will

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:13.970
of ultimate severity because it will
 

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.030
of ultimate severity because it will
push you right to your limits and you'll

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040
push you right to your limits and you'll
 

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.430
push you right to your limits and you'll
find out exactly where your unaddressed

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440
find out exactly where your unaddressed
 

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.610
find out exactly where your unaddressed
weaknesses lie because that's what

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:21.620
weaknesses lie because that's what
 

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.890
weaknesses lie because that's what
happens in a crisis and so the reason

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:23.900
happens in a crisis and so the reason
 

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.810
happens in a crisis and so the reason
that that's an archetypal reality and it

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:25.820
that that's an archetypal reality and it
 

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.130
that that's an archetypal reality and it
lurks underneath the entire

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:27.140
lurks underneath the entire
 

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.470
lurks underneath the entire
judeo-christian structure the apocalypse

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480
judeo-christian structure the apocalypse
 

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.630
judeo-christian structure the apocalypse
the impending apocalypse is because we

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.640
the impending apocalypse is because we
 

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.910
the impending apocalypse is because we
always live in apocalyptic times and

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920
always live in apocalyptic times and
 

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.670
always live in apocalyptic times and
your world is always in small ways and

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680
your world is always in small ways and
 

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.640
your world is always in small ways and
large ways coming to an end and so what

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:39.650
large ways coming to an end and so what
 

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.790
large ways coming to an end and so what
do you do you prepare for it you prepare

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800
do you do you prepare for it you prepare
 

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.580
do you do you prepare for it you prepare
for your world to come to an end and

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:45.590
for your world to come to an end and
 

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.800
for your world to come to an end and
then maybe when the end comes you get

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:47.810
then maybe when the end comes you get
 

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.790
then maybe when the end comes you get
another world that'd be a good deal
