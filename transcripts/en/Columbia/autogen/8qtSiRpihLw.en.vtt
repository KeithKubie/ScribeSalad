difference is because you have you can

the certain statements about defacing
 

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.960

constant revolutionary spirit and which

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:53.350
constant revolutionary spirit and which
 

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:56.430
constant revolutionary spirit and which
or Dorner talks about this as being the

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440
or Dorner talks about this as being the
 

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.650
or Dorner talks about this as being the
the search for the new and sort of

00:41:58.650 --> 00:41:58.660
the search for the new and sort of

maintaining this constant reinvention
 

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.290
maintaining this constant reinvention
and I was wondering if throughout your

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:04.300
and I was wondering if throughout your
 

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.320
and I was wondering if throughout your
career as you've been able to witness

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:06.330
career as you've been able to witness
 

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:08.880
career as you've been able to witness
many changes in the 20th and 21st

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:08.890
many changes in the 20th and 21st
 

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:12.120
many changes in the 20th and 21st
century whether you see that the old

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:12.130
century whether you see that the old
 

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.320
century whether you see that the old
order has been replaced with something

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:16.330
order has been replaced with something
 

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:21.930
order has been replaced with something
new and if so how do you there's a sort

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:21.940
new and if so how do you there's a sort
 

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.030
new and if so how do you there's a sort
of paradox or contradiction between the

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040
of paradox or contradiction between the
 

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.940

certain level of stability I wondered

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:42.190
certain level of stability I wondered
 

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.280
certain level of stability I wondered
how you sort of saw this contradiction

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.290
how you sort of saw this contradiction
 

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.420
how you sort of saw this contradiction
playing out between sort of replacing

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:48.430
playing out between sort of replacing
 

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.490
playing out between sort of replacing
old orders with new orders and then what

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:50.500
old orders with new orders and then what
 

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.820
old orders with new orders and then what
if the new orders become too stable and

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:53.830
if the new orders become too stable and
 

00:42:53.830 --> 00:43:03.990
if the new orders become too stable and
then there's a stagnant within that

a week yeah it was the abstract tell you

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:05.800
a week yeah it was the abstract tell you
 

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.520
a week yeah it was the abstract tell you
ten days on the that's an institution

and there are many forms of institutions

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520
and there are many forms of institutions
 

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.810
and there are many forms of institutions
and there are some in some sometimes

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:14.820
and there are some in some sometimes
 

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.510
and there are some in some sometimes
services enough to be constant and some

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.520
services enough to be constant and some
 

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.540
services enough to be constant and some
institution to be just for certain

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:21.550
institution to be just for certain
 

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:25.560
institution to be just for certain
amount of time and the difficulties with

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:25.570
amount of time and the difficulties with
 

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:29.670

institution that's to survive its own
reputation because after a while you

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400
reputation because after a while you
 

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.200
reputation because after a while you
know there is a tendency to to be very

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:37.210

the
no you have to put always that under

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680
no you have to put always that under
 

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.360
no you have to put always that under
scrutiny and sometimes say no no no no

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:49.370
scrutiny and sometimes say no no no no
 

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.790
scrutiny and sometimes say no no no no
it cannot go this way and you have to be

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800
it cannot go this way and you have to be
 

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.770
it cannot go this way and you have to be
more active you you have to sink more

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:53.780
more active you you have to sink more
 

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.950
more active you you have to sink more
you have to in you give me your ideas we

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960
you have to in you give me your ideas we
 

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.210
you have to in you give me your ideas we
will look at that as I mean the

00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:58.220
will look at that as I mean the
 

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.180
will look at that as I mean the
institution is valid in my opinion only

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:01.190
institution is valid in my opinion only
 

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:05.440
institution is valid in my opinion only
if it puts itself under scrutiny every

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:05.450
if it puts itself under scrutiny every
 

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:08.740
if it puts itself under scrutiny every
day and you know that's like the Phoenix

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:08.750
day and you know that's like the Phoenix
 

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.470
day and you know that's like the Phoenix
it has to be burned every day to be

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480
it has to be burned every day to be
 

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:15.310
it has to be burned every day to be
River reborn otherwise you know after a

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:15.320
River reborn otherwise you know after a
 

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.230
River reborn otherwise you know after a
while it becomes a kind of routine

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240
while it becomes a kind of routine
 

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.290
while it becomes a kind of routine
institution and that's the worst time of

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:20.300
institution and that's the worst time of
 

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.710
institution and that's the worst time of
Si and we don't replace we don't want to

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720
Si and we don't replace we don't want to
 

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.750
Si and we don't replace we don't want to
meet place within institutions by all TV

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:28.430
institutions okay so for me that you
 

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.080
institutions okay so for me that you
know I am very careful and I was the

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:31.090
know I am very careful and I was the
 

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:36.820

always inspecting and looking to see
 

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.370
always inspecting and looking to see
what happens simply that and if nothing

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:42.380
what happens simply that and if nothing
 

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.260
what happens simply that and if nothing
happens well you see nothing happens

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:44.270
happens well you see nothing happens
 

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:50.350
happens well you see nothing happens
please just see more thank you stuff

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:50.360
please just see more thank you stuff
 

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.490
please just see more thank you stuff
happened yeah my question is actually

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:54.500
happened yeah my question is actually
 

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.430
happened yeah my question is actually
really similar but maybe slightly

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440
really similar but maybe slightly
 

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.620
really similar but maybe slightly
broader first of all I really respect

00:45:59.620 --> 00:45:59.630
