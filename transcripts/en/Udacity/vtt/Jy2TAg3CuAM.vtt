00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.030
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here's another system of equations. I want you to think about which method

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.210
would be best to solve it, graphing, substitution, or elimination. Again, make

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.496

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:13.624
which one's easiest.
