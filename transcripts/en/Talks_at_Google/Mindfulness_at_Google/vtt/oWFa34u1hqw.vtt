00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.290
DANIEL GOLEMAN: When we started,
meditation was not cool.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.300
It was very uncool--

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.380
ultra uncool.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.000
Now it's ultra cool.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.360
And we want to talk about
that arc, how that happened.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.630
But before we do, we
thought we'd try it.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.650
Over to you.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.570
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
So we thought we'd

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.160
start with a little practice.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.200
By the way, how many of you have
participated in gPause here?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.150
Almost all of you.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.449
OK, wonderful.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:31.990
That's great.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.560
So let's start by bringing
our awareness into our bodies.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.550
You can sit with your eyes
closed or open, whatever

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.140
feels most comfortable.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.940
And finding a posture that's
dignified but relaxed.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.230
Sitting with an upright spine.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.080
And bringing our awareness
to the present moment,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.000
and checking in with ourselves.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.920
What might you be
sensing in your body?

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.480
Pleasant, unpleasant,
neutral sensations.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.860
Bringing awareness to
the body and recognizing

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.610
this extraordinary quality
that we have to be aware,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.860
which really is, in many ways,
the essence of these practices.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.050
And as we sense our grounding,
feeling our feet on the floor,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.880
our sit bones on our
seats, reflecting

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.950
for a few moments on our
motivation for being here.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.840
Recognizing that
these are practices

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.720
which can be helpful
in calming our minds

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.540
and opening our hearts not
just for ourselves, but even

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.220
more importantly for
all of the other beings

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.820
that we touch
throughout our days.

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:47.820
And so let's spend a few
moments steeping ourselves

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:57.320
in this altruistic
motivation and reflecting

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.970
on how a calm presence
and a warm heart

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.310
can be so helpful for
all of our interactions.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:38.630
And so just spending a few
moments bringing our awareness

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:49.650
to different parts of our
body, and using the sensations

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.300
in our body as support for
recognizing this basic quality

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.110
of awareness.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.710
And let's also
spend a few moments

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.820
reflecting on our intentions
for the work that we are all

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:36.438
engaged with, work that depends
upon so many other people,

00:04:36.438 --> 00:04:45.960
and leaning into a sense of
gratitude and appreciation

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.210
for all those who contribute
to the work that we do

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.320
and the benefits that
are enabled by our work.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:28.320
And finally, in these
last few moments,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.860
one of the ways in which
some traditions organize

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.790
a meditation session is to
reflect on our intention

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.850
as we did at the
beginning, and then

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.510
to have a period of
practice, and then

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.640
in the closing moments to
dedicate whatever merit,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.150
whatever benefit may have been
derived from our practice,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.265
we dedicate it to the
welfare of others.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.050
And so spending a few
moments reflecting

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:26.450
on how the kind of calm
demeanor that we can taste

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:33.060
and open-heartedness can
bring benefit to others.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.586
And now for those
whose eyes are closed,

00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:59.160
we can open them, but maintain
that same quality of awareness

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.512
as we bring ourselves back.

00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:04.910
And thank you all so much.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.380
DANIEL GOLEMAN: So that's
what we're talking about here.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:21.160
And our story begins in India.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.800
Is that OK?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.020
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Mm-hmm.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.730
DANIEL GOLEMAN: I somehow
wangled a predoctoral traveling

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.960
fellowship from Harvard to go to
India and hang out with yogis,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.770
and swamis, and lamas.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.100
I was particularly interested in
a yogi named Neem Karoli Baba.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.140
He was well-known in those
days as Ram Dass's guru,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.710
the mysterious yogi
on the blanket,

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.020
and I tracked him down.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.870
I'd been studying clinical
psychology at Harvard.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.840
Clinical psychology is
the art of figuring out

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.806
what's wrong with anyone.

00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:00.870
Neem Karoli Baba
was all about what

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.880
could be right with people.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:09.030
He embodied ongoing
presence, unconditional love,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:14.340
totally relaxed, happy,
joyous, and he was contagious.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.270
There's someone who used
to be here at Google.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.320
He's not here anymore.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.990
His name's Larry Brilliant.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.670
He was there too.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.180
And Larry put it very well.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.940
He said, the miracle wasn't that
he loved us unconditionally.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.700
The miracle was that we loved
each other unconditionally

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.500
when we were with him.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:37.039
He just radiated this aura,
and it was contagious.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.820
And I met a few other
beings like that.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.800
I went back to Harvard, and
I said, hey, you know what?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.690
There's an upside
to human potential.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.890
[CHUCKLING]

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.900
And they said, we don't
care, except for one person,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.420
who is now sitting
right next to me.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.191
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.930
RICHIE DAVIDSON: So
I entered the picture

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.270
as a beginning graduate
student at Harvard,

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.810
and this was in the days
before the internet.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:10.900
Dan had published a few very
obscure papers in a journal

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.600
by the name of the "Journal
of Transpersonal Psychology."

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.590
DANIEL GOLEMAN: It was published
right here, annual publication.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.185
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Yes, a journal
not with a very high citation

00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:18.685
impact--

00:09:18.685 --> 00:09:20.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.950
--but nevertheless, I was
probably one of about eight

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.331
people on the planet who
read these articles of Dan's.

00:09:28.331 --> 00:09:30.497
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Four of
them were relatives of mine.

00:09:30.497 --> 00:09:33.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.940
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
So I knew that Dan

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.220
was a graduate student at
Harvard doing this stuff,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.990
and actually, that was one of
my motivations for going there

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.470
as a graduate student, although
I kept that very subterranean.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.590
I didn't tell the faculty
who were interviewing me

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.710
that one of my attractions
was this crazy graduate

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.390
student named Dan Goleman.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.000
But I attended my
very first class.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.590
It was late afternoon.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.560
And I sat down, and there's
a guy who sat next to me

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.266
in this class.

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:05.140
And I had never seen a
picture of him before.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.680
And I turned and looked at him,
and I said, you're Dan Goleman.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.150
Now, it's not because I have any
well-cultivated psychic powers.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.110
It's because Dan looked like
he'd just came back from India.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.250
DANIEL GOLEMAN: So
the giveaway was this.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.780
I owned one pair of pants.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.100
They'd been made in India.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.540
They were wide wale
purple corduroy pajamas,

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.770
and I think that was a clue.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.540
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
That was a clue.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.160
DANIEL GOLEMAN: That
was a clue, yes.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:28.852
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:28.852 --> 00:10:30.977
RICHIE DAVIDSON: So and
then it went on from there.

00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:35.080
So Dan said, well, would you
like a ride back to your place?

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.620
And my apartment was just a few
blocks from William James Hall,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.820
but I said, sure.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.920
So we walked to
his vehicle, which

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.730
was a VW Microbus,
popular in those days.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:51.160
I get into this vehicle, and
plastered from floor to ceiling

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.010
were pictures of
yogis and holy people.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.280
And it just completely
blew my mind,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.610
and I had the beginning
sense that this

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.800
was going to be an
important source

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.600
of my alternative education.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.660
So that's how it began.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.620
And then, Dan was able to
finagle yet another fellowship

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.600
to go back to Asia a
couple of years later.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.150
And at that time, I was
finishing my second year

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.670
as a graduate
student, and I decided

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.660
that I needed to get a
firsthand taste of this stuff.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.880
And so much to the consternation
of the Harvard psychology

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.840
faculty, I went off to
Asia for several months.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.810
Many thought I
would never return.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.700
I was pretty sure I would.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.790
But for part of that
summer, Dan and I

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.510
were living together
in Kandy, Sri Lanka,

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.430
and we were hanging
out with a forest monk,

00:11:51.430 --> 00:12:00.340
Nyanaponika, who was one of
the experts on mindfulness

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.249
in this region.

00:12:01.249 --> 00:12:03.790
DANIEL GOLEMAN: In those days,
he had published the only book

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.498
in the English language
that had the word

00:12:05.498 --> 00:12:07.040
mindfulness in the title.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.640
It was called "The
Power of Mindfulness."

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.690
RICHIE DAVIDSON: So that was
a major motivation for us.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:19.630
And that summer, Dan
and I wrote together

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.350
the beginnings of
what would become

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.150
a lifelong journey together.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:30.340
And we wrote an article for
another very obscure journal,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.600
and we had a sentence that we
wrote in that article which

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.340
ended up being a very prescient
sentence that we came back

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.010
to many times since we wrote it.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.590
And we weren't quite
sure exactly what

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.260
it meant at the time, but I'll
tell you what the sentence was.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.940
The sentence was this--

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:56.460
the after is the before
for the next during.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.710
I'll say it again.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.210
The after--

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.080
DANIEL GOLEMAN: It's not
going to help, Richie,

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.913
if you say it again.

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:00.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.560
RICHIE DAVIDSON: The after is
the before for the next during.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.760
So what does this mean?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.950
Well, the during is about what
happens when you meditate,

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.350
what happens on the
chair, on the cushion.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.750
That's the state effects.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.940
The after are the
lingering consequences.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.490
Now, when we put our
butt on the cushion

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:29.057
or on a chair and meditate, it's
not for this experience we have

00:13:29.057 --> 00:13:30.890
when we're meditating
that we're doing this.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.480
It's for the impact
it has on every nook

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.040
and cranny of everyday life.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.430
And that's what we
mean by the after.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.110
And so when we say the after is
the before for the next during,

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.600
the after becomes
the new baseline.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.840
It becomes the new default.
And it becomes the new

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.180
before for the next
time we meditate.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:01.580
And those cycles, when
they accumulate over time,

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:08.240
are what is the key ingredient
to instantiating a trait.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.710
And a trait is something that
sticks, a quality that endures,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.539
and this is why we engage
in these practices.

00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:17.330
DANIEL GOLEMAN: We
should say at this point

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.250
it was a huge speculation.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.760
The reason is that the
theoretical and empirical

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.170
scaffolding for
this did not exist.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.740
That's the idea of
neuroplasticity.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.840
That was actually
discovered decades later.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.690
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Decades later.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.780
DANIEL GOLEMAN: So we
were making a lucky guess.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.020
Well, we'll call it
a smart guess now.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.118
Smart guesses are lucky
guesses in retrospect.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:46.400
RICHIE DAVIDSON: So that's
really where all this began.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.600
And at the time that we started,
there were actually three

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.050
scientific articles that had
been published on meditation--

00:14:54.050 --> 00:15:00.950
one by Kasamatsu and Hirai on
three Japanese Zen meditators,

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:06.470
the second article by Anand
et al., an Indian scientist,

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.330
on some Indian yogis--

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.500
DANIEL GOLEMAN: No, no,
one yogi in Samadhi,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.810
and he put a hot
test tube on him.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.950
And nothing happened,
according to Anand.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.200
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Right, right.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.040
And then the third article was
an article by Keith Wallace

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.650
and colleagues on
transcendental meditation.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:30.380
That was the sum total of
the empirical literature

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.390
on meditation when we began.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.210
DANIEL GOLEMAN: However,
despite the advice

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.790
to the contrary of our
mentors and professors

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.000
at Harvard, we decided to
add to that literature,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.150
and we each did our
dissertation on meditation.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.430
However, now that we've
written this book,

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.270
there are more than 6,000
peer-reviewed articles

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.341
on meditation.

00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:53.090
There are more than a
thousand a year now.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.620
We used very rigorous standards.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.410
We boiled 6,000 down to 60.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.330
Our research didn't
make the cut, did it?

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:02.850
RICHIE DAVIDSON: No.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.641
DANIEL GOLEMAN: No.

00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:05.589
Our early research--
his research does.

00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:07.130
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
Not the early stuff.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:17.630
And so in the book, one of the
key things that we describe

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.440
is what happens at different
levels of practice.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.030
And so when we began the
serious scientific research

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.780
on meditation, we actually
began on the far end

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.800
of the continuum.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.630
And we did that because we were
urged by His Holiness the Dalai

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:41.150
Lama to please study the minds
and the brains of practitioners

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.730
who spent years
training their mind,

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.140
to investigate using modern,
sophisticated neuroscientific

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.390
methods what might be different.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.290
And so that was
where all this began.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:58.700
And for a couple of years,
we flew practitioners

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.630
from India, Nepal,
Bhutan, and a few

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.640
from France who were
living in a retreat

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.089
center in southern France,
and they came to Madison.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:13.339
And we probed and interrogated
their brains and their bodies

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.369
in many different ways
to see, initially,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.800
if there was a there there.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.470
And we decided to
start at this point

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.300
because if we
didn't see anything

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.369
in these really
long-term practitioners,

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.910
it would be unlikely that
we can use the same tools

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.370
and investigate rank beginners.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.760
And so that was the
original strategy,

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.780
and it was a strategy
that really paid off

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.050
because we saw a
number of things

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.840
that were very unusual in
these long-term practitioners.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.230
Now let me say that these
are professional meditators.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.090
They meditate as
their full-time gig.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:57.440
So the average lifetime
practice of these individuals

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.675
is about 34,000 hours.

00:17:58.675 --> 00:18:00.050
DANIEL GOLEMAN:
I think we should

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.800
explain the different levels.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.930
So we see meditation as
falling into different baskets.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.080
The first is the hard-core
professionals, like these yogis

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.250
that are flown over.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.800
They live in a
culture that supports

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.900
people to just meditate.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.950
They are professionals.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.610
They're monks.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.151
They're nuns.

00:18:17.151 --> 00:18:18.140
They're yogis.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.020
They do it all the
time, and these cultures

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.910
understand the value of that.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:27.860
So they get very
deep in practice,

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.530
but a very small
proportion of people

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.600
actually do it at that level.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.240
Then there's one level
out, how these practices

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.350
are brought to the West.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.400
For example, I don't know
if you know Spirit Rock

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.990
up in Marin, which is
a traditional Vipassana

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.430
Theravadhan meditation practice
which has been exported.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.860
It's been taken out of
the cultural context.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.840
A lot of things get
left behind, but it's

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.440
adapted so that it is
more accessible to us,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.760
to Westerners.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.690
So you may not go as deep.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.160
That's an open question.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.320
I suspect not.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.590
But many, many more people
will have the experience.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.650
Then there's a further remove,
which actually the Dalai

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.500
Lama urged Richie to kick off.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.260
He said to him at one
point, our tradition

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.890
has many methods for managing
destructive emotions.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.250
Take them out of the cultural
and religious context,

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.370
test them rigorously in the
lab, and if they're of benefit

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.960
to people, spread them widely.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.490
And that's the third level.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:29.150
It's methods like mindfulness
that have been brought

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.880
to scale so anybody can do it.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.130
But you don't have to have
a particular belief system.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.430
You don't have to have a
particular cultural attitude.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.760
And those three
tranches, if you will,

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.170
are the subject of different
levels of the research that's

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.344
been done.

00:19:46.344 --> 00:19:47.510
So you're back to the yogis.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.093
RICHIE DAVIDSON: So
back to the yogis.

00:19:49.093 --> 00:19:51.470
Let me just give you
two examples of findings

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.650
from the yogis that are
particularly striking.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.890
One is-- and this is actually
the subject of the very

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.940
first paper we published,
which was published in 2004,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.430
and it came out in the
"Proceedings of the National

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.550
Academy of Sciences."

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.750
And it was the first time
a paper on meditation

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.000
had ever appeared
in that journal.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:21.410
And if you look at the graph
of the number of publications

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.530
per year in meditation
or mindfulness,

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.930
you'll see an inflection
point in 2005.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.250
There's a very noticeable
inflection point,

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.530
and that, we think, has to do
with this initial paper coming

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.170
out basically showing that
there was a there there,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.991
and it helped catalyze
a lot of research.

00:20:40.991 --> 00:20:43.532
DANIEL GOLEMAN: I thought was
my book "Destructive Emotions."

00:20:43.532 --> 00:20:45.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.667
We'll talk later.

00:20:46.667 --> 00:20:48.750
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Your book
"Destructive Emotions,"

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.850
what year did it come out?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:50.290
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Around then.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.560
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Yes, OK.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.100
DANIEL GOLEMAN:
It doesn't matter.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.530
RICHIE DAVIDSON: They
both played in a role.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:53.930
DANIEL GOLEMAN: OK, thank you.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.950
He is such a diplomat, and
he's gotten much better

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.120
since he's been a meditator.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.180
I knew him back when.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.720
And my wife says I've gotten
nicer too, by the way.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.970
That's the metric that counts.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.511
RICHIE DAVIDSON: And those are
the best unobtrusive measures,

00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:10.830
getting reports from
significant others around you.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.280
And we'll tell some
stories about that.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.040
So back to the yogis.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.630
We put EEG electrodes on them.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.910
And one of the
things that we found

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.820
which was very, very unusual--

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.470
and it took us about a year to
run all these control studies

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.490
to convince ourselves that
this was actually for real--

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.680
is we saw a very pronounced
gamma oscillations.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.860
Gamma oscillations can be
recorded from the scalp surface

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.830
using brain electrical
measures, but typically

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.200
in the average
brain, they are seen

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.010
for very short periods of time,
typically less than one second,

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.480
most often around a
quarter of a second.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.860
And these oscillations
appear when

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.960
there is a particular
insight that you may have.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.110
So if you're
engaged in a problem

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.820
and a solution emerges just
spontaneously and very quickly,

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.421
you will see a burst
of gamma at that point.

00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:05.920
And there are
experimental studies--

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.190
DANIEL GOLEMAN: You know what?

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.920
I think Google runs on
these bursts, doesn't it?

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.585
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:09.585 --> 00:22:11.210
RICHIE DAVIDSON: We
call it intelepsia.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:18.880
So you see that kind of thing
in normal, untrained people,

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.320
but in the yogis we see it go
on for seconds and minutes.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.300
And that was really
unusual, and we

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:34.060
had to rule out all kinds of
alternative explanations, which

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:39.670
we had to do to get this
in a high-profile journal.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.220
And subsequently,
it's been replicated

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.100
by a number of other
people and interestingly

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.190
in some other work that
we've done with practitioners

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.260
who are not as
advanced, but still

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:57.430
are long-term practitioners, but
more like those with day jobs.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.130
We see the presence
of gamma oscillations

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:05.860
even during sleep, which may be
indicative of a residual strand

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.040
of awareness that
persists throughout sleep.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.100
So that's one unusual finding.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.120
The second finding
is something that I

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.010
think we all can relate to.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.490
It was a study that we did
on pain, on physical pain.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.780
And using strong
stimuli of this sort

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.870
is one effective way
to challenge and probe

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.160
the mind and the brain.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.280
It's like a cardiologist
using a cardiac stress

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.370
test to look at
cardiovascular function.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.580
We were using a
mental stress test

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.500
to look at the
mind and the brain,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.510
and we can do this
with physical pain.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.800
So we use a device
that neurologists

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.700
use to test
temperature, and it's

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:57.250
a device that's compatible for
the MR scanning environment.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:01.570
And it's a very thin
metal plate that

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:06.190
gets strapped to the ulnar
area, which is very sensitive.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.340
And we have very
rapidly circulating

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.460
water that goes
through there, and we

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.210
can regulate the temperature of
the water very, very precisely.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:21.340
And the temperature of the
water for this is at 49 degrees

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:26.800
centigrade-- around 137-ish
degrees Fahrenheit--

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.590
and we have this stimulus
on for 10 seconds.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.040
And most people can take
it for a few seconds,

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.380
but after the fourth
or fifth second,

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.540
it's pretty excruciating.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.480
But we can adjust
it so that it's just

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.590
below the threshold for
producing tissue damage.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.830
So we can deliver
it quite safely.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.420
And so here's the experiment.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.840
We give people a zap of this so
they know what it feels like.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.200
And then in the experiment,
we give them a cue--

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.820
for example, a tone--

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.430
which denotes that
in 10 seconds,

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.330
they will get zapped
with this pain.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.390
So there's an
anticipation period

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.540
that begins with the
tone, which is 10 seconds.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.580
They then have 10
seconds of pain,

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.940
and then they have 10 seconds
that we call a recovery

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.120
period, which is
simply 10 seconds

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.140
after the thermal
stimulus goes off.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.420
Now, if you take
an average person

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.880
off the street who
has no mind training

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.352
and you give them an
initial taste of the pain,

00:25:31.352 --> 00:25:32.810
you then put them
in the experiment

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.270
and present the tone
which tells them

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.510
that they're getting the
painful stimulus in 10 seconds,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:42.980
in response to the tone alone,
virtually the entire pain

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.900
matrix of the brain activates.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.710
So it's as if
they're experiencing

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:50.555
the pain in response to the
tone, and it's dramatic.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.070
And they show that.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.630
They then get the pain.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.970
The pain matrix
continues its activation.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.660
And then during the
recovery period,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.140
they're still activated.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.580
They are still
reverberating and ruminating

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.710
about the painful stimulus.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.560
And what you then
end up seeing is

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.370
they're essentially getting
a triple dose of the pain

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.650
during these three blocks.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.570
You take the long-term
practitioners

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.630
and you present the tone,
and you see activation

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.430
of the auditory cortex.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.750
That is, they heard the tone.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.770
DANIEL GOLEMAN: No pain matrix?

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.150
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
Virtually no pain matrix.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.350
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Wow.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.000
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
It's really flat.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.090
In response to the
painful stimulus itself,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.940
they actually show significantly
heightened activation

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.790
compared to controls in the
sensory regions of the brain.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.780
So if you look at somatosensory
cortex for example,

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.720
they actually show
greater activation

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.860
in that region compared
to the controls.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.860
And then in the recovery period,
they come right back down

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.620
to baseline.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.850
So it's a very sharp
inverted v-shape function.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.150
And among the controls,
they are showing

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.510
this very flat and
highly activated

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.400
across all three periods.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.350
And the activation in the
anticipation and the recovery

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.640
period actually accounts for
a very significant amount

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.330
of the variance in
reports of distress.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.320
And so this is something
quite practical

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.070
and one of the most dramatic
differences that we see.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.660
DANIEL GOLEMAN: There
was another one.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.860
I happened to see the
first subject run.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.480
I was there in the
FMRI control room.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.300
And for statistical analysis
reasons, the subject--

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.960
the person in the human cigar
tube, the FMRI, the MRI--

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.870
was asked to do the following.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.320
We'd like you to do a
concentration practice for--

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.100
90 seconds?

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:53.430
RICHIE DAVIDSON: 90 seconds.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.830
DANIEL GOLEMAN: 90 seconds,
and then you'll hear a tone.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.090
Stop for 60.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.260
Then do it again for 90.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.340
And then stop, and--

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.910
like four times, and then three
different kinds of meditation.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.970
I don't know about you, but
when I sit down to meditate,

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.810
it takes a while for my
mind to actually focus

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:11.340
on the meditation.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.020
There's a saying in Tibet-- at
first, it's like a waterfall.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.150
They're talking about
the mind and thoughts.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.740
Then it becomes like a river.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.140
And then finally,
it's like a lake.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.930
But these people all went
to the lake immediately.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.990
There's this amazing
mental agility

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.080
that goes along with it.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.871
So I don't know if you
ever published that,

00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:32.246
but I think that's
important too.

00:28:32.246 --> 00:28:34.037
RICHIE DAVIDSON: No,
it's really important.

00:28:34.037 --> 00:28:36.665
And by the reports, they're
able to do this and their brain

00:28:36.665 --> 00:28:37.665
changes instantaneously.

00:28:37.665 --> 00:28:40.510
DANIEL GOLEMAN: But what about
people right at the beginning?

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.620
Let's talk about that.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.140
So let's say you're
just starting

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.160
this for the first time.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.880
You're not like a professional
yogi, but it's interesting.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:53.500
What happens with beginners
is really telling.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.137
The benefits start
from the get-go.

00:28:56.137 --> 00:28:57.970
One of the things that
you see, for example,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.534
is how it impacts multitasking.

00:29:00.534 --> 00:29:02.700
I don't know that that
happens here at Google, but--

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.340
--other places, I understand.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.120
So multitasking, of course,
means you're working on that

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.030
one thing, that really important
thing you have to do today.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:12.960
You're very absorbed.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.960
Your concentration is here.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.570
Then you think, oh,
I better check my--

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.420
do you have some
incoming-- what's your--

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.110
AUDIENCE: Email.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.610
Email.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.594
DANIEL GOLEMAN: No, but
there's a special Google thing.

00:29:23.594 --> 00:29:24.260
AUDIENCE: Email.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:24.895
[LAUGHS] It's still email.

00:29:24.895 --> 00:29:25.811
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Email.

00:29:25.811 --> 00:29:27.330
OK, you have to
check your email.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.480
People, on average, check their
e-mails more than 70 times

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.480
a day.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.340
If you do your email, well, then
you have to answer the email.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.090
Then you have to look
at that other email.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.080
Then there's your text.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.038
And then there's your
this, and that, and that.

00:29:39.038 --> 00:29:40.950
And then you go back
to that original thing.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.690
Your concentration was up here.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.350
Now it's down here, and it
takes a while to ramp up again.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.320
The brain does not
operate in parallel.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.820
It switches rapidly, and you
lose concentration, unless you

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.040
did 10 minutes of mindfulness.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.380
It turns out that 10
minutes of mindfulness

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.020
mitigates that loss
of concentration.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.420
If you do it three
times during the day,

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.280
your covered for
the day, it seems.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.730
So that's something
really handy.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.370
Attention gets better.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.950
Handling stress gets better.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.440
And I'm talking about
the stuff of life.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.000
Life is stress.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.950
So ordinarily, when
we get stressed,

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.860
the amygdala and circuitry
around the amygdala

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.110
is a trigger point for the
fight, or flight, or freeze

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.190
response.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.220
So the amygdala gets
triggered, and stress hormones

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.390
flood the body.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.790
And the recovery time--

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.460
the time from peak of
that to calm again--

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.020
is an operational
definition of resilience.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.990
It gets shorter, and the
long you've been a meditator,

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.500
the shorter it gets, the
less often you're triggered.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.920
And when you do get triggered,
you don't get triggered as--

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.220
it doesn't become as high in
terms of stress hormone levels

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.220
and so on.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.240
And then the third impact,
which is really interesting,

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.610
has to do with the meditation
called loving-kindness,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.760
kindness, which is
traditionally done

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.370
at the end of a
mindfulness session.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:12.090
In loving-kindness--
I think you actually

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:16.870
did a kind of loving-kindness--
you think about not just

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.330
yourself, but people you love,
people you know, strangers,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.030
a widening circle, and
you wish them well.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.590
You wish yourself well, and
you wish everybody else well,

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.460
that they be safe, and happy,
and healthy, and so on.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.420
And it turns out that that,
which is really more cognitive,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.610
it's not just trying to keep
your attention in one place

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.530
and bring it back
when it wanders.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:42.730
That's the basic repetition
in most meditation.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.160
This is a mental exercise.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.230
It's almost
attitudinal, but it has

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:51.490
remarkable effects on the
biology and on the brain.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:57.910
For one thing, the mammalian
circuitry for parental love,

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.120
a parent's love for a
child, becomes stronger.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.030
People become more likely to
notice when someone else needs

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.560
help and actually help them.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.030
People get more generous.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.660
So at the beginning
level, just doing,

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.310
say, eight weeks,
half hour a day,

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.370
15 minutes, whatever,
it does have an impact.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:15.870
And then--

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.800
RICHIE DAVIDSON: And one
of the other findings

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.880
with the loving-kindness that's
so interesting and important

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.510
in our national scene
today particularly

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.450
is a reduction in implicit bias.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.155
And so implicit bias
is an unconscious bias,

00:32:32.155 --> 00:32:35.980
a bias that is obsessed
with more objective means.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.930
So a person can fill
out a questionnaire,

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.300
and on the
questionnaire, you can

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.390
report that you have no
bias against various kinds

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:44.470
of out-groups.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.410
But on these implicit
measures, many people still

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.780
show evidence of some bias.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.230
And what's been found is
that even short amounts

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:58.510
of loving-kindness practice
have lingering effects

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.001
in reducing implicit bias.

00:33:00.001 --> 00:33:02.500
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Hey, that might
be relevant to the diversity

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.520
program.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.390
RICHIE DAVIDSON: I
think it might be.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:05.556
DANIEL GOLEMAN: It might be.

00:33:05.556 --> 00:33:06.450
OK.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.220
I just wanted to
drop that hint here.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.040
So then there are the mid-range.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.490
So how many people
here who are meditators

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.620
have been doing it for
more than a year or two?

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.590
OK, these findings apply to you.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.140
To us-- I'm in
that category too.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.100
What are they?

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.740
RICHIE DAVIDSON: So
with middle range

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.440
meditators, here
is where we begin

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.390
to see evidence of trade
effects, and by trade effects

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:40.920
we mean that the baseline
is now different.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.640
And so using various
kinds of indices,

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.610
we see evidence of
changes in the brain

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.670
and in the body
which do not depend

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:56.070
upon being in a meditation state
itself, but rather represent

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:59.490
enduring changes both in
the brain and in the body

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.380
as well as in behavior.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.740
So let me give you
one example of that

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.520
in the realm of
behavior, which turns out

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.560
to be quite important.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:16.659
There is a phenomenon known
as the attentional blink.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:24.060
And the attentional
blink is seen

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.739
when a series of rapid
stimuli are presented

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:31.800
and you're asked to look for
a particular kind of stimulus,

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.090
and you notice one
instance of that.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:41.969
And if a second instance occurs
in a closely spaced point

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.400
in time, you will not notice it.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.510
You'll be unconscious.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.639
Your attention will blink.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:51.090
And scientists have regarded
the attentional blink

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.110
as a kind of refractory
period of the mind.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.360
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Wait a minute.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.884
Don't you mean like spacing out?

00:34:55.884 --> 00:34:57.300
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
Spacing out, yes.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:57.990
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Exactly.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.740
This happens to us
all all the time.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.280
So basically, your
attention wanders.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.270
I remember talking
to one guy who said,

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.580
when I'm in a business
meeting and my mind wanders,

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.790
I wonder, what opportunity
did I just miss?

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.580
Or if you're with someone that
you happen to be in love with

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.920
and your attention wanders,
what emotional cue did

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.784
you just miss?

00:35:17.784 --> 00:35:19.200
That's what this
is about, really.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.510
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
Right, and so if you

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.250
stop to notice
cues, for example,

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.020
during into personal
interaction,

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.430
whether it's with a
partner, with a team member,

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.520
there's an enormous
amount of information

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.460
that gets transmitted
very quickly in a given

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.900
unit of time.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.680
And our ability to
function effectively

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.870
depends upon us picking
up on those cues.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:47.310
And if we can reduce
the attentional blink,

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.040
we will be noticing more stuff.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.560
And it turns out that
the attentional blink

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.530
is significantly
reduced among people

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.040
who are doing longer-term
meditation practice,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.300
and it does not depend upon
being in a meditation state.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:09.380
That is, it is a
lingering trait effect.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.490
In the domain of
attention, we probably

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.620
have some of the
very best evidence

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.209
that these effects endure.

00:36:15.209 --> 00:36:17.250
DANIEL GOLEMAN: But isn't
that like a no-brainer,

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:23.580
because meditation of any kind
reduces to attention training?

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.380
I mean, other things go on.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.230
But for example, if you're
doing mindfulness of the breath,

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.880
your contract with
yourself is, I'm

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.640
going to keep my attention,
my focus on the breath.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.830
But the mind wanders.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.080
Maybe you're familiar with
the famous study at Harvard

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.810
where they gave
people an app that

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.690
rang their phone at
random times a day

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.680
and asked three questions--

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.030
what are you doing?

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.150
What are you thinking?

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.630
How do you feel?

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.570
Well, if what you're thinking
doesn't match what you're

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.910
doing, your mind is wandering.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.890
And they use this
to get a metric

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:01.440
for how frequently it wanders
and in what situations and also

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.910
the mood it puts you in.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:07.860
So the mind, on average,
wanders 90% of the time

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.140
during commutes.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:10.680
Right?

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.440
You know that.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.240
The next term I'm a
little sorry to say.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.490
When you're looking
at a video monitor--

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:19.750
this is for other
people, not Googlers--

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.210
and when you're at work.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.540
90% of the time for most people.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.670
Not here, but for most people.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.487
It's only 10% of the time
during romantic moments.

00:37:30.487 --> 00:37:31.320
Well, wait a minute.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.020
Who answers an app at
the moment like that?

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.510
I think that data
maybe we'll put aside.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.720
And then the general take-home
is that the more your mind

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.440
wanders, the less happy you
are, because the mind tends

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.170
to wander to problems
we're having--

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:50.169
problems in relationships,
particularly; that email.

00:37:50.169 --> 00:37:51.960
2:00 in the morning,
you're thinking about,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.480
why did she send me that email?

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.020
Why did I send her that email?

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.730
But that happened two weeks ago,
and we're still thinking about.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.000
So in other words,
the mind ruminates.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.590
But when you meditate,
your contract

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:09.230
is, I'm going to bring it back
every time it wanders off.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.730
So you focus on the breath.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:11.610
Mind wanders.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.980
You notice it wander.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.120
Bring it back.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.450
That's the mental
equivalent of going to a gym

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:18.440
and lifting weights.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.810
Every time you lift
the weight for a rep,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.400
your muscle gets
that much stronger.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.970
And what you're doing
here is amping up

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.249
attentional circuitry.

00:38:27.249 --> 00:38:29.540
RICHIE DAVIDSON: So maybe we
should take questions now.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.540
So we have 15 minutes or so.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.410
AUDIENCE: I had two
questions today.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.140
The first one is just
a quick clarifier

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:42.370
on the yogis that could
handle the anticipatory--

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.870
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Could you hold
the mic closer to your mouth?

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.360
AUDIENCE: Yes, the
anticipatory pain response.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.540
Were they primed to be in
a meditative state before?

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.390
RICHIE DAVIDSON: No.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.870
And then my second
question-- this is maybe

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.390
a little more general.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:59.480
It's really out of curiosity
of your guys' experiences

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.270
in bringing meditation
from an Eastern place

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.160
and taking it to the West.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.290
I know here in the
West, we all often

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.920
use timers to help us
bound the time between when

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.130
we enter the practice and
get out of the practice.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.010
And I'm curious to know if
that is heavily more Western

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.920
or if you found that--

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.010
are there timers within temples,
if you will, with people--

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:24.370
DANIEL GOLEMAN: OK, so when
I lived in India two years,

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.120
I never saw a timer.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.640
They may not have
been invented then.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.560
But I think it's a
typically Western thing.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.530
I mean, I hung
out with Tibetans.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:42.330
In old Tibet, among nomads,
there were two times a day.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:45.380
They lived in yurts.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.330
They had fire in the
middle, and they had a hole

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.830
so the smoke would
leave the yurt,

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.340
in the middle of the yurt.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.690
So one time was before
the sun hits the fire,

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.220
and the other time was
after the sun hits the fire.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.480
In other words, being
so pressed for time

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.200
is a uniquely Western
condition, particularly

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.911
in these traditional cultures.

00:40:05.911 --> 00:40:07.410
AUDIENCE: I feel
like I can't really

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.966
meditate unless I have a
timer because I'm anticipating

00:40:10.966 --> 00:40:13.090
that I'm going to just get
lost in it or something,

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.150
and I'm going to
lose track of time.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.100
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Well,
I think it's good.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.260
I mean, a timer is
fine, because you

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.720
don't have to peek at
a watch or something

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.260
to see what time it is.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:27.070
I mean, I've used timers too.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.339
Just not in the Asian culture.

00:40:30.339 --> 00:40:32.630
AUDIENCE: I have a question,
actually, about the Center

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.900
of Healthy Minds.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.750
So can you share
a little bit more

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.640
about what you're doing
there and how that's

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.220
impacting well-being
in the workplace

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.170
and what we can learn about it?

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.270
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Sure,
thanks for asking, Rachel.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.800
So our center at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.580
is called the Center
for Healthy Minds,

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.810
and we have three
major pathways.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:56.630
One is a research pathway,
which is our core DNA,

00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:00.230
and we do both basic research as
well as translational research

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.280
in field settings.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.260
We also have two other pathways.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.880
One is an innovation pathway
where we're committed now

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.070
to being activist scientists.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.810
Our mission, by the
way, of the center

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.330
is to cultivate
well-being and relieve

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:18.110
suffering through a scientific
understanding of the mind.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.970
That's our mission statement.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.040
And in the innovation
pathway, we

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.510
formed a nonprofit corporation
to partner with our center

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.120
where we are developing
products and services

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.210
to bring out into the world
that are based on our research.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:35.210
And so one of the
things that we're doing,

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:39.440
a major, signature
project, is to develop

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.810
a comprehensive digital
platform to cultivate well-being

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.000
in workplace settings
initially, but we

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.740
envision this being more generic
and revising it so that we have

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.200
versions for different sectors.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.860
And it's not a
mindfulness program.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.890
It includes mindfulness,
but it has four modules.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.220
One is called Awareness.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.720
A second is called Connection,
which is really about kindness,

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.460
compassion, appreciation.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.800
The third is Insight, which is
focused on cultivating insight,

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.430
particularly into
how the self works,

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:22.820
what our healthy relationship
is to the narrative

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:26.240
that we carry around in
our minds about ourselves.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.700
And the fourth module
we called Purpose,

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.980
and it's focused on
helping an individual

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.310
to identify their core
meaning and purpose in life

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:38.330
and, most importantly, to
align their everyday behavior

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:40.130
with what that purpose is.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.760
And we also have a suite
of assessment tools

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.910
that will be implemented
on mobile devices that

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:52.520
will enable the measurement
of each of these four modules.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:58.190
That is, measuring the specific
constructs that are impacted

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.080
by each of these four modules.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.370
And the measurements
are in four categories.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.590
One is questionnaires,
which are obvious.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.980
The second is experience
sampling of the sort

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.920
that Dan described in
that Harvard study.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.530
The third are
neuroscientifically

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:14.840
grounded behavioral tasks.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.400
So they are tasks that measure
reaction time and accuracy that

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.920
are implemented on a mobile
device that will enable

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.280
measurement of different
aspects of attention,

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:31.580
empathic accuracy, generosity
with economic decision-making

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.890
tasks, and so
forth, all of which

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.630
have been studied
neuroscientifically,

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.600
all of which can be
implemented on mobile devices.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.380
The fourth category are
device-generated data.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:47.360
That is, data using
GPS coordinates to help

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.390
an individual understand
where their well-being may be

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:54.830
particularly high, where it may
be particularly not so good,

00:43:54.830 --> 00:44:00.290
and also to provide information
on social media use and doing

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:05.210
some initially simple content
analyses of the content

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.650
of social media,
particularly, for example,

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.890
the use of personal pronouns--

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:11.750
I, we, they.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.870
It turns out to be
very diagnostic.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:21.050
And also emotion adjectives--
pleasant, unpleasant,

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.260
for example--

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.500
are things that we
can easily capture.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.410
So this is a work in progress.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:32.210
IDEO has partnered with
us as a design firm

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:37.790
to help design the key
aspects of the user interface.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.240
And we will be doing some
pilot testing of this

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.590
and rolling it out
beginning in January.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.600
So that's our
innovation pathway.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.680
And let me just say very
briefly the third pathway

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.090
is our movement pathway.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.090
We believe that we are part
of the social movement,

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.930
and the simplest way to
capture it is the movement

00:44:56.930 --> 00:45:01.910
is about changing the cultural
meme around the simple idea

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.776
that well-being
can be cultivated.

00:45:04.776 --> 00:45:06.150
AUDIENCE: How do
we regard or how

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.270
do you regard a
meditation or stillness

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.790
practice with
emotional intelligence

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.050
or emotional awareness?

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:13.770
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Oh,
the relationship

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:15.930
between meditation practice
and emotional intelligence.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:16.030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:17.940
For example, one could
argue that if you're

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.810
on a mountaintop
for many decades,

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:26.190
that that may not necessarily
invest in your ability

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.150
to be in relationship with
people, hypothetically.

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:30.270
DANIEL GOLEMAN: OK.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:35.520
I think there is an indirect
way in which elements

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.380
of emotional intelligence
are definitely

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.350
boosted by meditation practice.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.510
I think your point about having
no relationships at all is

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:45.930
well-taken, because that's
the arena in which you

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.752
would probably
display and experience

00:45:48.752 --> 00:45:49.710
emotional intelligence.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.219
But for example, there are
four main components the way

00:45:53.219 --> 00:45:53.760
I look at it.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.190
There's self-awareness,
using that awareness

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.910
to manage yourself better,
either positive motivations,

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.420
positive outlook, and so on,
or handling stress better.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:08.010
The third is empathy, bringing
this to your relationships

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:10.434
and sensing what other
people are feeling,

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:11.850
and then putting
that all together

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.400
to have positive relationships.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.260
And I can see a
very definite way

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.840
in which the experimental
literature points

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:24.930
to how the first two are
boosted by mindfulness practice,

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.520
by meditation.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.370
Your ability to introspect--

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.860
I mean, it's training
and looking within.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:36.210
And then to use that to manage
yourself better in many ways

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.250
and probably to extend
that to empathy.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.250
On the other hand, I don't think
that it does the whole trick.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.810
I think that there--

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:47.310
I have a model of 12
competencies that are nested

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.900
in each of those four domains.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.930
For example, persuasion
and influence,

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:56.400
or conflict management,
or a positive outlook--

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.990
they might be helped
to some extent,

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:00.830
but I think each of those
is learned and learnable

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:01.500
over and above.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.800
By the way, there's something
that you didn't mention.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.520
For those of you who like to
listen to books instead of read

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.430
books-- and it may be people
who are seeing this on screen--

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:18.430
this is available as an audio
book from Key Step Media.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:22.020
Key Step Media also
has primers on each

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.540
of the 12 emotional
intelligence competencies.

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.060
You could look at those
and decide for yourself

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.390
which meditation helps a lot,
a little, or not so much.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:34.080
RICHIE DAVIDSON: And Dan
himself read the book, so

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:34.810
an added benefit.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.060
DANIEL GOLEMAN: It's my
[? mellificent ?] voice on it.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:37.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.482
AUDIENCE: I heard a
study on NPR where

00:47:40.482 --> 00:47:41.940
they were studying
unconsciousness,

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.040
when you take certain
kinds of drugs, anaesthesia

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:44.982
to put you out.

00:47:44.982 --> 00:47:47.190
And they said it was a wave
that goes back and forth,

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.260
a very long wave that
just oscillates back

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.660
and forth through the brain.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.610
And I was thinking that in
terms of your gamma bursts

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.070
and also in terms of how--

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:58.510
I know this is a field--
but how consciousness works.

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:03.650
So if the mind just has
lots of different centers

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.580
that are constantly
communicating with each other,

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.210
and that's what it
is to be conscious,

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:12.442
how does meditation affect
that and that communication?

00:48:12.442 --> 00:48:14.400
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Answering
that question really

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.560
deeply would require
a lot of time,

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.320
but let me give
you a few tidbits.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.380
One of the things that we
see when we see these gamma

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.020
oscillations is not simply
their elevated presence,

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.970
but we also see a
striking synchrony.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:33.780
So if you look at the phase
relationships of these gamma

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:39.150
oscillations across widespread
regions in the brain,

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:44.500
you can compute a metric of
synchrony based on the phase.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.550
And it turns out that these
gamma oscillations are highly

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.710
synchronized across the brain.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.900
So it's not simply
that they're elevated,

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.690
but they're also
highly synchronized.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.480
And the amplitude
and the synchrony

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.050
are not necessarily correlated.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.600
They're not always correlated.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.210
In these practitioners,
they're highly correlated.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:08.340
And so the synchrony,
we think, is--

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:12.330
synchrony as a metric
of brain connectivity

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.170
has been intensively
investigated

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:16.620
in the basic
neuroscience literature.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.990
And it is indicative of
increased communication

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.870
among brain regions.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.750
And so the way
these practitioners

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.870
describe phenomenologically
their experience,

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:34.400
it's a kind of
panoramic awareness.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.760
It's a very broad
panoramic field

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.700
that they report in
their experience.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.040
And it may be that
this synchrony

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.200
is a kind of neural
echo, if you will,

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.840
of that panoramic awareness.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.550
The stuff you mentioned
about anesthesia,

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:57.840
anesthesia is associated with
pronounced delta oscillations,

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.610
which are very low frequency.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:02.160
And one of the really
intriguing things is--

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.899
I alluded to this earlier.

00:50:04.899 --> 00:50:06.690
It's a published study,
and you can get all

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.700
our scientific publications.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.190
They're available
free on our website.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:17.010
But one of the things that you
see in experienced meditation

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.050
practitioners is
gamma oscillations

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:24.020
superimposed upon these delta
rhythms during deep sleep.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.210
It's the first time anyone has
ever seen gamma oscillations

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.730
during deep sleep.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.910
And it may be indicative of a--

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:35.580
these highly experienced
practitioners

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.910
often report that even
when they're sleeping,

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.160
they never completely
lose awareness.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.118
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Tell them
about the Dalai Lama.

00:50:43.118 --> 00:50:43.699
[AUDIO OUT]

00:50:43.699 --> 00:50:44.740
RICHIE DAVIDSON: --story.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.080
I was with the Dalai
Lama a few years ago

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.770
when he was about to
undergo some minor surgery.

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:55.510
And we were just chatting,
and he said to me

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:59.540
that he's concerned about
one thing about the surgery.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.740
And I asked him what
that was, and he said,

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.620
this will be the
first time in his life

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.630
that he is unconscious.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:10.520
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Meaning he has
awareness even when he sleeps.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.020
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Yes.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:11.811
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:51:11.811 --> 00:51:13.491
I have two questions,
hopefully quick.

00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:14.990
The first one, Dr.
Goleman, you said

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.180
that the one of the
benefits of meditation

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.840
is recovery time from an
amygdala trigger is reduced.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.477
Does it also change
the threshold at which

00:51:23.477 --> 00:51:24.560
the amygdala is triggered?

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.270
DANIEL GOLEMAN:
Yes, I did say that.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:26.030
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.453
DANIEL GOLEMAN: You said it
better, but I did say that.

00:51:27.453 --> 00:51:27.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:27.954 --> 00:51:29.328
AUDIENCE: And the
second question

00:51:29.328 --> 00:51:32.000
was, how often and for how long
do the two of you meditate?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.280
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Yes,
there's some evidence

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.300
to indicate that the
threshold changes,

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.470
but that's still very
much preliminary,

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.322
I would say, at
this point in time.

00:51:41.322 --> 00:51:42.780
DANIEL GOLEMAN:
The second question

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.010
was how much do we meditate?

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:44.910
AUDIENCE: Yes, sir.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:46.770
DANIEL GOLEMAN: You
mean for how many years

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:47.580
have we meditated or--

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.600
AUDIENCE: No, no, your practice.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.380
Daily, hourly--

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.820
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Oh,
it depends on the day.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.520
Some days not a lot,
and some days a lot--

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.521
AUDIENCE: (LAUGHING) OK.

00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:56.561
DANIEL GOLEMAN: --for me.

00:51:56.561 --> 00:51:57.760
I don't know about Richie.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.790
RICHIE DAVIDSON: For me,
anywhere between a half hour

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:03.060
and a couple hours.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.247
DANIEL GOLEMAN: We're
hard-core, though.

00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:06.580
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Hard-core what?

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.755
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Meditators.

00:52:10.755 --> 00:52:12.460
AUDIENCE: I also
have two questions.

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:16.720
And my first question
is, is the meditation

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:21.260
only useful to a
certain type of person?

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.300
My other question is,
can we do other activity

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.360
and do meditation together?

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.360
For example, my friend
told me when she's driving,

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.250
she's also doing the meditation
while staring the license

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.370
plate of the front car.

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:40.870
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
When she's driving?

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:43.750
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:46.660
RICHIE DAVIDSON: So those
are great questions,

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.880
really great questions.

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:55.690
And let me address the second
part of your question first.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:59.710
We don't really know from
a hard-core scientific

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:05.500
perspective whether engaging
in meditation practice

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.210
while you're doing
something else, so to speak,

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:13.450
is as effective as simply
sitting and doing meditation

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:16.000
in the more conventional way.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.050
In this digital platform,
this healthy minds program

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:23.830
that we're building, we actually
give a person an option,

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:26.320
because we've heard
this from so many people

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.980
that the very idea of taking
another minute out of the day

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.380
to do something to
reduce their stress

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.150
will increase their stress.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:37.030
And so what we say
is that that's fine.

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:40.220
You actually don't need to take
even a minute out of your day.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.240
What you should do
is simply identify

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.850
an activity of
daily living that's

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:49.990
non-cognitively demanding in
which you regularly engage.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:51.550
It could be commuting.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:55.690
It could be doing your laundry,
washing the dishes, whatever

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:56.680
it might be.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:00.910
And during that activity,
you can engage in a practice.

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:02.200
But we don't know--

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.210
there isn't any
data at this point.

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:08.800
There aren't any data that speak
to whether practice in that way

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.810
is as effective.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:12.820
Maybe it's 70% as effective.

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:13.840
We just don't know.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.490
We are studying that now.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:21.090
And the first question you
asked is whether meditation

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:23.310
is for all people.

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:26.040
There are hundreds of
different kinds of meditation,

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:28.050
and one of the things
that we often say

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:30.090
is that one size
does not fit all.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.450
But I will tell you what the
very best kind of meditation

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:37.940
is to do.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.240
So are you ready?

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.450
This is really the best.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:47.610
The very best kind of meditation
based on everything we know

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:49.920
is the meditation
that you actually do.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:52.429 --> 00:54:53.220
SPEAKER: Well said.

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.529
RICHIE DAVIDSON:
Whatever that might be.

00:54:55.529 --> 00:54:56.320
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.069
We are out of time,
but thank you so much,

00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:59.160
Dr. Goleman, Dr. Davidson.

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.285
RICHIE DAVIDSON: Thank you.

00:55:00.285 --> 00:55:03.110
[APPLAUSE]
