perspective I'm not sure if it's
 

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:50.569

terribly well known but in a sense

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:50.579
terribly well known but in a sense

always done in our Yahoo labs context is
 

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.919

institutions was kind of a natural thing
 

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.830
institutions was kind of a natural thing
to do and once the first idea sort of

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:40.840
to do and once the first idea sort of
 

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.720
to do and once the first idea sort of
took root we started talking about what

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:42.730
took root we started talking about what
 

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.490
took root we started talking about what
we might do together then it was pretty

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:44.500
we might do together then it was pretty
 

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.900

our folks working together found some

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720
our folks working together found some
 

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.800
our folks working together found some
really interesting kind of joint ground

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:12.810
really interesting kind of joint ground
 

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.250
really interesting kind of joint ground
in which they could work and so the

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.260
in which they could work and so the
 

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.440
in which they could work and so the
arrangement ends up allowing Carnegie

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:18.450
arrangement ends up allowing Carnegie
 

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.450
arrangement ends up allowing Carnegie
Mellon to do exactly what it needs with

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:20.460
Mellon to do exactly what it needs with
 

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.310
Mellon to do exactly what it needs with
all the intellectual property that it

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320
all the intellectual property that it
 

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.620
all the intellectual property that it
creates I guess I could put it that way

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:24.630
creates I guess I could put it that way
 

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.390
creates I guess I could put it that way
and I think that was very important to

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:26.400
and I think that was very important to
 

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.180
and I think that was very important to
both parties and in our case on the

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:29.190
both parties and in our case on the
 

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.280
both parties and in our case on the
Yahoo side were most excited really

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:31.290
Yahoo side were most excited really
 

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.030
Yahoo side were most excited really
about the collaboration and IP

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040
about the collaboration and IP
 

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.410
about the collaboration and IP
specifically was not really the point of

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420
specifically was not really the point of
 

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.690
specifically was not really the point of
this so in fact I think we worked out a

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:38.700
this so in fact I think we worked out a
 

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.720
this so in fact I think we worked out a
really perhaps a role model working

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:41.730
really perhaps a role model working
 

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.600
really perhaps a role model working

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.540
relationship I don't know certainly if
we do other big things with this

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:46.550
we do other big things with this
 

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.010
we do other big things with this
institution and we have a very firm

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:49.020
institution and we have a very firm
 

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.840
institution and we have a very firm
foundation for building on top of that

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:50.850
foundation for building on top of that
 

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.150
foundation for building on top of that
and part of our hope is to make lots of

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160
and part of our hope is to make lots of
 

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.280
and part of our hope is to make lots of
other universities quite jealous so

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:55.290
other universities quite jealous so
 

00:16:55.290 --> 00:17:26.130
other universities quite jealous so
we'll see how that works

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:26.140
 
 

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.990
 
it's a great question thank you

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000
it's a great question thank you
