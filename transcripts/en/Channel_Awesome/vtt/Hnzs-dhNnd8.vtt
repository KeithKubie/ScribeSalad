*Disneycember theme*

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.619
It's The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody the movie yet again another movie based on a show I didn't watch and if this movie

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.880
is any indication of what the show is like I think it's pretty obvious why I did watch it.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.500
The suite life starts off by ironically having nothing to do with suites. In fact it's actually on a ship

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.260
I'll just assume something happen in the show to make that happen.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.660
Actually it's a little weird seeing how Zack and Cody aren't

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.959
technically in the title of this movie only the suite life is and yet there's no suite in it so honestly this entire

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.590
movie is a complete lie. Regardless Zack and Cody are identical twins

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.069
but one of them has a problem he won an internship to get into Yale,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.470
which means he can't hang out with his girlfriend for a bit.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.170
She gets pissed off splitting up with him and to make things worse his smart aleck brother messes up his internship getting him thrown out.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.670
But it looks like the scientist

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.929
he was working with has another internship for him one that involves no surprise twins.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.949
So they're both sent to this lab that

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.099
experiments on twins to see if they can create a certain fruit where the more you eat it the more you can feel each other's

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.259
pain grow empathy and eventually become one mind. But wait isn't that a bad thing? Well yes.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.319
it is when we discover that the scientist actually has evil plans to turn all twins into one hive and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.499
force them to take over I don't know the world.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.589
It's kind of a weird plan for kind of a weird movie. So the biggest problem with this film is very obvious

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.009
it's not funny, but I don't think it's supposed to be funny to me.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.480
This is funny to the same crowd that liked to say Good Burger like little little kids.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.080
One of the earliest jokes they have is mishearing mammal for camel.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.220
Mr. Mosbey: Actually London their not fish their mammals.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.400
London: But they don't have humps.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.620
And if you didn't laugh of that, I'm sorry, that's what they think is the best joke in fact

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.220
they do it four times in the film.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220
Mr. Mosbey: Their not fishies their mammals.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.320
London: Then why don't have humps.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.840
The movie is mostly filled with humor like this and actors that aren't bad, but are good either.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.459
It's slow clunky awkward, but again

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.229
I think it's that way because it's mainly aiming for a little little children to be watching it.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.169
And yeah, you might be arguing don't our little kids deserve better, and yeah sure, but at the same time

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.179
there's nothing really harmful in this.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm not watching this think it's like Camp Rock 2 where there's actually a bad message or bad ideas being thrown by.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.389
It even once in a while gets a little bit of a giggle. Like the delivery from the mad scientist is legitimately well-timed.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.180
Yeah once in a while the girlfriends delivery can get a few laughs.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.200
Everything else is just kind of what you think would be done with this concept

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.540
just kind of slow and not funny

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.240
But I'd be lying if I said I couldn't see an audience of little kids watching this and having a fun time.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.160
Is there anything in it for adults? No is there anything really that great for kids in it?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.119
No, if nobody sees it is anyone gonna miss out on anything? Probably not, but nothing is gonna be made worse by saying it either.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.639
It's like a sock puppet show there's nothing really to it, but what's there really to get angry at either?

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.729
It's hitting the right crowd and not making anything worse.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.920
I know that's definitely not a glowing recommendation.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.529
But what can I say this movie didn't leave that big an impact on me if you liked it you're probably the exact right age

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.010
group for it, and if you don't you're probably the exact wrong age group for it.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.289
I guess I could be angry and say kids deserve a lot more, but honestly it's just not worth the effort.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.089
It's Zack and Cody it's stupid, but it's painless. Take it for what it's worth and just be happy

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.269
it's not Cheetah Girls. If you think that's the best thing I can say about it

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.800
you're right.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.600
Later
