1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,860
Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's a
whole nother TJ things. Oh bummer.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,130
That's a bummer. If you don't
know what we're talking about.

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:12,090
Tj Dillashaw tested
positive for injectable EPO,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,780
which is a serious performance
enhancing substance.

5
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:19,620
And in some circumstances,
according to Jeff Novitsky,

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,520
it's given people strokes.
Um, and I had heard this too,

7
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:27,240
that like young guys doing like Tour
de France type shit would have strokes

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,330
because they were taking too much apo.
Cause you know,

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:34,070
like if you're supposed to take one, take
two, fuck it. [inaudible] right, right,

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,940
right. That's the mentality.
This mentality's anybody
who's going to do that. Yeah.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,910
You know, I shit turns your, your, your
blood to paint. And I think that's what,

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,030
I guess that's probably the
discipline might have held,

13
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:49,410
people were always getting
away with things beforehand,
right. Is to try to, uh,

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,750
maybe try to do it in a way where they
won't get caught. But I think that's like,

15
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:58,440
Oh, if this much is good and this is much
more, it's going to be better. And Yeah.

16
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,840
And we know guys who've done
that with TRT. You know,

17
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,750
there was a few our t tests where they,
when tea,

18
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,050
our tea was legal testosterone
replacement therapy. Um,

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,910
where you would hear about guys tests
and like 14 hundreds, 14, 70, like,

20
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,370
which is insane.
It's like superhuman.

21
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:18,250
No person has ever lived that as 1400,
uh,

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,770
like as a natural walking
around testosterone level.
That's crazy. Hyper human.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,490
But they just get these benefits from
that with some of these people though who

24
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:30,000
walk around naturally. I wonder if they'd
never been tested though. That's true.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,740
Yeah. Some of these people I see
walking around like genetic freaks do.

26
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,110
Looks like he was born on steroids.
Yeah. There are some freaks, man.

27
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,370
There's some legit genetic freaks to deny.
That would be crazy.

28
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:45,750
There's some people that just like,
Yo, all Ramiro. What in the fuck?

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,120
It doesn't matter how
many steroids you take.

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,870
It doesn't matter what you
do like to do look like that.

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,100
You have to be a genetic freak. Yeah.
They're out there walking around.

32
00:01:56,101 --> 00:02:00,860
It's not fair. Who you'll always talking
about. He would say go to Cuba. Yeah.

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,670
Jeans, go see the jeans. What
have you been look around? Yeah.

34
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:10,470
What's his name? Um, think
a fighter from France,

35
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,580
the heavyweight from France.

36
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:16,581
I mean he presents in Ghana for Francis
in Ghana was a guy who used to be the

37
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:20,830
one who had the, the crazy
fat would pat. Pat Barry. Oh,

38
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:24,000
we Congo check Congo.
Oh yeah. Adonis. Yeah.

39
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,490
Sculpted Greek statue.
Yeah.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,720
He's just always imagine like I want
to go to where he comes from. What,

41
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:33,090
let's just take a look around.
Probably super athletes.

42
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,780
Probably a lot of
mediators. Um, the TJ thing,

43
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,900
apparently they went and
tested his old fight.

44
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,640
A piss with Cody too.
And that tested positive for EPO as well.

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,960
And then Cody started freaking out. Yeah,
that's right. What do you do if they,

46
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,590
if they go back, like what did they
decide to go back? Hey and say fuck it,

47
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:57,360
let's test all the fights and it finds
out that he was doing it like five,

48
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:01,150
six, seven fights. What do do well, yeah.

49
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,800
And then what do you do if you,
uh,

50
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,380
but then that's a whole
nother can of worms too.

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,850
Because like all the fights and then
what about all the, because right,

52
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,990
like when we get a test,
everybody,

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,800
Chad Brenton job and I were joking around
last night and I was like test them

54
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:18,970
all and he's going, no, no, didn't
test them all. Test everything.

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,140
Let's find out, let's know what it was,
let's know what it was. And he's like,

56
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:28,120
what if they had pissed samples
from you know, 10 years ago,

57
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,200
15 years ago.

58
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,360
Like what if they could use you sada
style testing today from the past.

59
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,930
I'm so glad that all these
things are above my pay grade
to deal with that. Yeah.

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,690
Yeah man.

61
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,690
If I was the guys in the office
right now in charge of that program,

62
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,300
you have to really
wonder where is the line.

63
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,300
You certainly want to test a guy for
a fight that happened a week ago.

64
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,250
You certainly want to hold,

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,850
you know and check is if some
new testing methods come out.

66
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,000
If there was a fight from a year ago,
you certainly would check that.

67
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,190
How many years back do you
go though? Yeah, especially
if it's not expensive. Like,

68
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:11,191
what if it's easy and cheap to do a
test run 500 tests in the last 500

69
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:16,090
championship fights and then you have
like 400 fights that you now have to like

70
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:19,720
change the result of
yeah,

71
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,670
I dunno. I Dunno either. Yeah.
Last night I was joking around,

72
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,410
I was saying testimonial.
I was, I was taking the,

73
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,720
the fun position test a mall.
I Dunno.

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,730
I mean look,

75
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:38,380
we all know at one point in
time performance enhancing
drugs were a huge part of

76
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:42,580
mixed martial arts and that's why the
UFC stepped up and decided to institute

77
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:44,020
this program.
There's a big part of it.

78
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,000
I think it's a big part of professional
sports in general. Sure. 100%. Yeah.

79
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,590
And I think that, um, you know,
uh, combat sports, you know,

80
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,890
has a government oversight
that other sports don't have.

81
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,350
So I think that we're kind,
we're going to be,

82
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,640
it's going to be coming up regardless
anyway. So I think maybe that's why the,

83
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:06,040
you know, to the UFC took a
position, right? Because I
think of the other sports.

84
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,410
I mean guys,
you get caught doing things,

85
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:12,640
but a lot of the other sports regulate
themselves, right? Yeah. I don't know.

86
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:16,120
I think the NFL regulates itself.
What are those core has?

87
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,500
What does this board has a government
body like athletic commission saying, Hey,

88
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,060
we're going to show up and do
this or do that. I don't know.

89
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:26,320
Like what do they do with
baseball? I don't know. I don't
know. Maybe. I don't know.

90
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:29,010
I don't know much about other
sports, but I didn't. I've heard of,

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,160
I've never heard, I've never heard
of like a, we all know about we,

92
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:36,400
you know that's something different.
Our support, the government involved

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,970
have a commission would not, not, not
like he's saying a government commission,

94
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:43,540
but they just, yeah, they're governing
themselves. The NFL would have a vote.

95
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,030
They hand down the suspension.
They're not fair from this.

96
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,270
This guy suspension at that
guy's suspension and baseball.

97
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:50,590
They have like a three strike rule.

98
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,070
Like that first time is like somewhere
in the 10 to 25 game range and then the

99
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,530
second one is like half the season.

100
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,040
Third one out for a whole year
and if you do it again, your

101
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,480
band, there's no outside getting it shows
up and decides to test your champion.

102
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:05,860
Right. Just the baseball or
NFL or basketball and the side.

103
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,540
What's the best?

104
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,780
You have a big moneymaker in your
sport and then somebody outside of your

105
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,720
company just comes along and says,
yeah, I'm, I'm the government by,

106
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,780
they have the right to test this guy.
Yeah. Like what happened with John Jones?

107
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,080
Yeah. I mean that's,
that's a perfect example.

108
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,380
I mean the UFC did not want
John Jones to test positive.

109
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
He is the biggest star right now other
than Connor and Connor is not active and

110
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:33,830
Jon Jones is fighting all the time.
He wants to fight all the time.

111
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,870
That if there that's,

112
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,050
but that's the only way you ever find
out what's really going on is you hire a

113
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:43,880
bunch of werewolves and he just
let them loose. Right. Go check,

114
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,990
Piss, go, go out there,
check, check everyone.

115
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,280
They checked the shit out of people.

116
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:53,330
I was looking at this list of people
that Holly Holmes been tested more than

117
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,570
like, I think, I think
Novitsky might've put it, oh,

118
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:00,830
Steve paid meo chick tweeted it because
he'd been tested 38 times. Really? Yeah.

119
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:05,390
Some people, it's like in the forties,
cris Cyborg got tested a lot. Yeah.

120
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,740
And Holly Holm got tested a lot, Huh?
Yeah. Yeah. Holly Holm got tested. A lot.

121
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,570
Lot of people get tested.
Um, it's just, uh,

122
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,010
like crazy numbers and a lot of them
are guaranteed their waking them up,

123
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,310
you know, get 'em up like six in the
morning. This is what I've heard. I mean,

124
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,720
I don't know what they go by.
I've heard conversations a little bit is,

125
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,540
doesn't seem like it's, no, they
want to make sure you're there.

126
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,610
So they get there really early
in the morning and fucked up.

127
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
Tell him where you're supposed to, where
you're going to be at and think, yeah.

128
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:39,380
Yeah. The problem is if you're training
hard, that eight to 10 is so huge.

129
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:40,760
You might get hit with a punch.

130
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,940
If they wake you up after
like six hours or five hours,

131
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,410
it's possible that a punch my connect on
you that wouldn't have connected if you

132
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:52,190
got eight that's not brash.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's real.
That's real. That's real.

133
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,000
Everybody knows when you, how you
feel good in the gym and everybody,

134
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,930
even if you just lift weights,
there's days you feel good days.

135
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,130
Daisy feel like crap. I made sure
I showed up here. Well rested,

136
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,060
you look well rested and I'm hydrated.
I'm like, can we get bathroom? I did.

137
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:09,470
I did hydrate. Yeah. I mean,
I don't know. It's just,

138
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,390
it's,

139
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,990
it's just not smart to stop athletes in
the middle of their training camp and

140
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:15,980
wake him up.
Yeah.

141
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,490
I mean I get the testing but I feel
like the testing so sophisticated,

142
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,690
you could get to them at noon. Okay.
Just so you could get to them at noon.

143
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,040
You got good testing now. So we
don't we, I mean I don't know that.

144
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,370
I don't know that either. I'm talking
shit cause I think the best time, right?

145
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,840
That best time is that, you know, maybe
the early years earlier the better. Right.

146
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,990
Maybe, I don't know. The thing
about this EPO apparently,

147
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,600
and this was a shop was telling
me was that they didn't,

148
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,280
it didn't use to be a detectable
the way it is now. They've,

149
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,340
they've got these new methods of
detection and a eps one to that.

150
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:55,590
Apparently from what I've read, don't
listen to me, I'm not a doctor. Um,

151
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,570
they can absolutely tell
that you injected it. It's a,

152
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
it's injectable. It comes
in the injectable form.
That's what's in the bottle.

153
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:07,730
So there's no chance of a tainted steroids
or tainted, um, a supplement. Right,

154
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:12,660
right. It's definitely EPO.
So that's, that's fucked up.

155
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,830
Cause apparently that stuff
has a giant advantage. Um,

156
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,580
it gives you an anabolic advantage.

157
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,030
It also gives you crazy
recoup recuperative powers.

158
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,210
So like you could train really hard
and then be ready to go the next day.

159
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,060
What do you think the
answers cause like for me,

160
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,520
like this is all stuff that like,
to be honest,

161
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,120
I don't really pay that much
attention to it because I don't have,

162
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,300
I always say it's out of
my wheelhouse to deal with.

163
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,820
But also it's hard to have an answer.
Like you said,

164
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,700
like do we go back and keep testing
them when these new things come and says

165
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,310
what do we do with the history
to haul? Yeah. Yeah. It's just,

166
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:47,190
it's very interesting. You know, what
do you do with the history books?

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,130
That's what you'd say.
Look at what point if,

168
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,390
if you have samples that
date back 10 years too,

169
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,840
you do chest them all like what do you do?
I don't know.

170
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:58,760
I don't know how long they keep samples
or how, who has them or how they,

171
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,000
you know, what's the chain of command? Um,

172
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,500
I don't know man.
It's just,

173
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:08,240
but if you find out that TJ tested
positive for the Cody fight too, well,

174
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,910
Cody shirt has an argument there.
And what if it's the fight before that?

175
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,730
What if you took a lot of that was
a lot of people have arguments.

176
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,550
There's a lot of guys. Yeah. So
it's, yeah, it's, it's tough.

177
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:22,551
To me it's a shame too because I'm a
Tj fan and I think he's a phenomenal

178
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:27,150
fighter and a, I'm, I'm a big
fan of watching him perform.

179
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,140
Um, but just, it taints
his legacy. It just does.

180
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:34,830
There's no way around it
when you get caught cheating,

181
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,030
which is this stuff is,
there's no way it's not cheating.

182
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,730
I mean this is just cheating, right?
I mean this isn't any accident. It's,

183
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,060
it taints your legacy right there. And
the guy had an amazing legacy, you know,

184
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,580
two times bantamweight champion,
one of the best pound for pound fighters.

185
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:54,540
The way he beat Hanan Barao I was like,
Holy Shit.

186
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,460
Did he went out and fought Hanan Barao he
was sparring with, yeah. Yeah. His stuff,

187
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,600
the stuff, some of his fights
were amazing. He's amazing. Yeah.

188
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,420
It doesn't take away from the fact that
he's amazing. Tj is an amazing fighter.

189
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,310
But fuck man,
that to test positive for EPO.

190
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,600
And the Henry. So Hutto funding is
also crazy to watch the progression,

191
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,320
all the work he did and how much, you
know, he was getting better every fight.

192
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,920
And so he came to this. Yeah, but
you got to think like how much,

193
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
like if you're on EPO,

194
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,950
how much does that really
allow you to train extra time?

195
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,560
How much does that allow you to recover?
What's the benefit?

196
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:33,400
Like what is the quantifiable benefit?

197
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,990
And it must be pretty significant
because there's a lot of, you know,

198
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,800
the cyclists, a lot of heavy
duty endurance athletes use it.

199
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,460
Yeah. I almost want to try it. You know,

200
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,450
they say that these executives are trying,

201
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,560
they're doing EPO and entering into
triathlons and shit like that for bragging

202
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:56,680
rights. Yeah, just assholes,
assholes with money or take an EPO.

203
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,270
Like really I was reading the thing
about an epidemic of a really a boost you

204
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,170
that much like,
okay,

205
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,570
you're going to take it and you're going
to notice that you're able to like,

206
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,920
like the other day you could barely finish
a role, a loop around the rose bowl,

207
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:12,400
a three mile loop. And then you started
taking it and you can get what, five,

208
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,100
six miles in. I wonder. I wonder.

209
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,550
I think what it does is it raises your
threshold if you're already an elite

210
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:21,670
insurance athlete too.
I think for them that's what it is.

211
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:23,470
It's like they're already
looking for that extra edge.

212
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,860
So they're already in elite endurance
athletes are already in the Tour de France

213
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,480
and they take that EPO and it's
like, whoa, just just Jackson mom.

214
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,070
They could just do more work. They have
more oxygen, they don't run out of juice.

215
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,240
And for a guy like Tj, his style is
so kinetic. There's so much movement,

216
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:43,780
explosion, switching stances.
Like he needs that juice.

217
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,970
It's not like a calm, easy game where
he's, you know, everything is fast,

218
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:53,720
fast, fast, fast, fast.
It's crazy. It's hard. It's,

219
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,510
it's a hard one to swallow. Yeah,
man. So for me, like I was like, man,

220
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,630
I was to come on Joe Rogan's
show and let's see, what was he?

221
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,450
Could he talk about to
make me uncomfortable to
talk about maybe some hard

222
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,310
stoppages? Man, I've talk
about some hard stop at, just

223
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,200
give me what's the wars went a little,
let me talk about when I made a mistake.

224
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:17,610
I don't want to talk about this.
You know what I'm talking about? No,

225
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,560
I'm just being, I have no answer for it.
I don't understand that. It's like, oh,

226
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,403
I'd want to like,

227
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,050
I just doesn't feel like a
good conversation because
all I could do is just,

228
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,580
it just get,
like you said,

229
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:32,140
it's just going to take away from what
I've seen of Athens and the more I

230
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,040
imagine about it,

231
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:37,750
it's just going to be more takeaway and
then anything I could say or think about.

232
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,010
I can't think of anything. That
solution or our sister. Yeah,

233
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,590
yeah, yeah. I don't think anybody,

234
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,280
I mean I think we're in this stage right
now where they're probably looking at

235
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,450
the data going,
okay,

236
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,460
what does this signify and how many more
people should we test? You know, once,

237
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,560
once they develop a new method of testing,

238
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:00,100
that's the whole reason why they want to
keep the old samples anyway in case new,

239
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,490
more sensitive methods of
detecting are invented.

240
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,500
And you know about this stuff
because I know the truth.

241
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,480
You're a science freak and you're saying,
especially,

242
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,020
especially when it comes to
anything that can enhance the,

243
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,780
this life that we have on this earth.
So yeah,

244
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:18,610
I'm sure you know a lot about this stuff.

245
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,640
While I've had a really
amazing conversation with um,

246
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,090
many people about it and,
uh, David Sinclair was one
more recent ones who did, uh,

247
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,110
this discussion about life extension
and different, uh, anti aging,

248
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,640
uh, solutions and different things
that they're coming up with.

249
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,360
But what I've come through with is at
the other end is there are probably

250
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:48,901
hundreds of thousands of people that
are involved in either legitimate

251
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:54,991
supplements or molecules or
testing hormones on people or,

252
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,321
you know,

253
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:01,370
trying all these different things to
try to figure out how to get the body to

254
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,443
perform better.

255
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,350
Some of them are legal and some of them
are illegal and that's where it gets

256
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:10,130
strange. She get like the guy, like the
ball co Guy Vic to contact comes along.

257
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,920
It's like, live, I've got one. You just
rub it on. No one's gonna know shit.

258
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,950
They don't even know what this stuff
is yet. Uh, and for a while, yeah,

259
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,630
that worked then, but, but [inaudible]
but while it worked, everybody was like,

260
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,250
hm, why is Barry bonds getting so big? You
know, people just started wrecking like,

261
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,390
mmm, come on man, look at me.
Sammy Sosa, look at me in the eye.

262
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,240
What are you doing?
You know? And they all,

263
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,400
they all like exhibited these obvious
physiological changes where the,

264
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,170
you could tell them whatever they
were doing was really effective stuff.

265
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,990
There's hundreds of thousands of
people working on that right now,

266
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,870
all the time on all the time
trying to get it better.

267
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,930
There's probably thousands of people that
are trying to come up with stuff that

268
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,550
sneaks past this testing.
