As we've talked about, emotions are involved in many different systems in our

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:07.248
brain and body. But did you know that culture also shapes emotion. One of the

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:10.720
most important ways in which culture shapes emotion is in how we learn when

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.897
it's appropriate to express different emotions. Different cultures have

00:00:15.897 --> 00:00:20.142
different rules for when it's okay to express certain emotions. These are

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:21.160
called display rules.
