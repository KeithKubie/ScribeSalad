00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.260
Tampons are great!

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.840
They let you frolic on the beach in a tiny
bikini smiling with your friends!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.980
At least, that’s what the commercials say.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.830
In reality, they come with the very serious
risk of toxic shock syndrome.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.750
Hey guys and gals, Amy with you on DNews today
talking about an unfun aspect of already not

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.310
so fun periods.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.480
Menstrual cycles obviously aren’t new, and
neither are tampons.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.610
Ancient Egyptians made disposable tampons
from softened papyrus while Ancient Greeks

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.850
wrapped lint around a small piece of wood.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.870
Other cultures over time used wool, paper,
vegetable fibers, sponges, grass, and, eventually,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.870
cotton.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.020
The modern tampon with an applicator was debuted
in the 1930s, but tampon in the United States

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.540
use didn’t really kick off until the 1970s.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.340
An initial trial phase saw the product very
well received, and by 1979, tampons were nationally

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.880
marketed in this country.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.940
Almost immediately, the health risks became
apparent.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.140
Tampons are, interestingly, classified as
a medical device because they alter the biological

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.440
functionality of the body.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.969
They are masses of cotton or synthetic material
inserted into the vagina to absorb menstrual

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:04.969
blood.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.140
But problems can come with having something
absorbent hanging out inside you.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.380
This is where toxic shock comes in.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.470
It’s still not perfectly understood, but
researchers have some idea of how this rare

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.140
disease is contracted.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.980
Our bodies have tons of bacteria crawling
around inside, and vaginas are no exception.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.200
The staphylococcus bacteria — commonly called
Staph — is normally and harmlessly present

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.380
in the vagina.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.760
Tampons can give that bacteria a breeding
ground and entryway into the blood stream.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.900
It’s possible that inserting and removing
a tampon can lead to micro tears in the vaginal

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.900
wall.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.500
Once that tampon is in place, it absorbs all
fluids, not only menstrual blood but also

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.180
the natural lubricant in the vagina leaving
it dry and more likely to these micro tears.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.150
And that saturated tampon becomes an incredibly
supportive environment for the rapid growth

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.150
of bacteria.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.439
It’s possible that this toxic bacteria can
enter the bloodstream through those micro

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.440
tears to go deeper into the body.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.100
This can lead to a high fever and low blood
pressure that in turn can deprive organs of

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.060
oxygen to the point that they shut down.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.509
Toxic shock became headline news in 1980.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.060
Of 55 cases of rare toxic shock syndrome that
year, 95 percent were in menstruating women.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.980
The common factor was Proctor and Gamble’s
Rely tampon, a super absorbent one designed

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.980
to cater to market demand for a product that
could be left in place longer.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.580
The subsequent lawsuit ultimately found P&amp;G
guilty of negligence and the product was pulled.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.430
But tampons are still around, as we know,
and though it’s an exceedingly rare disease

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.720
women are still getting toxic shock syndrome,
many victims citing a lack of clear warning

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.989
on any packaging as the root cause.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.950
In 2012, 24-year-old Lauren Wasser lost her
leg after toxic shock led to gangrene.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.700
But toxic shock isn’t limited to menstruating
women.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.730
Men, children, and non-menstruating women
are susceptible to it as well.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.220
Tampons just increase the risk.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.280
So what can you do to avoid toxic shock?

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.379
The easiest way is to not use tampons at all.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.190
But if you do, switch it up with a pad now
and then, use the lowest absorbency you can

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.790
get away with, and never leave a tampon in
for more than eight hours.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.510
Ladies, does learning more about toxic shock
change the way you feel about tampons?
