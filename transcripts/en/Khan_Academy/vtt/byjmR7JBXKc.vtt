00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.560
Maya and Mabel are
inspecting a 80 to 1

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.280
scale floor plan
of their new house.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.450
The dimensions of the living
room in the scaled plan

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:21.160
are 4 centimeters by 5
centimeters right over here.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.169
What is the area of the
living room in the real world?

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.210
So they gave us these
dimensions right over here.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.000
This is the scale
plan, and then we

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.850
could figure out these
dimensions in the real world

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.840
by looking at the scale
factor right over here.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.040
It's an 80 to 1
scale floor plan.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.720
And we can assume
that the house is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.360
much bigger than the floor plan.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.620
So the 80, for every
80 units in the house,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.510
that represents 1 unit
on the floor plan.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.950
So if we had 80
meters in the house,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.220
that would be represented as
1 meter on the floor plan.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.590
If we had 80 centimeters
in the house,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.270
that would be represented by 1
centimeter in the floor plan.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.790
And it goes the
other way around.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.930
1 centimeter on the
floor plan would

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.009
represent 80 centimeters
in the house.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.300
And it's always important to
do-- if this confuses you,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.710
just always do a reality check
that the house should be bigger

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.340
than the floor plan.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.900
So if the floor plan for this
dimension of our living room

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.850
is 4 centimeters, the actual
house will be 80 times that.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.350
And 80 times 4 is 320-- let
me do that in a blue color--

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.475
is equal to 320 centimeters.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.780
And we can do the same thing for
the length of the living room.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.270
So 80 times 5
centimeters is going

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.820
to get us to-- is going to be--
80 times 5 is 400 centimeters.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.880
So we could figure out
the area of this room

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.290
in centimeters, if we
like, and I guess, why not?

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.200
It might be easier to
convert it to meters later.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.960
So let's see, 400 centimeters
times 320 centimeters.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.360
Let me write this down.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.980
400 times 320.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.240
Let's think about it.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.900
4 times 32 is going to
be 120, plus 8, 128.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.410
And I have 1, 2, 3 zeroes.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.970
1, 2, 3.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.080
So it's going to be 128,000
centimeters squared.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.730
Now that's a lot of
square centimeters.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.260
What would we do if we wanted
to convert it into meters?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.970
Well, we just have to figure out
how many square centimeters are

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.820
there in a square meter.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.760
So let's think
about it this way.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.190
A meter is equal to-- 1 meter
is equal to 100 centimeters.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.810
So a square meter, so
that's right over there.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.420
1 meter squared would be
1 meter by 1 meter, which

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.200
is the same thing as 100
centimeters by 100 centimeters.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.650
And so if you were to calculate
this area in centimeters,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.480
100 times 100 is 10,000, is
equal to 10,000 centimeters

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.980
squared.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.190
So you have 10,000
square centimeters

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.030
for every square meter.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.230
And so, if you want to convert
128,000 centimeters squared

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.760
to meters squared, you
would divide by 10,000.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:53.077
So dividing that by 10,000 would
give us 12.8 square meters.

00:03:53.077 --> 00:03:54.660
Now, another way you
could've done it,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.243
and maybe this would
have been easier,

00:03:56.243 --> 00:03:57.560
is to convert it up here.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.970
Instead of saying
400 centimeters

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.770
times 320 centimeters,
you would say, well,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.825
400 centimeters, that's
going to be 4 meters.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.585
And 320 centimeters,
well, that's 3.2 meters.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.330
And you would say,
OK, 4 times 3.2,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.350
that is 12.8 square meters.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.420
But either way, the
area of the living

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.560
room in the real world in meters
squared, or square meters,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.280
is 12.8.
