00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470
 

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.970
Let's now think
about different ways

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.220
to represent a mixed number.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:11.361
And let's say that our
mixed number is 2 and 1/8.

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:13.610
Actually, let's make it a
little bit more interesting.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.210
Let's make it 2 and 1/4.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.720
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.890
So let's first think about
the whole number part, the 2.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.260
Well, the 2 is
literally two wholes.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.010
You could literally
view that if you want.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.550
Right here we've
drawn each whole.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.400
We've cut it up into sections
of 8, so it literally is 8/8.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.970
So let me just do it like this.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.120
So the 2 is this whole region
right over here, that's 1.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.080
So this right over here is 1.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.460
And then this right
over here is 2, 2 wholes,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.130
so let me paint that in.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.180
So that is 2 wholes.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.410
And then I have 1/4.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.770
So this last piece,
this last whole,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.900
is divided into 8 sections.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.680
So let me divide it
into fourths first.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.310
So that's one 1/4, 2/4, and 3/4.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.230
So we want one of
those four to be

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.180
filled in-- one of
those four in orange.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.952
So one of those four to be
filled in, just like that.

00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:23.160
You might notice that I
filled in two of the eighths,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.690
and that's because 1/4
and 2/8 is the same thing.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.780
So there I've represented
this mixed number, 2 and 1/4.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.400
Let's see how we
can decompose this.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.950
So let's get our grids back.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.540
So how else could we do it?

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.100
And I'm just going to throw
a bunch of fractions up there

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.220
and see what I get.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.570
So the first thing I'm
going to throw out is 1/2.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.004
So how would I
represent 1/2 here?

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:52.420
Well, if I take
one of these wholes

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.860
and I put it into two
sections right over here,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.920
1/2 would be this
section right over there.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.070
So let me color that in.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.480
So we have 1/2.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.039
So I'm first going to add 1/2,
which is the same thing as 4/8.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.330
And you see that I just filled
in four out of the eight

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.670
sections, which is exactly
half of this first whole.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.720
So we're making some progress.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.000
Now let's throw in 3/8.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.140
So what would 3/8 look like?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.660
 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.134
Each of these boxes
are literally an 1/8

00:02:32.134 --> 00:02:34.050
and I could fill it in
however I want, but let

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:42.630
me just put this as 1, 2, and 3.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:52.192
And then let's fill
in plus another 8/8.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:53.400
Now, what's 8/8?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.115
Well, 8/8 is a whole, and
I'll do that over here.

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:57.740
I still haven't filled
this one in yet,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.970
but I'll fill in this
one right over here.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.100
So let's do that.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:14.150
So 8/8-- so that's 1/8, 2/8,
3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.100
and 8/8, and it's a whole.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.971
So I have a whole whole
here, so that's 8/8.

00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:21.470
I want to make this one a whole,
because I want to get to 2,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.830
so let me put in a 1/8 there.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.360
So plus 1/8, well, that's going
to be this one right over here,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.850
so that's my 1/8.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:41.165
And then let's add another
2/8, plus another 2/8.

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:45.080
 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.940
Well, this is in
eighths right over here,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.580
so 2/8 is going to
be two of these.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.010
And notice, you see that the
2/8 is the same thing as 1/4.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.890
 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.900
If you took this 1/4
and split it into two,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.910
so you have two times as
many pieces, it becomes 2/8.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.850
And you see that if 1 times
2 is 2, 4 times 2 is 8.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.720
So that 1/4 is the
same thing as 2/8.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.390
You see the 8/8 is the
same thing as a whole.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.490
Now, you see, you could make
another whole out of 1/2,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.390
plus 3/8, plus 1/8, and
they add up to a whole.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.770
And just to make sense
of why that worked,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.460
1/2 is the same thing
as 4/8-- because you

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.360
see that, we filled in the
4/8-- then you have 3/8,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.930
and then you have 1/8.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.160
And if you add all of these
together, 4/8 plus 3/8 plus

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.520
1/8, you are going
to get, in terms

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.540
of eighths, 4/8 plus 3/8
plus 1/8 is going to be 8/8.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.890
4 plus 3 plus 1 is 8, so you get
8/8 which is this entire whole.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.300
So hopefully that helps give
you a visual understanding

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.570
of what we're doing when
we're adding and decomposing

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.230
these fractions a
little bit more.
