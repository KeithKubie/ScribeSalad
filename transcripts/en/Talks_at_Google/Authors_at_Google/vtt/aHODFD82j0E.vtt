00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.430
I'm delighted to welcome Chris
Kimball to Google.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.406
I'm sure he needs no
introduction, so I'm going to

00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:10.060
do a very brief one.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.610
He's the founder of "Cook's
Illustrated" magazine.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.950
It was founded back in 1980.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.240
And he's the host of "America's
Test Kitchen,"

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.020
which is the most watched
cooking show on public TV.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.820
And he's made so many
contributions to the culinary

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.430
industry that I'm not even going
to try to mention them.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.770
But he did found Who's Who
and Cooking in America.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.730
And at least in my kitchen,
"America's Test Kitchen"

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.640
cookbooks are a must have.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240
And Chris is here today to talk
about "The Science of

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.050
Good Cooking." If you haven't
picked up your copy in the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.340
back, please do.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.015
CHRIS KIMBALL: It feels
like the "Johnny

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:53.220
Carson Show" or something.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.250
So this is a little
bit about--

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.375
I won't talk too much about the
book, but about what we do

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.640
in "The Test Kitchen." You know,
the fundamental precept

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.060
of science is you sit around
and think about why things

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.220
happen, and then you devise an
experiment to either prove or

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.090
disprove that.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.070
So you watch the apple
fall, whatever.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.650
And the ultimate example
of this--

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.470
there's a YouTube video
about this, actually.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.670
It's about 40 minutes long.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.550
It's great.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.340
A called Lawrence Krauss,
cosmologist, and he decided,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.670
with a bunch of other
cosmologists a few years ago,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.470
to figure out whether
we live in a closed,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.260
open, or flat universe.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.550
This will have something to do
with cooking, eventually.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.810
So in a closed universe, it
collapses, we have a big bang,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.510
we all die.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.260
In open universe, it expands
exponentially.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.340
In a flat universe, it expands,
but the rate of

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.780
expansion slows.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.580
So they were trying to
figure out how to do

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.300
that relatively simply.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.870
And so the first thing they
said, well, OK, in a flat

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.130
universe, light travels
in a straight line.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.590
In a closed or open universe,
light diverges or converges.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.180
Which means that if you looked
at something a long way from

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.630
Earth, it would be bigger or
smaller than it actually is.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.050
If you live in a flat
universe, it will

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.500
be the right size.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.280
OK, so the next thing
was what to measure.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.430
Well, they said, let's go as far
away from Earth as we can,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.539
because the farther away we
are, the more we could see

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.280
that converging or diverging
of the light.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.560
Let's go back to the Big Bang,
13.72 billion years ago.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.070
The problem with that is, for
about 100,000 years after the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.150
Big Bang, it was like looking
at the center of the sun.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.200
It was pea soup.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.380
Couldn't see anything.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.770
So about 100,000 years later,
you could start to see things.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.040
And so, OK, that's
a good distance.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280
Now the question was, what
are you going to measure?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.550
And here's where it got
a little weird.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.050
They said, well, the universe
is only 100,000 years old.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.120
Nothing travels faster than
the speed of light.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.080
So that includes gravity.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.310
Gravity can't travel faster
than the speed of light.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.440
So the biggest thing could be
100,000 light years, because

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.550
if you're a lump of matter,
you want to attract other

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.210
matter, you couldn't communicate
farther than that.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.110
It's like a little town in
Germany 2,000 years ago, a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.250
village that maybe people from
20 or 30 miles might come in,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.430
but if you're 500 miles away,
you wouldn't even know the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.840
village existed.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.630
Same thing.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.460
So they said, OK, so the
object would be there.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.560
We know where it's going
to be, how far away.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.180
And it should be 100,000
light years.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.030
That's the maximum size, which
turns out to be 1 degree of

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.580
360 in the sky.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.590
So the other question is,
how do you measure it?

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.830
And they said, well, we'll
send up a balloon.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.390
This is what I like, these
guys sit around trying to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.690
figure out what kind
of universe.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.440
They get this big helium
balloon, they send it up and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.690
it has essentially a camera that
measures the background

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.050
microwave radiation
from that point.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.570
Light waves as they travel,
flatten out, infrared,

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.540
microwaves have the longest
wavelength.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.060
So for those of you-- and there
aren't many of you here.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.370
There's a few of my vintage--

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.290
in the days a television station
stopped broadcasting,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.540
oddly enough, at 1:00 or 2:00
in the morning, you'd get

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.990
static on your television set.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.860
And 1% of that static was, in
fact, microwave radiation from

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.330
just after the Big Bang.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.260
So you could actually see it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.100
So they took pictures, and they
developed it, and they

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.110
put it up on the wall.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.180
And it turns out that the
biggest things they saw were

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.520
exactly 1 degree.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.640
And that was exactly
what was predicted.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.760
And so since it was 1 degree,
we live in a flat universe.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.991
So that's exactly what we do at
"America's Test Kitchen."

00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.940
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.010
CHRIS KIMBALL: See?

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.140
On a slightly smaller scale.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.040
So we don't have big balloons.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.430
But we use scientific
principles.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.120
Equilibrium.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.790
This was invented or discovered

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.470
about 1750 in France.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.740
French scientists decided,
well, OK, I don't have

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.375
balloons, but I have
pig bladders.

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:40.240
I'll fill it with alcohol, put
it in a big tub of water, and

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.130
I'll see what happens.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.940
Well, of course, what happened
was water is 100% water,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.570
alcohol is 50% water, so some of
the water from outside went

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.400
through the membrane to
create equilibrium.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.020
That's called osmosis.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.085
Diffusion.

00:04:56.085 --> 00:04:58.500
But if you're going to brine a
turkey next week, there's a

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.330
little osmosis there.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.595
Salt.

00:05:00.595 --> 00:05:03.790
You put salt on the outside of
a turkey, or in a brine, and

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.530
that's diffusion.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.870
The salt from the outside goes
to the inside to create

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.710
equilibrium.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.600
So when you brine, you're using
a very old scientific

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.420
concept of equilibrium.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.650
And what happens is the chicken
or the turkey soaks up

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.400
water, and if there was no
brine, there was no salt, that

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.280
water would come out
during cooking.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.190
But what the salt does is it
takes the proteins, it

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.370
denatures them, they are able
to now hold onto water,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.690
because there's now
room for water to

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.120
get into the proteins.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.030
Some of the proteins turn
into a gelatin,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.380
which also absorb water.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.370
So what the salt does is help
the turkey hold onto water,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.150
even when heated and roasted.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.660
So not all of it leaves.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.170
Some of it actually stays.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.040
And that's all based
on an old premise.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.260
Some of the things we like
to do is disprove

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.000
stupid cooking theories.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.140
The world is flat theories.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.430
One of them is sear meat
to seal in the juices.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.110
You still in cookbooks today,
and on some cooking shows,

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.500
will see people say that, and
it's just total nonsense.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.220
Searing meat sears meat.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.950
It's the Maillard
reaction, which

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.250
we'll get to in a second.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.830
Amino acids and sugars are
creating flavor compounds.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.140
But it turns out that juicy
meat is just a function of

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.610
internal temperature.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.310
About 110 degrees, meat fibers
that sort of look like

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.540
insulated wires will start to
shrink around the diameter and

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.600
the length.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.830
The liquid in those fibers
gets pushed out.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.680
The more you cook meat, the
dryer it gets, and it has

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.430
nothing to do with whether
it's seared or not.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.980
If you pot roast or barbecue,
and you start with a piece of

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.270
meat that has a lot of collagen
in it, like pork

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.640
butt, for example, well, that
collagen turns into gelatin,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.320
melts, and that will hold onto
liquid, so that does work over

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.230
a long period of time.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.880
Another thing people say very
often is braising turns out

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.440
moist, succulent meat.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.990
And it kind of makes sense,
because you have a closed pot,

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.970
and you have a little bit of
liquid, and you have a pot

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.080
roast or piece of pork.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.260
In fact, Madeleine Kamman, in
"The Making of a Cook," which

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.950
is a great book you should read,
says that very thing.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.620
She says the steam gets
into the meat.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.220
It does this.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.510
No.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.750
It's the same thing.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.110
You can boil a pot roast, or
simmer a pot roast in water.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.530
You can roast it
in a dry oven.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.790
You can braise it in
a closed container.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.250
And if you get it to the same
internal temperature, 185,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.000
190, it will be exactly
the same inside.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.430
So it doesn't matter if there's
liquid around it, air

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.510
around it, a little bit of
liquid on it, steam, it

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.500
doesn't matter.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.880
It's all about the internal
temperature.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.710
Lots of other things--

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:43.860
recipes say pat meat dry
before you sautee it.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.840
And, by the way, I know what
you all do, even though you

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.470
work for Google.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.480
I know what you do.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.870
And that is that you
take our recipes--

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.450
and I do the same thing--

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:59.350
and you take them as vague
directions about what you

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.030
might do if you actually
had the ingredients.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.470
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.670
CHRIS KIMBALL: And you don't,
and you don't have the right

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.720
cookware, and lots
of other things.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.495
So our job is not to create
a recipe that

00:08:12.495 --> 00:08:13.340
works in our kitchen.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.520
It's for us to figure
out what you do.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.010
And what you do is really
interesting.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.960
And matter of fact, I think
behavioral psychology should

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.340
spend more time looking at--

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.810
they do, like, how
people vote.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.465
Now they should do
how people cook.

00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:29.520
About two years ago, we had a
chicken breast recipe, and we

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.510
sent our recipes out.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.400
It takes us five or six weeks
to develop a recipe.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.360
We sent it out to a bunch of you
who volunteered, and over

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.400
the course of a week, 200 or 300
of you will have made the

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.000
recipe, and you'll
fill out a form.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.810
And unless 80% of you say you
would make it again, we go

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.080
back in the kitchen.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.130
Well, this particular
gentleman--

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.290
and this recipe got
a great rating.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.250
90% of the people would
make it again.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.970
This one gentleman said it was
the worst chicken breast

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.210
recipe he'd ever made, which
caught our attention.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.840
And at the bottom, there's a
little place on SurveyMonkey,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.080
which is the software we use--

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.030
he had a comment, and this is
verbatim, what he said.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.922
He said, "Well," comma, "I
didn't have any chicken."

00:09:10.922 --> 00:09:13.634
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:09:13.634 --> 00:09:15.650
CHRIS KIMBALL: OK.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.970
"I substituted shrimp."

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.670
AUDIENCE: [GASPS]

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.660
CHRIS KIMBALL: So if you cook
shrimp for 25 minutes, indeed,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.280
it would be the worst shrimp
recipe you've ever had.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.440
But it's my fault, see.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.160
So it was my job to say in the
head note, do not substitute

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.220
shrimp for chicken in this
chicken breast recipe.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:38.430
So anyway, to go back to the
steak story, so the problem

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.050
is, if you put a wet piece of
meat or poultry in a pan,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.820
assuming the pan is the right
temperature, the meat's not

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.600
going to get above the boiling
point of water, because the

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.810
water has to evaporate first.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.410
So your steak is sitting there
at 210 or 212 degrees until

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.530
that water goes away.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.110
So you're steaming the meat,
it sticks to the pan.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.190
The Maillard reaction, which as
I said is amino acids and

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.150
sugars creating flavor
compounds, doesn't happen 'til

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.150
over 300 degrees, so you're not
going to get any browning.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.930
And that is a reason, by the
way, you shouldn't use

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.600
non-stick cookware-- because
70% of cookware sold in the

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.760
United States is non-stick.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.950
It's good for eggs,
it's good for

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.590
seafood, a few other things.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.540
Stir fry with a sticky sauce.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.730
It's terrible for everything
else, because you can't create

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.200
a fond on the bottom of the
pan-- that brown stuff that

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.290
when you're first beginning to
cook, you throw away, because

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.480
it's messy, and then you realize
it has all the flavor.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.290
Years ago, a friend of mine
came over from France--

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.360
he was a butcher--

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.790
to show us some tricks.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.360
And during the morning, he had a
bunch of onions, like 5 or 6

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.990
pounds of onions, a little
wine, little

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.970
water, little oil.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:44.510
All he did was put it in a big
Le Creuset Dutch oven, and he

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.290
sauteed it, browned it,
caramelized it.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.340
And every half hour or so, he
deglazed the bottom of the pot

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.840
with a little wine.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.990
And he didn't add stock,
he didn't add any other

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.950
ingredients.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:58.380
And by 12:00, 12:30, we had
French onion soup, and it was

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.940
the best French onion soup
I had in my life.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.440
And all the flavor, 100% of it,
came from the fond at the

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.800
bottom of the pan.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.020
And so if that had been a
non-stick pan, we would have

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.590
had the world's worst
French onion soup.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:11.290
So anyway.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.820
So those are just a few of
the things that we test.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.710
And another one which is
relevant for next week, for

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.400
those of you who are going to
make pie dough, recipes always

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.060
say add just enough water 'til
the dough holds together.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.740
Yeah, whoever wrote that should
be taken out and run

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.000
over with a truck, because
you're all scared to add too

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.060
much water, so what happens?

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.590
You create dry pie dough,
and it doesn't roll out.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.360
It rolls out into pieces, and
you have to do a pat in the

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.270
pan crust when nobody's
looking.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.500
That's what's going to
happen, because I've

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.370
done it many times.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.110
And the reason you don't want
to add too much water is

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.275
because in flour, there
are two proteins--

00:11:47.275 --> 00:11:49.290
glutinin, which sounds like
gluten, but it's different,

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.970
and gliadin.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.860
In the presence of water, they
form gluten, and that's why

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.390
you could have a no knead bread
dough recipe-- because

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.190
if you let water and flour sit
long enough, like overnight,

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.660
gluten will develop
on its own.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.970
You don't have to knead bread.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.900
So what's going on with pie
pastry is, a little too much

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.310
water, a little bit too much
gluten gets developed.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.550
So we sat around, just like
Lawrence Krauss did years ago,

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.590
and said, we need more liquid,
but we can't use water,

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.570
because water reacts with
glutinin and gliadin to

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.280
produce gluten.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.640
What else could we use?

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.700
And the obvious answer
was vodka.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.950
I mean, really.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.890
Because alcohol actually doesn't
react with proteins.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.780
Water does.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.660
So we said, we'll use half
water, half vodka, add a

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.910
little bit of extra liquid--
another tablespoon, so you

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.510
have a nice, moist dough,
rolls out easily.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.290
And by the way, alcohol will
dissipate at a much lower

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.630
temperature than water, so you
put in the oven, and you end

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.200
up with a nice, dry, flaky
dough, so, vodka pie crust.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.600
And thank you to our
food scientist.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.730
One thing I should warn you
about food scientists, because

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.820
I've worked with them
all my life.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.840
We have a guy who works
with us, this guy,

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.820
Crosby, who's very good.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.790
But remember in fifth grade, you
had those stupid molecular

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.350
things with the balls?

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:08.770
Well, eventually, over time,
I kept asking, do molecules

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.760
really look like this?

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.010
And some would say,
well, not really.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.802
It's just, we're trying to--

00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:17.380
I paraphrase--

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.000
we're giving you as much
information as we think you

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.050
can handle.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:22.840
So great.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.640
They think I'm an idiot.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.720
So over all these years, I'm
thinking about these red balls

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.260
and green balls and
everything else.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.210
And yes, it talks about
connectivity and other things,

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.880
but it is, in essence,
really, molecules

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.900
don't look like that.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.030
So when you talk to a food
scientist, the first time you

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.560
ask them a question about
starchy potatoes, for example,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.190
and amylose and amylopectin and
everything else, they'll

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.850
give you the answer they think
you can handle, which is

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.830
basically the idiot's answer.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.960
And then you come back a couple
weeks later and say,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.730
well, you know, it doesn't
really make sense because--

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.700
and they say, OK, OK,
now I'll tell you.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.330
And then they give you
the next layer down.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.940
There's like 10 layers, and I'm
working my way down to the

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.580
10th layer.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.490
I'm at about layer 7 now,
because he thinks I can

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.750
handle layer 7.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.710
But the problem with food
science is, as Einstein, of

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.660
course, was not a food
scientist-- it was too hard--

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.940
there are too many variables.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.550
There's too much
stuff going on.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.710
So it's very hard to
isolate one thing.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.690
Even if you isolate, let's say,
10% protein flour from

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.560
12%, you do two cakes or two
biscuits, it could be that you

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.510
didn't measure something
properly, the ovens were

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.820
slightly off, it was a humid
day versus not a humid day.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.570
So there's lots of stuff going
on, so you have to do things

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.200
over and over and over again to
make sure that your results

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.170
actually are reproducible,
which, of course, is the

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.050
essence of science.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:45.990
So that's what we do, and this
book is really a result of 20

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.880
years of work in the kitchen.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.360
We took 50 scientific principles
in some recipes to

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.390
illustrate them.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:57.720
And I've been on tour, and one
of the things I do if it's a

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.980
morning show or something is we
have a red bliss potato, a

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.340
non-starchy potato, and we
have a russet potato.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.670
The russet potato has more
starch, which has got a higher

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.250
specific gravity, and should
sink, and the red bliss potato

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.430
should float.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.670
And I did this on "The Today
Show" about a month ago, and

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.940
they both sank.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.220
So sometimes, the results
are not reproducible.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.905
So I just hid it behind
the other thing, and

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:26.280
it just went on.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.360
So that's what we do, and I'd
love to take some questions.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.270
And by the way, before someone
has the courage to ask a

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.310
question, Lynne Rossetto Casper
from "The Splendid

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:44.530
Table," whom I've known for
a long time, she had this

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.940
problem once, and she told the
audience that she would start

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.670
removing her clothes if she
didn't get a question asked.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.230
And they started asking
questions.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.910
So I was wondering two things.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.140
One of them is that you
mentioned caramelizing onions.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.640
And I know that what Einstein
told his cook-- that was one

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.880
of the author's pet peeves.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.070
CHRIS KIMBALL: Yeah.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.880
AUDIENCE: That's a side thing.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.700
You can talk.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.770
But the question I
have is actually

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.610
about non-stick cookware.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.660
CHRIS KIMBALL: That
was Wolke, yeah.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.100
That guy.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.540
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.630
The question I have is actually

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.530
about non-stick cookware.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.680
There's actually new non-stick
cookware coming out.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.630
It's ceramic, I guess, base,
or something else.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.820
Can you talk a little bit about
what you think of those?

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.900
CHRIS KIMBALL: Yeah,
we've tested a lot

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.020
of non-stick cookware.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.140
There's low-stick cookware like
Calphalon, which, if you

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.270
look at it under a microscope,
it just has

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.050
fewer craters in it.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.710
It's smoother, so the food
doesn't stick as much.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.010
There are ceramic non-stick
cookware as well.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.880
We basically didn't
like any of them.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.800
They either claimed they were
greener, which they really

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.070
weren't, or if they
really were green,

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.730
they weren't non-stick.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.270
So we went through all of them,
and the one that we

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.010
ended up with is just
the classic.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.050
They all use essentially the
same chemical-- slightly

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.690
different bonding techniques.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.130
The problem with non-stick
cookware--

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.270
there's a number of them--

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.690
first of all, there's something
called polymer fume

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.570
fever, and I actually subjected
myself to this just

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:02.560
to find out what it was like.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.619
So over 500 degrees, you'll see
the smoking, and if you

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.970
happen to have a parakeet in
the room, you know, the

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.359
parakeet might not survive
that process.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.780
I took a big whiff, and had a
vicious headache for about

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.730
five hours.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.000
Over 600 degrees, that chemical
actually starts to

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.150
break down, and that's
why non-stick pans,

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.060
over a year or two--

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.190
I mean, in our kitchen, they
don't last more than a year.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.130
They actually start to break
down, and that coating

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.360
actually comes off.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.840
So the other thing you can use
is cast iron, if you are of

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.280
the mind to season it properly,
which takes a little

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.760
more time, which I like.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.190
But when it comes to doing
scrambled eggs, a 10-inch or

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.330
8-inch non-stick All-Clad or
something similar actually is

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:46.905
fairly essential.

00:17:46.905 --> 00:17:50.270
But that's about all
I use it for.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.860
AUDIENCE: I'll say in defense of
non-stick, you guys have a

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.090
great recipe from a few months
ago for Thai stir fried

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.650
noodles for which you say
specifically, get this

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.600
non-stick 12-inch pan.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.160
Great recipe, I love it.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.610
One of the great examples of
I don't do it unless I have

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.040
exactly what "Cook's
Illustrated"

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.950
says I need to have.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.456
CHRIS KIMBALL: You're the
only reader who does.

00:18:16.456 --> 00:18:17.980
I've finally found him.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.745
AUDIENCE: From bitter
experience,

00:18:18.745 --> 00:18:20.110
I've learned my lesson.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.430
So my question-- you guys test
all these recipes over and

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.680
over again in the "Test
Kitchen." What do you do with

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.440
all the food that you create?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.220
CHRIS KIMBALL: Oh, well, first
of all, we're not licensed by

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.355
the town of Brookline just
outside of Boston to serve

00:18:33.355 --> 00:18:35.280
food to the public.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.860
It's a long story.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.460
So we wanted to give food to the
local shelter, food bank.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.020
We do give canned food, but we
couldn't give our cooked food.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.060
So we have about 140 employees,
slightly smaller

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.030
than you, and the test cooks in
the kitchen-- we have about

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.570
45 test cooks, it's about a
3,500 square foot kitchen--

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.740
the really good food, and the
really expensive food, like

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.330
the tenderloin, the lobster,
et cetera--

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.920
that immediately disappears.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.710
We have these big clear plastic
takeout containers and

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.050
big magic markers.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:08.930
So I--

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.240
Chris, for Chris, put the stuff
in, and go into our

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.690
takeout fridge.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.040
And at night, they
bring it home.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.950
The food that's pretty good
but not great, we call the

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.880
marketing department
down for that.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.195
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:26.540
CHRIS KIMBALL: No, I mean,
marketing's important, right?

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.760
OK.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.870
And then the really horrible
food is the finance people.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.010
My CFO lives off leftover
Halloween candy until January.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.750
That's all she eats.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:44.620
And they're grateful for that,
so that's how it works.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.770
We're hoping we can get licensed
to actually do

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.340
something else with it.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.410
We have 140 employees, so it all
gets eaten, and our test

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.470
cooks never cook during the week
at night, because they've

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.720
been cooking all day, and they
just take the food home, so.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.000
AUDIENCE: You brought up the
concept of brining earlier,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.870
and the best Thanksgiving turkey
I ever made I brined.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.650
And could you go over some of
the basic principles, since a

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.380
lot of people are going to be
roasting turkeys next week, of

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.960
what it takes to make
a good turkey?

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.580
CHRIS KIMBALL: Yes.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.140
The problem with having a food
magazine is every year,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.650
there's Thanksgiving,
and we have to come

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.990
up with a new recipe.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.570
So somehow we've come
up with 20 versions.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.870
The basic formula is
1 cup of table salt

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.200
per gallon of water.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.880
If it's going to be a 12, 14
pound turkey, you'd brine it

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.180
for six to eight hours,

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.080
something like that, overnight.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.650
You got to keep it cool,
preferably no more than 40

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.190
degrees, which can be a problem
if you don't have a

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.760
cold cellar somewhere
or outside.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.860
And then you want to make sure
it's dried off very well.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:53.255
You put it in a 375 to 400 oven,
breast side down for an

00:20:53.255 --> 00:20:56.440
hour, then flip it breast side
up and continue cooking it--

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.660
maybe even increase the
temperature for the last half

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.300
hour or so.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.540
We've done lots of other
recipes, one of which I like

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.400
is you cut it into parts
and you braise it.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.980
I did that last year.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.730
Then you get a great gravy out
of it, and then you don't have

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.360
the problem with the white meat,
dark meat, when it's

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.940
done problem.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.830
I just did for "Morning
Edition" next week on

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.750
Wednesday-- we do a segment
every year on Thanksgiving,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.900
and we did Julia Child recipes,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.580
all Julia Child recipes.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.890
She's got this great recipe
where she takes the backbone

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.330
out and takes the whole breast
and puts it over a huge amount

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.820
of stuffing on a roasting tray
with aluminum foil, cooks

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.470
that, and then she has the thigh
and the legs together,

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.240
those two pieces roasted
separately on a rack on a

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.640
baking sheet.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.300
But what she does is
really interesting.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.340
She takes the bone out
of the thigh, which

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.070
takes about a minute.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.070
It's real easy to do.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.440
Just use a paring knife.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.940
And then she spreads it open,
puts salt, pepper, a little

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.180
sage, whatever you want, sewed
it up, or just wrapped it

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.110
easily with some string
and roasted that.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.850
Only took about an hour
and a half to cook.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.470
And then when you slice
the thigh, there's no

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.530
bone, which is great.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.000
And that really works well.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.070
And if you like, she also had a
picture of reassembling the

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.750
bird after it's cooked, so you
have that little Norman

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.590
Rockwell moment or whatever.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.220
If anyone does have
that moment.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.170
So that's the basic concept.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.470
The other way you can
do it is butterfly a

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.020
turkey after brining.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.470
You take the backbone out.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.990
It's good to have poultry
shears for that.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.400
Flatten it, press down on the
breastbone, and then cook that

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.280
on a rack over a huge mound of
stuffing, which is also one of

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.230
my favorite techniques.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.590
So you don't have to worry about
a little bit of stuffing

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.810
in the cavity, which you should
never do, because the

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:40.020
stuffing takes a long time
to get up to 160.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.070
You don't have much of it, and
the meat will be overcooked.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.110
So butterfly it, take the
backbone out, rack over

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.930
stuffing, and you get
maximum stuffing.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.030
So those are four suggestions.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.860
AUDIENCE: Did you start
as a food writer?

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.870
Was that what you sort of--

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.900
CHRIS KIMBALL: I started as
a primitive art major at

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.050
Columbia in 1969.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:02.690
Well, actually, no.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.950
I had four years of the
revolution, so we didn't have

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.610
finals three out of the four
years, because the secret was,

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.210
we only had revolutions
when it was warm,

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.140
which was in May, usually.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.460
So I started that.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.020
I worked in a small publishing
firm in New York for a couple

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.340
years, ran a company for a
few years in the '70s.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.660
It was in and around the whole
issue of magazines and

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.630
publishing.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.650
And then I started "Cook's"
in 1980--

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.020
April 1980.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.340
Today, if you want to--

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.390
I've been grandfathered
into my own company.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.290
I don't think I'd get a job
there now, probably.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.310
If you wanted to get a job in
our kitchen today, you'd have

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.460
to come in and do a bench test,
which means that a bunch

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.500
of people will stand around you
with clipboards and not

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.540
talk while you cook all day, to
see if you have the knife

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.260
skills, you can expedite.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.880
But really, we're looking for
people who are incredibly

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.970
stubborn, don't mind doing the
same thing constantly, like

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.400
the same recipe for weeks
and weeks on end.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.720
You have to develop a recipe
on your own and write it up

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.490
and submit the article.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:12.910
And then we do three month
internships, and then usually

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.820
at the end of that period, we'll
keep one or two of the

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.340
people to work full time
in the kitchen.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.130
So what we really do
is a group process.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.140
We sit down every Tuesday
morning at 9:00 AM, editorial

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.400
table, and whoever's working on
a particular recipe talks.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.210
We sit down, have ideas.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.870
Every time there's a tasting,
there's a bunch of people in

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.370
the kitchen.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.400
So it's really very much
about a group process.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.000
It's not quite one man, one
vote, but it's almost that.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.770
And that's how we develop
the process.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.606
It comes from--

00:24:44.606 --> 00:24:48.940
I went to a high school which
used an oval table, the

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.860
Harkness table.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.650
And you'd sit around a table,
and the professor or teacher

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.870
would be standing up in the
corner, and you would have to

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.110
come up with a position about
something about Russian

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.700
history, and you'd have to
defend your position as your

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.700
fellow students ripped you to
shreds, which is basically

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.590
what we do now is to sit around
and argue, which I

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.240
assume you do a lot here, too.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.010
AUDIENCE: So you're in
magazines, but you must also

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.380
have been kind of crazy
about food.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.765
And then you also seem to have
this scientific bent.

00:25:14.765 --> 00:25:16.410
CHRIS KIMBALL: Well, I've been
cooking since I was about

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.460
seven, yes.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.910
My first recipe was a chocolate
cake out of "The Joy

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.280
of Cooking" with a seven minute
boiled icing, which

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.130
turned out like snot.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.635
Actually, I do still
remember the cake.

00:25:27.635 --> 00:25:31.560
Everyone said it was very good,
but I knew it wasn't.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.690
And in the '70s, I
started taking a

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.190
lot of cooking classes.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.050
And I realized there was one
guy in particular, who was

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.120
actually a great guy,
but he put on

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.400
this fake French accent--

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.940
he was from Florida.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.580
But he talked like
the [FAKE FRENCH]

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.570
like this, and he would say
things like you have to scald

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.670
milk to make a bechamel.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.460
Well, I went home, made it with
cold milk, it was fine.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.890
He refused to talk about it.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.020
And it turns out that you only
scald milk if it's raw milk,

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.660
because pasteurization is
scalding milk, and you want to

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.450
kill off an enzyme
that needs to be

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.100
killed to have it thicken.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.270
So it occurred to me, the
emperor's new clothes, that a

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.340
lot of stuff that was being
taught at the time in the '60s

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.050
and '70s was just being
passed down.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.470
And probably at the time, it
made sense, like when people

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.780
had nothing but raw milk.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.290
But there was a whole bunch of
things like that that just

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.400
made no sense anymore.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.450
And the cookware was changing,
the food processor came in

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.150
from Carl Sontheimer
in the early '70s.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.130
French cooking was going
away, American

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.180
cooking was coming up.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.662
So my interest was actually
starting a magazine where you

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:38.860
could talk about cooking.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.570
At the time, there was
"Cuisine," "Food &amp; Wine," "Bon

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.000
Apetitt," "Gourmet," none
of which really

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.890
focused on the kitchen.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.920
It was all about people
smiling at parties,

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.890
traveling, on yachts.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.455
And so I just wanted to focus
on fudgy brownies,

00:26:51.455 --> 00:26:53.800
essentially.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.280
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
techniques, but I want to ask

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.590
you about the actual product
and ingredients.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:04.020
I made a conscious decision to
switch to grass-fed beef, and

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.940
most of these techniques no
longer work, because this meat

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.790
is so different.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.490
There's less fat.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.307
What recommendations,
what suggestions do

00:27:11.307 --> 00:27:12.630
you have for me?

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.890
CHRIS KIMBALL: Well, we raise
our own beef and pork, too,

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.130
and we started out doing
pure grass fed.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:22.790
Well, I don't know if you've
ever had no grain purely grass

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.100
fed, but it's tough
and it's strong.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.350
And actually, in the last
three months, we

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.840
grained them, too.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.630
So I like mostly grass fed, but
I like grain at the end,

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.870
because I think it's better.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.640
But it's like trying
to cook venison,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.910
because it's very lean.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:43.350
And the other problem is the
butchers love the round, the

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.060
thigh, because it's this huge
hunk of meat with just one

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.730
bone in it.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.375
It's not complicated.

00:27:49.375 --> 00:27:51.580
But the problem is, it's lean.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.160
And especially grass-fed beef.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.340
So the first thing I would do
is get the fattiest cuts.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.350
Chuck eye roast,
shoulder roast,

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.200
anything from the chuck.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.650
I would never touch the round
under any circumstances.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:07.810
And then, unless you want to
lard it, like Fannie Farmer

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.520
used to do, you're probably
going to have to

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.360
cook it low and slow.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.380
But I would get the fattiest cut
from grass-fed beef that I

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.770
possibly could.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.250
Don't get anything lean,
because it's

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.970
going to be lean anyway.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.100
AUDIENCE: I'm curious what your
take is on the molecular

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.620
gastronomy movement, which also
sort of bills itself as a

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.950
science driven, although
probably not

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.130
as accessible, approach.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.400
CHRIS KIMBALL: Well, I'm now an
instant expert, because I

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.600
went to see Nathan Myhrvold two
days ago, and his chefs

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.550
cooked me a 12-course meal
one afternoon in Seattle.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:45.530
And first of all, OK,
let me describe.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.660
He has a lab to do a lot
of other things.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.260
The modernist cuisine is
just a small subset.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:50.760
You walk in.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.150
The place is huge.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:56.250
It must have 50 $1 million
machines in there to do all

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.280
sorts of weird things, like
3D printers and stuff.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.920
So the first thing I walk in is
I see this big HD screen,

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.720
and things are popping
on and off.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.470
And I say, what's that?

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.900
He said, well, a few years ago,
we decided to solve the

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.866
problem of malaria.

00:29:14.866 --> 00:29:16.120
OK.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.270
And one of the guys on the team
was one of the guys who

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.840
helped develop the Star Wars
project, which actually was

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.900
pretty much a failure,
as far as I can tell.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.190
And he said, well, I don't
know, just get a

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.780
laser gun and zap them.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.370
And then the guy said to me,
well, at first we thought that

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.390
was foolish, comma.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.800
I said, what do you
mean "at first"?

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.730
It's like, what, it's
not foolish now?

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.570
So he claims--

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:41.270
I didn't believe this-- he
claims that this thing was

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.560
actually showing there's
mosquitoes in a glass--

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.950
am I losing my voice here?

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:49.270
Hello?

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.060
There we are.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.645
He claims that he had this big
glass container, an aquarium

00:29:54.645 --> 00:29:58.620
of mosquitoes, and they could
sense the mosquitoes

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.080
individually.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.350
That's what was showing
up on the screen.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.350
Then it gets weird.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.810
It says, they can tell the
difference between a male

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.990
mosquito and a female
mosquito.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:08.750
And I said, how do
you do that?

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.520
He said, well, female mosquitoes
beat their wings at

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.360
a different RPM than
male mosquitoes.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.470
OK.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.840
Female mosquitoes bite,
males don't.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.110
So I said, then what happens?

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.050
He said, oh, then the laser gun
melts their wings and they

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.000
fall down and die.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.600
I said, OK, so you're in Africa,
Niger, and you have

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.390
this $100,000 mosquito
killing laser gun.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.450
Now what are you going to do?

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.610
Well, we'd ring the
village with them.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.380
I said, how about like, $1.00
for a mosquito net?

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.610
Like, really?

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.330
Anyway, so I was going,
like, really?

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.910
So anyway, the meal was
fabulous, though.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.750
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.960
CHRIS KIMBALL: And there were
no mosquitoes anywhere.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:57.210
I mean, he's proven if you're
incredibly smart, and you have

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.480
unlimited capital and time,
what you can do to food.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.850
It has no bearing on home
cooking at all.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.460
But, I mean, for example,
the pistachio gelato--

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.220
I love pistachio gelato.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.690
I've had it in a lot of
different places.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.550
And most of the time, it's
vanilla ice cream with green

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.280
food coloring, essentially,
because it doesn't taste like

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.360
pistachio, right?

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.035
So this pistachio gelato
was amazing.

00:31:16.035 --> 00:31:19.240
I mean, it's like, amazing
pistachio flavor.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.620
And he extracted oil,
and guess what.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.120
Each scoop, which is about this
big, was $25 worth of

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.300
pistachios to get one scoop
of pistachio gelato.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.240
The other thing he showed
me-- and they were

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.430
great French fries--

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.350
but in order to get that crunchy
outside, he puts the

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.440
French fries in water--

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.590
am I losing my voice again?

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.680
I think you have to keep putting
quarters in the thing.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.270
It's a cavitation device,
essentially.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.340
Sonic waves go through the water
and rough up the surface

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.740
of the potato.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.530
And so, yeah, it did
work, but he's

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:55.750
extracting maximum flavor.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.160
So the answer is, why not?

00:31:59.160 --> 00:31:59.900
Good for him.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.800
He's an interesting guy.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.740
He's rich.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.860
The food was great.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.840
But I don't think anybody here
is going to be making $25 a

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.970
scoop pistachio ice cream
anytime soon.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.590
Although maybe some of those
techniques end up in a home

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.380
kitchen in 10 years.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.060
I don't know.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.200
But it's not what we do.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:20.260
What we do is, my premise has
been, most people most of the

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.650
time don't have a lot of
success in the kitchen.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.387
It's not necessarily a failure,
but it doesn't turn

00:32:25.387 --> 00:32:27.120
out exactly the way you want.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.820
If you were building airplanes,
and 80% of the

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.150
time, they fell out of the
sky, you wouldn't be in

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.370
business too long.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.990
Recipes, if you think of it as
a business, it's the only

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.230
business in the world where you
can actually have a very

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.570
high failure rate and
still be around.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.720
And so our thought was, we're
not trying to get you to

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.840
modernist cuisine or
French Laundry.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.620
We're just trying to get people
to the point where most

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.530
of the time they go in
the kitchen, if they

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:51.750
do follow the recipe--

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.150
don't substitute shrimp
for chicken--

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.970
it'll turn out well.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:58.460
And that's all.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.290
We're not trying to
create chefs.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.680
We're just trying to say, you
can be confident, go in the

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.320
kitchen, and get pretty
good results.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.240
That's about it.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:11.230
For a variety of reasons, my
girlfriend and I only get to

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.540
cook it once a week or so.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:17.180
Do you have any advice for
rewarding but efficient

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.900
occasional cooking
at small scale?

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.260
CHRIS KIMBALL: Yeah, the best
thing I can say is, 100 years

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:29.680
ago, the Italian grandmother had
a very limited repertoire.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.580
As I was taught to
cook by a baker--

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.100
actually, a cook in Vermont--

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.550
Vermont!

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.310
And I have a recipe card.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.240
She has about 50 recipe cards.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.340
So I think the secret has been
people had a limited

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.160
repertoire of foods that were
local with techniques that

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.680
were all related, and that's why
they didn't need recipes.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.580
Because your grandmother, if
she cooked, or grandfather,

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.250
they had a baking powder biscuit
recipe, or they had a

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.290
curry goat recipe.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.160
Whatever it was, they
knew how to do it.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.010
So if you're going to start out
in cooking, and you don't

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:06.280
have a lot of time, my
suggestion is have 25 recipes.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.570
Pick 25 recipes that cover a
braise, or a tagine, or a

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:15.210
stew, or a quick bread, a soda
bread, whatever, and just get

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.929
a range of recipes that cover
most of the bases, and get to

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.060
the point you don't
need a recipe.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.550
You can make them.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.060
Then you can do anything
you want.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.900
But if you do that, it's great,
because the problem

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.239
with all of you and the problem
with me is, on Tuesday

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.350
night I'm going oh, I love that
Ottolenghi recipe from

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:31.510
"Plenty" or "Jerusalem." I want
to make that tonight with

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.830
the Gorgonzola and the lentils
and the caramelized onions.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.710
And the next night, I'll say,
well, maybe I want something

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.449
from South America,
and then I--

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.989
well, you never get anywhere,
because you're changing

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:41.120
ingredients and techniques.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.340
So stick to 25 recipes.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.420
The example I like
to give is music.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.920
Like most aging baby
boomers, I have a

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.960
Grateful Dead cover band.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.469
Of course, that's typical.

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:53.489
At some point, you all will
have Grateful Dead cover

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:54.779
bands, or something.

00:34:54.779 --> 00:34:55.440
Aerosmith.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.550
I don't know, whatever.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:01.130
So if you've ever seen a
50-year-old pick up a guitar,

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.760
it's a disaster because
he or she thinks they

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.910
can just play it--

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:08.610
without "Guitar Hero--" play
it, and they can't, because

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.090
you actually have to know
something, like there are

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.510
chords and scales, and there are
two note chords, and three

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.680
note chords, and the triads.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.800
There's the blues scale, and
the pentatonic scale, blah,

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.750
blah, blah.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:24.030
Jerry Garcia, my hero, he played
scales two hours a day.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.620
So there is something to know.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.790
And so by sticking to 25
recipes, you'll actually get

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:29.230
the technique down.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.270
You'll understand something
about cooking, and then you

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.210
can do whatever you
want from there.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.430
I always work Jerry Garcia into
every talk, by the way.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.160
AUDIENCE: Question about
your turkey recipes.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.710
They typically deal with
smaller birds, or

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:42.450
medium sized birds.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.980
Do you have ideas on cooking
larger ones, particularly when

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.785
you're cooking them upside
down to start?

00:35:47.785 --> 00:35:50.630
Is there a limit to how big a
bird you can cook that way?

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.785
CHRIS KIMBALL: No.

00:35:51.785 --> 00:35:55.430
We usually like 14 to 16 pound
birds, because they, I think,

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:56.860
usually taste better.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.140
But you can get a 22 pounder.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.910
The question is, is your
oven big enough?

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.480
And then, of course, you have
a bird that's very hot, and

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.400
you have to flip it over
after an hour.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.470
If you do the butterfly
technique, however, you don't

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.220
have to flip it.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.050
And if you braise it in parts,
you don't have to flip it.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:16.630
But if you do the hour down
and then up, you do.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.620
I just use kitchen
towels to do it.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.720
Some of those Orka silicone
mitts and stuff, you ever try

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.510
to use those?

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.580
Your hands get sweaty,
and then you drop it

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.780
anyway, so who cares?

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.410
So I just use kitchen
towels and flip it.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:32.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.560
My next question is about when
you write up recipes.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.890
It's very clear from anybody
who's read "Cook's" how much

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.800
work you guys put into
developing your recipes and

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.150
trying out every variation.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.630
Have you had a chance to do
that with how you actually

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.180
write up the recipes to present
the information and

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.110
help understand what's the
best way to present it to

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.014
people such that they're
able to follow it?

00:36:49.014 --> 00:36:50.264
CHRIS KIMBALL: Oh, yes.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.650
Yes.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:57.540
Most of the stories, because
we're dealing with cooks now,

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.610
not writers--

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.290
most of the people who work for
us don't have any writing

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:06.470
experience, and so the editing
process is tortured.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:12.830
And we had made people cry
after reading the--

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.080
I used to read everything.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.460
I stopped about a year ago.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.390
I read it, but not
at the beginning.

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:18.840
And I used to put comments in.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.660
And my comments were usually
something like, this is the

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.020
worst first paragraph I've
ever read in my life.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.630
So what you get is, I remember
my mother, when she used to

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.040
make-- and I'd say, look.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.420
Unless you can describe your
mother in some detail and

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.300
paint a picture, nobody cares
about your mother.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.140
You have to make us care.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.390
So people take a long time
to get to a point.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.380
I think the issue is, I always
say it's like a Sherlock

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.710
Holmes story.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.090
There's the one boot is missing
in "The Hound of the

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:47.340
Baskervilles," you know?

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.450
So when you're telling the story
of how you solved the

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.680
problem of bad food to get to
good food, it's a mystery.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.680
It's a narrative.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.940
You have to tell a story.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.720
A story has ups and downs,
it has ins and

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.920
outs, it has dead ends.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.820
So you have to construct
that story.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.870
The problem is the test cook has
tested in a certain order,

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:10.030
and he or she then thinks, it's
a documentary process of

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.820
documenting what they did.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.780
That has nothing
to do with it.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.610
It's about creating a story.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.910
And so even though it doesn't
seem when you read it that

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.135
we've done a lot of work, we
spend some time, it's like 50

00:38:21.135 --> 00:38:25.800
or 60 hours on the story, to
tell a story, because people

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.830
have to care about the story.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:30.100
Who wants to read 2,000 words
about fudgy brownies unless

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.640
you kind of make
it interesting?

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.530
And so a lot of the tests
we leave out.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.250
It's like editing a
Hollywood movie.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.480
You've got to cut characters
out and scenes.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.140
It's the same thing.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.170
So it's all about storytelling
and narrative.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.730
And then finally, we call it
the aha moment, when you

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.610
finally, what's the big thing
you discovered that made the

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.350
recipe work?

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.770
And hopefully there's something
interesting.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.940
AUDIENCE: When you were talking
about cooking myths

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.840
and how they're not true, you
mentioned searing the meat,

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.710
which we've heard from Harold
McGee a couple times.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.860
But you also mentioned
patting the meat try

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.300
before you sautee it.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.170
And I don't think you followed
through on why that's a myth.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:16.460
CHRIS KIMBALL: Well, what I
said was, it's not a myth.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.130
It's something that people tell
you to do, but people

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.770
don't do it, because they don't
understand why they

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.280
should do it.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.115
And the reason is, as I said,
if you put the meat in a pan

00:39:25.115 --> 00:39:29.570
and it's wet, until the water
turns to steam and evaporates,

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.950
the surface temperature of the
meat's not going to go over

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.120
the boiling point of water.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.320
So all that energy's going
into the water to

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.780
turn it into steam.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.320
The energy is not going
into the meat.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.760
So until that happens, you're
sitting there in the pan with

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.440
a fairly cool pan.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.490
You're not getting any browning,
you're not getting

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.660
any Maillard reaction.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:51.455
So that's one of those things
you need to do.

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:55.700
What I've discovered is people
won't do what recipes tell you

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.530
unless you understand it.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:58.780
And that was my problem, too.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.055
So we're just trying to explain
in some cases not

00:40:01.055 --> 00:40:02.730
necessarily a myth, but we're
trying to explain why you

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:05.355
should do it, and the odds of
you doing it will be greater

00:40:05.355 --> 00:40:07.176
if we explain it.

00:40:07.176 --> 00:40:09.280
AUDIENCE: It's not because the
water will spatter in the oil

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.810
and get you burned?

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.160
CHRIS KIMBALL: That would
be true, too, and yes.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.210
And the other thing is that if
it's wet, the chicken skin

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.565
will stick irretrievably
to the bottom of

00:40:18.565 --> 00:40:20.157
the skillet, yes.

00:40:20.157 --> 00:40:21.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:25.410
So among all of the home cooks
that you've interacted with

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:32.140
and sampled, what's the single
way in which they've most

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:36.360
tragically underinvested in
their home equipment, whether

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.540
it's getting something lame that
they should get a good

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.480
version of it?

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.210
CHRIS KIMBALL: Three things.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.790
The first is an instant read
thermometer that really works.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.150
The only one we really love
is the Thermapen.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.050
It's $95.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.940
It's obscenely expensive,
but it really works.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.380
It takes a temperature from the
end of the probe, not an

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.925
inch or two up, so you know
exactly what you're measuring.

00:40:56.925 --> 00:40:58.620
It has a big readout display.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.140
It's instant.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.540
I could cook without it,
but it would be hard.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.110
I bake bread.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:08.630
American bread is 190 to 195,
European bread 205 for

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.080
custards, et cetera.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.290
Two, a knife.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.100
Forschner makes a Victorinox
Fibrox knife.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.670
It's $25.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.610
It beats the $150 knives
all the time.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:23.090
Third thing is knife
sharpening.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:26.220
Jacques Pepin would die if I
said, go buy an electric knife

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.460
sharpener, but go buy an
electric knife sharpener.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.750
The Chef's Choice model
130, 140 works great.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.350
There's no other way to sharpen
a knife at home unless

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.700
you really want to stand there
for 10 minutes with a

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.590
sharpening stone, which you can
do, but most people don't

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.780
have the patience for it.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.510
One last thing.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.970
The European knives have a
20 degree angle to them.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:50.180
The combination east west knives
have a 15 degree angle.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:57.070
So if you sharpen a $200 Gyuto
knife with a traditional

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.720
electric sharpener, you'll
ruin the edge.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.180
So Chef's Choice did come out
with a model that'll do both,

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.760
which is kind of important.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.300
The last thing I would say
that's really important is a

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.070
good 12-inch skillet,
and you want--

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.070
All-Clad still makes
the best skillet.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.720
I would invest in an All-Clad.

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.940
So those are the three or four
things you definitely need.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.265
AUDIENCE: Thanks, that's
a great answer.

00:42:20.265 --> 00:42:20.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.770
So there are some times that
I search for recipes on

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.510
"America's Test Kitchen" and
I'll get results from "Cook's

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.540
Country," and realize that I
don't have a membership there,

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.820
and I didn't realize that
recipe was part of it.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.770
Is there any work being
done to sort of--

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.970
CHRIS KIMBALL: Yes.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:37.360
AUDIENCE: --give
me the-- yeah.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.360
CHRIS KIMBALL: My head of IT
who has a notebook and a

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.730
pencil promises me by April.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.510
We're rebuilding all the

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.510
infrastructure, all of our sites.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:52.250
The problem is that we have
an outside vendor--

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.760
it's owned by Hearst--

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.000
that handles all of our
subscriptions and processing.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.900
And for us to do this entirely
on our own, without some of

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.250
the things they offer,
is almost impossible.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.120
So we've been waiting for
them to get up to speed.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.730
So we're right in the middle
of the project.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:12.150
It should be done by May, at
which point you can have

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:14.410
access to everything.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:15.420
It'll be easier.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.130
Because right now, if you go
to three of our different

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.150
sites, you have three different
passwords, three

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.080
different credit cards.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.370
It's very complicated.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.980
AUDIENCE: And then the
last one, sorry.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.380
Is there going to be an app for
the Android for "America's

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.100
Test Kitchen," or any
of the others?

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:27.340
CHRIS KIMBALL: Yeah.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:28.802
CHRIS KIMBALL: Yes.

00:43:28.802 --> 00:43:31.640
Yes.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.190
I can't part say no.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:35.930
I wouldn't get out
of here alive.

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.270
Yes.

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.420
AUDIENCE: So America's changed
since you went to university.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.760
What have you learned from
outside of America and brought

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.410
in from the science
perspective?

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.700
CHRIS KIMBALL: Well, not
so much from a science

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.530
perspective, but I think what's
interesting is there's

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:50.680
been a restaurant revolution
in the

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.410
last 30 years, obviously.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:54.690
And home cooking hasn't
changed much, really.

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:58.300
It's starting to, in
the last two years.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.490
Nothing goes into our magazines
unless we survey it.

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.200
We ask you what you want.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.690
It's that old story.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:07.695
In 1985, I was owned in part by
"The New Yorker." And so I

00:44:07.695 --> 00:44:09.300
had an office at "The
New Yorker's"

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.830
building, and Bill Shawn--

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.380
William Shawn was the
editor back then, as

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.630
some of you may remember.

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.400
And Si Newhouse took Mr. Shawn
out for lunch at the Four

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.320
Seasons and said, Mr. Shawn, how
do you determine what your

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.900
readers want to read?

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.420
And Mr. Shawn said, I don't.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.330
And Mr. Newhouse said,
what do you mean?

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.670
And he said, well, I just put
things in the magazine that I

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:30.650
want to read, and I assume
my readers have the

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:32.040
same tastes I do.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.430
He was fired four
months later.

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:38.310
And my answer to that is we
only put things in the

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.700
magazine that you tell us you
want, because we don't take

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.800
advertising.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.030
So we found in the last two
years that what you want is

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.880
starting to change.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.090
That being said, I have
to say two things.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:52.610
The top 10 rated recipes of all
time out of 7,000 recipes

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.310
we've rated-- we rate
every week--

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.298
two of them are green
bean casserole.

00:44:57.298 --> 00:45:00.290
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.440
CHRIS KIMBALL: Somebody here
makes green bean casserole.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.670
Statistically, it
has to be true.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.190
I don't know why, but they do.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:14.270
And so what's starting to happen
now is techniques-- not

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:15.400
necessarily science,
but techniques--

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.660
I mean, stir fry used to be
ethnic at one time, right?

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.750
Which is ridiculous,
but it makes sense.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.950
Small pieces of food cook
really quickly.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.010
It's very variable.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.100
It got incorporated into the
American repertoire fast.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.200
Now all the things coming from
different parts of the world

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.980
that do make sense for American
home cooking, and

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.210
they are coming in.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.260
And I would think in the next
five to eight years, you'll

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.210
see a huge change in American
home cooking.

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.190
It's just starting, but it
hasn't happened yet.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:47.030
People are still making that
dried out lasagna, but that's

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.610
really changing.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.020
I would suggest that my favorite
book currently is

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:55.100
Ottolenghi's "Plenty." I just
got "Jeruslaem." I've tried a

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:55.570
couple things.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:58.280
I've cooked about half of the
recipes in that, because, you

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.540
know, the Ottoman Empire was
in the spice trade, on the

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.040
spice routes.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.530
They had 85 to 90 different
spices.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.680
Northern Europe had
a dozen spices.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.400
"The Joy of Cooking" originally
had 15 spices.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.480
So there are ways of combining
flavors, there are techniques

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.180
that we have never used here,
because we're mostly northern

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.630
European style cooking,
mostly.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.140
And there's a lot that's
going to come in.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.420
So I think it's going to change
completely, and I think

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.810
people's experience
with food through

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:29.270
restaurants has also changed.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:31.870
They know what saag
paneer is now.

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.950
I still don't want to make it at
home, but many people in my

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.100
kitchen do.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.860
But no, it's going to change.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.500
AUDIENCE: So at the beginning
of your articles, you have

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.450
this description of what
you're going for.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.580
We want a tender crust
or whatever.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:53.310
So where does that preference
come from?

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.025
CHRIS KIMBALL: Well, the
question is, we have to pick a

00:46:56.025 --> 00:46:57.590
lane for a story.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:01.000
And so we survey and ask
what people want.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.180
But at some point, it depends
on what we've done before.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.860
We have to come to it with a
different point of view.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.400
But you can do chewy chocolate
chip cookies, or you can do

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.370
crispy chocolate chip cookies,
and one's not

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.490
better than the other.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:18.960
So it's mostly what you say, and
it's also our tastes, and

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.840
whether we think we can
add some value,

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.890
because it's a new direction.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.760
It's something different.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.410
Sometimes we'll go back and do
a story we did 10 years ago,

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.410
because we found out actually
it's not as good as it should

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.030
be, like pumpkin pie,
or creme brulee.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.910
But it's mostly just a function
of listening to what

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.750
you guys want.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:40.870
AUDIENCE: OK, sorry, one more,
since I'm a new cook.

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:44.650
So the trouble I always have
is doubling recipes.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.740
I always assume that if I need
to double it for whatever

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.940
reason, like a sauce or
whatever, that I literally

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:54.700
double every single ingredient
I see, which, yeah, OK.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.280
So are there certain things,
or a key, or something you

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.030
should use like never double
your flour, or only do that

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.360
amount and a quarter
or something?

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.140
CHRIS KIMBALL: Savory
versus baking.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.570
Savory, a few things
to watch out for.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.890
Don't double the heat
or the spices.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:11.080
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.850
CHRIS KIMBALL: Because
you hold off and then

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:14.830
taste as you go.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:15.980
But that's really a problem.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.000
Secondly, liquid.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.640
Sometimes in a stew, if you're
going to triple a stew, you

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.130
don't need triple the liquid.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.590
So that's something you
should look at.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:27.680
The other thing is in baking,
as you double a recipe, then

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.670
the pan size doesn't
necessarily-- you need a

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.100
different pan size.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.550
And you may end up with a
thicker, or more depth to the

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.670
cake, or whatever you're doing,
so the cooking time's

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:38.070
going to be off.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.090
If you're going to create
something bigger, you tend to

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:43.630
lower the oven temperature by
25 degrees, so it's going to

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.140
have to cook a little
longer, so you don't

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.480
overcook the outside.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.410
In general, baking is tough.

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:51.860
And also, when you mix things
together, like you're creaming

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.110
butter or mixing things
together, if you quadruple a

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.380
recipe, when you mix it, you're
going to over mix it to

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.700
get everything mixed together.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.360
For example, when you make
brownies, it always says, or

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.600
should say, streaks of flour
left in the batter?

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.370
Well, I know what you do,
because I do the same thing.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.560
I'm going like, hey, there
are still streaks of

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.250
flour in the batter.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.190
This can't be right.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:13.570
So you keep going
a couple more.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.280
Well, what happens is you
develop gluten as a result.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.640
The brownies rise a little bit
more, because there's more

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.540
structure, but they
turn out cakey.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.650
Not that good.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:23.630
So when you have double the
recipe or quadruple the

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.310
recipe, you end up mixing more,
there's more agitation,

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:27.570
and you end up--

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:31.380
so very often in the test
kitchen, we'll just maybe

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.962
double it, maybe not, and just
make more than one batch.

00:49:34.962 --> 00:49:36.940
But baking is particularly
difficult.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.924
AUDIENCE: So what about
cider-braised pork steaks,

00:49:38.924 --> 00:49:40.620
like a recipe like that?

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.412
CHRIS KIMBALL: That's
not a problem.

00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:43.260
AUDIENCE: You can double that?

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.830
CHRIS KIMBALL: Yeah.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:48.640
AUDIENCE: In the magazine where
the people write in with

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.960
questions, there was once
a question about using

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.830
California bay laurel leaves
instead of [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:55.800
CHRIS KIMBALL: Oh
yeah, Turkish.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:50:01.150
And the answer was that it
wasn't worth the price to use

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:02.000
California.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.750
But the thing is that we're
here in California.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.310
A lot of people have those
trees in their

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:06.710
yard, so it's free.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:10.930
And so I was wondering, can
you use the bay that grows

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.210
around here, and do you use a
different amount, or is it

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:16.220
just one for--

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:17.340
CHRIS KIMBALL: I do remember
that letter.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:17.830
It was a few years ago.

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.860
I think we decided that we
preferred, actually, the

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.070
California, I think.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.450
But yeah, sure.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.900
You can use them.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.095
I mean, my pet peeve is-- and
I argue this all the time--

00:50:28.095 --> 00:50:31.280
you know recipes, you're doing
a stew for 12 people, and it

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.310
says add a sprig of thyme?

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:34.930
Are you kidding me?

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:36.690
I mean, I don't know, maybe the
French had particularly

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:37.790
pungent thyme.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.910
But I mean, a sprig of thyme
isn't going to do anything.

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.520
You're never going to
know it's there.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.020
And sometimes I feel the same
way about bay leaves--

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.020
I always add an extra one.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.560
So yeah, you can use it, sure.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.690
But I think one thing I've
learned is, also, towards the

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:56.280
end of cooking, I mean, unless
it's baking, but if it's a

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.220
stew, a soup, or whatever,
taste it.

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.310
People just assume--

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:02.770
my 22-year-old loves to cook--

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:05.170
and she'll just follow the
recipe and won't taste

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:06.260
it and serve it.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.095
And, you know, it needs salt,
it needs something else, a

00:51:08.095 --> 00:51:09.360
little vinegar.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.920
But at the end of cooking, fresh
herbs are best added at

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:18.030
the end, grated or minced
ginger, garlic.

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:19.790
There's lots of little things
you can add at the end of

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.900
cooking-- vinegar,
lemon juice--

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.550
to get the balance right.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:26.370
And so that's the most important
part of cooking,

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:29.580
other than cleaning up, is
the last five minutes.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.820
And adding those things
at the end.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.330
And there's also secret
ingredients.

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:37.270
Years ago, someone in my office
mentioned pomegranate

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.620
molasses, and I made fun of
them, because it's a stupid

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.400
hard to find ingredient.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.930
Now it's not hard to find.

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.440
That's one of the things I have
at my disposal when I'm

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.530
cooking, just to get
the balance right.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.880
It's a little sweet,
a little sour.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.850
So it's that last minute that's
really important.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.140
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned about
thinking that there's

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.550
new spices, and that kind
of thing, maybe some new

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.338
techniques coming from
around the world.

00:52:01.338 --> 00:52:06.070
What about just new approaches,
and I guess more

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:09.600
technology in the kitchen?

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.550
CHRIS KIMBALL: Well,
sure, yes.

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:15.650
We're doing a pressure cooker
book right now.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:19.190
That's actually going to be
huge, because it's fast.

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:21.870
It's not a slow cooker,
it's a fast cooker.

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:24.590
You can make the world's best
chicken stock in 15 minutes.

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.420
You can make risotto
in 15 minutes.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.840
And also, a pressure cooker
turns out great food.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.050
So that's going to be big.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:33.890
Everyone's talking
about sous-vide.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.330
AUDIENCE: That's getting
to be affordable now.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:40.400
CHRIS KIMBALL: There's a $450
one we liked, which is--

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.210
I mean, the problem with that
is, money is one issue, but

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:44.850
then what do you do with it?

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:48.230
I'm sorry, I've gotten down to
small things now, because

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.150
these big things, you've
got to take it out.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:52.660
But yeah, sous-vide is fine.

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.410
Although, I have to say, the
problem with sous-vide for me

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:58.610
is I like to chew my food.

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:01.900
And I find, like, if you've
ever had a turkey sandwich

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:06.420
made with sous-vide turkey,
it feels kind of wet.

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:09.510
And so as a friend of mine
said about turkey at

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:14.150
Thanksgiving, he says he likes
overcooked white meat, because

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:15.740
that's the tradition
at his house.

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.590
And he said that's why
God invented gravy.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:18.190
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:21.180
CHRIS KIMBALL: Well, who wants
gravy and a particularly moist

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:21.900
piece of white meat?

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:22.960
It doesn't work.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.630
So I don't know.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:27.480
Yeah, it's a great way of
cooking, but I don't think

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.740
that's going to be in
everybody's kitchen.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.360
But I think the pressure cooker
is probably one of

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.490
those things that will be.

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:32.990
So thank you very much.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:37.032
[APPLAUSE]
