00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.220
Hey it's a beautiful day in May and

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.800
this tree right here is shedding these seeds everywhere

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.300
that look a lot like cotton balls

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.720
now it's not technically cotton

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.980
but its very light and fluffy the same way

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.940
and if you look on the ground here

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.160
you can see that they are pretty much everywhere

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.200
now you can see as you add the seeds together

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.520
it makes a nice big ball of fluff

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.820
it's very soft, very light and fluffy

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.940
see it's very easy to tear

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.700
this stuff should make some pretty good tinder

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.920
lets add it to our batch

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.800
now of course the first thing that comes to my mind is whether or not we could use these

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.860
to make some of that improvised char cloth i used cotton balls for in a previous project

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.800
so let's go fill up a tuna can with this stuff and put it on the burner and see if we can make some improvised fire starter

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.560
so I got quite a bit of this fluffy stuff, I also got a tuna can and you can see I poked a hole in the bottom there

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.540
if we shove all that down in there and put the lid back on top

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.380
makes a pretty tight seal

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.260
and now we can set that upright on a fire, a flame, a stove. whatever you want so long as there's quite a bit of heat

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.680
we want to cook this thing without letting oxygen get in

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.680
now when you go to cook char cloth that's as light and fluffy as this cotton type of stuff you want to make sure that no air can get in there

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.160
and this will pop open under pressure

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.240
so I'm just using, like, a rock, to sit on top there

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.440
and it's really important not to overcook this. We want to just heat it up until it makes the flame and when that flame goes down out of the top we want to stop

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.380
if we go any further than that our char cloth is not going to work

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:30.640
*blowtorch*

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.380
there it goes, we're done

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.000
now we just need to plug that hole with something, make sure that no air gets in there

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.300
something like that

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.320
and let it cool down

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.160
alright, it's actually only been about 2 minutes here but I'm just going to show you what would happen if we opened this up

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.400
here we go

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.400
oh

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.900
there you see this ones undercooked

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.580
this got really nicely charred but this other side is only half cooked but

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.800
let me take a piece off here, off the top and we're going to see if that'll work

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.600
as a proof of concept

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.100
now lets see how many of you remember what thing is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.920
this is one of the earliest projects i did

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.720
it was my 14th preoject video

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.720
and I made it transparent so we can actually

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720
see compression starting in action

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.720
and it worked with cotton balls, so I am curious

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.720
to see hows its going to work with this improvised char that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.420
we made from this cotton seed

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.420
Now I need to do is just load the tip with

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.580
little bit of our char

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.960
You see that claw grabs everything in there pretty nicely

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400
Once thats all on the set, we can go ahead and give

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.340
a nice big wack

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.180
Here we go

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.460
We did it right, we just got a little flash

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and ofcourse once you get your tinder smoking

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
you can put in bundle, give it a little blow

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
It actually did light on fire. Thats cool!

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.740
Just wanna drop that down in there

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.000
That is getting pretty close to gone up in flames

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.220
I had to bring this outside, so I didn't set up

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.520
this smoke detector in the house

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.540
So I wrapped another piece of paper towel around it

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.740
just to give it a little more fuel

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.740
but I wanna light this thing up for ya and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.000
it should only take a few breaths of fresh air

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.740
And when you are trying to get your tinder to light

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.740
its best just to let it to smoulder in its own pace

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.980
you dont wanna rush it

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.260
you go too fast

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.080
Its not gonna like that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.560
You can see this smoke is starting to get really thick

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.320
Oh! Here we go

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320
FIRE!

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.800
Whoa! That wasn't as easy as I thought it was gonna be

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.200
but atleast we got it to work
