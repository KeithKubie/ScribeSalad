00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.320
hello my name is Alicia and what I would

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
hello my name is Alicia and what I would
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.310
hello my name is Alicia and what I would
like to know is you think time Israel

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320
like to know is you think time Israel
 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.900
like to know is you think time Israel
for example sometimes an hour can still

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
for example sometimes an hour can still
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.310
for example sometimes an hour can still
very short and sometimes it can feel

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
very short and sometimes it can feel
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.670
very short and sometimes it can feel
very long depending on your perception

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680
very long depending on your perception
 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.200
very long depending on your perception
so then is time subjective if it's a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210
so then is time subjective if it's a
 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.900
so then is time subjective if it's a
measurement of something what is it a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
measurement of something what is it a
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.689
measurement of something what is it a
measurement of I'd really like to know

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699
measurement of I'd really like to know
 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.490
measurement of I'd really like to know
your thoughts about time Thank You

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500
your thoughts about time Thank You
 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.220
your thoughts about time Thank You
Alicia that is fantastic

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230

notice that in English we don't have any

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
notice that in English we don't have any
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.470

other word for time except time it's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
other word for time except time it's
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.940
other word for time except time it's
unique is it's this wild fourth

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950
unique is it's this wild fourth
 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.400
unique is it's this wild fourth
dimension in nature this is one

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
dimension in nature this is one
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.170
dimension in nature this is one
dimension this is one dimension this is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
dimension this is one dimension this is
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090
dimension this is one dimension this is
one dimension then time is the fourth

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
one dimension then time is the fourth
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130
one dimension then time is the fourth
dimension and we call it the fourth

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
dimension and we call it the fourth
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.729
dimension and we call it the fourth
dimension

not just in theoretical physics but in
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560
not just in theoretical physics but in

it is above sea level and then when you
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.719
it is above sea level and then when you
want to get there

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
want to get there
 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.410

we just have this one word it's a
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.600

strange and surprising thing so along

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
strange and surprising thing so along
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.080

in my opinion time is both subjective

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
in my opinion time is both subjective
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.520
in my opinion time is both subjective
and and objective what we do in science

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
and and objective what we do in science
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.359

to have a global positioning system that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
to have a global positioning system that

the street you're on from your phone you
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.109
the street you're on from your phone you
need to take into account both the

need to take into account both the
 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.639
need to take into account both the
traditional passage of time that you

traditional passage of time that you
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.440
traditional passage of time that you
might be familiar with watching a clock

work very hard to measure time with all

sorts of extraordinary clocks but there

sometimes it feels short sometimes it

sometimes it feels short sometimes it
 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.270
sometimes it feels short sometimes it
feels long and it's just the nature I

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
feels long and it's just the nature I
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.800

think of being constrained by measuring

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
think of being constrained by measuring
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.199
think of being constrained by measuring
time with our brains this is why we

build instruments to measure time

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
build instruments to measure time
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.420
build instruments to measure time
outside of ourselves externally but it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430
outside of ourselves externally but it
 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.610
outside of ourselves externally but it
is a great question and then the whole

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620
is a great question and then the whole
 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.199
is a great question and then the whole
idea of science really started with this

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209
idea of science really started with this
 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.470

philosophy and when you throw in the

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389
philosophy and when you throw in the
 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.360
philosophy and when you throw in the
word philosophy for me you start asking

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370
word philosophy for me you start asking
 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.759
word philosophy for me you start asking
this question like can you know anything

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769
this question like can you know anything
 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.580
this question like can you know anything
let alone what time it is or how long

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590
let alone what time it is or how long
 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.550
let alone what time it is or how long
it's been sand something happened or

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560
it's been sand something happened or
 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.839
it's been sand something happened or
whether or not or when something will

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849
whether or not or when something will
 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.099
whether or not or when something will
happen in the future or whether or not

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109
happen in the future or whether or not
 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.330
happen in the future or whether or not
it will happen at all

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340
it will happen at all
 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.270
it will happen at all
these are philosophical questions and I

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280
these are philosophical questions and I
 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.580
these are philosophical questions and I
feel that you can get yourself pretty

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590
feel that you can get yourself pretty
 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.240
feel that you can get yourself pretty

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
spun up and in saying to yourself
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.969
spun up and in saying to yourself
there's no way to know anything you can

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979
there's no way to know anything you can
 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.770
there's no way to know anything you can
philosophically you can't know anything

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780
philosophically you can't know anything
 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.099
philosophically you can't know anything
on the other hand it seems to me we can

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109
on the other hand it seems to me we can
 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.460
on the other hand it seems to me we can
know a great deal about nature and that

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470
know a great deal about nature and that
 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.069
know a great deal about nature and that
includes time and its passage one last

one had discovered it yet and so I just

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579
one had discovered it yet and so I just
 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.420
one had discovered it yet and so I just
wonder what else it is about the nature

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430
wonder what else it is about the nature
 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.289
wonder what else it is about the nature
of time or the nature of what physicists

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299
of time or the nature of what physicists
