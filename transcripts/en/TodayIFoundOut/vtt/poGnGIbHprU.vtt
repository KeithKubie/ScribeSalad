00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.890
Without the use of their hands, astronauts
have to rely on other means to scratch various

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.890
itches.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.070
For any itch outside of the face, retired
astronaut Clayton Anderson explained, “You

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.130
shake, rattle and roll, baby!

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.869
That’s the only thing really that you can
do to alleviate that itch.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.230
Hopefully, between the incredibly bulky and
stiff suit itself and the liquid cooling garment

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.940
you are wearing beneath the suit, you can
wiggle your body enough to effectively scratch

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.210
that itch!”

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.150
Itches on the face can be a bit more tricky,
but there are things within reach.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.170
For instance, under the helmet astronauts
wear what is sometimes referred to as a Snoopy

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.950
Cap that is equipped with earphones and a
microphone.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.340
If an itch presents itself on the lower half
of the face, the microphone is one commonly

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.090
used scratching post.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.700
The downfall of this method is that the action
sometimes moves the microphone out of position,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.450
interfering a little with the sound quality
in communications.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.671
blowAnother option astronauts use is the valsalva
device, which is a foam piece attached to

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.420
the bottom interior of the spacesuit helmet.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.520
The purpose of the valsalva device is to allow
an astronaut to block up their nostrils and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.899
blow to equalize pressure in the ears when
necessary.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.679
Beyond its intended purpose, the foam block
is a handy device for scratching an itch.

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.770
Of course, you could potentially get a little
snot rubbed on the itchy spot if you’ve

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.489
previously used the humps on the valsalva
to stopper your nose, but desperate times

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:37.489
and all that…

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:41.569
scratchingA third option to address facial
itches is a strategically placed piece of

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:42.569
Velcro.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.890
This was particularly used during the Apollo
missions.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.849
(And, note, contrary to popular belief, Velcro
was not invented by NASA, nor specifically

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:51.380
for use in the space program.)

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.680
The astronauts would typically place the Velcro
on the little feed port flap that is held

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.820
closed via the pressure in the suit when out
in space.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.379
Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt noted,
“Everybody seemed to agree that you needed

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:05.530
that [Velcro]…”

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.880
If an itch pops up where nothing sufficiently
abrasive can be rubbed against it, the astronaut

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.270
simply has to endure, generally using the
distraction tactic until the itch fades.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.580
This is easier than in some other settings.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.709
A typical spacewalk lasts between five and
eight hours and being out there working is

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.290
incredibly laborious due to how stiff the
space suit gets when in the near vacuum of

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.120
space (even just flexing your fingers to grip
things is relatively difficult).

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.290
Between the straining and extreme focus needed
to complete some of the tasks the astronauts

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.849
are out there for, not to mention the absolutely
beautiful view and the knowledge that there

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.019
is very little between you and the near vacuum
of space, there’s plenty to get caught up

00:02:46.019 --> 00:03:06.890
in and forget all about the itch.
