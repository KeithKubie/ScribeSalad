00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.577
- We got the special kabob
with the marrow in it again.

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:05.565
(chattering in foreign language)

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:09.065
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.030
Such an eye opener.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.950
If I think back throughout
the entire year,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.070
that was the single bite that
just shocked my taste buds

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.010
into new peak levels of deliciousness

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.830
that I've ever had in my entire life.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.180
In this video I'm gonna share with you 10,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.250
the 10 best meals I ate in 2018.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.330
One thing to note is that this list is not

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.370
in order of delicious
but it's just in order

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.410
of time from the beginning of the year to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.950
the end of the year and
this happened to be like,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.390
I didn't plan for this,
I love to eat vegetables

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.460
but it happened to be quite a
meaty year, as you will see.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.220
How long do they smoke for?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.790
- Oh anywhere between, like small ones

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.230
like this guy will take about eight hours.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.063
- [Host] Okay.

00:00:52.063 --> 00:00:55.050
- [Chef] Maybe one like
that'll take 10 to 14.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.220
(chattering in background)

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.320
There you go, you didn't get one did you?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.290
There you go, dude.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.440
- That's a lot of meat.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.319
This platter of meat

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.730
is gigantic and absolutely insane.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.690
I think we have to start
with the center piece

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.790
which is the beef short
ribs and they only make it

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.150
Friday and Saturday, so
we came on the right day.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.730
Look at that, we can just press down.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.253
- I can't wait to taste it.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.433
(upbeat ensemble music)

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.178
(laughs)

00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:29.725
Oh.

00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:30.897
Oh no.

00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:32.643
- Oh that is,

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:35.663
oh that is almost impossible.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.470
Look how tender and
juicy and fatty that is.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.450
Number two, we are off to Mexico.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.700
Just in time as they're
opening a fresh oven.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.330
Oh, that is unbelievable.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.910
He took off the lid of the clay oven

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.390
and just a poof of smoke came out.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.020
So the smoke is just locked up inside that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.550
clay oven and you can
immediately smell it.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.390
The owner just told me it's lamb.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.890
In order to take the meat out of the oven,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.330
because it's so ridiculously ultra-tender,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.870
they just scoop it out by the plateful.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.910
They don't need knives here.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.280
All they do is take a
plate and literally like

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.390
scoop it in or grab it
and they just take plate

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.610
after plate of the most tender meat you've

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.740
ever tasted in your life out of that oven.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.520
It's just oozy and
dripping with juices, wow.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.720
That's all meat, man.

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:35.835
Oh man.

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:37.190
Number three was so cool because we

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.810
really did not have any plan when we

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.070
set off on the day and it just unfolded.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.103
Grateful for all the people
that helped us, number three.

00:02:47.237 --> 00:02:50.659
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.576
(upbeat guitar, trumpet music)

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.940
It took like five hours to make this mole.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.720
They made everything from scratch
starting with the chilies.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.683
There must be 30 different
ingredients in this mole recipe.

00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:12.700
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.533
Muy, muy bueno.

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:15.450
I can tell you certainly there's

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.380
nothing like this in the world.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.090
Number four is so cool because you go out

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.800
onto a little boat, you're
on a little floating

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.140
platform and then you're
presented with these,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.542
like a platter of giant blooming oysters.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:33.709
(relaxed electronic, piano music)

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:42.614
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:42.614 --> 00:03:46.947
(festive trumpet, electronic music)

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.100
Oh, he just freshly opened these.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.460
I gotta try one as is immediately.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.770
I'm going for that center guy.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.963
Yeah, look at the size of that.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.220
Oh, that's just as unbelievably
fresh as it can get.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.710
For number five, let's go to
Accra, Ghana in West Africa.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.180
All sorts of things, probably
the palm in that oil.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.680
You can smell the fish,
you can smell the chilies.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.077
Oh wow.

00:04:26.548 --> 00:04:27.400
Wow.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.970
Let me tell you, making banku,

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.450
stirring it like that, that's
rowing on the next level.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.670
The Chop Bar, it's a local restaurant.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.250
In all those dishes you choose your starch

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.993
and you choose your soup
and then they dish it out.

00:04:42.743 --> 00:04:45.153
- I go for food and good cooked meat.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.293
And light soup.
- Wow.

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:51.865
- Oh my gosh.
- Is it so good?

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:52.698
- It's so good.

00:04:52.698 --> 00:04:54.410
- Oh wow, that's really smooth in texture

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.410
and really kinda sticky,
kinda almost like, dip it?

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.230
- You have to dip it.
- I'm gonna go for one of

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.780
those chilies on my first bite.

00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:05.340
Mm mm.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.663
I'm just gonna pick this
up like a drumstick.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.850
And by the way, I'm gonna
have all of this information,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.100
all of these meals plus
the top destinations

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.530
that I visited plus I'm
gonna share with you

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.360
the camera gear that I use in a blog post

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.720
which will be linked
in the description box.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.930
Number six, to the East Coast of Africa.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.679
Today we are in Shela Village
which is on Lamu Island.

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:36.979
- Garlic, turmeric.
- Turmeric, curry powder.

00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:40.720
(sizzling)

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.130
The cook, she first stir fried some onions

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.640
and carrots and caramelized
them in some oil.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.420
Then she added in that pounded

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.840
mixture of the garlic and the spices,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.240
the turmeric, the black pepper.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.860
Immediately as that hit the oil,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.233
that aroma just overwhelmed my nose.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.070
Oh man, that just smells insanely good.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.500
But she added in the crumbs,
she added in the coconut milk.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.193
The final step is that
she added in the, oh wait.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.700
Finally this is the bite
that I have been waiting for.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.550
Some of the prawns, I'll take a prawn,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.513
I'll mix it with the rice.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.600
That is ultimate,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.953
that's a ridiculously
delicious combination.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.440
From the first time I tasted this dish,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.970
I think I was back in like
sixth or seventh grade when

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.100
I was like 11 years old, this
has been one of my favorite

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.453
dishes and to have it at
the source, it was special.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.883
She's adding some water but that aroma.

00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:45.607
(bubbling)

00:06:45.607 --> 00:06:50.607
Nice.
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.417
- This is what it's about.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.210
- You can just see the onions

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.880
which have simmered down into that sauce.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.595
It's not thickened by anything except for

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:08.995
the onions and some oil
and the spices in there.

00:07:14.148 --> 00:07:15.820
(children screaming)

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.320
It's so good.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.810
Oh man, I mean it's so good.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.100
The chicken is amazing but it's so good,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.420
the sauce is so incredibly good,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.173
you barely even, I mean
it's good with just sauce.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.130
Moving on to number eight and this

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.390
was just one of the ultimate platters.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.530
It is the signature Samarkand plov.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.630
It's different from the
other version we've had

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.910
in Tosh, Kenya and it looks
like dark, used motor oil.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.150
But that's flaxseed, black flaxseed oil

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.020
and he pulled out a chunk of the meat.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.090
Is that lamb or beef?
- It's beef.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.430
- It's beef, okay.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.500
Giant chunks of beef
just simmered and you can

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.300
also see there's raisins in
there as well as chickpeas.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.250
- [Cook] Chickpeas.

00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:57.810
(up tempo electronic music)

00:08:02.674 --> 00:08:06.060
(speaking foreign language)

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.050
- As majestic as the sights are

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.370
in Samarkand is that plate of plov.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.490
They've got a giant platter plate

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.690
with the geometric designs on it.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.290
First bite, reaching in
mostly for rice and carrots.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.280
Those carrots, mm.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.377
And that beef is just full for dinner.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.460
Number nine and again
this list is not in order

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.870
of delicious but this next dish,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.190
when I think about it I feel like

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.980
tears starting to form in my eyes.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.860
It's that good.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.700
This might be the coolest restaurant,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.940
like cooking station I
have ever seen in my life.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.800
That is an entire bonfire,
it's just radiating.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.870
He's mixing the meat right now.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.163
Tomatoes go in, nice.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.680
Without a doubt this is one of

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.380
the coolest restaurants of my life.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.148
So he makes the meat and
I love that shove move,

00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:07.763
he just slides it into the fat.

00:09:09.619 --> 00:09:14.080
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.570
We got the special kabob
with the marrow in it again.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.850
Gotta get that, oh just juices, oh.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.620
Oh look at that,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.603
oh wow.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.530
Just gonna sprinkle on
some of that citrus,

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.637
some of that (speaking foreign language).

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.620
And finally number 10,
but keep on watching

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.050
this video because I have
more to share with you,

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.060
the top destinations,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.370
is the Biryani game changer.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.753
They're putting it on a plate.

00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:49.910
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.020
It's not even a plate but this is

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.210
an entire metal saucer bowl, wow.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.345
- Heavy, too.
(laughs)

00:09:57.345 --> 00:09:59.530
- Hassim is gonna help us with the bones.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.430
Oh there it comes.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.447
- [Guest] Dude, I can't
believe that actually works.

00:10:16.447 --> 00:10:17.670
- You gotta hit it hard, man.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.713
- I can hear like pieces
rattling in there, there it goes.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.990
Still it's so hot and so delicate.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.553
Marrow biters.
(cheers)

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.760
- No way.
(chuckles)

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.263
- The marrow makes butter feel tough.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.620
That wraps up the top,
the best meals of 2018.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.750
It's so hard for me to choose
but the reason I enjoy,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.480
I don't really like making
lists of top 10 because

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.670
there are so many variables
of what makes a good meal,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.610
from the people to the location to

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.973
the visual aspect of it
to the delicious taste.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.260
But one of the reasons I enjoy doing this

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.150
every year is because it
allows me to really think back,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.860
to really reflect on the
things and the people I met,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.140
the food that I ate

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.830
and just reflect on the year

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.850
and so that's partly the
reason I love doing this.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.910
All right and next I just wanna

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.950
share the top 10 destinations.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.723
Number one, I really loved
Merida in Yucatan, Mexico.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.170
Number two, Luang Prabang, Laos.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.723
What an ultimate relaxation place.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.210
Number three is Trat in Thailand which is

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.853
a beautiful eastern coastal
province in Thailand.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.253
Number four, Cape Coast, Ghana.

00:11:46.119 --> 00:11:47.730
Yes, yeah.
(children clapping)

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.550
Number five is the beautiful

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.964
Swahili culture, Lamu Island, Kenya.

00:11:52.964 --> 00:11:56.200
(up tempo electronic music)

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.503
Number six, on the shores of
Lake Kivu, Gisenyi, Rwanda.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.180
(shouting)

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.990
Number, oh ho ho, number
seven which was also

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.580
the scariest moment of
the year, Harar, Ethiopia.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.021
- Sit, get a stick and try to face me.

00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:15.300
- Yes?
- There we go.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.740
- Oh, hey.
- Get a stick.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.420
That one is on your back, don't worry.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.423
Okay, okay.

00:12:21.927 --> 00:12:22.830
Okay.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.161
- Number eight is Samarkand, Uzbekistan

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.578
which the architecture just blew me away.

00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:34.370
And number nine is Peshawar, Pakistan.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.703
I loved the culture, the
people, the food, the meat.

00:12:45.017 --> 00:12:47.127
And then finally number 10,

00:12:47.127 --> 00:12:50.140
Hunza Valley, Pakistan which is easily

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.350
one of the most naturally spectacular,

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.400
beautiful, unbelievable places that I've

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.330
ever been in my entire
life and the mountains,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.145
the people, the culture, it
was, ah it was breathtaking.

00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:08.640
(traditional Pakistani guitar music)

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.330
So again the link will be
in the description box,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.130
go check that out, go check
out the full blog post.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.000
It will include all this
information plus more details.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Again I am extremely grateful
for your incredible support

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.630
and without you, this
entire channel, the videos,

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.380
the travel, it wouldn't be
possible without your support

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.090
and your sharing and
your continuing to watch

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.100
