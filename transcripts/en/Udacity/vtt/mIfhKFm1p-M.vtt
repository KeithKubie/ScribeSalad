00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.080
Before doing anything else,
we first need to capture the values in

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.510
the tableau with a collection
of boolean variables.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.610
We'll start with this State column here.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.560
We let Qi represent whether after
step i, the state is q sub k.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.998
Similarly, for the Head Position,
we define H, i,

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:24.350
j, to represent whether the head
is over square j after step i.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.100
That captures this column.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.605
And lastly, for the Tape Contents,
we define s, i, j, k,

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:34.410
to represent whether after step i,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.550
square j, contains the tape
symbol enumerated as k.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.730
That captures all of these columns,
here.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.570
Note that as we define these variables,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.930
there are many truth assignments
that are simply nonsensical.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.730
For instance every one of the q
variables could be assigned

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.440
a value of true.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.620
But in a given configuration sequence,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.910
the Turing machine can't be
in all states at all times.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.250
Similarly we can't assign
them to all be false.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.420
The machine has to be in some
state at each time step.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.690
We have the same problems with
the head position variables, and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.140
with the variables for
the squares on the tape.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.750
All of this is okay.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.670
For now, we just need a way to make
sure that any accepting configuration

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.099
sequence has a corresponding
truth assignment.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.170
For any way of filling out the tableau,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.340
the corresponding truth assignment is
uniquely defined by these meanings.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.650
It's the job of the boolean formula
to rule out truth assignments

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.690
that don't correspond to
a valid accepting computation.
