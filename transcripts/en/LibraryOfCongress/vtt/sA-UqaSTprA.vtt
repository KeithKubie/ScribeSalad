&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D. C.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.760
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Good morning again.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.090
Buenos dias.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.580
My name is Stephanie Marcus,
and I'm a research specialist

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.210
in the science, technology
and business division.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.970 position:56%
This is the first lecture of 2016,
and it's the first in our tenth year

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.160
of our collaboration
with NASA Goddard.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.100
So it's been very fruitful, and
we were trying to choose talks

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.150
for this year and there
were so many good topics.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.540 position:56%
Normally we choose six, but we
couldn't resist, and we chose eight.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.920
So it's going to be
a very busy year.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.240
The next ones aren't till May, so
we have a little time to prepare

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.740
and since we had a snafu
today getting out speaker

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.830
into the parking lot,
we had plenty of time

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.180
to get the next one his parking.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.150
Today our program is on
El Nino, as you know.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.900
And our speaker is Steven
Pawson from NASA Goddard.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.100 position:56%
He came there in 1997, as a
meteorologist atmospheric physicist.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.070
And he's been the Chief
of the Global Modelling

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.500
and Assimilation Office since 2014,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.840
and has been on its
staff since 2003.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.190
And if it's wrong, I got
this off the website.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.240
So this man has a little
bit different background

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.540
from our other speakers.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.810
He was educated in England
pretty much, and I think you are.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: I'm English.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.540
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
British born, yes.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.930
Let's see.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.760
He spent almost a decade at
the Meteorological Institute

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
of the Free University of Berlin.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.120
And he was also teaching
there for six years.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.530
He was the editor for
several years for the Journal

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.210
of Geophysical Research
Atmospheres, which is published

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.400
by the American Geophysical Union.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.360
He has a master's in atmospheric
sciences from Imperial College,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.130
the University of London.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.600
And a Ph. D in meteorology from
the University of Edinburgh.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.340
He was a post-doc in space
and atmospheric physics

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.590
at the University of Oxford.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.730
So he's well-educated.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.930
And since we all think we know
a little bit about El Nino,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.080
we're going to listen to a man who
knows everything about El Nino.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.720
Welcome, Dr. Pawson.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: Thank you.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.250
[ Applause ]

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.490
Well, thank you for
the nice introduction.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.980
I thought I was going to tell you
everything about El Nino today,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.150
and when I first started
planning this presentation,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.870
I was thinking I was going to show
satellite observations of clouds

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.810
in Ethiopia, how the monsoon goes

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.700
down in India, fires
in South America.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.020
Flooding everywhere.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.800
And when it comes down to it,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.450
there's just so much
to say about El Nino.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.300
I actually ended up dropping a lot

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.150
of those aspects from
the presentation.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.930
I wanted to try to give just
a zoom-in on the Pacific Ocean

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.880
where El Nino is really happening.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.860
And then a look at some of
the things that are happening

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.300
around the world because of that.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.320
But really, I want to try to
give you a sense of a little bit

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.000
of how El Nino works, what it
really is and also how NASA has

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.030
so many satellite observations
that can contribute

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.190
to our understanding
of the phenomenon.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.710
And also how we can use those with
numerical models to do predictions

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.310
of how things are going
to evolve in the future.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.900
And in doing this I want to try
to give you that NASA and NOA play

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.500
in some ways similar but
actually very different roles.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.670
And that NOA is an operational
agency, and they have a fleet

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.870 position:56%
of operational satellites which they
can use and do long-term products.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.130
NASA comes a bit more from the
space science point of view.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.140
We're doing research
types of instruments,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.370
so maybe some of them
are a little short-lived.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.750
But they set up standards
and demonstrate

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.160
that observations can be
made of different processes.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.410
And that they can be
used into the future.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.700
And that I think gives
NASA an incentive

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.140
to continue the time series of
observations or it gives us a means

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.260
of convincing NOA to try to
take on that kind of observing.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.980
And what I want to try to do
today is just give you a flavor

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.370
of how we work in that
regard, of how NASA makes sort

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.970
of revolutionary observations
at certain times.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.130
And how we can use those to help
put together the big picture

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.780
of the processes at work.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.950
I've tried to put a
little history in as well,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.190
to try to show us how those people
from like a century ago were able

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.650
to just take a few points of
information spread over time

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.950
and put those altogether,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.540
and actually understand pretty much
what we still understand today.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.770
It's just that now we
have a lot more detail

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.830
from the number of
observations we have.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.320
This is a slide.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.740
I started collecting
things from newspapers.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.870
I might be seeing a
little problem here.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.550
And there's a lot of
-- over the world,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.250
like different newspapers
are publishing stories

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.200
about El Nino's back and
droughts in Australia.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.030
There's flooding in
Southern California.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.950
A lot of El Nino related
damage in the Philippines

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.220
and Indonesia and things like that.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.350
There's been a lot of
headline news about El Nino.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.740
And also, has it been affecting
the droughts in California?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.450
Has it been affecting
these big storms that came

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.860
up the east coast of the US?

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.820
And I'm thinking about that.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.790
They all make the news and
get into the newspapers.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.700
So my verview, which has an
O at the front of it usually,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.060 position:56%
is basically to say what is El Nino.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.490
I'd like to give an overview
of what it looks like.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.650
Yeah, I set the formats of these
slides on a stretched screen

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.430
and it's kind of truncated
on the 4x3 I think.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.730
El Nino in history.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.660
So look at the historical
observations, and then moving

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.820
into NASA's observations before we
go to the work that we actually do

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.750
in the Global Modelling
and Assimilation office,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.350
which is using those observations
alongside computer models,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.540
high-end computer models,
to make detailed analyses

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.660
of the three-dimensional
structure of El Nino.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.140
And forecasts of how it's going to
behave over the next few months.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.850
And then looking at the view
from space of different parts

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.960
of the climate system that
are affected by El Nino

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.990
and a little bit of
a summary at the end.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.320
So start off with a basic
description of El Nino.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.910
What is El Nino?

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.640
And basically looking at the oceans
and the signals that El Nino has.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.880
So I'm going to start with a map
of global sea surface temperature.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.500
So this is what's called a Robinson
projection, so it goes in a bit

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.000
at the poles and it gives
you roughly the sense

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.200
that the tropics are very large.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.440
And if we look at this map --

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.670
This doesn't seem to be working.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.420
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Just press that button.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.720
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: That one?

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.020
The red one?

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.320
That helps, yeah.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.620
Okay, so there we go.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.920
So this is sea surface temperature

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.780
and basically the Reynolds sea
surface time series is a very

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.360
famous product.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.980
It's developed at NOA.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:35.510 position:56%
And it's used to produce essentially
global maps at least every month

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.510
of the temperatures of
the surface of the ocean.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.810
And to see what you expect.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.910
At the poles where there's
less sunlight, it gets cooled.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.060
It's cold so those
temperatures are blue.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.100
They are just in the
low few Celsius.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.310
Then by the time you
get to the tropics,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.550
you can see the temperatures
are well into the 20's Celsius.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.060
Much warmer water.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.510
And in particular what
we'd like to look at today

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.790 position:56%
in this region of the Pacific Ocean.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.320
And we can see that
over by Indonesia,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.140
the maritime continent north of
Australia in the western Pacific,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.780
the temperatures really
are up to above 28 Celsius.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.480
And that's kind of a magic number.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.990
Because 28 Celsius is about the
temperature that we need to have

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.530
for deep, powerful
convection to happen.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.840
So basically over that region we're
going to get strong clouds forming,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.590
very deep clouds and storms.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.770 position:56%
And in the normal case, there's a
lot of precipitation in this region.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.290
And we can see what's called the
intertropical convergence zone,

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:42.800
which is essentially a warm tongue
extending over to the east Pacific.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.590
That hits Central America.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.890 position:56%
And if we look right on the equator,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.190
we can see cooler waters
here off the coast of Peru.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:55.210
And that is associated with
the currents we'll talk

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.510
about in a few moments.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.080
But this is the basic structure of
temperature over the Pacific Ocean.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.360
Warm on the west, cooler
on the east.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.640
At least in the southern hemisphere
and under the equator itself.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.940
There's that gradient.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:14.740 position:56%
And that's essentially the normal
state of the circulation over there.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.590
And this is basically
pointing out what I just said.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.270
And this black rectangle
is essentially showing us

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.230
that the main region of
interest for El Nino --

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.590
so when you think about it,
it's the tropical Pacific Ocean.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.420
But this projection does a fairly
good job of preserving areas.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:38.060
This is actually about between
30 north and 30 south is half

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.940
of the globe in terms
of surface area.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.720
And this is almost half of that in
terms of the longitudinal extent.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.990
So El Nino is a huge thing.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.900
It's affecting -- variations

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.580
in El Nino are really affecting the
global temperatures because it's

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.990
such a large area of the
globe that we're looking at.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.910
What we tend to show when
we're looking at El Nino

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.170
and other phenomena is the anomaly.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.840
And that's the departure from the
long-term average in this sense.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.840
So we look at an average from
something like 1980-2000 and we do

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.640
that and we subtract that from the
actual year that we're looking at.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.650
And that's essentially telling
us how different is this year

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.700
from a normal year, if
a normal year exists?

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.280
And this is December of 2013
again, the month that we just saw.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.690
And we can see that in
this tropical region here,

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.250
there are really very
small differences

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.820
from the normal situation here.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.470
So this is what we
call a neutral year.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.510
There was no El Nino
and there is no La Nina.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.060
Yeah? We're not going to talk
too much about La Nina today.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.420 position:56%
La Nina is essentially just an
intensification of the normal state.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:49.190 position:56%
So where it's cold over here and the
average is just a little bit colder

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.440
than normal average, and probably
a little bit warmer over here.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.220
The more interesting one is the
El Nino, and this is the plot

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.980
from the previous December,
2015, the one that just passed.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.520
And here we can see a
very different situation.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.490
Now we've got a slightly cool
anomaly over the western Pacific,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.340
but here over the eastern
Pacific we can see a very,

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.830
very large red colored contour
that's showing us temperatures more

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.730
than two degrees above
the typical situation.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.930
And this is the development
of the El Nino case,

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.690 position:56%
where the warmth has basically moved

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.560
across the Pacific
to the other side.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.610
And now south of the equator

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.610
in Peru there's these warm
ocean temperatures there.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.860
And that's showing
up as that anomaly.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.880
There are other features you
can see too in the other oceans.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.690
But they are less of
a concern today.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.100
Except one thing here.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.860
I'm just going to talk
back to the 2013 case.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.630
Already we're seeing
this very warm anomaly

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.820
in the Pacific Ocean off
the west coast of the US.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.380
And that's been referred
to quite a bit in the press

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.100
as the blob and things like that.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.280
It's basically a warm anomaly
off the coast of California

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.450
and the entire west coast here.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:09.260 position:56%
And this is probably related to the
drought that we've been experiencing

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.440
in California and on the west
coast over the past few years.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.440
This has been quite persistent.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.180
And it's led to the
anomalously low rainfalls

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.410
over the west coast,
the site of the drought.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.250
Or if it hasn't led to it,
it's associated with it.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.040
It's all part of the same sort
of large-scale sort of patterns

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.340
of variations in the atmosphere.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.890
And you can see when
we go back to 2015,

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.190 position:56%
that's still apparent there as well.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.980
And that's probably going to be
important just towards the end

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.160
of the presentation when we
talk a little about California.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:48.210
So that's essentially what I
wanted to show at the beginning.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.780
Now just one more thing.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.280
If we look at this map here,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.040
we can see that this is directly
compiled from observations.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.820
So observations are
coming in from ships.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.600
They're coming in from
satellite observations

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.930
of the ocean temperatures.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.460
And from satellites
especially, they're very spotty

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.070
because there are a lot of clouds
in the way and things like that.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.050
So you can see that spottiness
come through on these maps.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.620 position:56%
Especially outside the tropics, it's
got a bit of a spotty structure.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.190
Whereas on this plot, this is
essentially the same field,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.620
just using the same
observations more or less

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.110
with a few extra ones added.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.410
This is what happens

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.660
when we actually assimilate
those same observations.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.980
And essentially assimilation is
the art or mathematics really

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.290
of putting together observations
into a very complex computer model.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.510
And we're essentially, if you
interpolate you'd have information

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.550
about this point here
and this point here

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.310
and you could draw a straight
line between them and come

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.320 position:56%
up with some values from in between.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.370
What assimilation is
essentially doing is a very

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.250
sophisticated interpolation.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.800
And the model that we're
using to build that structure

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.240
in between the observation
points is based

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.360
on the dynamical equations
of motion.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.050
So we're actually using
that to use water masses

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.800
around when we do it for the ocean.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.590
And that gives us a good estimate
of the state of the ocean based

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.750 position:56%
on the observations in other places.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.640 position:56%
So it's essentially a very expensive
three-dimensional interpolation

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.600
that we're doing to come

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.330
up with optimize analyses
of the entire globe.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.600
And we'll see later we get the
three-dimensional structure

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.720
of the oceans as well from
just a few bits of information

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.280
about the vertical
profiles in the ocean.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.720
And the point here being if we
toggle back and forth for a moment,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.990
here it's very noisy from
the pure observations.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.990
Here we get a much smoother and
much more sort of realistic,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.620
dynamical looking field that's
taking into account the motions

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.860
of the ocean currents and the
surface winds blowing over it

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.970
that help define these fields.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.130
And so that's essentially the
work that the Global Modelling

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.910
and Assimilation office
is doing in this.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:15:01.430
And here again, as part of what
we do, this is showing us sections

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.290
across the equator from the
Indonesian side of the Pacific

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.370
to the South American
side of the Pacific.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.870
And it's showing depth
of the ocean froM0

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.700
to about 300 meters
below the surface.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.850
And this is the temperature anomaly
as a function of depth of the ocean

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:22.340
for December of 2013 where
we see just a very weak one

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.740
or two degree -- region that's one
or two degrees warmer than normal.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.460
And for December of 2015,
the strong El Nino year

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.800
that you saw at the top.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.990
And here you can see that
this temperature anomaly

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.080 position:56%
that we were looking at on the
surface just a moment ago is really,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.940
really prevalent below the surface.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.200
And it reaches about
7 degrees Celsius

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.660
on this South American
side of the Pacific.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.920
So under the ocean surface.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.230
Now as I said, this analysis
is made using the surface

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.530
ocean observations.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.280
It's made using an analysis
of the atmospheric state

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.380 position:56%
so we know the winds in some detail.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.940
And it's also made using
just very, very few profiles

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:06.450
of the ocean temperature and
salinity structure from some buoys

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.420
that are moored over in the
Pacific at certain locations.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.020
But really it's just a handful

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.440
of information that's
actually measured about that.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.710
And we use the model to
fill in the gaps and come

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.450 position:56%
up with a three-dimensional picture.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.500
The other thing that
we sometimes use,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.580
and I actually believe it's
actually not in this run,

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.170
but we sometimes use measurements

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.040
of the sea surface height
that we made from space.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.710
And we'll be looking
at those in a while.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.860
And essentially that's
useful because obviously

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.850
from space you can't see below the
surface of the ocean in most cases.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.360
Especially optically thick.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.210
So all you can do is
measure the top temperatures.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.980
One thing you can measure
at the surface,

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.700 position:56%
if you can measure the height of
the ocean you're essentially saying,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.190
"If that water in there is warm,
it's going to have a larger volume,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.950
so it's going to push
the height up."

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.740 position:56%
So these surface height observations
are telling us about the temperature

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.130
of the water over a huge, deep
layer beneath the surface.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.910
And so that's the type
of thing that can go

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:06.080
into getting this analysis as well.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.950
And so moving away from
that and going back to kind

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.890
of the schematic -- and
it's always tempting to try

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.210
to draw my schematics
of what's happening.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.790
And actually these days if you look

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.610
around the web you really
find some fantastic ones.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.080
And this one I think
sums up what's happening

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.390
and what we've just talked about.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.190
It's essentially showing
the ocean surface,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.520 position:56%
showing the normal warm temperatures

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.060
over to the western
part of the Pacific.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.710
And then the deep convection
above that, and this circulation

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.220
in the atmosphere that
goes up in that region

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.130
and it completely goes
across and down.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.010
And then the trade
winds they're called,

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.060
running across the
ocean's surface up there.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.360
And that's called the trade winds

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.550 position:56%
because of the ancient shipping
routes that sailors used to make use

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.770
of those to get across the Pacific.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.390
Essentially they'd be
blown across there.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.620
And it's showing underneath
the ocean surface,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.150
it's showing the thermocline.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:02.080
The thermocline is essentially the
boundary of the water that's mixed

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.280
up by turbulence caused
by wind stirring it.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.210
And the deep ocean waters,
which are not affected

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.640
by the surface winds so much.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.660 position:56%
And so what we're seeing is that
the thermocline is not far below the

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.160
surface on the Indonesian side.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.050
But then on the Peruvian side
here there's basically upwelling.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.350
We'll talk about that
again in a moment.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.700
And that's pushing the
cold, nutrient-rich water

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.690
from the deep ocean
upwards on the coast.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.430
And so the layer that's
actually affected

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.400
by the atmosphere is very thin
at that edge of the ocean.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.800
So that's the normal state.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.690
And then if we look at the El
Nino state we can see the warmer

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.990
temperatures moving
across the equator.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.880
The thermocline tips so we don't
get so much of the upwelling

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.070
over the eastern side
of the Pacific.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.440
And the deep convection
in the atmosphere moves

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.840
over to the central Pacific
and also a little bit more

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:58.410
over to the South American
part of the atmosphere.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.650
And as I said earlier, the La
Nina case, which is the opposite

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.710
of El Nino, is basically an
intensification of this state.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.360
And typically the thermocline may
even meet the surface just off

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.660
the coast.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.540
So it's just an intensification
of how cold it is over that side

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.510
of the Pacific and a little
bit warmer over the other side.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:22.440
And I've tried to give a citation
to most of the figures I do use

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.960
from the web, although this is --
I think that's the original site.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.930
These images float
around all over the place,

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.690
so it's hard to know
who did that one first.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:39.800 position:56%
So just looking at this, the Pacific
then essentially, in normal years

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.990
in the central Pacific
region we've got sort

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.800
of moderately warm temperatures.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.390
In El Nino years it
gets much warmer.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:54.950 position:56%
And this is then used as a metric of
how strong the El Nino events are.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.890
These four regions, Ninos
one, two, three and four --

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:03.150
the red shaded regions --

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:08.120
early locations used to define the
strength of the El Nino events.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.160
And the reason they're called one,
two, three and four I think is

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.950
because these are places
where the ships used to sail.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.860
And so they actually made
measurements using --

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.700
you know, they threw a bucket
over the side, pulled the water up

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.440
and put a thermometer
in it, basically.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.200
And they get measurements of
the ocean surface temperature.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:28.620
And that's still done
today by research vessels.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.710
And so these were four
regions where ships sailed.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.250
And it's obviously due to
trades between the ports

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:41.630
of South America here and the
Asian ports on these lengths.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.940
What we typically use these days

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.280
to define the El Nino is
this region we call Nino 3.4,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.200
which has got a little bit of
4 and a little bit of three.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.410
And I think people
converge on that just

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.570
because it really shows a
decent signal that we can relate

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.910
to what we regard as Enzo.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:05.780
And then if we look at the time
series of the Nino 3.4 region,

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:10.290
this is essentially showing us
how things change over the years.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.800
This one begins in 1950, and it
goes up to actually the present,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.750
to about February of 2016.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.920
This is again compiled by NOA.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.910
There's this one of the
labs in College Park.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:26.510
And essentially you can
see these very cold years.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.160
Basically if it gets half a
degree cooler than normal,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.910 position:56%
it then turns into La Nina, at least
if it persists for three months.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.440
And if it gets half a degree
warmer than normal and persists

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.380
for three months, then
it's regarded as El Nino.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:45.150 position:56%
And of great interest are these
three big El Nino events in 1982-83,

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:48.170
'97-98 and then this present year.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.580
You can see that at least over the
last 50 years these three events

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.270
stand out.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.870
And this one was quite
widely studied

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.480
and it's a very interesting
one in many ways,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.040
because it actually coincides

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.940
with a major volcanic
eruption as well, El Chichon.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.760
So it's actually hard to use

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.040
that to decide what the
climate anomalies are,

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.340
especially with El Nino,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.090
because there are also big
climate anomalies associated

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.800
with all the volcanic
sulfates and all

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.190 position:56%
that buzzing to the high atmosphere.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.320
So that one is less useful,
at least less useful in terms

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.500
of defining climate anomalies.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.770
But as we get through to 1997-98,
we're getting to the point

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.920
where we have a fairly clean
atmosphere so we can look

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.220
at the climate anomalies.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.090
And the other great thing
is this is around the time

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.970
when NASA did start having some
research satellites available.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.550
And in particular the TRIM mission

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.650 position:56%
that measured global
precipitation had just been launched

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.950
when this started.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.510
And we also had some measurements
of the color of the ocean,

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.270
which tells us about
how many phyto pints are

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.920
in it and things like that.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.270
So this starts to get
interesting for NASA.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.430
And then of course the
present one is as strong

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.250
as by this measure that one.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.090
In some measures it's
a little stronger.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.560
In other measures it's
not quite so strong.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.090
So this again is giving us an
opportunity to look at El Nino

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.760
with a very modern fleet

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.670
of satellite instruments alongside
everything else that we have.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.690
And I think just basically
the forecasts

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.480
of this extremely strong
El Nino that started coming

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.300
out towards the middle of
last year were really alarming

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.580
because people remembered what
happened with the 1997-98 one.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.520
You know, that was a big,
global scale climate response.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.990
It starts with that
warm water by Peru.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.500
Really leads to a lot of
anomalous rainfall in Peru.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.530
A lot of rainfall in a
mountainous terrain like that leads

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.470
to a catastrophic landslide.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:47.610
So a lot of environmental damage
by the flooding and landslides.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.300
So there was a lot of concern about
that happening this year as well.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.920
And I was going to show a bit
more about that, but I didn't.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.950
And so I'll say now that actually,

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.920
even though there was some
strong rainfall in Peru,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.190
it didn't turn out
to be quite as bad.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.410
Because if we look at these
anomalies, El Nino one

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.850
and El Nino two are
basically telling us

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.600 position:56%
about the temperatures just by Peru.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.710
They were not quite so strong
this year as they were in 1997-98.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.730
So essentially there's been
a tendency for the El Ninos

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:22.620
to be peaking in more of the
central pacific rather than right

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.950
on the eastern Pacific
in recent years.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:30.540 position:56%
Even though this one is really big
and bigger in some ways than '97-98,

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.020
its horizontal extent
wasn't quite as large.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.670
So it didn't have such a
big signature down here.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.660
That means that any weather
systems that are moving

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.070
into Peru just don't
get quiet as much energy

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.280
from the oceans beneath them as
they go in a little less water

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.580
because it's not quite so warm.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.000
And so the rain has
probably not been quite

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.750
as bad as it was in '97-98.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.550
That's not to say there hasn't
been any severe storms in Peru,

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.500
but it probably wasn't as
bad as they were dreading

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.360
in the beginning of this.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.930
So with that, I've tried
to give sort of an overview

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.540
of the basic characteristics of
El Nino and what it looks like.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.270
I want to just briefly
go through a little bit

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.950
about the historical
role of El Nino.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.790
And it seemed good to start
with an old map of Peru.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:20.060
So that's the Peruvian coast, and
you can see that north is pointing

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.380
that way, so orientate yourself.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.950
And this is actually -- this map
was actually drawn up by Mercator

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.250
and one of his colleagues.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.720
And there's actually a Mercator
map projection that's you know,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.300
very widely used to this day.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.050
It's essentially a regular
latitude/longitude grid.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.990
And you know, you really --

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.130
I just always found it
impressive these people would be

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.580
out on ships and making
measurements.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.070
And they'd get some fairly
accurate maps of the coast.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.120
They even put ships out in
the sea and things like that.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.860
You know, sometimes
you find monsters.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.490
I don't know about these ones.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:55.790
So this is a nice one.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.860
And you can see on this too
they've really made effort

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.870
to show the very tall
mountains, the Andes,

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.250
very close to the coast in Peru.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.870
Which rise very dramatically
up there.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.850
So that's an old map.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:17.020
And this is a map of basically the
ocean circulation of South America.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.090
Again, a pretty old map.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.110
This is the coast of South America.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:26.150 position:56%
And essentially the Humboldt current
runs up the coast in the ocean.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:31.840
And as we get close to the
equator, that starts to be pushed

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.550
by the winds going
off the continent.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.550
Also by the earth's rotation, kind
of encourages that to flip away.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.390
So as we get to Peru and Ecuador,

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.580
that current is moving
away from the coast.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.820
And that's essentially dragging
this water up from below.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.810
So that deep water from the
deep cold ocean is going

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:54.470 position:56%
to get drawn up from the deep ocean.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:59.090
And that comes up just around here.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:07.180
And as the settlers in the 17th
century and way back started moving

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.500
into Peru, they basically started
discovering that there was a lot

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.920
of fishing, especially
anchovies off the coast.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.150
And essentially what's happening
there is this cooler water that's

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.430
upwelling from the ocean floor is
bring up iron and other nutrients.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.970
And that encourages the growth
of phytoplankton in that water.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.650
It's got plenty of
light to grow as well,

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.920 position:56%
so it's really the ideal conditions.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.290
And these anchovy fisheries
are essentially still one

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.980
of the biggest fish sources
for the entire world.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:39.690
But what actually happened is
that the old fisherman noticed

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.490
that every few years
the fish would go away.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.940
And this is basically
the ocean warms.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.240
This is the El Nino coming in.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.540
The ocean warms.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.570
That upwelling of the deep cold
waters to the surface is cut off.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:57.470
The phytoplankton, you know,
they're upwelling somewhere else.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.920
So the fish go away
and feed elsewhere.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.110
So essentially there's a
dramatic decline in the fisheries

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.170
in those years when
there's an El Nino.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.770
And the name El Nino
actually comes --

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.310
it was given to it by the Spanish
settlers in Peru and Ecuador.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.480
Essentially this was happening
around the end of the year,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.980
around Christmastime and they used

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.480
to call this the boy
child, or El Nino.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.990
And that's where the
name comes from.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:26.170
And then La Nina, I think the
name came some years later

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.510
because it wasn't so dramatic.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.420
You know, you still got
the fish in the La Nina.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.290
So for those people
it wasn't so critical.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:40.800
And so that's loosely
how things are working

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.990
around the coast of South America.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.360
And just flipping onto a very
modern view, this is a NASA view.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.570
This is actually from the CWB
Satellite which was observing

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:54.930
around 1997 and 1998 after
it was first launched.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.400
So CWB measures the color
of the ocean essentially

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.710
at different wavelengths.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.830
And the color of the ocean, if it's
very green, means there's a lot

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.430
of phytoplankton in there.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.830
If it's very blue, it means it's
very clean so there's no life.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.440
So you can infer from
this the amount

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.130
of phytoplankton in the ocean.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:14.440
And you can then infer where the
fish may be and things like that.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.890
But these plots are essentially
showing that in December of 1997,

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.910
an El Nino year, we have to look
at the scale and be careful here.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.510
This is a logarithmic scale here.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:28.880
So this dark blue has 10 times less
chlorophyll than this pale blue.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.860
And by the time you get to
white, that's 100 times less.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.570
So between there and there,

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.970
there's about 100 times
less chlorophyll here

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:39.870
than there is there, basically.

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.890
And this is the El Nino year.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.500 position:56%
You're seeing not particularly much,

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.550
but compare that to
December 1998, a year later.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.640
So '97 was the first year
of measurement from CWB.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.430
'98 you're seeing a
very white region.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:59.670
So you're in the few
milligrams per cubic meter

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.030
of chlorophyll in those regions.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.440
So we're essentially able

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.420
to show using space-based
measurements the thing

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.750
that the Peruvian fishermen
knew all those years ago,

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.450
that the phytoplankton had
gone away in the El Nino event.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.610
And there they are in
the La Nina in this case.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.470
So you can actually
see this from space.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.560
And we've now got a
really long time series.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.860
About 20 years of measurements
of ocean color.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.020
And there's a new mission
that just got funded to take

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.540
that way into the future.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.710
So you know, we're able to do
sort of climatological studies now

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:36.860
of ocean color and infer
phytoplankton changes over time.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.540
We have models that run
and do sort of diatom

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.660
and multi-bodied phytoplankton
that kind of change over time.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.210
And that's one of the great
things that we actually do

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.920
with our satellite observations.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.620
So going back to history,

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.000
and we come to Sir Gilbert
Walker who is also English.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.750 position:56%
He was a mathematician and physicist
and essentially he was posted

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:07.230
to India as the director of the
meteorological observatories there.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:13.960
And he just heard about,
you know, there had been --

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.260 position:56%
I'm sorry, I'm not saying this well.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.900
In the late 19th century there
had been famines in India

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.980
because the monsoons had collapsed.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.610
And Walker knew about other things.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:24.910 position:56%
He knew about pressure measurements,

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.620
surface pressure measurements
over the Pacific Ocean.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:32.350
And he basically had an army
of staff in India working

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.010 position:56%
on time series analysis essentially.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.590
And what we now do very routinely

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.140
on the computer he had
people doing for him.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.480
And he was able to establish
sort of relationships

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.930
between different variables
that were being measured

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.080
in the atmosphere in that time.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.890
And it turns out that the
circulation with the ascent

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.450
over Indonesia and then the
transport across the atmosphere

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.240
and descent near South America,

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.710
that's now called the Walker
circulation, named after him.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.240
And he's basically the person
that put this all together.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.600
And what he actually defined
was what's called the southern

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.310
oscillation, which was a
seesaw in surface pressure,

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.030
the surface pressure
difference between Tahiti

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.240
in the min-Pacific and
Darwin in Australia.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.880
So he was able to deduce that
those things moved out of phase.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.510
And this was the change
of mass of the atmosphere.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.560
He didn't realize at that
point that that was El Nino.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.660
It was Burke I guess in the 1950's
or '60's who put that all together

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.160
and realized that essentially
the southern oscillation

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.650 position:56%
in the atmospheric surface pressures
is essentially the same signal

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:41.220
as the El Nino event in
the tropical Pacific ocean.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.630
You know, but coming
up with these things

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.380
with just a few point measurements
of meteorological conditions

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:53.400
of the colonial sort of stations
that they had set up over time.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.220
So this is a much more modern map.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.190
It was in the 2007 IPCC report.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:05.130
And it's showing essentially this
Darwin sudden oscillation index,

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.930
the Tahiti Darwin surface
pressure change.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.490
And in this case actually we
have to be a little bit careful.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.240
A positive value is
actually La Nina.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.670
A negative value is an El Nino.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.550
They're anti-correlated
between them,

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.370
the Pacific surface temperature.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:26.210
But essentially what it's
saying is that when we have a --

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:33.210 position:56%
so a negative anomaly in this
pressure difference is corresponding

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:41.180
with -- this will be a positive
anomaly in the surface temperature.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.270
So the El Nino has
warmer temperatures

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:48.590
over the eastern Pacific than
has that particular signal

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.300
in the surface pressure difference.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.400
So you can see a signal
here in the surface.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.440
That temperature in
the surface pressure.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.080
This is essentially
the Walker circulation.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.090
When it's going up there,
the pressure is lower.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.850
Down here the pressure is
higher and that seesaws.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.450
And the precipitation,
essentially the clouds are moving

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.220
over the mid-Pacific
in the El Nino event.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.400
So in the El Nino the
precipitation is increased

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.500
in the mid-Pacific over Indonesia.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.070
So that's the coherent
dynamical framework.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.600
Walker put that together.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.800
You know, we've got a lot more
observations and a lot more time

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.100
to have done that in the meantime,

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.880
but that still holds
in those things.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.990
So that's then showing essentially
what people were able to do

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.100
in historical times with
very few observations.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.250 position:56%
And now let's move a little into the
time when we have NASA observations.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:45.040
And I want to emphasize the view
from space showing the advantages

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.300
that a satellite can have over
these in situ observations.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:55.400
We start with just repeating
the map of where we're looking

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.560
in the El Nino 3.4 region.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.840
And this time, I'm going to show
the historical ship tracks as well.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.340
This is obviously not
NASA observations.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.700
This is ship observations that
were made I think towards the end

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.000
of last century.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.300
And this is averaged
over a long time,

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.730
so there are a lot
of tracks in that.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.900
And unfortunately the
Pacific on this is over here.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.730
But you can see there's
the coast of South America.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:22.480
You can see fairly dense
networks of ships off Peru.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.040
And then crossing the trade winds,

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.090
crossing the Pacific
and coming into Asia.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.450
You can see, you know, there's some
very interesting things about this

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.780
because the ships, if they
wanted to go around here,

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.480
they had to go all the way around
the Cape, so going past Africa.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.950
So if we look then at a more modern
ship map, we can see the Panama

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.800
and Suez Canals have opened up

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.730
and that has totally
changed where the ships go.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.570
You know, the distances are
much shorter going through.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:56.210
So really very few ships now
are going through these regions.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.160
But many more are passing through
the channels, through the Red Sea,

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.520
through the Mediterranean and
then through the Panama Canal.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.380
But still, the point being
for both the historical time

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.770
and the present time, yes, you
do get quite a lot of information

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.330
from ships, but it's
very, very selective

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.750
where you actually
have that information.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:19.190 position:56%
It's analogous really to the weather
observations that we have, you know,

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.560
for the weather forecasts.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.170
Essentially we have a lot of
balloon observations over land,

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:28.230
so North America, Europe, Asia
is all dense in observations.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.480
But really very, very few
of those over the oceans

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.620
because there is no one
there to observe things,

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.170
and similarly in unpopulated
land regions,

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.470
don't have many observations
there either.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.110
So essentially, knowledge
of surface temperature

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:44.970
from ships is essentially only
coming from where the ships sail.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.110
So what NASA does is
basically provide a lot

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.930
of different types of observations.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.430
I'm actually going
to skip this slide,

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.890
and I'm going to show
this one, maybe.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.640
And this is basically
showing NASA has

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.970
about 20 satellites
in orbit right now.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:09.690
Most of them polar orbiting,

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.980
which means that they essentially
just go round and round and round

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.650
in a circle and the earth
spins underneath them.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.480
And because the earth turns once
a day, we basically get a map

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.930
of things high-globe from
each satellite over each day

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.100
when it's in a polar orbit.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.470
And this is the fleets.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.860
You can see some of them
chasing each other around.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.220
That's actually called the A-train.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.920
[Laughter] That's the name.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.010
Basically, they're all trying

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.330
to measure essentially the same
air masses, one after the other,

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.940
so we get information about
different properties of it.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.860
What one interesting one, it's
always the same with this movie.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.310
As soon as you want to start
speaking about something,

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:48.610
it disappears around the back.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.040
So there's the Space Station.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.510
There, it's gone again.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:38:00.040
But a very different type of orbit
is the International Space Station.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.340
Here it comes around there.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.210
So that's in a much different
orbit, it's much more inclined,

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:07.520
so it's essentially going around
the earth more frequently.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.140
What that means is you actually,
whereas these polar orbiters,

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.430
you only see one time of
morning and one time of night,

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.940
the Space Station, you basically
go through the whole day,

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.290
and you can see things
at all times of day.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.180
And that can be really
useful information for things

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.180
that vary strongly through
the day, if you're able

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.890
to see them from that orbit.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.960
No, and you know, a
whole bunch of things

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.850
that [inaudible] you
just sort of go by.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:32.810
That's actually a radar, and
it's measuring the roughness

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:36.340
of the ocean's surface so you're
able to get information about waves

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.110
and things like that from that.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.410
Oh, seems to have stopped.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.680
You know, OCO2 down there
is measuring carbon dioxide

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.980
in the atmosphere.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.970
SNAP, which seems to have gotten
distorted as well as stopped,

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.960
is measuring soil moisture
from space.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.470
That's a fairly new
mission, you know.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.900
And actually, we had one
called Aquarius up there.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.510
That failed, unfortunately,
last August.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.510
We're hoping we're going to be able
to use some measurements from SNAP

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.600
to replace Aquarius
and get information

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.140 position:56%
about the surface salinity of the
oceans, the saltiness of the oceans.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.980
And that's also a really
important part of the like,

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.360
the circulation budget, essentially
you've got cold, fresh water coming

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.470
as ice melts in high latitudes.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.770
And also, you know,
colder water comes up.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.570
I'm sorry, and then where
it rains onto the oceans,

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.510
that's diluting salt, so
it's fresher there as well.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:27.550 position:56%
So with things like that, we're able
to put together a big picture of,

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.270
you know, how precipitation's
happening

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.780
and how it's affecting the ocean.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.900
How if ice is melting
in the polar regions,

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.620
that's affecting the
salinity of the oceans.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:39.060
And that's sort of what drags the
large-scale ocean's circulations

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.360
that we have.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:45.360
I wanted to talk a little bit
about the sea surface height.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.920
I alluded to that earlier.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.340
As I said, you basically can't
measure temperature below the

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.640
ocean's surface from space.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.790
So, but what you can
do is kind of infer

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.490
that if it's warm, it's
going to be higher.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.120
So essentially, this
series of satellites,

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.400
they're actually international
partnerships with Europe,

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.290 position:56%
and they're led by the jet
propulsion laboratory in California.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:10.190
We've just launched Jason-3,

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.760
which is the third one
in the series of Jasons.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.290
Jason-2 was launched in
2008, Jason-1 in 2001.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:19.800
And before that, we had
TOPEX/Poseidon which was launched

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.560
in 1992 and lasted through 2006.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.950
So we've got a long time series now
of about 20 years of information

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.810
about the height of the oceans.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:33.850
And this is a, you know, as I said,
sort of an integrated quantity

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:37.130 position:56%
of the vertical temperature profile.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:42.170
And this is an example
of, again, an anomaly map

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.360
for February 22nd of this year.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.120
So really quite recent.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.910
And it's showing us essentially the
same thing that we've been looking

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.210
at with the temperatures.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:52.430
Where it's warm, we've
got a high anomaly

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:53.880
in the oceans' surface, you know.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.340
So it's warm, it's
thicker, it's raised up.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.740
And here over the Eastern
Pacific, it's lower than normal.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:03.560
So that's the signature of the
El Nino in the ocean height.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.440
Now how we measure that is
actually very interesting.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.220
Essentially you, you -- you would,

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:13.050
the altitude of the spacecraft
is measured very accurately

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:16.770
in reference to a certain geoid,
it's called, a reference level.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.050
And then by beaming a radar down,
it knows how much signal is sent.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.450
It times the time for it to come
back, the signal to come back.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.810
And then it can calculate the
path between the spacecraft

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.110
and the height of the ocean.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.060
So with those two pieces of
information about the height

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.420
of the satellite above this
reference level, and the distance

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.750
from the satellite to
the ocean's surface,

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:36.450
which you can measure
very precisely,

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.810
it can actually measure the height
of the ocean's surface to within --

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:41.060
I think it's about
three centimeters.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.860
From an orbit about -- I
think it's about 300 --

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.710
no, 850 kilometers above
the earth, 500 miles up.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.130
So, you know, that's the type of
information we can get from space

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.480
that we cannot get from down here.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.710
You can't actually measure
the height from down here.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:04.920 position:56%
You'd be on a ship, and you don't
know how high you are to start with.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.760
Yeah, so. And another type of
observation that we can make.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.110
This is actually rainfall,
and again,

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:16.290
it's comparing the rainfall
measurements on the left

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.120
for 2014, on the right for 2015.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.420
And it's two different months.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.970
I think it's September and October.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:25.440
September at the top,
October at the bottom.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.360
And if you look at this carefully,

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:35.260
you can see the differences
with the El Nino states.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.690 position:56%
And when you look at it from here,
you can't see any difference at all.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.160
And so maybe we'll just
skip over that one.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.050
There is definitely a signal of --

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.140
it's actually difficult to
get the reference there.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.970
I should stand near
the microphone, sorry.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.140
It's essentially, I
think that's the equator,

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.610
and this is closer to
the equator than -- .

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.910
I'm sorry.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:00.520
This is side in 2015, are closer
to the equator than these ones.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.280
And you can see actually,
yeah, it is more red

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.660
over the mid-Pacific
than it is here.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:09.090
So, you know, there's -- if you
know what you're looking for,

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:13.570
you can actually see the signal
of El Nino in those observations.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:17.740
And those really are just two of
the different types of observations

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.150
that we have from NASA that
help us put together sort

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.190
of a quantitative picture
of what's really happening

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.490
in the El Nino event.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.930
Now the ocean height,
that goes along

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:27.230
with the sea surface temperature

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.050
that we actually get
from NOA largely.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:33.070
And this again, the Global
Precipitation Mission,

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.290
the TRMM was a predecessor of
the Global Precipitation mission.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.250
If you remember, that's
the one that crashed

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.800
into the Indian Ocean
about a year ago.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.900
It ran out of fuel, and
then it just basically --

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.870
they descend back through
the atmosphere then.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.820
But now there's the Global
Precipitation Mission

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.090
which should give us information
about rainfall and clouds

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.390
for the next few years as well.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.920
So I wanted to give a brief look
at our computer-based analysis

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.830
and prediction, and I
see I'm actually running

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.640
out of time a little bit,
so I have to be careful.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.750
But essentially, I already
mentioned we're taking a lot

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:14.350
of these observations that are
made from earth and also combining

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.020
that with observations from space,

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.620
and using advanced analysis
techniques to come up with analyses

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.930
of three-dimensional
structure of the oceans,

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:23.510
as well as the atmosphere.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.140
And once we have a good estimate
of the ocean's state on any day,

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.030
we can actually start to
predict what it's going

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.570
to look like in the future.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:32.170 position:56%
So every month we 'rerunning a suite

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.320
of forecasts that's
called an ensemble.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.940
I think right now we run
17 numbers each month.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.430
Some of them start
on different days,

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.970
and some of them we tweak the
actual state because, you know,

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:43.270
there is some uncertainty in it.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:46.570
So we try to build up
some suite of ensembles

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:48.840
and then we can make a forecast.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.300
And these are then the forecasts
that we ran last August.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.230 position:56%
We'd already in about May, we'd been
starting to see a signal of a very,

00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:01.570
very strong positive temperature
anomaly in this Nino 3.4 region.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:05.350
And this is the ensemble.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.680
Often, when you run an
ensemble, this is the zero line

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.980
that you'll get if
you're going up there,

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.840
and if you're going down there.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.150
And, you know, the average of
them all is roughly what you put

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:17.230
out as the best guess of
where we're going to go.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.800
In this case, we'd already
seen the observations

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.860
of sea surface temperature ramping
up, so we want to start with,

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.720
and we're predicting
then, a very warm anomaly.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.840
That's about, you know, three and
a half degrees on the average,

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.730
but some of them were almost five
degrees, and most of them were

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.150
about two and a half degrees.

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:37.920
So we were predicting fairly
early on a very strong El Nino

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.380
for this year, and we were a bit
worried about it because some

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.470
of the other centers weren't
predicting something that strong.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.610
But actually it turned out as the
year went by, the Australians put

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:48.910
out a press release
saying it's going

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.230
to be the strongest El Nino ever.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.360
And it sent out these
two or three groups

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:57.060
that were forecasting a very strong
event, and were actually right.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:02.820
And this is what's called the
National Multi-Model Ensemble.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.020
This is a project organized by NOA,
and they gather this information

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.020
from different centers
that make the forecasts.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.650
And what I just showed
you from out groups is all

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:13.300
of the different ensemble members.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.930 position:56%
You can then make an average for
each group, and this is the averages

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:18.810
for each of a number of groups.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.780
We're on this with the yellow one.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.210
We are the strongest number;

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:26.090
one of the Canadian
models is a little weaker.

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:27.850
And the average is here.

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:30.200
Most of the models were
clustered just a little bit colder

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.920
than the average of all
of them, and that's just

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.480
because you have two
fairly high ones above it.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.210
So you know, there was a
good consensus this year

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:41.420
that there was going to be a very
strong El Nino, and you know,

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.930 position:56%
in the mid-Pacific, it really looked

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.100
like it was going to
be the strongest one.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:50.600
This is a, this is a history map
showing our forecasts that began

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.530
in August of each year,

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:57.940
so essentially you're seeing this
El Ninos and La Nina's going along.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.010
This was, the blue line
here is the observations,

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.280
those Reynolds Sea Surface
Temperature observations,

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.050
and here -- so here you are
in January and February.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.350
It's very warm.

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:07.650
And here is our forecast.

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:09.620
So we'd greatly overestimated
that forecast

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:14.340
in that previous event
in '97 and '98.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.780
But generally, you know, we
do a reasonably good job,

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.820
and we were a bit concerned
about this one being so strong

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.910
because on the basis of this one,
we were thinking, "Well, okay,

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:24.090
we're saying it's strong, but
it's going to be down here."

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.020
But actually, and unfortunately,

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.530
I couldn't find the
plot that shows it.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.370
But we actually did
a pretty good job.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:32.740
This was one of the strongest El
Ninos ever in the mid-Pacific.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.540
So these forecasts of
sea surface temperatures

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.460 position:56%
in that region were pretty accurate.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.430
And so what's going to happen now?

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:43.730
We've gone through this time.

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.840
We've predicted a big El Nino,
now here are the forecasts

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.530
that begin in January of 2016.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.750
Here you can see we're in the pink
now so we're up there somewhere,

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.780
the two and a half, three degrees.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.790
And as time goes by, we're
predicting that to fall away

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.480
and just get loosely negative.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.850
So essentially, the
El Nino's dying out.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:04.160
Some of the groups are now
predicting a, you know,

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.460
a reasonably strong La Nina event
is going to happen later this year.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.750
On the basis of this
we couldn't really say

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:12.120
that our ensemble is doing that.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.800
But you know, that's
still a possibility.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.640
There's often a precedent that when
you have a strong El Nino event one

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.720
year, the following year you
get a reasonably strong La Nina

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.020
event afterwards.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:26.090
So this is like an
over-recovery of the thing.

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:31.220
So that's one of the uses of the
analyses, making these forecasts.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.100
What I'd like to show now is
a movie, and this is going

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.480
to show us the sea
surface temperatures.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.610
And throughout 2015, and this is
the view from the top, essentially,

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.000
so this is from our analyses,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.070
and it's showing essentially
how the warmth has built up

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:47.920
and propagated across the ocean.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.290
This is made from daily
or subjects-daily data,

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.050
so you can see a lot of movement.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:53.660
And that's starting again.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.550
And now what's going to happen,
it's going to tilt on its side

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:59.290
in a moment, and you
can start seeing this

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.390 position:56%
as a function of depth in the ocean.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.440
So there you go, so now you're
not just seeing the surface,

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.610
but you're seeing the situation
under the ocean's surface.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.980
And that's starting again
now in January 2015,

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.860 position:56%
and you can see how the anomalies
are building up in the lower layers,

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:16.350
then really moving over
to the ocean's surface

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:18.090
as the event matures.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.390
So it's November.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.220
It's now a very mature El Nino
event in January and February.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.520
And stops there.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.930 position:56%
It's already dying off a little bit.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:25.910
Yeah, you see, you
can put it to January.

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:30.730
So you know, we've peaked
here, and that's dying out now.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.750
But this is, you know, that's
basically a summary diagram

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.950
of what happened this year based
on our best estimates using

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:40.020
as many observations
as we could use.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:43.850
Now, I was -- I would just
talk about the drought

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:46.300
in California at this point.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.600
The view from space.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:53.550
So essentially, this is a NASA
view of the drought in California.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:57.580
It's essentially looking at the
vegetation derived by MODIS,

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.460
which is an instrument on
the EOS Aqua satellite.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.150
And essentially, anything
brown means

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:05.290
that there's way less vegetation
there than there should be.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:09.420
And so compare this with
maps of high temperatures.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.840
This essentially means, you
know, it's been hot, dry.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.680
The plants haven't survived.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.800
So we're on strong anomaly
there down, you know,

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.990
through much of the West Coast,

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.870
in the mountains close
to the coast as well.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:31.130 position:56%
So when we heard about this big El
Nino coming, there's been precedents

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:34.170
in the past to say okay, a
large El Nino means a lot

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:36.350
of rainfall in California.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.160
And so has there been
rainfall in California?

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.460
Well, here's another view.

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.000
This is NASA's GPN satellite.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.420
This is essentially going to build
up showing you accumulated rainfall

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.810
over each month for
November, December.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.110
No, sorry.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:51.410
December, January, and February.

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:54.130
And yes, you can see we got
quite a lot of precipitation

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:59.210
on the northern part of the West
Coast, but really not a huge lot

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:03.420
over the Sierra Nevada
in Southern California.

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.620
We got plenty on the Gulf
Coast, you know, some storms.

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:11.140
And you're going to see one event
that we got, the snowfall event,

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:16.160
and you know, which was a
typical East Coast storm.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.740
So on the basis of this, at
least until mid-February,

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.580
there have not been a huge
lot of rain in California.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:30.270
And this is a map again from
NOA sort of summarizing.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:34.650
It's the average precipitation
between December,

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.610
over December, January,
and February.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:40.330
And typically in a strong El Nino
year, it's a little cooler up here,

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:43.650
warmer down here, and
blue here means wetter.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.780
So a lot more rain
on the West Coast,

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.200
and typically across
the Gulf Coast, too.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.500
It's kind of well-known the Gulf

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.790
of Mexico gets pretty wet
in the El Nino events.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:57.980
And also people thought
this year, 2015-2016,

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.970
not so much rain over in the Gulf.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:02.690
Not enough, particularly wet.

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:06.090
Also not a whole lot
of rain in California.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.300
There's been a lot of rain
in the Pacific Northwest,

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.340
but not so much in California.

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:16.960
So really we haven't had this
massive deluge throughout the

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.260
entire winter.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.140
I think though since this
map was made, there has --

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.250
there was actually some fairly
severe rainfall just a couple

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.850
of weeks ago, so that
didn't make this map.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:30.840
But in general, this idea that
a strong El Nino means a lot

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.140
of rain throughout the winter

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.300
in California is not
holding up this year.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.690
Now, there's a couple
possible reasons for that.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:40.620
One of them might be that warm blob
off the coast that's keeping things

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.060
warm out there and directing the
storm tracks slightly differently

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.360
than normal.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.960
But more generally, I think
our knowledge of El Ninos

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.100
and their impacts on North
American rainfall is actually based

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.560
on very few events.

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.120
It may just be that every
single one of them, you know,

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.790
just like the events themselves,
each one is very different.

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.580
Maybe the response in the higher
latitudes is also affected

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.010
by other factors.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.540
Just the positions of
the waves that affect

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.120 position:56%
where the storm tracks go, and that.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.810
So I think it's not
such a clear-cut thing

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:16.710
that strong El Nino automatically
means rain in California.

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:19.540
And we've known for a long time
that moderately sized El Nino,

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.730
there's really no correlation
between California,

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:24.510
Northern California and
rainfall and the El Nino pattern.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:27.850
So, you know, we're probably
in the situation where we have

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:31.460
so few large events that we
don't know statistically what

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.990
really happens.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:37.420
So the summary and outlook:
I'm trying to keep this short.

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.280
We do have a broad
understanding of El Nino

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.280
and its importance in
climate variability.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.730
I've tried to give you a few
examples today of, you know,

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:48.750
about the structure of El Nino
itself, and the long-term effects.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.500
To do that thoroughly, you
could have a lecture every week

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:55.020
for three months, and you know,
I think that would be too much.

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:59.990
So you know, I can encourage people
to just to go away and take a look.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:04.580
And the traditional viewpoint
of the measurements from ships

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:08.220
and from the ground is supplemented
by NASA satellite observations.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.910
And essentially with that, we're
able to get global observations

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:12.920
of many different quantities

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:17.490
that we can put today using our
complex data simulation systems.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:19.460
And in that way, we can
build more complete pictures

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.810
of the entire earth system

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:23.350
and how different processes
start interacting.

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:26.390
And that's one of the
more, you know, for me,

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:28.940
that's the really interesting
part about this right now.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.560
We've got essentially
an unprecedented number

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.210
of satellites flying, and we're
able to see so many different parts

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.720
of the earth's system now
than we could a few years ago.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.060
But, you know, this is
a very exciting time

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.430
to be working in this science.

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:45.230
You know, barely touched on the
broad spectrum of NASA observations

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:48.760
of the earth's system, but I
hope I've given you some flavor

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.890
of what we have.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:55.410
And even despite all this, I think
there are a number of points where,

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.520
you know, our understanding
isn't all there.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.820
And so what we're really trying

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.820
to do is bring together
these satellite observations

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.500
with the models so that we
can improve the representation

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.180
of processes and improve the
fidelity of these predictions,

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:12.400 position:56%
not only of the nine months seasonal
forecasts, but all the IPCC models

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.960
that do climates assessments.

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.460
Some of those have, you know,

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.740
reasonably good El
Nino representation.

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.240
Some of them, it's too weak,
or some it's too strong.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.260
Some of them, it hits the
wrong, periodicities and things.

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:27.960
And that got better between the
2007 and 2013 climate reports,

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.790
but they're still not there.

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:33.570
So there's really a great hope
that we can use our observations

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.690
to improve these models and come up
with a better prediction of climate

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:39.460
and the role of El Nino in climate.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.000
And also even the role of El Nino

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.440
in a changing climate
isn't well understood.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.270
You know, we know surface
temperatures are warming.

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:51.220
We've had this general temperature
increase, even basic things now,

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:54.230
like if we're looking at a 40-year
time series, we can't assume

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:57.340
that the average El Nino is
not affected by climate change.

00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:00.130
We need to stop thinking that
the average should be something

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:03.220
that increases slowly with
time, and then we might come

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.850
up with slightly different
conclusions

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:08.710
of how these things happen.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:11.510
You know, so I think those
are some of the things

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:14.210
that I'm hoping we can use
NASA satellite observations

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:15.510
to address in the future.

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:19.310
I just want to thank everyone
here as well as my colleagues,

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:22.200
our funding and computing
center in particular.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.270
We keep them really
busy with our things.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:28.800
And I'll end up with some contact
information if anyone needs it.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.100
So I'd like to thank you very much

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.900
for your attention,
and thanks for coming.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:38.230
[ Applause ]

00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:39.910
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: You probably
have had all your questions

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.360
answered, but if there are a
few more, we can take them.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.160
And when you ask a question,
if you would repeat it

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.530
so everybody [inaudible]
on the recording.

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:51.360
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: On
the recording, yes.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:55.630
&gt;&gt; Steve, what's your
general thinking

00:56:55.630 --> 00:57:01.600
about as the climate gets
warmer, ocean water gets warmer.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.900
Is that -- ?

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.400
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: You know, I
mean, El Ninos have been happening

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.630
for as far back as
we've had observations.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:11.020
And people have even gone back
thousands of years and used records

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.350
of sediments on the ocean floor.

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:14.330
They've used tree rings,
they've used many things,

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.490
and you can reconstruct
these climate fluctuations

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:17.830
that are El Nino-like.

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:19.790
So El Nino's been around
for a long time.

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:24.050 position:56%
It's going to persist into the
future, and then the basic mechanism

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:27.730
of El Nino, you know, taking that
warm water from here and moving it

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.460
over here is probably
not going to change.

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:34.400
But the difference could be
either if you're just in general,

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.360
if you're a degree or two warmer,
then the response is nonlinear.

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:43.680
So triggering clouds is not --
isn't, you know, that could change

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.370
because even though you're colder
than normal, you could still be

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:48.140
above the temperature where
you're triggering clouds

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.440
if your climate has changed a lot.

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.560
So, you know, things could
change in their responses.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.300
And I think that's a
very interesting type

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.600
of question to be looking at.

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: You can choose.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: Yeah.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.440
Okay, yeah?

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:13.100
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.710
So the question then
about the accuracy

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:18.100
about the three centimeter
measurement

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.800
of the sea surface height
when waves are much larger.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.160
And yet waves, waves
are a separate thing.

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.390 position:56%
We can try to model waves separately
from the actual mean height

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.840 position:56%
of the ocean that's being looked at.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:33.710
So I think that if there is
some element of time averaging

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:36.440
when a wave moves through,
and you get an average

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.370
of what's there without the wave.

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:40.680 position:56%
So getting that reference, you know,

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.310
that reference height is
very critical to this,

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:45.000
and not measuring the
crest of a wave.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.300
You're absolutely right, yes.

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.760
&gt;&gt; Well does the satellite
have sufficient time resolution

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.710
to be able to do that
average over a wave.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:58.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: Yeah,
usually the satellites,

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:00.570
you can do it in two ways.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.970
First of all, if the
observation window is long enough,

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:04.630
the wave just moves through anyway.

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:06.730
But if you're not having
the wave move through,

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:10.300
then you basically aggregate over
several measurements to get rid

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.210
of the shorter scale signatures.

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:16.120
And that's a very, that's a
very normal way of dealing

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.680
with fast changes in
satellite observations.

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:22.610
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.150
How does the satellite measure
the salinity of the water?

00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:31.320
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: That's
measuring emissions of light

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.860
at particular wavelengths,
and that emission is affected

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:37.010
by how much salt is in the water.

00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:38.310
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:39.610
&gt;&gt; One more?

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:41.860
&gt;&gt; What's the relation
between El Nino

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:47.080
and the salinity of
the ocean, if any?

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.490
&gt;&gt; Steve Pawson: Okay,
so it's fairly complex.

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:53.650
Essentially, the salinity
of the tropical ocean is

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:56.490
in part determined by rainfall.

00:59:56.490 --> 01:00:01.700
So through an El Nino event, the
rain will move because it's raining

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.000
where it's warmest over the ocean.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.510
So essentially your freshwater,
the non-salty water is getting put

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:08.740
into the ocean in different places.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:11.510
So that probably the
most basic aspect

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:16.110
of the salinity that we can see.

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.060
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Well,
it's been very interesting,

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.930
and I think the next party we
can go to, we will be the center

01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.610
of attention with all
of our new knowledge.

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:26.870

well thank you, too.
