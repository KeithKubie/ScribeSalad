00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.990
Round 1,585 to the
nearest ten.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.290
Let me rewrite the number.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.500
1,585 to the nearest ten.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.860
So we want to focus
on the tens place.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:24.240
If we were to round it up, we
would go to 1,500-- let me

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.950
color code it.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.162
We would round up to 1,590.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.590
The 8 would round up to a 9.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.425
And 90, if we were to round
down, we would go to 1,500,

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:41.190
and we would round down to 80.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.560
So these are our two choices.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.370
Now we've seen the last
two examples.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.590
If the place to the right
of it is 5 or

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.790
greater, we round up.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.340
Well, the place to the
right of it is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.010
definitely 5 or greater.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.130
It is 5, so we round up.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.890
So it is 1,590.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.420
And we're done!
