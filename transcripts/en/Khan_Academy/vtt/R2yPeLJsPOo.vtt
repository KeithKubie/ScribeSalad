00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.100
- [Instructor] When you
take an AP Biology exam

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.210
it is likely that will
include a formula sheet

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.270
that will include formulas like this one

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.420
and it can be a little
bit intimidating at first

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.930
because we're not used to
seeing formulas like this

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.530
that involve, in fact this is
formally calculus notation,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.020
in a biology class.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.690
But, what we'll see in this
video is that this formula

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.320
is actually just trying
to express something

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200
that's fairly intuitive and
something that you actually

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.560
don't even need calculus
or even much algebra,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.590
but then we'll connect it to this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.460
to see that it all makes sense.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.750
So, putting this aside,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.110
let me just ask you a simple question.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.280
Let's say we're studying a population

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.280
and we see that the birth rate,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.420
the birth rate

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.500
of this population is equal to 60,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.540
let's say we're studying
a population of bunnies,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.903
60 bunnies,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.430
bunnies per year

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.370
and let's say we know that
the death rate of bunnies,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.910
death rate, is equal to 15 bunnies,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.890
bunnies per year.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.160
Now, without even paying attention

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.870
to this formula sheet up there,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.610
what do you think, given this data,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.200
is the population, population

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.070
growth rate for this
population of bunnies?

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.080
Pause this video and see
if you can answer that.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.710
Well, your population growth rate,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.060
if you think about just
even say a given year,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.130
in that year you'll grow your population

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.030
by 60 bunnies per year.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.260
So, you will grow

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.020
by 60 bunnies

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.020
per year and then you would shrink

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.330
by the 15 that died.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.170
So, it would shrink by 15 bunnies,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.230
bunnies per year

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.590
and so in that year you
would net out 45 bunnies

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.690
and that's a rate 'cause
you're saying per year.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.410
So you would grow by 45 bunnies,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.450
bunnies in that year

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.770
and that would be your
population growth rate.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.960
Now the thing that we
just did very intuitively,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.730
you don't need advanced
math to think through

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.760
what we just did, that's exactly
what this formula's saying.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.470
This notation where
you say d something dt,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.480
this is the rate at which this something

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.350
is changing with respect to time.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.150
So, this is just a fancy way of saying

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.410
what is the rate at which our population

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.400
is changing with respect to time?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.350
There's other ways that you
could have written that.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.960
If you didn't wanna use calculus notation

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.650
you could of written change in population

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.100
for a given change in time.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.160
The Greek letter delta
often denotes change in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.360
and what this formula says
is exactly what we did.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.530
It would be the difference
between the birth rate,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.790
which is the letter b in this formula,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.410
the birth rate, right over here,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.750
and the death rate.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.820
The death rate is the
letter d in this formula.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.090
You have it right over here

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.090
and that's exactly what we did over there.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.800
So, it's all very intuitive.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.680
Now, if I were in charge
of the formula sheet

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.340
I might have expressed it
a little bit different.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.120
Maybe I would have used
notation like this.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.970
Maybe I would have
written in plain English.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.420
I probably would have
used different notations

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.670
for the b and the d to make
it a little bit clearer

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.810
that those were rates,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.420
but as you see from this example,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.930
it's just trying to express
something very straightforward

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.000
and frankly, something
that you probably actually

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.663
don't need a formula sheet for.
