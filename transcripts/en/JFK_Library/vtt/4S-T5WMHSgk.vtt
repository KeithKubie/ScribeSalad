00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:01.590
- She called one night and said she wanted

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.796
to go trick or treating in
Georgetown in Washington D.C.

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:07.308
And she had the whole outfit,

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:10.372
she said, from herself and for me.

00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:11.205
- [Woman Offscreen] That
she'd made herself, right--

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:12.038
- Of course.

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:13.601
Well, I don't think so. (laughs)

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:14.610
- [Woman Offscreen] No, you
don't think she made it herself?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.333
- Because it was a sort
of sheet with a head

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.292
- [Man Offscreen] It was a silk bag.

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:22.236
- [Woman Offscreen] There's a photograph,

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:24.500
you've gotta see this
photograph, in the book.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.620
Yeah, it's like a silk hat.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.708
- Yeah.

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:32.045
And so we went around,
all around Georgetown.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:33.569
(audience laughing)

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:34.461
- [Woman Offscreen] There
were are. There's it.

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:35.373
- [Smith] I had to speak

00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:36.909
because she has a very well known,

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.701
very good voice.
- She did?

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.189
Jackie had a distinctive voice?

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.005
- Very distinct.
(audience laughing)

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.893
And so we had to watch that.

00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:45.726
She couldn't--

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:46.559
- [Woman Offscreen] So you
must've been the one that

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.392
had to say trick or treat.

00:00:47.392 --> 00:00:48.225
- So, I had to say trick or treat.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:49.058
(laughs)

00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:50.479
And, nobody got it.
