even when garnets are grabs him and
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800
even when garnets are grabs him and
brings him back into the warp uh you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
brings him back into the warp uh you
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.330

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
know she's holding it very much like how
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.730

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
like how a mother would and talks to him
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.359
like how a mother would and talks to him
very lovingly too so it's like it's not

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
very lovingly too so it's like it's not
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.940
very lovingly too so it's like it's not
like oh they hate each other now but

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
like oh they hate each other now but
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.969
like oh they hate each other now but
again they're there's definitely that

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979
again they're there's definitely that
 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.719
again they're there's definitely that
there's definitely a little bit of

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
there's definitely a little bit of
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.469
there's definitely a little bit of
rebelling that's going on and a big

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
rebelling that's going on and a big
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.530
rebelling that's going on and a big
thing is that this ball lands uh in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
thing is that this ball lands uh in
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.980
thing is that this ball lands uh in
Stevens uh in their house and it has

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
Stevens uh in their house and it has
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530
Stevens uh in their house and it has
these uh these like four or five arms

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
these uh these like four or five arms
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.319
these uh these like four or five arms
it's a great design and there's a bunch

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
it's a great design and there's a bunch
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.240
it's a great design and there's a bunch
of them and Steven gets thrown in the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
of them and Steven gets thrown in the
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.469
of them and Steven gets thrown in the
warp and a bunch of these things are

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
warp and a bunch of these things are
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.060
warp and a bunch of these things are
going with them it turns out there's a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
going with them it turns out there's a
 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920
going with them it turns out there's a
lot of words happening even though they

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
lot of words happening even though they
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.830
lot of words happening even though they
said nothing will be warping nothing on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
said nothing will be warping nothing on
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260
said nothing will be warping nothing on
earth anyway and they should be the only

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
earth anyway and they should be the only
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.840
earth anyway and they should be the only
ones that you know can see this stuff or

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
ones that you know can see this stuff or
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.230
ones that you know can see this stuff or
or that can warp and eventually they

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
or that can warp and eventually they
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.270
or that can warp and eventually they
follow these things and there's this

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
follow these things and there's this
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.760
follow these things and there's this
character named was a parent dot I think

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
character named was a parent dot I think
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.520
character named was a parent dot I think
uh yeah peridot and a wonderful design

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
uh yeah peridot and a wonderful design
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.080
uh yeah peridot and a wonderful design
my life she has this hand where the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
my life she has this hand where the
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.430
my life she has this hand where the
fingers come off and they form these

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440
fingers come off and they form these
 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.199
fingers come off and they form these
computer screens and could do all sorts

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
computer screens and could do all sorts
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.410
computer screens and could do all sorts
of cool science wonderful design and is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
of cool science wonderful design and is
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.630
of cool science wonderful design and is
pretty much it looks like she was just

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
pretty much it looks like she was just
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.180
pretty much it looks like she was just
checking to see if these she's just

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190
checking to see if these she's just
 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.840
checking to see if these she's just
fixing these warps pretty much and she

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850
fixing these warps pretty much and she
 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.729
fixing these warps pretty much and she
says that has probably been compromised

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739
says that has probably been compromised
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.130
says that has probably been compromised
because I has the sad face sticker from

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
because I has the sad face sticker from
 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.510
because I has the sad face sticker from
before and she takes off and the gems

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
before and she takes off and the gems
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.540
before and she takes off and the gems
destroy this warp thing says she's never

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
destroy this warp thing says she's never
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.309
destroy this warp thing says she's never
coming back she can't come back they say

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
coming back she can't come back they say
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.590
coming back she can't come back they say
we can't do this again and it just stops

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600
we can't do this again and it just stops
 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.280
we can't do this again and it just stops
there um so again interesting hmm like

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
there um so again interesting hmm like
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.570
there um so again interesting hmm like
it was this all mean of watching them

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580
it was this all mean of watching them
 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.449
it was this all mean of watching them
more and more it's I'm not saying they

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459
more and more it's I'm not saying they
 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.560
more and more it's I'm not saying they
are but they're acting more like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570
are but they're acting more like
 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.550
are but they're acting more like
fugitives like they're on the run um cuz

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
fugitives like they're on the run um cuz
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.680
fugitives like they're on the run um cuz
it's because before it's like oh we're

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690
it's because before it's like oh we're
 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.320
it's because before it's like oh we're
the Guardians and we protect earth and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330
the Guardians and we protect earth and
 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.530
the Guardians and we protect earth and
from the bad things in the galaxy but

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540
from the bad things in the galaxy but
 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.090
from the bad things in the galaxy but
everything seems to be me and everything

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
everything seems to be me and everything
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.449
everything seems to be me and everything
seems to be bad and usually in those

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459
seems to be bad and usually in those
 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.820
seems to be bad and usually in those
cases it's not Oh everything is evil and

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830
cases it's not Oh everything is evil and
 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.319
cases it's not Oh everything is evil and
only these three people are good it's

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329
only these three people are good it's
 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.180
only these three people are good it's
usually these three people are bad

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
usually these three people are bad
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.009
usually these three people are bad
everything else is good but they're

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019
everything else is good but they're
 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.930
everything else is good but they're
running away from them so then again we

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940
running away from them so then again we
 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.310
running away from them so then again we
don't know much about these gems we

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
don't know much about these gems we
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.259
don't know much about these gems we
don't know much about this universe so

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269
don't know much about this universe so
 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.030
don't know much about this universe so
I'm kind of wondering that that would be

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
I'm kind of wondering that that would be
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.940
I'm kind of wondering that that would be
a really interesting twist on the whole

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
a really interesting twist on the whole
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.430
a really interesting twist on the whole
thing um or it could be like whatever
