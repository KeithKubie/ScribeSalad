DAN GALPIN: Hello, I'm Dan
Galpin for the Developer Show.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.990
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.640
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.570
The first beta release of
Flutter is now available.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.030
Flutter is Google's
new mobile UI framework

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.880
that helps developers craft
high-quality native interfaces

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.190
for both iOS and Android.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.740
Get started today with a post
linked in the description

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.100
below.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.550
You can now craft your
own bot integrations

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.730
using the Hangouts Chat
developer platform and API.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.100
With feature-rich
intelligent bots,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.280
users can automate tasks,
get critical information,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.070
or do other heavy lifting
with a simple message.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.320
For example code and
a link to the docs,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.140
head on over to the post.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.690
We've been working to ensure
that Android apps don't

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.970
use non-SDK
interfaces, since doing

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.520
so risks crashes for users
and emergency rollouts

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.550
for developers.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.080
In Android N, we restricted the
set of symbols that C and C++

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.220
code could use.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.224
Starting in the next
release of Android,

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.640
we will further
increase stability

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.306
by expanding these
restrictions to cover

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:03.180
the interfaces of the SDK.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.850
Head on over to the post for
some more details in what's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.040
next.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.530
Managed import and export
for Cloud Datastore

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.270
is now generally available.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.310
Cloud Datastore is
our highly scalable,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.800
NoSQL managed database service.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.600
This feature replaces the
previous Cloud Datastore admin

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.500
backup module, and provides
a more fully managed database

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.580
experience.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.860
Links to the docs
are on the post.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.000
The Cloud Billing Catalog API
joins the Google Cloud Billing

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.670
API to help you manage
your billing experience.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.190
With it you can predict
bills, estimate costs,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.530
and reconcile rates when
you're using list Google Cloud

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.910
Platform pricing.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.470
Links to the docs
are on the post.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.440

I'm Dan Galpin for

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.402
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.110
Figure it was better
than the shaggy look

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.778
I had going for the last
time I did Dev Show.

00:01:54.778 --> 00:01:58.320
