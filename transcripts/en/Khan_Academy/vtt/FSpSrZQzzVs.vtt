00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.646
79% minus 79.1
minus 58 and 1/10.

00:00:05.646 --> 00:00:07.270
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.809
and try to compute this
expression on your own.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.350
Well, the thing that
jumps out at you

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.750
is that these are in
different formats.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.764
This is a percentage.

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:17.090
These are different
representations.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.964
There's a percentage.

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:18.770
This is a decimal.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.882
This is a mixed number.

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.090
And so to make sense of it,
it's probably a good idea

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.790
to get them all in
the same format.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.206
And it seems like
we could get all

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:27.450
of these into a decimal
format pretty easily.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.920
So let's go that way.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.510
So 79%, that literally
means 79 per 100.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.099
If you wanted to write it as a
fraction, it would be 79/100.

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.890
But if you wanted to
write it as a decimal,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.450
it's 0.79, which could be 0-- or
we would write it down a 0.79.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.682
Now, 79.1 is already
written as a decimal,

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:50.890
so we'll just write it again.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.850
So minus 79.1.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.140
And then, 58 and 1/10.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.510
Well, 1/10 is the
same thing as 0.1.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.400
So you could view this as 58--
well, and literally as 1/10.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.890
So it's minus 58 and 1/10.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.387
Or, you could view this as 58.1.

00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:09.970
So now they're all
in the same format,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.101
let's actually do
the computation.

00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:13.850
Now, the first thing
that jumps out at you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.474
is you have a fairly
small number here.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:16.690
Small positive number.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.760
It's less than 1.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.510
And you're subtracting fairly
large numbers over here.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.805
So your whole answer is
going to be negative.

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:25.430
And to make sense of
this a little bit,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.805
what I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:28.884
to factor out a negative sign.

00:01:28.884 --> 00:01:30.300
And that'll make
the computation--

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.270
at least in my brain, it's going
to make it a little bit easier.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240
So if we factor out
a negative sign,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.310
this becomes-- so we're
going to factor it out.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.970
Actually, let me
just do it this way.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.980
So if we factor out
a negative sign,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.310
then this will become negative.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.268
This would be positive.

00:01:44.268 --> 00:01:46.230
And this would be positive.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.660
And just to verify this,
imagine distributing

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.900
this negative sign, or
if this was a negative 1.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.170
Negative 1 times
this is positive.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.850
Negative 1 times
this is negative.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.790
Negative 1 times
this is negative.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.150
So these two expressions
are the exact same thing.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.670
And the reason why
I did that is now

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.590
we'll do the more
natural thing of we

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.970
will add these two numbers.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.422
We'll get a positive number,
a larger positive number

00:02:08.422 --> 00:02:10.380
than what we're going to
subtract from it right

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.960
over here.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.501
So we can use our
traditional method.

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:15.110
Although, we can't forget
about this negative out here.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.390
So let's first do that.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.310
Let's add 79.1 plus 58.1.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.220
So 79.1 plus 58.1.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.160
So 0.1 plus a 0.1 is 0.2.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.420
9 plus 8 is 17.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.590
So that's seven 1's and one 10.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.610
So one 10 plus seven 10's
is going to get us to 0.8.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.470
Plus 0.5 gets us to
thirteen 10's, or 130.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.740
So we have 137.2 is this
part right over here.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.082
So 100.

00:02:48.082 --> 00:02:49.040
Let me write this down.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.510
So we have 137.2.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.500
And then from that,
adding a negative 0.79

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.790
is equivalent of
subtracting 0.79.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.010
So let's do that.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.400
Let's subtract
0.79, making a point

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.740
to align our decimal points
so that we're subtracting

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.250
the right place from
the right place.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.240
And now let's do
our subtraction.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.432
So right now we're
subtracting 9 from nothing.

00:03:16.432 --> 00:03:17.890
We could write a
0 right over here,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.260
but we still face an issue
in the hundredths place.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.880
We're also subtracting
a 0.7 from 0.2.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.520
So we're going to have
to regroup a little bit

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.340
in the numerator in
order to subtract.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.110
Or at least, in
order to subtract

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.170
using the most
traditional technique.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.930
So let's take a tenth from the
2, so it's only one tenth now,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.340
and give it to the hundredths.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.190
So one tenth is ten hundredths.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.565
So we could subtract that
ten hundredths minus nine

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.550
hundredths is one hundredth.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.040
Now in the tenths place.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.220
We don't have enough up
here, so let's take 1

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.170
from the one's place.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.360
So that becomes a 6.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.870
1 is ten tenths.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.932
So now we have 11 tenths.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.970
11 minus 7 is 4.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.920
Add our decimal place.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.660
6 minus 0 is 6.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.190
And then we got our
13 just like that.

00:04:10.252 --> 00:04:12.710
So outside the parentheses, I
still have the negative sign.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.220
When I computed all of this
inside the parentheses,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.983
I got 136.41.

00:04:18.983 --> 00:04:21.399
And then we can't forget about
the negative sign out here.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.250
So this whole thing
computes to negative 136.41.
