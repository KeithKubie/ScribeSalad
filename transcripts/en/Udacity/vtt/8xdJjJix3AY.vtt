00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.500
So it looks like this word,
per, means division.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.600
And this quantity, 35 miles per hour,
is what we call a rate.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.235
And in this case this particular
rate is comparing miles to hours.

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:15.497
And we use these rates whenever we
compare two quantities that have

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:18.932
different units, so for
example, miles and hours.

00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:21.640
And this is important enough that
it may be worth writing down.
