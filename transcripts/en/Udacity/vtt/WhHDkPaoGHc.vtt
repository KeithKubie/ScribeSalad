00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
So, this game looks good, and you play it a couple of times, and now, the following scenario happens.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.160
Now, let's say you watch other people play the game first and you notice the following thing:

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.740
In the last 40 throws, no six was thrown.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.190
My question to you is, of course, why could that be.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.250
Could that be due to pure chance?

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.140
Could that be due to something being wrong with the die or maybe even someone is cheating?

00:00:24.140 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check all of those that are correct.
