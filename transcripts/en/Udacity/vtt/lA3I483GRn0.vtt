00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.469
One of the components that the owning component,

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.360
that is, the one that is aggregating things, and let's say in this case it's

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.730
the ViewPort, has pointers of instance variables to the other two. It owns them.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.484
When the scroll, ScrollBar change request that is the direct event first is in,

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:19.240
notified, or announce to the Viewport.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.930
It delegates a responsibility to the other components to handle it. First off,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.280
it has to find out from the ScrolBar what the new position is. The Viewport then

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.020
determines that it needs additional content from the FileManager in order to

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.380
reestablish the invariant. It makes a request to the FileManager for

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.880
the required lines, and then uses its own method to display them.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.750
That is, the viewing window has aggregated the responsibility for

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.790
maintaining this invariant.
