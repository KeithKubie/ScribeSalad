RICK: When Reagan was
a conservative icon

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.890
 Eisenhower was the person
who contained the divas,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.200
and that includes people
like Patton, who didn't

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.390
want to listen to anyone.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.630
RICK: Your hat has
seen better days.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.310
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.980
 I have here a campaign
hat from the 1960

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.160
Democratic Convention, and
a campaign poster from 1960

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.910
from Kennedy's campaign.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.610
This was kind of
the standard poster

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.420
that Kennedy put out in his
presidential bid in 1960.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 He was the first
candidate for president

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.909
ever to really
embrace television.

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.990
Do you remember this campaign?

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.280
 I can remember little
bits about it, son.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.520
I was in the
military at the time.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.920
 Kennedy was a Navy man.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.620
RICK: That's right.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.600
 And that's how
come I voted for him.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.310
RICK: Your hat has
seen better days.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.630
The problem is, is they printed
this on really cheap paper.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.920
It was never meant to last.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.500
So we have this thing
right here literally--

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.990
 Deteriorating in
front of our eyes.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.970
RICK: I mean, the poster
is in pretty good shape.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.140
One little tear, which is pretty
common for election posters

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.780
because people didn't take
care of them back then.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.190
How much do you want for these?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.430
 Well, the poster I'd
like $250 and the hat $600.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.270
 Woo.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.480
 That's a lot of money.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.740
So what do you think, Rick?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.160
 I'm thinking $200 for
the whole kit and caboodle.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.120
 I was thinking $250.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.480
That was what I was
thinking, dammit.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.740
 Could you go up to $400?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.260
 I'll go $250.
That's what I can go.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.610
 All right.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.020
 OK, all right, it's a deal.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.090
 Thank you, sir.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.680
COREY: Earlier a guy
brought in Ronald Reagan's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.540
high school yearbook,
along with a letter

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.350
signed by Ronald Reagan.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.800
It looks right, but
you never really know.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.135
So I called my buddy, Drew,
to come down and take a look.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.370
DREW: Ronald Reagan was
a conservative icon.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.770
Like most presidents,
he's highly forged.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.090
The value of it
is pretty strong.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.870
So you always have to take
a look at all the details

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.170
and make sure it's authentic.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.930
Well, one major thing that we're
always going to be looking for

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.730
is the couple r's
always supposed

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.170
to be larger in the first
name than in the last name.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.390
I need to see that the
d is tilted back a bit,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.580
because that's a style
that he would always do.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.770
Very interesting.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.800
T bars are at the top.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.080
OK.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.600
If we take all the evidence
together in its totality,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.440
this is beautiful.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.460
It's 100% authentic.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.600
 Great.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.610
 So what do you
think it's worth?

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.920
 I would say all together,
the value of both the book

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.031
and the letter, if you framed it
up nice, retail $2,500, $3,000.

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.350
- Really?
- Yeah, how about that?

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.100
- Great.
- It looks like he scored.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.520
All right, so what do
you think, Big Hoss?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.720
 Thinking around $1,800.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.650
 I'm thinking--

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.330
I mean, he said $25 to three
grand, so how about $2,500?

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.770
 I would offer you
that, man, but I'm

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.020
going to have to frame it
and this is all going to have

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.220
to go together in one piece.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.840
And it's going to
have to be in a way

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.994
that I can present it
and sell it to somebody.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.490
 $2,100.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.460
 I'll give you two grand
if it helps you out.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.384
[SLOW GUITAR MUSIC]

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.510
 All right.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.040
COREY: Deal.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.290
RICK: Earlier a guy came in
with a World War II book,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.100
he says is signed by
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.980
Even if the signature is legit,
I have no way to price it.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.690
So I called in my friend,
Rebecca, to help me out.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.340
 "Crusade in
Europe," this is all

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.250
about World War II,
specifically the European front.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.790
Eisenhower was involved in this
from pretty much the beginning.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.190
He was the person who
contained the divas,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.470
and that includes people
like Patton, who didn't

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.430
want to listen to anyone.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.610
Or General Montgomery,
who was the same way

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.600
on the British side.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.660
I have the same book in
the signed limited edition.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.860
RICK: OK.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.150
REBECCA: What we're going to do
is look at the two signatures.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.890
One thing that we
have to worry about

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.980
is that Eisenhower
actually had an autopen.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.310
So there is the possibility
in this time period

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.670
that he could actually have
the autopen sign for him.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.380
The nice thing about
this, though, is you have

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.480
this full inscription here.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.190
And since you've got
a uniformity of ink

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.830
with the inscription
and the signature,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.570
we know it's not autopen.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.310
It's real.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.250
RICK: Sweet.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.240
 Oh, that's great.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.010
Awesome.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.930
RICK: So what's it worth?

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.190
 Without the jacket,
this book is worth $1,500.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.839
If it had a dust
jacket, it needs

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.130
to retain the dust jacket.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.980
If it was an original binding,
it should stay in that binding.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.210
You're losing a huge
part of its value.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.270
 How much you want for it now?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.800
 She said $1,500, I'm
thinking and around $1,000.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.390
That gives you a little room.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.730
 I'm thinking more like $800.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.390
 How about the
difference, $900?

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.920
 We're still talking about
a lot of money for a book.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.580
 But it's an Eisenhower book.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.300
 $850.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.091
 No, I've got to stay with
nine, it's really unique.

00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:49.480
 You know what?
I'll go the nine.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.090
I'll go the nine.
- All right, we got a deal.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.129
- All right.
- Thanks.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.336
 I'll meet you right up front.
