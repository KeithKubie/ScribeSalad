bias so that's basically when you look
 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.170
bias so that's basically when you look
for you have like a pre-existing want to

value evidence that confirms that belief
and dis FAL you evidence the disproves

look for all the signs yo I saw that
 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.610
look for all the signs yo I saw that
they hadn't looked shaky in that way and

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620
they hadn't looked shaky in that way and
 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.010
they hadn't looked shaky in that way and
they seemed a little uncertain look for

they seemed a little uncertain look for

they seemed a little uncertain look for
all the evidence that could suggest that

all the evidence that could suggest that
 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.040
all the evidence that could suggest that
they are bluffing and then not really

ask yourself that you know those vital
 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.580
ask yourself that you know those vital
questions like okay well what evidence

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590
questions like okay well what evidence
 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.780
questions like okay well what evidence
is there that they actually have a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790
is there that they actually have a
 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.109
is there that they actually have a
strong hand and learning that skill is

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119
strong hand and learning that skill is
 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.819
strong hand and learning that skill is
absolutely crucial to be a great poker

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829
absolutely crucial to be a great poker
 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.969
absolutely crucial to be a great poker
player and I think that applies to too

many parts you know so if you're trying

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090
many parts you know so if you're trying
 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.149
many parts you know so if you're trying
to make a big business decision and you

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159
to make a big business decision and you
 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.429
to make a big business decision and you
know should I hire this new person ISM

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439
know should I hire this new person ISM
 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.069

as a manager and you say you know

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079
as a manager and you say you know
 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.480
as a manager and you say you know
they're they're an old family friend and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
they're they're an old family friend and
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.770
they're they're an old family friend and
you really really like them so you

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780
you really really like them so you
 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.050
you really really like them so you
really do want to hire them you'll tend

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060
really do want to hire them you'll tend
 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.109
really do want to hire them you'll tend
to look for all the signs that they

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119
to look for all the signs that they
 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.039
to look for all the signs that they
could be great but dismiss the perhaps

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049
could be great but dismiss the perhaps
 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.800
could be great but dismiss the perhaps
overwhelming signs that or sorry they're

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810
overwhelming signs that or sorry they're
 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.480
overwhelming signs that or sorry they're
very strong signs that they're actually

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490
very strong signs that they're actually
 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.389
very strong signs that they're actually
not the right person for the job

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399
not the right person for the job
 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.399
not the right person for the job
so it's it's very important to just

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409
so it's it's very important to just
 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.219
so it's it's very important to just
remember that your break our brains are

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229
remember that your break our brains are
 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.940
remember that your break our brains are
naturally inclined to to look to confirm

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950
naturally inclined to to look to confirm

what we really want to believe the

what we really want to believe the
 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.200
what we really want to believe the
status quo bias is basically when we say

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210
status quo bias is basically when we say
 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.399
status quo bias is basically when we say
to assert whenever we catch ourselves

saying well it's always been done this
 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.289
saying well it's always been done this
way or it's worked for me like this in

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299
way or it's worked for me like this in
 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.969
way or it's worked for me like this in
the past and this is my way of doing

the past and this is my way of doing
 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.949
the past and this is my way of doing
things that's the status quo bias

things that's the status quo bias

murmuring is it's rather ugly head and

murmuring is it's rather ugly head and
what this means is that where we have a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
what this means is that where we have a
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.170
what this means is that where we have a
tendency to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180
tendency to
 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.130
tendency to
not want to change our methodology

not want to change our methodology
 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.080
not want to change our methodology
perhaps you know change the process with

perhaps you know change the process with
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.619
perhaps you know change the process with
which we do something because it's it's

which we do something because it's it's
perhaps worked sometime in the past or

perhaps worked sometime in the past or
 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.500
perhaps worked sometime in the past or
we like doing it that way and in poker I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510
we like doing it that way and in poker I
 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.170
we like doing it that way and in poker I
remember I used to catch myself falling

into that I had like a style of play

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
into that I had like a style of play
 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.910
into that I had like a style of play
that had worked for me a number of times

that had worked for me a number of times
 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.720
that had worked for me a number of times
and I would over rely on that and and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730
and I would over rely on that and and
 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.569
and I would over rely on that and and
not update my my playing style based

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579
not update my my playing style based
 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.860
not update my my playing style based
upon the table that I was at because

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870
upon the table that I was at because
 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.930
upon the table that I was at because
perhaps I didn't enjoy it as much or I

perhaps I didn't enjoy it as much or I
 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.319
perhaps I didn't enjoy it as much or I
found it more scary for example and and

found it more scary for example and and
 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.869
found it more scary for example and and
the same thing can apply to us in in

the same thing can apply to us in in
 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.879
the same thing can apply to us in in
life the important thing there is to

life the important thing there is to
 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.809
life the important thing there is to
just be aware of the bias and look for

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819
just be aware of the bias and look for
 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.360
just be aware of the bias and look for
situations where you could be using it

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370
situations where you could be using it
 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.280
situations where you could be using it
to justify staying in a situation that

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290
to justify staying in a situation that
 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.929
to justify staying in a situation that
you're a little bit scared to change

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939
you're a little bit scared to change

you're a little bit scared to change
another classic one that comes up in

another classic one that comes up in
 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.190
another classic one that comes up in
poker is the sunk cost fallacy where

might as well see it through to the end

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260
might as well see it through to the end
 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.069
might as well see it through to the end
but if you have very strong information

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079
but if you have very strong information

putting more money in the pot is a bad
idea then you shouldn't but we have this

poker when whenever a new card comes out

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609
poker when whenever a new card comes out
 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.250
poker when whenever a new card comes out
even though historically you've put in a

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260
even though historically you've put in a
 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.229
even though historically you've put in a
lot of money into the pot when that new

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239
lot of money into the pot when that new
 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.390
lot of money into the pot when that new
information comes out that's it's an

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400
information comes out that's it's an
 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.420
information comes out that's it's an
entirely new situation what's happened

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430
entirely new situation what's happened
 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.789
entirely new situation what's happened
before in terms of how much money you've

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799
before in terms of how much money you've
 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.289
before in terms of how much money you've
put in is actually largely irrelevant

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299
put in is actually largely irrelevant
 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.099
put in is actually largely irrelevant
and the same thing applies to if you're

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109
and the same thing applies to if you're
 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.580
and the same thing applies to if you're
investing in a business be it time or

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590
investing in a business be it time or
 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.789
investing in a business be it time or
money when no matter how much you've put

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799
money when no matter how much you've put
 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.830
money when no matter how much you've put
in over the last few years that say if

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840
in over the last few years that say if
 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.140
in over the last few years that say if
new information comes out that this

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150
new information comes out that this
 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.920
new information comes out that this
market is shrinking

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930
market is shrinking
 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.780
market is shrinking
some legislation has been passed that's

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790
some legislation has been passed that's
 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.840
some legislation has been passed that's
gonna make it even harder to proceed

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850
gonna make it even harder to proceed
 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.840
gonna make it even harder to proceed
then you have to largely ignore the the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850
then you have to largely ignore the the
 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.760
then you have to largely ignore the the
decisions that you made yesterday or

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770
decisions that you made yesterday or
 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.189
decisions that you made yesterday or
before you go that information you're in

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199
before you go that information you're in
 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.200
before you go that information you're in
an entirely new situation and you have

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210
an entirely new situation and you have
 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.439
an entirely new situation and you have
to evaluate it with all the information

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449
to evaluate it with all the information
 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.909
to evaluate it with all the information
that you now have available yeah it's

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919
that you now have available yeah it's
 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.850
that you now have available yeah it's
interesting to observe sort of the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860
interesting to observe sort of the
 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.150
interesting to observe sort of the
difference in emotion you can have when

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160
difference in emotion you can have when
 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.439
difference in emotion you can have when
you end up in a very similar situation

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449
you end up in a very similar situation
 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.460
you end up in a very similar situation
so for example I I had a hundred

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470
so for example I I had a hundred
 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.170
so for example I I had a hundred
thousand chips I'm in a big tournament I

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180
thousand chips I'm in a big tournament I
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.600
thousand chips I'm in a big tournament I
have a hundred thousand ships and I lose

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610
have a hundred thousand ships and I lose
 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.490
have a hundred thousand ships and I lose
a big hand and I go down to fifty

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500
a big hand and I go down to fifty
 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.969
a big hand and I go down to fifty
thousand and then if I compare it to I'm

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979
thousand and then if I compare it to I'm
 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.920
thousand and then if I compare it to I'm
in the same tournament and I had twenty

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930
in the same tournament and I had twenty
 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.930
in the same tournament and I had twenty
five thousand chips I double up my stack

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940
five thousand chips I double up my stack
 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.390
five thousand chips I double up my stack
and end up with fifty thousand so these

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400
and end up with fifty thousand so these
 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.980
and end up with fifty thousand so these
are two different situations I have the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990
are two different situations I have the
 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.629
are two different situations I have the
same number of chips but I feel

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639
same number of chips but I feel
 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.120
same number of chips but I feel
completely different between the two and

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130
completely different between the two and
 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.830
completely different between the two and
that those then those differing mindsets

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840
that those then those differing mindsets
 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.090
that those then those differing mindsets
you know if in the time I've just

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100
you know if in the time I've just
 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.740
you know if in the time I've just
doubled up I'm feeling great I'm like

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750
doubled up I'm feeling great I'm like
 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.719
doubled up I'm feeling great I'm like
wow I've I'm up to here now let's see

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729
wow I've I'm up to here now let's see
 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.029
wow I've I'm up to here now let's see
where we can go whereas I've hard my

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039
where we can go whereas I've hard my
 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.010
where we can go whereas I've hard my
stack I'm feeling despondent I was like

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020
stack I'm feeling despondent I was like
 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.770
stack I'm feeling despondent I was like
man I had this many before and so often

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780
man I had this many before and so often
 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.290
man I had this many before and so often
you'll end up playing badly from this

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300
you'll end up playing badly from this
 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.909
you'll end up playing badly from this
point and playing great from this point

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919
point and playing great from this point
 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.610
point and playing great from this point
and yet it's stupid because actually

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620
and yet it's stupid because actually
 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.409
and yet it's stupid because actually
practically you both you're in exactly

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419
practically you both you're in exactly
 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.659
practically you both you're in exactly
the same situation in both so poker

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669
the same situation in both so poker
 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.570
the same situation in both so poker
teaches you to detach yourself from how

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580
teaches you to detach yourself from how
 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.450
teaches you to detach yourself from how
you got there and just going okay this

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460
you got there and just going okay this
 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.400
you got there and just going okay this
is my situation right now what's the

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410
is my situation right now what's the
 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.750
is my situation right now what's the
best best procedure moving forward

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760
best best procedure moving forward
 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.000
best best procedure moving forward
