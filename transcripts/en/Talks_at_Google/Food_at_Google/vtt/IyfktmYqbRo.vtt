00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.210
MALE SPEAKER: And welcome
to another talk at

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.227
Google Experience.

00:00:05.227 --> 00:00:06.810
If you're here in
the audience, you've

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.880
probably seen how amazing
the restaurant is yourself,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.870
down in the North Beach,
Tony's Pizza Napoletana--

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.379
as I feign my way
through Italian.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.570
But we have the man
himself here today.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.260
He's here to speak to us
about his new book, "The Pizza

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.380
Bible," which is
everything it says

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.290
it is, the ultimate guide to the
variety and diversity of pizzas

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.130
throughout the world, with
special advice for the home

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.350
chef, as well.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.320
Tony's Pizza is a San
Francisco institution,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.930
a thing of pure legend, and
he himself has won, I think,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.170
11 international pizza awards.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.500
And then, I guess they decided,
to be fair to the other people,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.570
to elect him out
of the competition.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.810
So he's a judge in
emeritus now, I guess.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.510
So without further
ado, looks like we

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.460
have some dough on the line.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.480
So please join me in
welcoming Tony to Google.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.980
Thank you.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.634
Thank you.

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:57.134
Thanks.

00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:58.625
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.715
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Who was here first?

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:03.970
Who was here first?

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.856
I saw you.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:07.000
There's one.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Who else was here first?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.333
No, I don't know about that one.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.260
I'll give you one, too.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.160
I have a couple.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.820
I don't know if he was.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.750
Anybody have a kid?

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.401
Baby?

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:20.360
Like "baby," baby?

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.390
Somebody have a baby?

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.800
Some-- nobody has babies?

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.970
I just had a baby.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.350
I'm going to save it
in case somebody--

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.760
Well, where did "The Pizza
Bible" originate from?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.470
How did it all happen?

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.625
It really goes back
to the beginning.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:36.000
And even when we
go further back,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.940
I grew up in Fremont, Italian,
Portuguese, Spanish family.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.640
My mom cooked.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.360
And when I say my mom
cooked, she was a housewife.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.550
We would come home
from school at 3:00.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.460
My dad would come home
from work at 6:00.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.270
We'd watch my mom
cook for three hours.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.330
That was my brother, Frank,
and I watched my mom cook.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.580
We grew up on a farm.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.440
We had fresh produce.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.520
We had apricots, cherries,
fava beans-- I farmed.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.750
So being used to that,
growing up around food

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.860
was a staple in our household.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.520
Pizza Friday
nights-- Uncle Joe's

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.460
was a local place,
independent guy.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.270
He was Italian.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.120
I was a little kid.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.328
My grandpa would bring me in.

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:19.140
I'd get a double
cheese, and I thought

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.570
it was the greatest
thing in the world.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.160
And then, when I
was 18, my brother

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.330
had the idea of
opening up a pizzeria.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.560
It was in Castro Valley.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.110
And that's where I
made my first pizza.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.600
And when you think of my
first pizza, first pizza

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.080
professionally, where somebody
paid for it, and they came in.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.040
My brother taught me the basics.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.760
Get some flour on your dough.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.870
Stretch it out.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.450
I thought it was
the greatest thing.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.590
Here in front of you
is this living organism

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.140
that I wanted to make better.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.594
I wanted to figure it out.

00:02:53.594 --> 00:02:55.510
And I don't think we can
always figure it out.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.580
It's something you want to
master, but at the same time,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.380
you still want to respect.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.410
But at that time, I was
trying to figure out

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.670
what hasn't been done.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.260
When you're a young chef,
you're a young pizzaiolo--

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.860
that's a pizza
maker in Italian--

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.674
you're always trying to figure
out what's never been done,

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:18.250
what type of out-of-the-box
pizzas you can do.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.610
And when you get older
and you get wiser,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.080
sometimes some of the
simplest things in life

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.250
are the greatest things.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.420
So I was known for
this pizza acrobat,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.300
this guy that threw it around.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.070
And when people used
to come in, kids

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.310
thought it was the greatest
thing in the world.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.290
I got pretty good at it.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.660
I would do things as
people came around.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.980
And what was that?

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.190
It was a hell of
a marketing idea.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.020
It was an idea that if
people came in and saw

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.410
me throw, let's help
a lot of them do.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.660
Guy in the red-- all right!

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.550
Look at that.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.680
So kids came in.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.360
Parents came in.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.590
When kids came in, they said,
wow, what's he doing, daddy?

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.920
And when parents came
in, they would say, wow,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.490
I remember when that guy used
to do that when I was younger.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.690
It was a lost art.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.530
It was something so simple.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.000
Yet you're trying to
manipulate it, do tricks to it,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.810
and it was fun.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.399
Well, I won in the '90s.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.220
And I think when
I was introduced,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.900
I was banned from competing.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.071
I retired and competed.

00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:28.070
I was banned from Italy.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.580
I couldn't compete.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.005
I won so many times
in acrobatics.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.909
Made how-to videos,
I got millions

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.450
of dollars worth of
free advertising.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.200
Here we were, this little mom
and pop shop, and it was great.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.730
I got to travel
around the world,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.180
and I got to make pizzas.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.920
I got to toss pizzas
at places from Fargo

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.390
to Florida, to
Belgium, to Thailand.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.610
I was traveling
with Thai acrobats

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.560
when I was 23 years
old across Thailand.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.860
I got to see how
pizza's made all over.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.710
And when you think of
"The Pizza Bible," how

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.804
did this guy become good
enough or an expert enough

00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:08.720
to be able to do that?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.800
It was a lot of times.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.990
It was 16 years of
traveling on the road.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.790
I was fortunate.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.340
A lot of pizza guys
know one style.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.590
They stay in their restaurant.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.340
We do New York.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.120
That's it.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.340
Well, I was fortunate enough
to work with guys from Detroit,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.070
see St. Louis-style pizza, work
in New York, work all over,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.260
and really understand
regional pizzas

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.400
and Italian-style
regional pizzas.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.110
It was funny.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.950
I went to Naples
in the year 2000.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.870
I was on my honeymoon.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.490
We're on our way to Sorrento.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.610
I told my wife, I
got to go by Naples.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.700
Here's this pizza
guy in the industry.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.510
If you look at it,
it was the year 2000.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.596
I got into the pizza
industry in 1991.

00:05:55.596 --> 00:05:57.640
I thought I knew it all.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.170
I said, I got to see this.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.840
We want to Trianon.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.340
We were going on the train,
got out, went to Trianon.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.060
And it's a pizzeria in Naples.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.060
There's Trianon, Da
Michele, Di Matteo,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.630
Presidente-- it's this
circle of great pizzerias.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.690
I ordered a Margherita My wife
ordered this pizza lasagna.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.820
It was like a combo pizza in
Naples, what you would call it.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.080
And here was this pizza
sitting in front of me

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.090
that I didn't understand.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.810
I looked at it.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.643
It was a Margherita.

00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:31.990
It's simple, but 900
degrees, 90 seconds.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.560
It was simple.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.520
It was basil, olive
oil, sea salt.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.450
It was mozzarella fiordilatte.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.450
It was a cheese pizza
with basil on it.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.080
But it wasn't that.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.640
I didn't know how to do it.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.420
I looked at it.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.670
I don't know how to make this.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.086
Here, I'm this pizza guy and
whatever you want to call me,

00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:50.440
and I didn't really
know how to do it.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.430
It was a realization
of I knew nothing.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.810
I said to myself,
I know nothing.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.970
And my wife's looking at
like, you're a nutcase.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.540
What are you talking about?

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.510
I said, I don't know
how to make this.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.580
This is something that
was done 150 years ago.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.496
And here, I'm this guy
in this pizza industry,

00:07:03.496 --> 00:07:07.600
and I don't even
know how to do it.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.020
It wasn't the thing like I
know how to play PlayStation,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.604
but I never learned how to
play Commodore or Atari.

00:07:13.604 --> 00:07:15.520
It was a little bit like
that, but it was just

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.270
this basic thing that
was just such a craft.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.360
And it was amazing.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.310
So I had to reteach
myself all over again.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.210
I had to do my own research.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.130
It was a lot of work.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.870
I saw the industry evolving.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.685
Back then in 2000,
Neapolitan, coal-- all

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:36.544
that that's going on right now,
artisan pizza, wasn't that big.

00:07:36.544 --> 00:07:38.335
I saw our industry
going in that direction.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.240
It was crazy.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.240
I started the first team
in the pizza industry

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.016
from the US Pizza
team to an elite team

00:07:46.016 --> 00:07:47.390
called the World
Pizza Champions.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.520
We traveled around the world.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.687
I did a lot, but
it was all going

00:07:51.687 --> 00:07:52.770
towards the food category.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.790
Forget the acrobats.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.750
That's done.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.654
Let's focus on food.

00:07:55.654 --> 00:07:58.070
And there's a funny thing that
happened right at that time

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.400
at the Alameda County fair.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.090
I do 30 shows.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.190
It was cooking and acrobatics.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.130
It was right around 2000.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.830
The chef, Courtney Townsend,
that was the head of that.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.810
It was a hot day.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.300
It was 109 in Pleasanton.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.679
It was just really a mess.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:16.720
I got done doing my show.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.553
I was out of breath.

00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:18.410
I was tired.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.580
There were five people
in the audience.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.288
It was a Tuesday.

00:08:20.288 --> 00:08:21.424
It was a horrible day.

00:08:21.424 --> 00:08:23.840
It was just one of those days
that nobody was at the fair.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.310
It was a 2:00 show.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:25.909
I was done.

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:26.450
I was a mess.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.020
And Courtney went to
me and said, you know,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.910
you're doing it now.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.390
But I don't think anyone wants
to see a 50-year-old on stage

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.440
doing what you're doing.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.936
It was funny, because
Courtney was right.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.519
And there was a time
in my life that I

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.580
said, meaning you
should focus on food.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.970
You're a great guy
cooking, she told me later.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.880
You know how to
do amazing things.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.490
Why don't you focus on the food?

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.720
And she said that, and I got it.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.530
Some people would
say, screw you.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.030
I'm done.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.290
I like to throw pizzas.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.830
A lot of guys in
our industry do.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.880
So I focused on food, and
the Food Network came around.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.630
It was hot.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.410
There was one
competition that I won,

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.300
and I won a number
on the Food Network.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.000
But the one I wanted to win
was "Best Pizza in the US."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.539
And if you guys
have seen that show,

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:14.080
it was a pizza called
the Cal Italia.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.040
That was a pinnacle
moment in my career,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.206
just because it's like,
wow, I finally got something

00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:19.410
with food.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.550
And I was striving for that.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.810
Pizza schools were
originating everywhere.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.920
They're all over Italy,
France, just everywhere.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.860
In the US, there
wasn't that many.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.420
I was this hot guy
in the industry

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.540
that three different
schools wanted

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.500
me to start their chapter in
San Francisco or in California.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.020
I visited three, and I
saw one that I loved.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.860
I liked it because
their book from the '80s

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.010
to the '90s to that
time was getting

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.230
bigger and thicker and thicker.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.800
They progressed.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.550
And it wasn't just
about making recipes.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.080
It was about the chemistry
behind the dough,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.960
simple sugars, yeast,
complex sugars.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.906
There was the whole chemistry
behind the whys and the whats.

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:05.780
And when you're an owner,
you're an operator,

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.991
you're a home cook,
you're a chef,

00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:10.240
you're trying to figure out,
why did my dough blow up?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.810
Why did it go flat?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.890
Why didn't it brown correctly?

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.307
Why is it not working?

00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:18.890
And when you're an
owner and operator,

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.270
you want to try to
figure those things out.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.850
So the chemistry behind dough,
the chemistry behind cooking

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.000
was at this school,
and I liked that.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.347
And nobody else had that.

00:10:27.347 --> 00:10:29.430
It was considered one the
oldest schools in Italy.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.740
I went and got my
master's from that school.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.570
And I was able to certify.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.240
So in the year
2005, I had a book

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.762
that came out called
"Pizza" that was good.

00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:41.470
It's a good book.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.780
It did very, very well.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.000
But if you look at what "Pizza"
is to "The Pizza Bible,"

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.800
the progression
is pretty dynamic.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.380
But during that
year, they said, hey,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.670
when are you going to
open your school up, Tony?

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.540
I said, well, Tony's pizza
Napoletana's not here yet,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.760
because we opened in '09.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.520
I was just leaving
Paisano's, my brother,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.760
trying to figure out
what I was going to do.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.140
I wanted to do a school.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.270
It was a lot going on, actually,
for me in my life at that time.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.760
Nobody understood the model,
Tony's Pizza Napoletana.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.610
Several ovens, every style--
practically every style

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.320
of pizza.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.470
How are you going to do it?

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.803
How are you going to operate it?

00:11:17.803 --> 00:11:19.660
It's never going to work.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.660
Nine out of 10 people
told me they don't get it,

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.930
and it's not going to happen.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:24.650
It's not going to work.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.880
You're probably going
to go out of business.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.040
And these are operators.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.610
These are guys in the
industry where you look up to.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.790
So I decided to.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.970
And at that time, I was
practicing Neapolitan pizza

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:35.860
at my house.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.380
I was a guy who was certified in
pizza, but I wasn't Neapolitan.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.260
Let me just tell you,
that Neapolitan arena

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.220
is in an arena of its own.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.980
Guys that run pizza classica,
Sicilian-style pizza,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.920
Pizza Romana--
that's a category.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.510
But the Neapolitan
category is very hard.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.195
It's a trade that you don't
see it around that often.

00:11:57.195 --> 00:12:00.620
And people may say "Neopolitan,"
but most of its neo-Neapolitan.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.190
But Neopolitan's
very, very difficult.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.810
I started practicing in my
backyard with beehive ovens,

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:09.010
and we were talking about
that a little bit ago.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.670
I had ingredients sent
to me to my house.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.000
I was working like a
dog trying to figure out

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.350
this craft on my own, from wood
boxes to deseeding San Marzano

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.250
tomatoes, to trying
to figure out

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.050
the best way I could
make this pizza.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.230
I entered in '07.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.720
I brought the first team from
the US to Naples to compete,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.490
and I won that World Pizza Cup.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.350
It was probably a landmark
win in the pizza industry.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.110
I was escorted out by
police when I won that,

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.060
because they thought I was
going to get stabbed or shot.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.030
It was a crazy moment of
2,000 people in this arena,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.350
most of them pizzaiolos.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.520
And then, there was this
American table of nine

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.790
that police came to and
said, don't get excited.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.740
And you're like, what?

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.156
And then, they
call your name out,

00:12:53.156 --> 00:12:55.290
and you can't really
get too excited.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.640
It was a surreal moment.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.760
It was a pinnacle moment in
my career and in the industry.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.040
And after that win, I decided
to find North Beach, San

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.870
Francisco, and put
Tony's Pizza Napoletana

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.904
and the International
School of Pizza there.

00:13:09.904 --> 00:13:11.570
And when you think
of "The Pizza Bible,"

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.735
that's where it all
started, out of Tony's.

00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:17.610
Nine out of 10 people
said I'd never make it.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.187
It was '08, '09, building,
horrible economy.

00:13:21.187 --> 00:13:22.020
You're a young chef.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.430
Go to the Mission.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.710
I heard that so many times.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.190
I don't want to
go to the Mission.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.106
Oh, you're going to have
a hard time doing it.

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:30.630
Any time somebody tells me I
can't do it, or I don't get it,

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.240
or why are you doing that, it's
when you want to show them.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.980
And everybody said it.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.200
But doing it in North
Beach, Little Italy-- I

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.150
got married across the street.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.495
I hung out there when
I was 19 years old.

00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:43.470
You're Italian.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.136
I want to do it in North Beach.

00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:46.760
I love the Mission,
don't get me wrong.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.730
But is it easy in the Mission
for me to do it at that time?

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.647
It was.

00:13:50.647 --> 00:13:52.730
Was it hard to try and do
it at North Beach, where

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.600
they considered that corner
one of the worst corners

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.800
at that time?

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.930
Everybody was going under.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.250
It was seven to nine
different places

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.870
going under when I opened,
and it was very, very tough.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.520
So the odds were against me.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.910
So we opened with five ovens.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.760
Now, we have seven.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.000
We have coal, electric,
wood, gas, rotating gas.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.860
We have practically every style
of pizza other than Chicago,

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.170
which I opened up a new
concept called Capo's.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.020
And it was groundbreaking.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.625
It was innovative.

00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:25.000
When you think of
groundbreaking,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.490
Google is groundbreaking.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.020
Google is innovative.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.950
Obviously, we're
here, and it's one

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.892
of the most amazing
campuses, areas,

00:14:32.892 --> 00:14:34.350
places to work--
wherever you would

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.181
like to call it-- that
I've ever been to.

00:14:37.181 --> 00:14:43.200
So to create something that
was monumental in an industry,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.320
it was exciting times.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.830
When you're thinking of that
startup, or the early years

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.370
of Google and now, of course,
it's that exciting time to say,

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:50.950
we can do it.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.160
We can do it.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.940
And that was really
exciting to me,

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.160
bringing regional styles,
national styles, to a place

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.780
where everybody lives.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.490
If you're from St. Louis,
I have the provel cheese

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.150
that you probably are used to.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.750
If you're from Wisconsin,
you've heard of brick cheese.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.050
And you're making Detroit-style
pizzas in Detroit,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.175
I'm using the brick cheese.

00:15:16.187 --> 00:15:17.770
It's important when
you think of books

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.990
that have been written is, do
we have room for another book?

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.990
Is there room for
another pizza book?

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.010
Yes, there was room
for "The Pizza Bible."

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.570
I wrote one 10 years ago.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.050
I wrote a children's
book after that.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.716
But when it comes
down to it, do we

00:15:32.716 --> 00:15:34.090
need another book
on our shelves?

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.590
And "The Pizza Bible" is a book
that every professional will

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.990
have, and every home
chef will have to get.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.470
It's a user-friendly book
that is unlike any book.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.430
Is everything in
it that I wanted?

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.740
Did I get everything in it?

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.050
Not everything got in it.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.430
I could have been a $100 book.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.030
Fortunately, we wanted
slot it correctly

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.540
for a home user
and a professional,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.580
where it was affordable.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.610
98% of everything that I wanted
in that book was in that book.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.230
There's a few styles
that were left out,

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.640
and I left them out for
reasons that I didn't really

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.980
feel they were the
greatest-tasting styles

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.130
out there.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.430
But when it comes to
"The Pizza Bible,"

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.570
and when it comes to the
styles, it's a book--

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.910
now, when you look at books,
resources are so important.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.480
The resources in this are
professional resources.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.580
We tell you where to
buy All Trumps flour.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.090
That's good for New
York-style pizza.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.550
Power flour, that's
great for your home oven.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.450
When you think of
specific ingredients,

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.070
a lot of home chefs
say, what am I

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.907
doing wrong when
they make pizza?

00:16:37.907 --> 00:16:39.740
It's the first question
I hear all the time.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.215
Or they just come to you
and make that statement.

00:16:42.215 --> 00:16:43.450
Well, what am I doing wrong?

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.910
I can't do it like
the pizza operators.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.840
It's not that they're
doing something wrong.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.040
A lot of times, they're just
not using the right ingredients.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.510
Ingredients are a key.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.150
Quality ingredients are a key.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.825
You go out to your food court
out here and you're eating,

00:16:55.825 --> 00:16:56.866
and everything's quality.

00:16:56.866 --> 00:16:57.639
It tastes great.

00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:58.180
It's amazing.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:58.680
It's fresh.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.650
And obviously, I've
been to food courts

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.390
like this where everything
tasted horrible.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.329
It's a key element
to cooking, and it's

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:07.440
important to understand.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.981
And the chemistry
behind dough, and I

00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:11.410
talk a lot about that--
understanding salt

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.220
and how it affects your dough,
how your water is so important.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.250
The variables from day-to-day
operations are amazing.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.710
Humidity-- when it comes
to hot, cold, elevation,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.109
they're all factors when
it comes to your dough.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.770
And it always comes
back to your dough,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.395
because your dough's
the hardest thing.

00:17:32.329 --> 00:17:34.620
So I'd love to be able to
take some questions from you.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.170
I had a couple questions
I answered in my speech

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.995
right now, that somebody emailed
to me that wanted to know.

00:17:39.995 --> 00:17:41.870
I don't know who it was,
but it was somebody,

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.500
unless they're just
going to watch it later.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.900
But if you have any questions,
I'd love to answer them.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.360
If you want to have some books
signed, I'd love to sign some.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.580
AUDIENCE: Without going into the
specifics of Neopolitan pizza,

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.510
what is it that makes it
different, for those people who

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.440
haven't been to Napoli, and
who haven't tried it really?

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.106
TONY GEMIGNANI: That's
a great question.

00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:07.340
So Neapolitan
pizza-- it's soupy.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.940
It's wet.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.750
It's sloppy wet, sometimes.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.160
When you have a
Neapolitan pizza,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.690
it's 90 seconds, 60
seconds, 900 degrees,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:19.330
a fresh mozzarella that's wet,
olive oil that's obviously wet.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.570
It's a pizza that
unfortunately-- it's

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.740
a few good questions,
actually, in one.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.520
Sometimes, what we grow
up with in the US--

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.770
you've been to places that
say "New York-style pizza."

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.410
And there's nothing
New York about it,

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.451
until a purist comes in
or a traditionalist comes

00:18:34.451 --> 00:18:35.950
in and says, "this is New York."

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.140
And then, you're
battling it out, saying,

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.210
well, I've been eating at
this place for five years,

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.293
and they call it New York.

00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:42.317
And you're like, well,
they have the wrong oven.

00:18:42.317 --> 00:18:43.400
They have the wrong flour.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.940
The cheese is horrible.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.890
Everything's wrong about it.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.390
So it's tough when
you're in the US.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.820
There's a lot of places that
call themselves "Neopolitan

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.920
pizza," and there's nothing
Neapolitan about it.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.210
That's why I said the
name "neo-Neapolitan."

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.700
Places like A16 is Neapolitan.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.620
Una Pizza Napoletana
is Neopolitan.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.550
Tony's Pizza Napoletana
is Neopolitan.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.466
There's other pizzerias
out there that aren't.

00:19:07.477 --> 00:19:09.310
I don't like people to
get-- not necessarily

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.820
lied to-- but if I'm
getting something that's

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.630
called something, I
want it to be that.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.790
And again, that's
very important.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.930
Neapolitan pizza is
typically a 00 flour.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.860
And if you've ever
heard of 00 flour,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.610
it's a type of refinement.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.140
Typically, those
flours are from Naples.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.810
It's a very simple sauce.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.020
It's sea-salted San Marzanos.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.800
There's not oregano
or garlic, or all

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.640
these different seasonings
in this tomato sauce.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.730
It's basil.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:40.510
It's olive oil.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:41.106
It's simple.

00:19:41.106 --> 00:19:42.480
Really under the
guidelines, it's

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.063
three different types of pizzas,
the marinara, the Margherita,

00:19:45.063 --> 00:19:46.910
the Margherita extra.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.790
You could put other
items on those pizzas,

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:52.447
but the simplicity of that
pizza is what it's all about.

00:19:52.447 --> 00:19:54.280
And like I said, some
of the simplest things

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.880
are the hardest things.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.550
It's not about pepperoni
on top of that.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.350
It's not about putting
your basil on after.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.180
It's that basil is
cooked on that pizza.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.080
And that's the style.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.240
It's not cooked
at three minutes.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.590
It's not cooked at five minutes.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.570
It's charred, chewy,
wet, sometimes soupy.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.800
It's not crispy.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.050
Charred and crispy are
two different things.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:13.990
Charred is charred.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.040
Crispy is you fold it up,
you eat it, and it cracks

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.290
but it doesn't break.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.460
So it's very important
to understand that.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.010
There's no paste or
agents that you put in

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:24.980
to sweeten the sauce.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.060
It's about the tomato.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:26.935
It's about the flour.

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.960
It's about the basil, if that
makes a little sense to you.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.880
Yeah, it's a soft, very
delicate-type pizza.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.310
And you could eat
it with a fork.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.350
It could be uncut.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.070
It could not.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.289
I cut mine, because
people would be pissed off

00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:42.080
and send it back to me
all the time saying,

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.071
can you cut my pizza?

00:20:43.071 --> 00:20:45.070
And when you're on a line
doing 500 pizzas a day

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.410
on one single line,
you'll go crazy.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:53.130
So yeah, 11.5, 12.5 inches, big.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.940
You're not looking at
small, medium, extra large.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.850
You could have a
starter in that dough.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.320
Typically, there's not.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.770
Some people right
now, the question

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.580
that somebody sent me was,
"What makes the perfect pizza?"

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.980
Somebody sent that to me
last night on an email.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.510
And really, when I think of
a pizza, it's about balance.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.770
It's not about
over-complex doughs.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.010
It's not about the
sourest starter

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.510
that you have, and you're like,
"Do you taste this starter?"

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.176
I like to taste a
little bit of starter,

00:21:20.176 --> 00:21:22.201
and I like to taste a
little bit of complexity.

00:21:22.201 --> 00:21:23.700
But when it comes
to a pizza, if I'm

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.130
using a great cheese, or
a great piece of basil,

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.190
or some really nice
olive oil and a sea salt,

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.040
I want to taste it and have
it take you through a journey.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.940
I just don't want to have the
back of my mouth tasting sour.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.880
And a lot of people
are trying to achieve

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.140
the most sour starter,
sourdough dough

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.300
that they're trying to achieve.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.690
And really, when it
comes to me when cooking,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.700
is I don't like it overseasoned
or under, or oversalted or not.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.230
I like it to be about balance.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.850
And that's the key
to great pizza.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.220
AUDIENCE: You mentioned moving
from your old restaurant

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.654
and opening your place in North
Beach, and a lot of skepticism

00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:02.945
from other people about
whether it would be successful.

00:22:02.945 --> 00:22:05.350
And it's obviously
very successful now.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.810
It's always packed in there.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.720
So I'm curious as to
whether you encountered

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.540
unexpected challenges
with maintaining

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.790
a high quality of a large number
of different types of pizzas

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:16.820
at a high volume.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.580
And a possibly
related question--

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.270
why 73 Margheritas per day?

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.120
TONY GEMIGNANI: That's
a good question.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.180
So 73-- we'll start off.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.890
I went on St. Anthony
Day, San Antonio day.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.920
When I won that
competition-- well

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.790
before I won that
competition, I was

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:35.870
sitting with a bunch of
pizzaiolos, Neapolitans.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.310
I knocked over some
wine at the table.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.360
It was for lunch.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.300
And I went to clean it up, and
the guy grabbed my hand, said,

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.690
don't.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.049
In Italy, if you spill
it, rub it on your head.

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:48.090
It'll give you good luck.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.670
You're going to win tonight.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.390
And they said, it's
St. Anthony Day.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.350
It's like your second birthday.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.100
It's your lucky-- I'm Anthony,
so it's your lucky day today.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.740
So it was a joke during lunch.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.530
So that the day is
always on 6/13, June 13.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.250
So I added the six and
one, kept the three.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.780
I was born in '73.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.390
And when we're out, we're out.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.880
And we run out every day.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.990
We could do 100
Margaritas that day.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.560
But after we get to 73-- and
it's done with the San Felice.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.770
I still make it with
the specific flour.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.490
I still keep it in wood boxes.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.690
It's that pizza, that one.

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.830
It's a little better
actually than it

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.310
was from that winning day.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:33.520
If I go back to that pizza and
look at it, it was interesting.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.290
It was a tough competition.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.360
Nobody wanted me to win.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.840
Every single judge that I
had was just pissed off.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.000
It was an odd day.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.182
But those judges asked
for another piece.

00:23:46.182 --> 00:23:47.640
When you judge a
competition-- I've

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.220
judged a few different world
competitions-- you never--

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.050
you're done eating.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.340
You're a mess.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.440
You feel horrible.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.390
You never ask, hey, can
I get another slice?

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.740
You never do that.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.680
So they asked for another slice.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.520
So the team had one slice
to split for all of us.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.670
We had one piece that day.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.640
That was one of the best
pizzas I ever made in my life.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.450
We ate it.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.910
We said, OK, it's good,
we said to ourselves.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:07.700
Is it the winner?

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.220
We said, we don't know.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.030
The politics in
pizza, we didn't go

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.140
in thinking we were
going to win, trust me.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.440
Maybe a 3rd would be great,
but it was our first time.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.250
It was one of those-- so
it's really interesting.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.590
When it comes to the styles
that we've incorporated

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.570
and the more-- are we better
than we were on day one?

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:30.850
Tony's is better.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.250
My crew in the back, 70%
of them have been with me

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.630
from the very beginning.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.320
Chef Laura, Tiago-- they're
both worlds champions now.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.310
So I've carried
this 11-time world

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.112
champion, won all these things.

00:24:44.112 --> 00:24:46.070
A lot of people don't
know that Laura, my chef,

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.190
has one two world titles.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:50.030
Tiago has won a world title,
and Matt at Capo's won a world

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.430
title in Italy.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:56.560
So I have a seasoned crew of
Babe Ruths and Michael Jordans,

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.280
really.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.920
At the beginning, if you came
into Tony's, it was hard.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.420
It was a new concept.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.920
Guys I got from North Beach
Pizza, Cybelle's, whoever

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.740
came-- and bad habits.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.964
They needed to know how to
make pizzas a certain way.

00:25:10.964 --> 00:25:12.380
There were things
that nobody even

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.720
knew what the heck they were.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.970
Nobody was really doing those.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:21.580
So I would say we've expanded a
lot since then, mostly because

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.480
of the space.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.147
Did I open up with
enough refrigeration?

00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:24.646
No.

00:25:24.646 --> 00:25:26.150
Did I open up with
enough storage?

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:26.400
No.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.025
Thank God I bought
the deli next to me,

00:25:28.025 --> 00:25:32.090
and I added the coal oven
and the roto-flex oven.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.000
But now, we're making
our pasta fresh.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.480
We didn't start that in '09.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.120
We're pulling mozzarella
for one specific pizza.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.680
It's the Guinness pizza that
we make, only so many a day.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.180
We case all of our sausage now.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.135
If you look at what Tony's
was in '09, it's amazing.

00:25:48.135 --> 00:25:49.040
It was great.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.220
But if you look at it
now, it's an institution.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.590
And I'm proud of it.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:57.730
And when you think of
Lombardi's of the East Coast,

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.707
I think you think of
Tony's of the West Coast.

00:25:59.707 --> 00:26:01.290
There's no place
that you can go where

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.910
you have a Roman, Sicilian,
Detroit, St. Louis.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.446
And I get operators
in every day.

00:26:06.446 --> 00:26:07.820
And they'll get
every single one.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.675
They're looking at the bottom.

00:26:08.675 --> 00:26:10.383
They're like, oh,
that's what it is, huh?

00:26:10.383 --> 00:26:11.008
And it's funny.

00:26:11.008 --> 00:26:12.007
And they're quizzing me.

00:26:12.007 --> 00:26:13.900
And I'm like, so what
restaurant do you own?

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.390
Or which one are
you going to open?

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:17.920
It's cool.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.780
And it's just great that
it's in San Francisco.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.590
And it needed to
be in North Beach.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.690
I love that neighborhood,
and I still do.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.880
So yeah, I think it's better.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.160
Yeah, it's way better.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.500
It's hard, though,
keeping consistency up.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.820
Ordering the product's fine.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.260
The consistency's the toughest.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.060
I'm lucky I have a great crew.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.310
And my general
manager right now,

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.760
if you look at our management,
it's never been better.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.510
I'm pretty happy with them.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.230
AUDIENCE: So, my whole
family are pizza nuts,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:51.160
and we love having it.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.440
We have it several times a week.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.841
Unfortunately, one of them was
just diagnosed with celiac.

00:26:56.841 --> 00:26:58.590
And I'm wondering if
it's possible to make

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.597
a really good pizza
that is gluten-free.

00:27:01.597 --> 00:27:03.680
TONY GEMIGNANI: There is,
and we make a great one.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.430
It's hard to make.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.890
It took me two and 1/2 years
to come up with that recipe.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.140
Celiac-- you hear
it all the time.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.170
Why does everyone have
gluten free allergies?

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.199
What's going on?

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.240
When I was younger, did
my parents hear about it?

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:16.739
No.

00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:20.520
My grandparents-- nobody
had it, and now it's here.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.600
It's interesting
to talk about that.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.860
It's not that we did
something wrong, at least,

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.529
or that we changed.

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:29.070
The grain has changed
over the years.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.100
You're seeing a lot of
ancient grains right now.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.650
You're seeing a lot of
grains that are not complex.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:36.644
It's grains that were
from 2,000 years ago.

00:27:36.644 --> 00:27:38.060
Every time they
picked that grain,

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.340
reharvested it, and
changed it over the years,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.230
that grain became
very, very different.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.600
And there's multiple grains
inside a bread or a flour.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.050
And then, when we eat it, our
body doesn't recognize it.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.330
And they don't process it, and
we're getting sick from it.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.560
We did it naturally.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.510
I don't think we did
it really on purpose.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.217
It's just farmers did it.

00:27:58.217 --> 00:27:58.800
You reharvest.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.780
You find better
areas to replant.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.300
You try and get the
strongest one, the best one.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.990
So the chromosomes changed,
and it's different now.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.291
And gluten-free is here.

00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:10.040
It's here to stay.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.210
There was something said
yesterday that, is it a fad?

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:14.560
I don't think it is at all.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.510
I sell 350 gluten-frees a week.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:22.260
I sold 50 gluten-frees a
week two and 1/2 years ago.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.570
It's elevating.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.290
What makes a good gluten-free?

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.110
There's a few things
I like to add.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.390
Agave nectar, I like to add
to it, to slightly sweeten it.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.310
I like to add some
rosemary and thyme,

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.120
I add to mine, to make it
a little more exciting.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.530
You can add egg whites
to it to fluff it,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:48.100
because a lot of times,
they're just really super thin.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.810
But when you look at binding
agents like potato starches

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.520
and xanthan gum, you always
need some sort of binding agent.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.200
I'm not big on egg
in my gluten-free.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.265
Especially in Italy, if you
ever go compete in gluten-free.

00:29:00.265 --> 00:29:02.390
If you ever put egg in it,
you always come in last.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.270
They hate it.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.270
They hate the additives.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.640
They're trying to
get more natural.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.420
Rice flour, tapioca
flour-- those

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.270
are the two key
flours that I like.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.690
So yeah, it is hard.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:18.920
The water absorption rate--
the leavening agent--

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.440
when you think of gluten,
there's four proteins, really,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.780
in flour, and there's two
proteins that are missing.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.772
So when you want to make dough
and have it rise in a ball,

00:29:29.772 --> 00:29:31.980
there's a gluten net that
makes it very, very strong.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.290
And like a helium
balloon, you blow it up,

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.500
and it's hold forever.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.810
Unfortunately, gluten-free
doesn't have that,

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.750
so it's tough to make
a flavor profile in it,

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.910
because it's hard
to-- you can only

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:47.430
put so much yeast
in it to make it

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.081
taste the way you want it to.

00:29:49.081 --> 00:29:50.580
But you don't want
to over-yeast it,

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.112
because then it'll just
be all wrong for you.

00:29:53.112 --> 00:29:55.320
You've got to come to Tony's
and try our gluten-free.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.220
You'll love it.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.740
Cooking on a stone is important.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.270
We have one dedicated oven.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:03.010
We don't put our gluten-frees in
the same oven, which you really

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.760
shouldn't do.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.800
We try to make it away
from where the flour is.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.954
We do as much as we can to get
it away from all the flour.

00:30:10.954 --> 00:30:12.995
I think it's important
when you go to a pizzeria,

00:30:12.995 --> 00:30:14.020
you should ask.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.740
Do you put your gluten-frees
in the same oven?

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.520
If they do, it's not the
best thing for you, actually.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.080
But a lot of guys
are doing it wrong.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.260
AUDIENCE: Do you have the
recipe and information

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.440
like that in the book?

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.440
TONY GEMIGNANI: I don't.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.360
That's one I left out.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.200
We mentioned "Cup
For Cup" in the book.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.350
It's something my
partner, Susie--

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.552
I work with Thomas Keller,
that came out with that.

00:30:34.552 --> 00:30:37.010
We thought it should be, if
we're doing a gluten-free book,

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.600
we may just save it for a
gluten-free book down the line.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.058
And that's why we
didn't put it in.

00:30:41.058 --> 00:30:44.891
We mentioned it, but we
didn't talk about it.

00:30:44.891 --> 00:30:45.390
Come by.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.620
You can always talk to me.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.490
And if you wanted to buy a
couple shells to go and bring

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.417
it back, I would
sell them to you.

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:54.500
AUDIENCE: I had that same
experience that you did.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.840
I was raised on
typical American pizza.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.860
And then, I went this
last month to Rome.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.850
And I had the most
incredible, simple,

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.590
and it was really almost
cracker-thin, just right

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.790
with the really
fresh ingredients.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.670
Is that one of the
hardest pizzas to make,

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.334
and do you make that--
whatever that's called?

00:31:14.334 --> 00:31:16.500
TONY GEMIGNANI: Yeah, I do
a thin crust Roman-style.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.602
There's two-- Roman
can be tricky.

00:31:18.602 --> 00:31:19.310
It could be thin.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.090
It could be thick.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.730
It could be cooked on a pan.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.040
It could be cooked on a stone.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.450
A lot of it is putting
ingredients on afterwards.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.742
It's the finishing ingredients.

00:31:27.742 --> 00:31:29.283
Typically, when
we're making a pizza,

00:31:29.283 --> 00:31:31.367
we want to put everything
and cook it all at once.

00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:33.074
But in our reality in
the pizza business,

00:31:33.074 --> 00:31:35.180
our finish line, the
ingredients that go on after,

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.640
is typically bigger
than our make line.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.140
So a lot of times
in Rome, you'll

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.102
see great fresh
mozzarella, basil, tomato,

00:31:42.102 --> 00:31:43.560
peppers that are
all on it that are

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.370
very bright and
vibrant and fresh.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:49.850
And most of those ingredients
go on after the bake.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.520
Making a Roman-style
pizza-- yeah,

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.330
we have probably one of
the only Roman-style pizzas

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:55.990
in San Francisco.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.330
Mine is thin, and that's
the way I like it.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.750
I talk about it in the book.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.210
Typically, your hydration
is slightly higher

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.510
when it comes to that.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:08.940
More water in your dough
is a crispier crust.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.780
We're always trying to achieve
more water in our dough.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.937
And typically, Roman is
a high-hydrated dough.

00:32:14.937 --> 00:32:16.770
Sometimes you think
more water in your dough

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.145
is a soupy pizza
and a wet pizza.

00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:18.870
It's not.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.667
During the baking process,
it's the opposite.

00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:23.125
But yeah, I love
Roman-style pizza.

00:32:23.125 --> 00:32:24.110
It's one of my favorites.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.859
And I'm not knocking
American-style pizza.

00:32:25.859 --> 00:32:28.430
I'm not saying American-style
pizza's horrible.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.560
But there is one word called
digestability that's important.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.360
And when it comes
to digestability,

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.520
it's a key factor to pizza.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.550
When I'm making
dough today, am I

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:41.550
going to feed it to you in six
hours, 12 hours, 24 hours or 48

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:42.600
hours?

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.910
If I were to feed you
your dough at six hours,

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.224
you'll feel horrible.

00:32:46.224 --> 00:32:47.640
You're not going
to feel too good.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.130
You'll feel pretty good.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:53.010
You'll feel great, because
yeast feeds on simple sugars.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:59.040
The longer you let your yeast
feed, the less digesting

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.480
you have to do, meaning that
you're letting the yeast

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.350
feed on the simple
sugars for you.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.550
So would I rather have old
dough than young dough?

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:07.070
Yeah.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.580
And in America, typically
that dough, a lot of times,

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.872
are made that day.

00:33:11.872 --> 00:33:14.330
And the worst thing you could
do is make dough this morning

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.455
and give it to you tonight.

00:33:15.455 --> 00:33:16.340
You'll feel tired.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.630
You'll feel like you
want to go to sleep.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.350
And really when
it comes to that,

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.380
it's some of the
worst habits that you

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.580
see in our pizza industry.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.040
You want to really
make your dough

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.730
and use it 24 hours,
36 hours, 48 hours.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.550
And Italy understands that a
lot more-- Europe understands

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:34.760
that a lot more than we do.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.810
Go ahead.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.560
AUDIENCE: So cooking
on a barbecue, pizza.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.960
Any tips?

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.711
That's all I have
is a gas barbecue.

00:33:40.711 --> 00:33:42.210
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Yeah, a lot of tips.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.926
So what type of barbecue?

00:33:44.926 --> 00:33:46.120
AUDIENCE: Gas barbecue.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.650
TONY GEMIGNANI: So you have your
gas barbecue in front of you.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.720
Do you have-- how many
flames do you have?

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.930
One, two, three?

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.970
AUDIENCE: Three, north-south.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.100
TONY GEMIGNANI: Nice barbecue.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.690
MALE SPEAKER 5:
And a glazed stone.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:00.760
TONY GEMIGNANI: So no sugars
in that dough, one thing.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.010
Even in my dough recipe, I
like a Neapolitan dough recipe

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:04.600
on the grill.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.100
Why?

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.630
Because it's used to
cooking at high heat.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.620
We're cooking at 900
in a wood-fired oven.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.350
That dough can handle it.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.100
Doughs that are
high-gluten, high-protein,

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.320
you don't want to use.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.409
A lower-protein, a lower-gluten,
like a Caputo 00, is great.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:19.590
No browning agent.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:20.949
You don't need any oil on that.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:22.989
You don't need a
fat in that dough.

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:26.760
I like to have my
grill on medium.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.510
I like to go ahead and
get my dough ready.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.659
And you could either lay it
on or slide it on with a peel.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:33.159
You're going to
cook one side of it,

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.699
and that side is going
to have grill marks.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:41.486
If it's on medium and it's
right, 30 seconds, 45 seconds.

00:34:41.486 --> 00:34:43.005
MALE SPEAKER 5: Is
that 600 degrees?

00:34:43.005 --> 00:34:45.130
TONY GEMIGNANI: Medium, if
you have it-- yeah, 600.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:47.760
So you're going to slide
that right on your grill.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.960
You're going to
then peel it off.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.920
I'm going to go ahead and
lay that other side down,

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.040
the grilled side
down, top my pizza,

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.740
and then slide it
right back on my grill.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.202
And this side is
the unmarked side.

00:35:00.202 --> 00:35:02.410
The only way you can grill
a pizza correctly and cook

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:07.910
the top of it is
to close the lid.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.300
If your bottom's now
done, you open it.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.970
And 30 seconds later,
your ingredients

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.290
aren't melted that great.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.085
It's half-done but
your bottom is burning,

00:35:16.085 --> 00:35:18.950
just get a pizza pan,
a round pizza pan

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.380
that you would see, a
12-inch pan, 14-inch pan.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.810
Put a little semolina
on it, and just go ahead

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.814
and put it right on pan
and then close your lid.

00:35:25.814 --> 00:35:27.480
It'll save you about
two and 1/2 minutes

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.975
of burn time on that bottom.

00:35:29.975 --> 00:35:31.850
It's just the key of
just doing it like that,

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.310
flipping it over, topping
it, putting it on, then

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.900
checking it.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.795
And if it's burning,
just put a pan under it.

00:35:36.795 --> 00:35:37.610
Does that make sense?

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:38.060
AUDIENCE: It really does.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.680
TONY GEMIGNANI:
It's really easy.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.950
Grilling is probably the
easiest, when it comes to it.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.960
Just have some extra
dough to play with.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.720
AUDIENCE: People spend a lot
of time talking about flour,

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.110
but what about water?

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:51.520
People say that New York
water has something special

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.053
in it, or maybe Italian water.

00:35:54.053 --> 00:35:56.420
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Italian water's great.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.984
Water is a key ingredient.

00:35:57.984 --> 00:35:59.400
It's the second-highest
ingredient

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.550
that goes in your dough.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:05.450
A lot of people from
Florida have horrible pizza.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.590
I run a school.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.692
I certify 60 chefs a
year, approximately.

00:36:10.692 --> 00:36:13.210
If I have somebody
from Florida, they'll

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.890
say the pizza sucks in Florida.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.280
I say, yeah, it does.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.010
So tell me how you
make your dough.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.540
Well, we use this,
this, this, this.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.602
Do you drink the
water in Florida?

00:36:23.602 --> 00:36:24.310
They said, never.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.940
It's horrible.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.106
Do you use it on your dough?

00:36:26.106 --> 00:36:27.702
Yes, all the time.

00:36:27.702 --> 00:36:28.660
Doesn't make any sense.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:28.960
Why?

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.793
Well, it's horrible.

00:36:29.793 --> 00:36:30.310
It's cloudy.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.740
It tastes horrible.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.980
Moderately hard water
is important in dough.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.130
Hard water is bad.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:42.800
Vegas, I have reverse osmosis
in my restaurants in Vegas.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.790
I have one in Sacramento.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.740
San Francisco water's amazing.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.880
As you get to San
Diego, it's bad.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.490
LA isn't the greatest.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.350
The Midwest is interesting.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:55.210
Chicago is great.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:56.150
New York's great.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.720
Does water make your
dough taste great?

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.900
No, but it really makes
your dough perform.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.050
It makes it conditioned,
doesn't make it dry.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:09.700
Your yeast works way better
when your pockets can open.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.040
So water does a lot of things.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.690
Your leavening agent
makes your flavor.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.220
Your yeast really makes
your flavor in your dough.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.489
Great water and strong
yeast, the yeast

00:37:17.489 --> 00:37:18.530
is going to overpower it.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.637
So New York water, San
Francisco water doesn't really

00:37:21.637 --> 00:37:23.845
make your dough taste great,
but it makes it perform,

00:37:23.845 --> 00:37:27.110
makes the yeast come out,
makes the pockets better.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.600
It does make it feel better.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.690
It does all sorts
of great things.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:34.430
I don't like chlorinated
water, super hard water.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:38.530
I like to use filtered
water or reverse osmosis.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.035
Or San Francisco, I
don't do anything.

00:37:41.035 --> 00:37:43.082
The water in San
Francisco's great.

00:37:43.082 --> 00:37:44.540
I was making dough
in Walnut Creek.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:50.120
Compared to San Francisco, I
used 1/2% to 1% more water.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.400
Just was a little
harder over there.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.650
A rule of thumb is
if your water's hard,

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.380
you back off on the
salt a little bit.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.810
If the water's soft,
you'd up your salt.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:01.420
Typically, when you have your
batches, baker's percentages.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.090
I have 100 pounds of
flour in my batch,

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:06.870
and I say make it 2% salt.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.160
Well, that means
two pounds, right?

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.630
If I said make it 60% hydration,
it's 60 pounds to 100.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.530
It's always based on
your flour weight.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:18.570
A rule of thumb is 2% to
your flour weight salt

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.459
is always a good number.

00:38:21.459 --> 00:38:23.250
If I'm tasting my water
and it's super hard

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.600
and I can't do
anything about it,

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.740
I would back off on
my salt, because salt

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.050
makes your dough strong.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:32.780
It makes it hard, and makes
the gluten net very stiff.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.580
So I would back it off 1/2.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.730
When I won in Naples and I was
at the hotel, a rule of thumb

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.730
is you taste the water,
tastes horrible, don't use it.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.520
All the Canada-- all
these guys, Japan,

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.590
were all making their dough.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.210
Everybody was
talking about water.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.330
They use bottled water.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.120
They all went to the store
and bought bottled water.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.540
I didn't, because I said
to myself, guys in Naples

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.380
aren't buying bottled water.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.230
I bet you the sulfur
flavor I taste

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:06.700
will be more common to
these Neapolitan judges,

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.160
if I'm making a pizza that I
really have Neapolitan judges,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.700
and they want to say, this
tastes like Naples dough.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.409
I actually did the opposite.

00:39:15.409 --> 00:39:17.700
It was probably the only time
in my life I would ever--

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.908
I would never use that water.

00:39:18.908 --> 00:39:20.600
It just didn't
taste right to me,

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.810
but it tasted right to them.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.990
So I didn't tell all the
other international people,

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.810
but it was good.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:26.700
It was good.

00:39:28.892 --> 00:39:30.850
AUDIENCE: So I've done
a lot of experimentation

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.570
at home with the Jeff
[? Farzano ?] 1995 website that

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.687
scrolls forever, and just
tried out a million things.

00:39:38.687 --> 00:39:40.645
That I have a baking
steel rather than a stone.

00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:43.614
And I get as close to the
broiler as I can, et cetera.

00:39:43.614 --> 00:39:45.030
I was just wondering
how close you

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:47.435
think I can come to something
that-- I've run standards

00:39:47.435 --> 00:39:49.920
on the differ-- something
that feels like a fairly

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.540
authentic Neapolitan pie, given
that my temperature's going

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.140
to be lower.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.760
TONY GEMIGNANI: So in a home
oven, how do I get close to it?

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.640
Yeah, baking steels, broiler
method, that's the key.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.600
Cleanout cycle, you've
probably done that.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.550
You can't have this here,
but this is illegal.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.075
You can't do it,
if you try it, you

00:40:06.075 --> 00:40:08.487
can get a high heat
on cleanout cycle.

00:40:08.487 --> 00:40:09.070
Don't do that.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.820
Don't break your oven.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.140
Broiler method, yes.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.880
We've learned a lot
in cooking at home

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.990
that all the ovens cycle off.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:25.110
All of them-- Wolf, during
the experiments, we had Wolf

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.359
and we had Viking.

00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:28.400
There's different cycles.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.869
So if you have an oven
that's preheated too long--

00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:33.160
I had somebody say I had it
preheated for three and 1/2

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.210
hours.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:36.490
And it was too hot,
and it cycled off.

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.500
And it was cooking
like it was at 400.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.580
So cycling, careful
on your ovens.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.580
Don't preheat it too
long, but you definitely

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.330
want to preheat it
for at least an hour.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:48.360
The baking steels are
great, upper-level broiler,

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.060
and a little bit
of a sugar content

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.230
to help it caramelize a little.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.080
Typically, that's not found
in a Neapolitan dough recipe.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.210
But for that, you'll
see in my book

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.790
that I talk about
all that, trying

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:03.090
to get it as close as you can.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:07.797
If you do it perfectly, you'll
get a two-minute bake almost,

00:41:07.797 --> 00:41:08.380
two and a 1/2.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.040
It's hot.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.720
You have to 1/4 or 1/2-turn it.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.930
Convection bake works well.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.870
We didn't talk about
it much in our book,

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.140
because not everybody
has convection bake.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.030
People will say, hey, why don't
you talk about convection bake?

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:21.530
Well, when it comes to reality
of everybody else in society,

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:22.930
it's everybody does have bake.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.346
Not everybody does convection
bake, so we base it on bake.

00:41:26.346 --> 00:41:27.470
Convection bake works well.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:31.330
It cuts off about a minute
or two of your bake time,

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:35.370
just because of
circulation of heat.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:36.770
So those help.

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:43.890
A lot times-- I did a recipe
for a pretty big magazine.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:46.385
And I gave them a
Neopolitan recipe.

00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:48.074
And they were busting
me up, saying,

00:41:48.074 --> 00:41:49.240
why do you have sugar in it?

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.020
I said,well, because
unfortunately,

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.610
the American people and their
home ovens are off by 400

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:56.520
degrees, right?

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.680
So you have to.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.680
And you've got to explain
why, when they make it

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:05.340
out of your magazine, why it's
coming out like cardboard.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.200
It's crispy.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:12.890
It's almost cracker-like if you
try 00 flour in a 500-degree

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:13.390
oven.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:14.930
It's the opposite
ends of the earth.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.020
You'll make this recipe,
and you'll be trying it.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:17.978
This is not Neopolitan.

00:42:17.978 --> 00:42:20.290
It's horrible, because
it's the wrong flour

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.670
for the temperature.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.540
So I had to explain to
them that all the recipes I

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.597
had in the past
don't call for sugar.

00:42:26.597 --> 00:42:28.680
I don't use it, but you
have to put in parentheses

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.940
saying, for a home
oven, you should

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.320
add some malt or sugar or some
sort of browning agent, which

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.146
is important, because
the recipes not going

00:42:36.146 --> 00:42:38.370
to look like the picture,
if that makes sense.

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.536
And it was a pretty big
magazine I was fighting over

00:42:40.536 --> 00:42:42.950
and they finally put it,
because I said you have to.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.360
AUDIENCE: So that's in the
book, a lot of that stuff?

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.140
TONY GEMIGNANI: Yeah,
it's all in the book.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.550
I have a wood-fired section.

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.040
I have a section that I
thought was a key in the book,

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.956
because there's not that
many pizza books that

00:42:51.956 --> 00:42:53.730
have wood-fired or
home, or talking

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.300
about the different
methods and the techniques.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.260
But baking steels-- two
steels are the way to go,

00:42:59.260 --> 00:42:59.870
not just one.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.010
Stones or steels, two
are the way to go.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.160
It's always great to
start your pizza on one,

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.330
cook it halfway, and then
finish it on the other.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:10.610
In the pizza business,
do we cook in one spot

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.741
and never leave it?

00:43:11.741 --> 00:43:12.240
No.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.350
If we have an oven like
this, I throw a pizza in.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:15.990
I cook it in that circle.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.450
That's the cool spot.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:21.470
Everything else in that platform
in my oven is a hot spot.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.290
Do we-- when we finish
cooking that pizza,

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:26.540
do we move it to a hotspot
and finish that bottom

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.730
and take it out?

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.580
So on a home oven, when
you have one stone,

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.390
am I able to finish it anywhere?

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.200
You're not, because you don't
have another secondary surface.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.170
So on less than two
stones or two steels,

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:41.056
it'll make your bottom
totally different.

00:43:41.056 --> 00:43:42.680
AUDIENCE: If you're
a home chef and you

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.670
want to start making
great pizza, what's

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.489
the easiest thing to start with?

00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:48.780
TONY GEMIGNANI: What's the
easiest thing to start with?

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.595
Meaning like what should
you buy, what you invest in?

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:52.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.250
Say you're just learning
to cook great pizza.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.708
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Just learning how--

00:43:55.708 --> 00:43:58.130
some of the most important
things, two steels

00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:59.720
will work great.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.837
You have to have an oven.

00:44:00.837 --> 00:44:02.210
I'm just joking.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:03.190
Flour's important.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.190
For a home oven, high-gluten,
high-protein flour.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.250
When you look at
all-purpose flour,

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:11.220
we don't use all-purpose
flour, typically.

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.850
So let's just say you
have King Arthur Flour.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:15.900
If you're looking
at Sir Lancelot,

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.350
that's a flour that's better.

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:18.380
It's a higher-protein.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:22.580
Giusto's performer is a
great flour that you can buy.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.310
You have to go invest in a
high-gluten, high-protein

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:26.380
flour.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.190
Put a browning agent in
your dough, a sugar, a malt,

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.690
a honey, a molasses, something
that will help it caramelize.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.560
At 500 degrees in
the pizza business,

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.630
pretty much everybody
has a browning agent.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:40.355
But you'll see recipes
that won't have it.

00:44:40.355 --> 00:44:40.980
It's important.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:45.540
I have it in my book, and
I talk a lot about it.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.750
Making your dough
mature overnight--

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.510
don't use it the same day.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:54.134
Using cold water, 80%
cold water, 20% warm.

00:44:54.134 --> 00:44:55.550
Activate your yeast
in warm water,

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.250
but cool it down
with cold water.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:59.540
Doing a slow-rise
method is important.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:03.150
Don't use all 104-degree water,
like you're making bread,

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:06.457
and like a lot of books say.

00:45:06.457 --> 00:45:07.290
It's not what we do.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.830
We don't use hot water.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:14.170
We use cold, and then some warm
water to let it rise gradually.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.010
Those are some of the key
components, your flour.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.397
Those are some key.

00:45:20.397 --> 00:45:21.230
Making dough's easy.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.500
It's not too hard.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.260
Yeah, it's fun.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.517
Don't take it too seriously.

00:45:25.517 --> 00:45:27.850
There's some guys who are on
the internet who are crazy.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.720
They're taking it so seriously.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.107
You can have fun
with this dough.

00:45:32.107 --> 00:45:33.190
AUDIENCE: All right, Tony.

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:34.720
This is all too easy.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.640
We're speaking
about making pizza

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:43.160
on Earth, where we have plenty
of oxygen and great things

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.430
to cook the pizza in.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.870
But I have friends at NASA.

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.030
And I bet you they're
probably thinking now,

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:52.700
so how are we going to make
all this stuff in orbit,

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:58.200
or on Mars, where we
have certain constraints?

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.370
The energy budget
is constrained.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.360
The temperature in the
oven might be constrained.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.241
So how do we go about
doing a space pizza?

00:46:08.241 --> 00:46:09.782
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Well, you're probably

00:46:09.782 --> 00:46:15.370
a flash-frozen
process, or space cake?

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.934
So you want to know how
do we make pizza in space?

00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:20.100
AUDIENCE: The closest thing.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.615
TONY GEMIGNANI:
The closest thing.

00:46:21.615 --> 00:46:23.490
And do you think they're
going to watch this?

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.115
Are you going to tell
them to watch it?

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:30.390
TONY GEMIGNANI: I think if they
can get a spaceship to Mars,

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.650
I think they could
figure that out, right?

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.970
That's one thing.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:41.125
But there's probably a lot
of preservatives in it.

00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:43.500
There's probably a lot of
dough conditioners, L-cysteine,

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.670
things to make the
dough not go bad,

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.510
and then a lot of
probably horrible things

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:51.450
to eat that will
survive for many years.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.270
AUDIENCE: So you've got in your
North Beach restaurant a lot

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.510
of varieties of toppings,
a lot of different flavors.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:58.940
And you rotate
through, sometimes.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.000
Some will retire, and
you'll bring new ones.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.647
So I'm wondering if you
have a particular favorite,

00:47:03.647 --> 00:47:06.105
and if there was one combination
that you thought was going

00:47:06.105 --> 00:47:07.804
to work out, but
really, really didn't.

00:47:07.804 --> 00:47:09.220
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Yeah, I always say

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.750
that's like asking who's your
favorite son, like asking

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:14.950
a dad-- which one's
your favorite pizza.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:15.890
It's funny.

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:18.170
Most of them have
worked out, actually.

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:21.310
I've retired some,
but you have to do it.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.160
We will be changing
our menu soon.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.810
We do it seasonally.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.010
We do it twice a year,
and then sometimes

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.440
in the middle of
that, we'll change it.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.790
We try and do a big
run of 5,000 menus.

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:37.150
But now, you're going to see
the Tony's menu changing,

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.600
that we're going to have
inserts now, more like a book

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.340
that you can open, so we can
change it on a regular basis.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.640
When it comes to pizzas,
what didn't work?

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.120
I wouldn't put it on the
menu if it didn't work.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.300
Did people not get it?

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:57.860
We had one, the rhubarb
and Scotch pizza,

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.210
with Scotch Bonnet peppers.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.190
Confusing, tricky--
but that one,

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.440
I don't know if everyone
got the rhubarb.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.690
San Francisco's not bad.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.190
My other restaurants,
people don't get it.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.040
So I have eight
restaurants, going on 12.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.950
I'm building several
in Vegas right now.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.480
Everything starts at
Tony's, and things

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.270
don't work in Sacramento.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.740
In Casino, I have one.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.470
Vegas, even though
it's Vegas, it's

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:26.190
still-- so I don't have
quail eggs and random items,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:30.050
guanciale, on those other menus.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:34.750
Yeah, the progressiveness
of Tony's pretty much

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.430
starts there.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:38.580
And there's only a couple
that haven't really worked.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.160
There's some that
are hard to make.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.150
And my guys are like,
are you kidding me?

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:44.740
Eight-hour pork--
there's certain things

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:49.105
that we do that are just really,
really hard for the kitchen.

00:48:49.105 --> 00:48:50.480
And that's probably
the hard one.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.800
Right now, the Hang 10
pizza's my favorite.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:58.080
It's a Korean barbecue pizza.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.450
My friend, Daniel
Lee, who worked for me

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.550
when I was at
Paisano's, was a driver.

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:05.720
He has a big Korean family, had
Korean friends at restaurants.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.830
I had a good kalbi recipe from
him, little city meat slices,

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.960
the short ribs for
me, paper-thin.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.460
We have a three-day
marinate for that pizza.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:20.900
We have a bean curd that I
get at a Korean store that

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.410
only sells it.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.800
It's a great pizza,
and we pickled--

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.290
we did a lot of
pickling all year.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:28.700
And all the pickling is
for the whole winter.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.080
So you'll see our pickled
peppers and carrots on that.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.170
And it's only for two
pieces on the menu,

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:36.340
and the Hang 10
pizza's really cool.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.070
That's a pizza that's
way out of the box.

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:39.180
And you're like, I
don't know, Tony.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:39.700
You're nuts.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.200
I don't know if it's
going to be good.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.660
It's one of the best
pizzas you'll ever have.

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:43.590
Yeah, it's great.

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:45.970
AUDIENCE: I'll try to give
the rhubarb a try, too.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:46.720
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Did you try that?

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.460
AUDIENCE: No.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.970
TONY GEMIGNANI: Yeah,
it's not on anymore.

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:49.390
I took it off.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.514
I'm going to bring it back.

00:49:50.514 --> 00:49:53.430
Throwback Thursdays now
are all the retired pizzas

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:54.750
that we're bringing back.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.797
So the Soprano's this week.

00:49:56.797 --> 00:49:59.130
There'll be some other ones
coming up in the next weeks.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:02.964
But they're $13 pies, and
people have asked for them.

00:50:02.964 --> 00:50:04.630
AUDIENCE: If you could
have a last meal,

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.160
what would that last meal be?

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.540
TONY GEMIGNANI: I've been
asked that five times.

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.080
I feel like I'm going
to die, and everyone

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.800
wants to know what
my exit strategy is.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.900
I can't stand it.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.510
I feel like I'm this guy who's
70 years old, and you say,

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.330
so what's your exit strategy?

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.310
If I had to know?

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:18.810
It's funny.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:20.820
So what would I
eat, my last meal?

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.910
I said a Romana.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:24.350
A couple times, I
said a Romana pizza,

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:26.840
because my Romanas are
almost three feet long.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.940
And it's the first, your
second, and your third course.

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.740
So it's three courses in one.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.584
That was one.

00:50:32.584 --> 00:50:34.000
Who would be at
the table would be

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.280
my grandpa and my wife, my son.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.370
That would probably be--
my parents, of course.

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:40.060
My grandpa-- I'd
grown up on the farm.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.960
My grandpa is a big
part of my life.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.350
Of course, I haven't
seen him forever.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:46.520
He's long gone now.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.150
That's why.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:51.440
But I had a pretty awesome--
there was another question of,

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.800
what was your best day
of eating in your life?

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.990
One was recently in New York.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:59.870
If you ever follow
me on Facebook,

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.630
I had a marathon of eating.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:02.860
I had 20-something pizzas.

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.870
I had to go to old
friends, new guys.

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:07.330
And I was a mess.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.097
But I had to see--
sometimes, you've

00:51:09.097 --> 00:51:10.430
just got to see what's going on.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.304
It's been a while since
I really had a chance

00:51:12.304 --> 00:51:13.690
to do that in New York.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:15.420
Sometimes, you're checking
on what you're doing, just

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.128
to see-- make sure
you're doing it right.

00:51:17.128 --> 00:51:19.990
It's always cool to
double-check it and see it.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:23.290
And there was one day that
I was eating a cannoli

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:25.860
on Mulberry St.,
walking in the rain.

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.360
And I was saying, I
was like John Travolta

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.450
eating his cannoli, after I
had seven pizzas that morning.

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.704
And it was one of those days
that you had to have-- I

00:51:33.704 --> 00:51:35.620
was at Roberta's that
day, Prince Street Pizza

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.150
out of Soho Square.

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:39.830
I had all these pieces that
day that were really great.

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.470
That was a great day for me.

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.830
Another time, we went to
Italy, and my wife and I

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:46.540
were traveling.

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.960
And I got lost.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:54.490
I stumbled onto some place
that I could never find again.

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:56.580
All of a sudden,
this town appeared.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.224
And we went to this
restaurant, and it

00:51:58.224 --> 00:52:00.390
was a four-star restaurant
in the middle of nowhere.

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:02.290
I don't even get how
they would even do that,

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:04.090
but it was one of our
best meals we ever had.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.180
I had a Florentine steak
that came to your table.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:10.019
And it was just a rare that went
to medium-rare on the table,

00:52:10.019 --> 00:52:11.060
and it was just sizzling.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.740
And everything came,
and it was cool.

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:16.240
It was one of those moments that
was unexpected, but beautiful

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.130
at the same time.

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:17.800
Yeah?

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.515
AUDIENCE: Is there hope for
the mass-market pizza industry?

00:52:21.515 --> 00:52:23.265
TONY GEMIGNANI: Meaning
like frozen lines?

00:52:23.265 --> 00:52:25.400
AUDIENCE: Or frozen
or improvements?

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.700
TONY GEMIGNANI: I think
there's a lot of improvement.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.074
I've worked on
some frozen lines,

00:52:28.074 --> 00:52:30.315
actually, for three years.

00:52:30.315 --> 00:52:31.690
Everybody's doing
the same thing.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.530
Why is frozen pizza
always the same?

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:34.900
It's horrible.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:38.130
Well, there's only a few places
that really manufacture it.

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:41.141
And when you manufacture it
on a big level on a line,

00:52:41.141 --> 00:52:42.890
It's hard to change
anything on that line.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.560
It's a 24/7 line,
that everybody's

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.210
making these same pizzas,
because the lines are all

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:48.816
the same.

00:52:48.816 --> 00:52:50.940
It's important to find a
warehouse or somebody that

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.960
could have a line
that can adapt or can

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.950
add this or do this and do that.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:58.780
And that's what will make a
pizza different and better

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.240
than those.

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.820
Preservatives-- there's a
lot of extra excess in dough

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:04.840
that I hate.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.642
When it comes to frozen pizza,
I hate dough conditioners.

00:53:07.642 --> 00:53:09.600
There's one thing that,
if you look on the box,

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.970
there's a dough
conditioner on the dough,

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:12.650
or L-cysteine, and
stuff like that.

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:13.550
I can't stand it.

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:17.520
And you're able to make a
great frozen line without that.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.480
So maybe you'll
see Tony's Pizza.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.480
Well, not Tony's-- there's
already Tony's Pizza.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.938
You've got to think
Tony G's Pizza.

00:53:23.938 --> 00:53:26.100
We have a frozen line
coming out, pretty good.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.180
MALE SPEAKER 1: So
with that, thank

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.430
you very much for
stopping by Google.

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:29.330
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Thank you very much.

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:30.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.980
Thank you.
