00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.879
Spending some time swimming in warm ocean
waters this summer?

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.560
You could be bathing in a sea of flesh eating
bacteria.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:18.199
Hey I’m Carin for DNews and today I’ve
got a warning for folks hitting the beach

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.490
in any of the Gulf Coast states.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.380
The health department in Sarasota, Florida
has confirmed that infection by the bacterium

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.019
Vibrio vulnificus is responsible for at least
one recent death there.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.189
In fact, it’s responsible for 10 deaths
so far this year.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.950
According to a study in the journal Clinical
Infectious Diseases 100 people are infected

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.440
each year, resulting in approximately 50 deaths.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.020
This bacterium is particularly harmful because
it can infect us in two different ways.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.470
First, we can contract it by eating raw or
undercooked seafood like oysters, and second,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.410
it can invade our bodies through pre-existing
lesions - cuts, scrapes, blisters.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.970
Once you get infected, you will feel the symptoms
right away and they are violent.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.860
If ingested, the bacterium causes severe stomach
ache, vomiting, diarhhea and septicemia - a

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.480
life-threatening condition that worsens extremely
quickly.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.120
If the Vibrio bacteria are contracted through
a skin lesion, wound infection can cause tissue

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.300
breakdown, resulting in large disfiguring
ulcers that require skin grafts or even limb

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.300
amputation.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.680
In both cases immediate treatment with antibiotics
is critical, patients not treated for 3 days

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.250
after being infected have a death rate of
100%.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.330
Now, why isn’t the world in a mass panic
over this deadly bacteria?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.549
Well, it’s actually a normal part of the
microbial communities in most tropical coastal

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.549
waters.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.630
But having skin lesions puts you at a much
greater risk of contracting an infection.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.970
If you have an open sore of any kind, it’s
not a great idea to go swimming in Sarasota

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.970
right now.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.670
If you do have a cut or you get one from a
sharp coral or sea urchin spine - disinfect

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.900
it right away!

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.490
And, if you’re a connoisseur of raw oysters,
it may be a good idea to focus on ones from

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.720
cooler Northern climates.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.300
Vigilance is key in preventing an infection
by this bacteria.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.860
In addition, experts note that those with
compromised immune systems and notably with

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.510
liver disease, are much more likely to contract
an infection than healthy individuals.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.750
What makes the bacteria so lethal is a toxin
located in its cell walls.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.670
It’s called a lipopolysaccharide or LPS,
and interestingly, females are protected against

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.400
its effects by the production of estrogen.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.830
Almost all reported cases of infection by
Vibrio bacteria are in males, not females.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.250
Studies looking at the effects of LPS done
in rats showed a rapid death rate for males

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.400
but not females; however, when females had
their ovaries removed both sexes exhibited

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.980
the same death rates.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.480
In addition to the LPS, the bacteria contain
a number of other compounds that facilitate

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.300
its virulence and infection rate, including
numerous tissue degrading enzymes.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.800
Vibrio bacteria are especially virulent in
the warm summer months, they actually go into

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.319
a more dormant state when water temperatures
are cooler.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.520
Because they thrive in warm waters, overall
increases in ocean temperatures due to global

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.450
warming means that their ranges are expanding.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.360
As temperatures continue to climb, scientists
expect a parallel increase in death rate caused

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.620
by Vibrio-related infections.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.890
Do you think that risk of a potentially deadly
bacteria will keep you out of the water?

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.940
Let us know in the comments below and keep
coming back for more DNews every day of the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.060
week.
