00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.080
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.280
-Five years down the line, I
don't help what I'll be doing.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.980
I may be dead.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.000
I may not be.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.109
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.650
If you asked me when I was 17
what I'd be doing with my life,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.800
I would have said I'd
definitely be a writer.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.140
But found medicine was, in
fact, the perfect place.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.440
I first began noticing symptoms
in my sixth year of residency.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.580
Obviously, Luci and I
were both very suspicious

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.340
that I had some form of cancer.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.730
But actually having
the confirmation

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.190
was still devastating.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.330
Since Cady's birth,
my time with her

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.540
has had a very peculiar
and free nature.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.390
In all probability, I won't
live long enough for her

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.400
to remember me.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.500
And so the time
just is what it is.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.739
It's a careful balance.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.800
If you don't think
about the bad case,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.960
that ending is going to be very
rough on you and your family.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.780
But if you don't think
about the good case,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.400
you're going to
miss an opportunity

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.318
to really make the most
out of your life and time.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:56.720
SPEAKER: Paul's critically
acclaimed memoir,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.260
"When Breath Becomes Air," is
a profound, searingly honest,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.160
and ultimately life-affirming
meditation on the challenge

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.970
of facing death and the
relationship between doctor

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.800
and patient.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.790
It's been a New York
Times bestseller.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.350
It's been published into
more than 40 languages.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.620
That's what I hear.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.760
What have people
been telling you?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.800
I hear that they've been
writing letters to you.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.330
What are the things
you're hearing?

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.740
How is it changing people?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.080
LUCY KALANITHI: It's been, like,
the best and worst experience

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.120
of our lives, obviously.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.550
And I just wanted to say
thanks for inviting me.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.910
I'm really excited to be here.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.020
I've never been
to Google before.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.160
Paul's best friend in
the world, Robin Moroney,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.574
is a writer who works
for Google, actually.

00:02:44.574 --> 00:02:46.240
And we have other
friends who work here.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.829
So it's really
exciting to join you.

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.328
And I'm grateful
for the invitation.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.320
Sort of one of the
weirdest personal things

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.360
about the book coming
out is I remember

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.150
being so excited to see the
review in the New York Times--

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.130
like first of all, just to get
a review in the New York Times

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.546
and then have it
be a good review.

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:07.460
You're like, thank god.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.870
The reviewer, Janet
Maslin, wrote,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.740
"This is an indelible book."

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.980
And it was, like, this
sort of weird moment for me

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.570
of like Paul died.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.890
And then he's indelible
in a certain way.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.920
And so it's just this
bizarre combination

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.290
of connecting with people
over him, like you say,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.640
and then missing him
at the same time.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.440
So yeah.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.900
People tweet me, and
they write to me.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.610
And the thing that I think
is the most gratifying

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.100
to hear is when somebody
says, this helped me

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.180
through a time of suffering,
to relate with Paul's words

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.340
or what you said, this
deepened a relationship of mine

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.390
in some way, or this made
me less afraid to die,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.810
which is quite a
profound thing to say.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.880
And I think that would have
meant a lot to Paul as well.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.720
So that's been really exciting.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.610
And then people write to
me about grief or about

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.320
caregiving.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.130
A woman recently
wrote to me and said,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.670
caregiving is a beatitude.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.800
Grief is a beatitude.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.540
Like they're sort of these deep,
painful, and moving experiences

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.460
that we all share.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.960
We can't avoid them.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.899
So I think just the
feeling of connecting

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.410
with people over suffering.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.980
It's not something
any of us wants,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.910
but it's an immutable
part of our lives.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.300
And what we do with it?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.730
And it's been helpful for me
to feel less isolated, and also

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.170
gratified in a certain
way because of what it

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.880
would have meant to Paul and
what it means to Paul's legacy.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.360
It's the worst.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.375
But even being here
today with you, right?

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.750
It's like I get to look in
your eyes and talk about Paul.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.937
And it helps me personally, too.

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:48.520
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.750
In fact, before we started,
I was just telling Lucy

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.820
that for all of us people
who might be strangers to her

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.036
but who read the book,
you know, in some way,

00:04:58.036 --> 00:04:59.410
she feels like
part of the family

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.230
because you've very courageously
shared some of the experiences

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.400
and incidents in this book.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.990
They really move you and touch
you at a very, very deep level.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.760
So in terms of this format
of question and answers,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.940
our interview, what
we thought would

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.920
work best is we will
try and let Paul speak

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.780
through most of this interview.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.920
So we'll try and channel that.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.380
I've selected some quotes.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.770
And maybe if you could
help me read those quotes.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.730
And I will follow
up with a question.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.717
LUCY KALANITHI: Sure.

00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:36.050
Do you want me to read this one?

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.410
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.390
LUCY KALANITHI: I will
say one other thing

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.610
about what people talk to
me or write to me about.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.507
So Paul started out the book
by talking about a rocky patch

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:44.590
in our marriage, actually.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.750
So now I know a lot of
other people's marriages.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.330
The big secret of
being a grownup

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.250
is people die and
marriage is hard.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.200
So anyway, that's
kind of-- he didn't

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.370
spare anybody in the book,
including himself or me

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.080
or whatever.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.380
But that's part of it, right?

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.754
It's like intimate
and authentic.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.980
So this part here?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.854
SPEAKER: Yes, please.

00:06:07.854 --> 00:06:10.280
LUCY KALANITHI:
So this part is--

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.790
I'll just give a quick context.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.650
It's from the epilogue
to the book, which

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.210
I wrote after Paul died, that
tells how Paul died and then

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.360
reflects on him and what's
been happening since he died.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.620
And it mentions this best
friend of Paul's, which

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.416
is Robin Moroney,
who's the Google dude.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.840
"Paul found poetry more
comforting than scripture

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.070
in his ability to
forge from his life

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.300
a cogent, powerful tale
of living with death.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.510
When Paul emailed his best
friend in May 2013 to inform

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.265
him that he had terminal
cancer, he wrote,

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:50.510
'The good news is I've already
outlived two Brontes, Keats,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.606
and Stephen Crane.' The bad news
is I haven't written anything."

00:06:55.606 --> 00:06:57.230
SPEAKER: You know,
the reason I thought

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.230
we'll start with this
is in reading this book,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.740
it's clear that Paul had the
unusual and remarkable knack

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.890
of making sense out of the
somewhat messy intersection

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.470
of what some would call
philosophy, science, religion,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.340
spirituality, and scripture.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.620
Can you talk to us a little bit
about Paul's beliefs, faith,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.630
and what kind of
perspective helped

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.650
him make sense of
everything put together?

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.162
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah, sure.

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:27.870
And by the way, going
back to that quote,

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.037
"The good news is I've
already outlived two Brontes.

00:07:30.037 --> 00:07:31.870
The bad news is I haven't
written anything."

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.310
It actually gets at
this really deep thing--

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.940
partly that Paul was funny.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.040
It's like a funny way, in
a way, to tell your best

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.998
friend you have cancer.

00:07:38.998 --> 00:07:43.640
But it's also getting at
his deep ambition in general

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.640
and the fact of what writing
meant to him because he's

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.410
writing this as a neurosurgeon.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.840
But the big loss in
his mind immediately

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.540
is his medical career
plus his love for writing.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.150
So Paul, as a child, as
he said in that video,

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.062
had always thought
he'd be a writer.

00:08:02.062 --> 00:08:05.630
Was a real lover of literature
and thought he would--

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.390
he majored in English
and then went on

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.200
to study history and philosophy
of science and medicine.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.620
And then surprised himself
by becoming a doctor.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.750
His dad was a doctor
who worked really hard.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.140
And initially Paul said, I
don't want to work in that way

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.960
and thought he would
enter the humanities.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.330
And then ultimately
had this realization

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.010
that meant a lot
to him, which was

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.000
many of the critical,
life-changing moments we all

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.510
face happen in a
medical context.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.640
And that's good news and
bad news-- everything

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.601
from having a baby to having
a serious illness or trauma.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.120
He's sort of seeking what are
the underpinnings of meaning

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.880
in our lives, from all
these various ways?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.260
And I'll just give an example.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.900
When Paul was becoming
more and more ill

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.360
and having unexplained
symptoms when he was 36,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.545
he started losing weight.

00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:04.510
He started having terrible back
pain, and then night sweats

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.050
and chest pain and
a cough, and had

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.380
been working with his
doctor to figure out why.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.125
And then he got a chest x-ray.

00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:13.940
It had nodules on it.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.280
And maybe it was
tuberculosis and most likely

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.460
it was metastatic cancer.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.580
And both of us knew that.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.700
And we were on our way
to Stanford Hospital

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.320
because he was admitted to the
hospital for expedited work

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.370
up of what's causing these
symptoms and the x-ray problem.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.850
And he packed three
books, actually,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.600
to take with him
to the hospital.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.804
And I was packing all the junk
like fuzzy socks and a health

00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:41.970
insurance card and whatever.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.553
And he's got this stack of books
that he's carrying with them.

00:09:44.553 --> 00:09:48.800
And the books were "Mere
Christianity" by CS Lewis,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.270
and a novel by
Solzhenitsyn, "Cancer Ward,"

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.680
and "Being in
Time" by Heidegger,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.020
which I don't know how you
concentrate on that book

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.561
when you're feeling well, let
alone when you're feeling sick.

00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:01.450
But it was this stack of
literature and religion

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.220
and philosophy.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.120
And they were sort of
like a little amulet.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.000
Like, I'm not taking
a medical text.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.250
I'm taking literature and books.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.827
So I think if you think
about literature or science

00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:17.410
or philosophy, they're all sort
of aiming at this question of,

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.620
who are we as humans?

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.722
What are we doing here?

00:10:19.722 --> 00:10:20.680
What do our lives mean?

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.070
And I think he sort of
understood that all of those

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.010
are paths to answering these
bigger questions that are not

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.580
just technical, but sort of rich
and in many ways unanswerable.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:38.980
So I guess maybe that's
what I would say about that.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.770
And also, I think Paul
had been interested

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.990
in this question
of human suffering

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.250
and wrapping his head around
mortality and suffering.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.319
So I think when he himself
became ill, being a physician

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:53.610
and being a reader, he had
a language to talk about it,

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.109
right?

00:10:54.109 --> 00:10:57.140
I mean, reading
deepens our empathy.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.780
That's part of why we
read is to experience

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.170
lives that are not our own.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.880
So he was able to
sort of fall back

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.170
on those tools when
he became sick.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.650
And I think he says this
lovely thing in his writing

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.320
where he says, I
didn't ask, why me?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.150
The answer to the question would
have been, well, why not me?

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.860
And I think he sort
of had that approach

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.120
to thinking about suffering.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.870
And it helped him
when he became ill.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.680
And some of that came
from practicing medicine

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.869
and some came from literature.

00:11:27.869 --> 00:11:29.410
SPEAKER: In fact,
in the book there's

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.000
this passage where he
describes first seeing

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.640
the CT scans [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.730
And actually, my next
question is around that.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.165
Lucy, if I could ask
you to read that for us.

00:11:42.165 --> 00:11:43.040
LUCY KALANITHI: Sure.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.636
So this is from the
prologue to the book.

00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:49.420
"Lying next to Lucy
in the hospital bed,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.080
both of us crying, the CT
scan images still glowing

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.430
on the computer
screen, that identity

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.830
as a physician, my identity,
no longer mattered.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.400
With the cancer having invaded
multiple organ systems,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.990
the diagnosis was clear.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.210
The room was quiet.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.450
Lucy told me she loved me. 'I
don't want to die,' I said.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.520
I told her to remarry,
that I couldn't bear

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.080
the thought of her being alone.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.430
I told her we should refinance
the mortgage immediately."

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.690
SPEAKER: So he gets
this devastating news

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.460
and begins talking to you
about securing your future,

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.170
refinancing the mortgage.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.090
What was it about Paul that
kept him so action-oriented, so

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.210
ambitious, as you said?

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.580
And this is a recurring
theme of striving

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.566
that comes across so
many times in the book.

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:35.440
I wonder if you could
elaborate on that.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.315
LUCY KALANITHI: Sure.

00:12:36.315 --> 00:12:37.162
Yeah.

00:12:37.162 --> 00:12:38.370
And it's kind of interesting.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.750
So literally, one of
the first things he said

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.200
was, I want you to remarry.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.150
And often you think
about with cancer,

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.480
or even what kept him
so action-oriented,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.000
the obvious action when you
have a diagnosis like this

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.050
is like, we'll beat it.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.820
We'll fight it.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.290
We'll find the best doctor.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.610
We'll beat this.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.530
And in a way, that sentence
of "I want you to remarry"

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:06.480
is an immediate recognition of
I likely will not survive this.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.760
And both of us knew that.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.440
And so part of Paul's striving
during that time was he

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.130
faced what was actually
happening to his body.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.300
He understood the fact that
his identity and his career

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.280
trajectory, like 20 years as a
neurosurgeon or neuroscientist,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.750
or 30 years, maybe write a book.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.590
All of that just shattered.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.190
And so in this moment
and henceforth, striving

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.417
was reshaping a new identity,
which initially was going back

00:13:36.417 --> 00:13:37.500
to work as a neurosurgeon.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.790
And then, frankly, "When
Breath Becomes Air"

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.850
became the reshaping
of his identity

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.590
and the ultimate purpose of
his life and was sustaining.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:50.220
Even as his body was collapsing
and he became more isolated

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.910
and was at home and
frail, the writing

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.260
was sort of a way to continue
to stay connected to others

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.580
and to feel like he had a
future, even if he wouldn't

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.320
be alive.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.400
It was this really interesting.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.400
And having a child actually
meant some of the same things.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.830
And one of Paul's
friends said recently, I

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.240
think that Paul
felt this struggle

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.390
to find meaning in our lives
is there meaning in our lives.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.240
And so the fact of striving was
extremely meaningful to him.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.830
And I'm supposed to
teach our daughter

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.740
about that, which is something
we all teach our kids, right?

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.570
It's like it's important
to strive, to do your best,

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.000
and to be a good person.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.260
You can't do it all the
time, but it's important.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.440
SPEAKER: What really touched me
in reading that was on the one

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.360
hand here, he is very
pragmatic, recognizing

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.920
the vulnerability of himself.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.580
And at the same time,
he's not giving up either.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.190
I mean, there is this
huge sense of just going

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.694
on despite all the hard--

00:14:54.694 --> 00:14:55.610
LUCY KALANITHI: Right.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.776
Until you die, you're alive.

00:14:56.776 --> 00:14:57.590
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.960
And he wrote years
ago-- and maybe

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.610
we could just pick
up that thread.

00:15:07.044 --> 00:15:08.710
LUCY KALANITHI: Should
I read this part?

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.584
SPEAKER: Yes, please.

00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:13.750
LUCY KALANITHI: "Years
ago, it occurred to me

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.010
that Darwin and Nietzsche
agreed on one thing.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.659
The defining characteristic
of the organism is striving."

00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:21.200
And then this next
part skips around.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.460
And this is about
coping through reading.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.520
"I began reading literature
again-- Solzhenitsin's "Cancer

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.100
Ward," BS Johnson's
"The Unfortunates,"

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.300
Tolstoy's "Ivan Ilyich,"
Nagel's "Mind and Cosmos,"

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.280
Wolf, Kafka, Montaigne, Frost,
Gravel, memoirs of cancer

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.820
patients, anything by
anyone who had ever

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.670
written about mortality.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.990
I remember the moment when my
overwhelming unease yielded,

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.600
when that seemingly impassable
sea of uncertainty parted.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.450
I woke up in pain,
facing another day.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.550
No project beyond
breakfast seems tenable.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.840
I can't go on, I thought.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.600
And immediately, its
antiphone responded,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.930
completing Samuel
Beckett's seven words,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.950
words I had learned long
ago as an undergraduate.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.430
I'll go on.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.950
I got out of bed and
took a step forward,

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.500
repeating the phrase
over and over.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.385
I can't go on.

00:16:13.385 --> 00:16:15.910
I will go on."

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.180
SPEAKER: So this is the exact
opposite of just giving up

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.060
is being very realistic and
yet very, very powerful.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.120
And you know, striving
and progress, I think,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.010
has been a constant theme
in reading the book.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.320
And there's a video
that I watched

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.570
where he says that
just as the clock logs

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.490
on hours, as the clock of
our lives logs on more hours,

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.530
there should be a
measurable increase

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.790
in some sort of progress.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.600
Can you maybe talk
about that idea

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.780
and how that drove
how he did things?

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.060
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.250
I guess maybe I'll reflect
on what Paul was writing

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.380
about and talking about.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.510
He said this interesting
thing in an interview.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.800
Because he wrote some
of that that I just read

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.500
ended up in a New York
Times little essay

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.778
that he wrote that was super
serendipitous that it even

00:17:13.778 --> 00:17:15.069
ended up in the New York Times.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.074
And then that led to
his securing a book deal

00:17:18.074 --> 00:17:18.990
and writing this book.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.156
SPEAKER: And there was a
story about how it actually

00:17:21.156 --> 00:17:22.050
got into the--

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:22.619
LUCY KALANITHI: Oh yeah.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.535
Do you want me to just
tell that really quick?

00:17:24.535 --> 00:17:26.420
And then I'll go back
to the time thing.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.610
So Paul was on an airplane
after having returned

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.760
to work as a neurosurgery
resident for about a year

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.730
while he was healthy
enough to do that.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.720
And he wrote an essay
that ultimately ended up

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.580
being entitled, "How
Long Have I Got Left?"

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.910
And it was about how even
when you know you're dying,

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.260
the uncertainty about how
much time you have left

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:49.250
or how it will happen itself
is its own type of pain.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.420
Uncertainty is just hard to
tolerate in general, I think.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.210
And everybody can
relate to that.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.410
So he wrote an essay about that.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:01.870
And he sent it to two people,
a family member and then

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.420
Robin Moroney, the Google
guy, who's a writer.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:09.030
And Robin wrote back and
said, you buried your lede.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.079
You're funnier
than this essay is.

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:13.120
And you're kind of making
three different points.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.960
And I don't know.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.124
And the family member
wrote back and said,

00:18:18.124 --> 00:18:20.540
I forwarded this directly to
the oped desk at the New York

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.300
Times.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.090
I hope that's OK.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.920
And it's crazy because then
it was published, which Paul

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.785
was exceedingly excited about.

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:31.910
He started getting emails
from patients and doctors

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.970
and felt really good about that.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:40.640
And got a literary agent in
the process, who has since

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.810
told me one path to being
able to write a book

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.080
is to get a shorter
essay published somewhere

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.750
and demonstrate
a response to it.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.610
And that's FYI, if anybody
here is trying to write a book.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.120
And so Robin Moroney
can eat his words.

00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:02.890
What was I going
to say about that?

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:03.600
That's the story.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.620
I can't remember the link
back to the time thing.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.110
But I'll just say
briefly about time.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:17.770
Paul said time used to have this
linear progression feel to it.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.400
And now, while dying, time
feels more like a space.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.650
And that's really interesting.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.560
And I think I've talked
to a number of people

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.480
about the experiences
of aging and dying.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.900
And I've had older
or elderly people

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.720
relate to that sense
of the change of time--

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.220
less linear, more like a space.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.210
And goals change
over time, right?

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:41.250
So we all think, and I think,
about my life projected

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.470
literally over decades.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.350
And there's a lot of sort
of future-oriented thinking.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:49.130
And then that changes as you get
closer to the end of your life.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.440
And in a way, it's
not better or worse.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.190
It's just a shift.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.460
I was just listening to
this podcast with Paul

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.560
as I was driving over.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.090
Because if I'm going to talk
about Paul, sometimes I'm like,

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.310
I want to hear his voice.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.310
Or if I just miss him, I
want to hear his voice.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.860
And he was talking about how
he was at his 15 year Stanford

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.360
reunion.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.000
He graduated from
Stanford in '99

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.950
and just had the reunion
the year before he died.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.470
And somebody said,
oh, it's going

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.500
to be fun to be at the 30th
and see how everybody's doing.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.210
And Paul was like, it'd probably
be kind of rude to say, well,

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.010
I probably won't
see you at the 30th.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.820
And he was asked, isn't that
strange and painful to think,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.911
you're not going to be
at the 30th reunion?

00:20:30.911 --> 00:20:32.410
And he said, well,
at certain times,

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.900
I just sort of conceive of
it as like a fact of life.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.490
It's not any more painful
than if someone said, well,

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.630
I'll see you at
the 150th reunion.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.300
And any of us here would be
like, well, no you won't.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.810
It's not distressing
in the same way, right?

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.334
It's more like if
you've conceptualized

00:20:48.334 --> 00:20:49.750
that it's unfair
that you wouldn't

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.735
be at the 30th or the 150th.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:59.630
And I think that that tendency
about thinking about time

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.285
is just really the
difference between how

00:21:03.285 --> 00:21:04.660
are you conceiving
of your future

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.118
and what actions
are you taking now

00:21:06.118 --> 00:21:08.785
that lead to a future,
versus are focused more

00:21:08.785 --> 00:21:09.410
on the present.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.750
And one little
side bit about that

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.580
is there's all this research
about mindfulness meditation

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.460
or mindfulness.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.130
And I don't know if Google gives
you guys courses on mindfulness

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.630
and stuff.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.020
It's helped me cope
a lot, actually.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:33.000
And one of the things
is sort of this frame

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.282
of acceptance or non-judgment.

00:21:34.282 --> 00:21:36.490
And some of it is about
being in the moment, focusing

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.900
on the present moment.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.020
And there's all this research
about how that's good for you.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.990
And I think when
you're terminally ill

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.390
or when you know your
loved one will die,

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.110
you are focused
more on the moment.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.650
And even for us
having a child, we

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.690
decided to have a child
after Paul got sick.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.120
And then she died when
he was eight months old.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.050
And I think even when
you have a young infant,

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.802
oftentimes you're
wishing away time.

00:21:57.802 --> 00:21:59.760
Like, I wish she would
sleep through the night.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.426
I wish this period
of infancy were over.

00:22:01.426 --> 00:22:03.890
I Can't wait till
she's 5 or 10 or 20.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:08.390
And I think, given that Paul's
life expectancy was so short,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.240
the experience of having
an infant and those moments

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.880
were actually really wonderful.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.000
So now I think a lot more about
the future and the present

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.115
or the ways of
conceiving about time.

00:22:20.115 --> 00:22:22.850
It sort of takes some of the
pressure off in a good way,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:27.650
or reframes what you think
life or illness means.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.290
SPEAKER: I was also asking
you, when you sign books,

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.900
you write "Shantih
shantih shantih."

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.465
Can you share with us
what inspires that?

00:22:36.465 --> 00:22:37.340
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.840
So after Paul died and
I told Random House

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.782
I'll do a book tour.

00:22:42.782 --> 00:22:44.240
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.240
And I didn't know if
I would like doing it.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.230
I was like, I'm going
to promote the book

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.160
and keep this promise to Paul.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.740
And I did end up liking
doing it for him.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.757
And then they told me I
was going to sign books.

00:22:55.757 --> 00:22:57.590
And I was like, I'm
going to sign the books?

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.660
And then they said,
think of an inscription.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.190
Apparently Oprah
writes, "Blessings.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.252
Oprah."

00:23:03.252 --> 00:23:04.710
And one of Paul's
friends was like,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.376
well, you should just
write, "Blessings.

00:23:06.376 --> 00:23:07.770
Oprah."

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.620
I'm going to have to
think of my own thing.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.560
And so then I sort
of had this brainwave

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.810
and decided to write, "Shantih
shantih shantih," which

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.790
is the last line of the
poem "The Wasteland,"

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:24.110
which I literally bought the
cliff notes for after Paul

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.150
died because I wanted to
sort of dig into that poem.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.577
It's pretty obscure
in some places.

00:23:29.577 --> 00:23:30.660
It's about life and death.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.450
And it's kind of funny at times.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.980
But the last line is
"Shantih shantih shantih."

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.040
TS Eliot writes it
with no punctuation,

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.880
just sort of leaves
it as a send off.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.505
It just sort of hangs
there at the end.

00:23:41.505 --> 00:23:45.215
And "shantih" is a Sanskrit word
that essentially means peace.

00:23:45.215 --> 00:23:47.590
Like at the end of yoga classes,
people say "om shanthi."

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:48.730
And it's that word.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:53.300
And TS Eliot transliterates it
and spells it S-H-A-N-T-I-H,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.020
which is sort of
a weird spelling.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.270
Oftentimes it's
transliterated T-H-I or T-I.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.610
And he himself
sort of translated

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.920
it to mean the
peace that passeth

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.780
all understanding, which
is actually a Bible verse.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.380
It's sort of like this
interfaith version

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.090
when Eliot translates it.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:23.530
And I sort of think of it as
like a blessing and a sendoff,

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.500
and then a literary
reference in honor of Paul,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.670
and almost like a
little description

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:32.520
because Paul inspired me sort of
with his calm or with his peace

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.046
despite great suffering.

00:24:34.046 --> 00:24:35.670
And you know, he
wasn't a perfect dude.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.940
He was also a normal person,
and funny, and complicated.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.920
But he was brave.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:45.480
And so it's like a
secret message to him,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.330
and then kind of a
blessing to the person

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.580
that I'm signing the book for.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.710
So it's the end of that
poem "The Wasteland."

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.590
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.381
Thanks for sharing.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.460
There was part, going
through illness,

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.830
where Paul describes how it's
a process and not a one time

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.980
event, unlike death.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.160
And there was a lot of decisions
that came along the way.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.000
Having a child was one of them.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.730
But before we get to
that, there was this part

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.260
about him being able to continue
his practice as a doctor

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.490
or not.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.420
And I was wondering
whether you could

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.747
share how you guys thought
about that as this was going on.

00:25:23.747 --> 00:25:25.830
And there's a couple of
lines that I have selected

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.969
from that part of the-- thanks.

00:25:28.969 --> 00:25:30.010
LUCY KALANITHI: This one?

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.551
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:25:30.551 --> 00:25:31.620
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.810
"Graduation from residency
required two things."

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.194
And this is after he gets
sick and he goes back to work.

00:25:39.194 --> 00:25:41.960
"Meeting a set of national
and local requirements, which

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.180
I've already done, and the
blessing of the faculty."

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.150
And then briefly
in between here,

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:52.370
he talks about how he runs
into a fellow resident

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.910
or young faculty who says they
may not actually graduate you.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.260
And he says, " 'What?

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.640
I don't mean to sound cocky,
but I'm a good surgeon.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.542
Just as good as--' 'I know.

00:26:01.542 --> 00:26:03.750
I think they probably just
want to see you performing

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.020
the full load of a chief.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.330
It's because they
like you, seriously.'

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.690
I realized it was true.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.870
For the past few months,
I'd been acting merely

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.310
as a surgical technician.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.650
I had been using
cancer as an excuse

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.520
not to take full
responsibility for my patients.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.660
On the other hand, it was
a good excuse, dammit.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.580
But now I started coming
in earlier, staying later,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.530
fully caring for the patients
again, adding another four

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.090
hours to a 12-hour day."

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.350
It's pretty rigorous, right?

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.975
You're like, Stanford,
cut him a break.

00:26:31.975 --> 00:26:36.620
But then this is the important
thing about being a doctor.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.870
It's not just a technical job.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.750
It's connecting
with those patients

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.890
and taking full responsibility
for every aspect

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.010
of their well-being.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.280
SPEAKER: Despite what you
were going through yourself.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:49.660
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.090
I mean, it's one of the
tensions about being a doctor.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.070
It's like the best and worst
part because it's stress on you

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.919
too, emotionally and physically.

00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:58.460
Yeah, that's what
he's talking about.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.990
SPEAKER: Did you think
that was helpful for him

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.850
in a certain way, even though
it was taxing on him physically,

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.570
as he mentions in the book?

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.184
LUCY KALANITHI: Yes, for sure.

00:27:09.184 --> 00:27:11.100
He kind of surprised me
by going back to work.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.410
It didn't surprise me because
I knew his personality.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.700
But I think a lot of people,
if you were given months

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.740
to a few years to live, and
maybe the outside possibility

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.680
of a decade, many people
would quit their jobs.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.000
I certainly would not fault
somebody for doing that.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I might do that.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.036
But he really wanted
to go back to work,

00:27:32.036 --> 00:27:33.910
and initially didn't
think he could, and did.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.340
It was very important
to his identity.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.970
It was what he'd
been training for.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.550
It was a very
considered decision

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:45.220
to leave the humanities
and enter medicine and then

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.550
neurosurgery.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:51.070
And so initially, or always,
he got this really deep meaning

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.420
from taking care of patients.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.350
Later, writing the manuscript
for "When Breath Becomes Air,"

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.300
was another way to
feel like an expert

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.450
or to feel like he was
helping people or even

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.300
healing people in a
completely different way.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.140
So that ended up
being the case later.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.644
I did a book reading
recently and one

00:28:12.644 --> 00:28:14.060
of the questions
from the audience

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:18.790
was Paul, when he went
back to work as a surgeon,

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:20.980
was having really
excruciating back pain

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.522
and he felt dizzy in the
operating room at one point.

00:28:23.522 --> 00:28:24.980
And there were all
these safeguards

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.940
to keep his patients safe.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.940
That was obviously
the first priority

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.680
was that he could sufficiently
act as a doctor, even though he

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.520
himself was ill.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.045
But somebody said, do you
think he put more wear

00:28:37.045 --> 00:28:37.920
and tear on his body?

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.760
Do you think he died sooner
because he went back to work

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.110
and was not sleeping as
much, working so hard?

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.580
And I was like,
well, I can't think

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.570
of a mechanism by which
working as a neurosurgeon would

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.180
make your chemo drug fail.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.500
So I don't really think so.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.750
And I was sort of like, whoa,
that's a ballsy question

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.040
to ask me to my face.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.640
But at the same time, it was a
really good question, actually.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.110
And I was reflecting on it.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.610
And I was like, well, I wonder.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.000
And if I think Paul
could have even chosen,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.400
I think it gets to this
question of the quality

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.570
of your life versus the
quantity of your life.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.560
And I think, especially
when you're ill,

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.800
it's fair and brave
and good to also think

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.130
about the quality of your life.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:26.250
And so I think about him
taking on that burden

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.072
was actually him taking
on meaning and identity.

00:29:29.072 --> 00:29:30.530
And something that
he really wanted

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:35.370
was to keep being a physician
despite his illness.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.210
And it ended up
working for a while.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.840
So I think it added deeply
to the quality of his life

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.690
during that time that
he could still work.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.800
SPEAKER: I think you
also refer to the same--

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.870
in talking about life support
and being on a ventilator,

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:56.290
the duration is not necessarily
synonymous with quality

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.560
of how much time you have."

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:57.810
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:58.540
Right.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.554
And there's that narrative
of the battle, right?

00:30:00.554 --> 00:30:02.470
Like beat it, fight it,
live every millisecond

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.310
that you could.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.180
But there's a set of
tradeoffs, especially

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.780
as treatments get harder to
stand or less likely to work.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.694
And so at the very
end of Paul's life,

00:30:10.694 --> 00:30:12.110
as you know-- and
I wrote about it

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.930
in the epilogue to the book--
he became very ill very fast

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.490
and came up against a
decision about whether to be

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.880
put on a ventilator,
on a breathing machine,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.660
and chose not to be.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.300
He had knowledge as a
physician that it would likely

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.750
extend maybe the duration of
his life by hours to days.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:35.350
But if he couldn't interact
or go home or write or hold

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:39.210
our child, or ever come off
that breathing machine, which

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.030
was the most likely,
then it wasn't for him.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.340
So he decided not to do it.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.240
And instead, our baby came
into the hospital room.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.200
And the gears totally
shifted completely

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.530
to quality and not quantity.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:55.480
And I only remember
that day or those hours

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.350
almost as a series of
images, like snapshots

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.370
in my mind, because it
was so painful and so

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.820
intense to know that that
was the last day of his life,

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:09.480
and to be holding him in the
bed and knowing he's right here.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.582
And then he went to sleep.

00:31:10.582 --> 00:31:12.040
And then he died
a few hours later.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.520
And it's like, he's right here.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.670
And then he's like literally
about to disappear.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.820
It was so intense.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.050
And that decision making
was so hard and painful,

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:25.030
and even confusing, to
weigh the tradeoffs.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.530
But I think that's one of our
great challenges in medicine

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:31.040
is to be able to help people,
or within our families,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.690
be able to weigh the tradeoffs.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:36.480
Because it's not
as simple as always

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.300
throw all technology
at the issue.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.041
It's like, what makes
sense to you as a person?

00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:42.790
And I think he made a
really brave choice.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.000
And I think it was the
right choice for him.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.780
But it's really
hard in the moment

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:55.457
to know and to make
choices like that.

00:31:55.457 --> 00:31:57.040
SPEAKER: I think by
sharing it I mean,

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.930
you guys have done
a great service

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.660
to a lot of other people who
are in similar situations.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.800
And they feel that there is
a sense of empathy coming

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.810
towards us because
there's other people who

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.610
are going through the same.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.910
And in fact, Paul,
in the book, shared

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.230
a really personal decision,
which you referred to,

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.830
deciding to have a baby.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:24.190
And I was wondering if you
could share with the audience

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.430
a little bit about how
you guys thought about it.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:29.455
Because I think it's a
beautiful line that he writes.

00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:30.330
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.350
Can I just answer part
of the question first?

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.960
So this was, obviously, one of
the other hardest decisions.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.170
We had always
thought that we would

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.629
have a child toward the end
of Paul's residency training,

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:46.170
which would have
been that same year.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.490
Or try to have a child.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.969
You can never predict.

00:32:49.969 --> 00:32:52.010
And we'd also been going
through this rough patch

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.810
in our marriage that I
mentioned and he mentioned.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.580
And then he was
diagnosed with cancer.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.370
And everything sort
of came to a head.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.882
And then we started
talking about,

00:33:01.882 --> 00:33:03.340
how are we going
to cope with this?

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.120
And would we ever consider
having a child still?

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.660
Which was kind of a crazy
decision in some ways.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.360
And both of us knew
that he would likely

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:21.170
die during the child's infancy
or young childhood, which

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.910
is a big challenge for me, and
a big challenge for our family

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.420
and for him and for
our daughter, who

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.600
ended up being born in 2014.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.630
Each of us was worried
about the other one.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:39.410
I'll just read the part
about this conversation.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.550
"'What are you most afraid of
or sad about,' Lucy asked me one

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.265
night as we were lying in bed.

00:33:44.265 --> 00:33:46.390
'Leaving you,' I told her.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.720
I knew a child would bring
joy to the whole family,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.290
and I couldn't bear to picture
Lucy husbandless and childless

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.510
after I died.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.920
But I was adamant that the
decision ultimately be hers.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.120
She would likely have to
raise the child on her own,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.710
after all, and care for both
of us as my illness progressed.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.170
'Will having a newborn
distract from the time we have

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.159
together?' she asked. 'Don't
you think saying goodbye

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.980
to your child will
make your death more

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.090
painful?' 'Wouldn't it be
great if it did?' I said."

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:16.870
And I love it.

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.620
I think, "Wouldn't it
be great if it did,"

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:24.270
I think, is recognizing that
the joy and suffering, both

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.060
of those, would be greatly
deepened by the experience

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.620
of having a child and then
needing to leave that child.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:36.310
But sort of accepting both of
those as a rich part of life

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.080
is what he's getting at.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.120
So she just turned two.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.909
Her name's Cady.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.550
She's doing very well.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.600
We have this huge,
supportive family.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.230
And it's on me, I
think, to help her

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.710
understand where she came from
and help shape the narrative

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.580
of her life going forward.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:54.070
And she's really thriving.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.239
And I'm so happy
we had that child.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.430
And I remember at
the time, I was

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.600
worried about inviting
additional uncertainty

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.550
and pain.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.280
Nobody has a child because
it's going to be easy.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.390
You have it, hopefully, because
it's going to be meaningful

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.640
and you feel ready to do that.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.740
And so I sort of had to
picture, how does that

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.200
fit into our lives now?

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.420
And I read a book at that time
called "Far From the Tree"

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.171
by Andrew Solomon.

00:35:18.171 --> 00:35:19.961
I don't know if anybody
has read that book.

00:35:19.961 --> 00:35:20.580
It's amazing.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.810
It's long and dense.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.837
But Andrew Solomon,
the writer, is--

00:35:25.837 --> 00:35:27.670
this is going off on a
tangent a little bit.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.170
Is that OK?

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.211
SPEAKER: Yeah, of course.

00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:30.720
It's about parents and kids.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.180
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.346
It's about parents and kids.

00:35:32.346 --> 00:35:34.250
And Andrew Solomon
is gay and dyslexic.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:38.430
And his mother was extremely
supportive with his learning

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.920
disability and less
accepting of his being gay.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.150
And he writes that it
led him to conceive

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.760
of this idea of horizontal
and vertical identities

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.870
and the way in which your
identity can be shaped

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:53.170
by your family, or the way
in which you have identities

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.190
that you need to seek
connection and support

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.370
outside your family.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.830
And so he writes these
various chapters on autism,

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.940
different types of
disability, children

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.660
who are born out of rape,
children who are criminals.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.690
He interviews Dylan
Klebold's mom.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:07.970
And it's really intense.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.844
And it's all these versions
of strife within a family

00:36:11.844 --> 00:36:13.510
and challenges for
parents and children.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:17.470
And the parents,
almost to a person say,

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.580
I would give anything to
spare my child suffering.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.560
But the degree of
resilience and meaning

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.250
that this has brought me
and my ability to cope,

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.570
and my child's ability
to thrive in our family,

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.430
is very clear to me.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:39.670
And it talks about how the love
families have for each other

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:44.790
and the sense of meaning that
people can get despite struggle

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.490
is really deep.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:47.940
And so it sort of
helped me understand

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:57.540
both the sort of profound
goodness of having a child,

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.180
and also the degree to which
struggle that comes from that

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.110
is OK.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:04.290
And it's part of life.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.670
And even when it's
extreme, families often

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.920
are able to cope.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.620
So it sort of
bolstered my ability

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.930
to think about doing that.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:18.020
And then I was really scared
of postpartum depression.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.740
My sister had really bad
postpartum depression twice.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.250
She's a blogger and has
shared that publicly.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.950
So we strategized a lot about
any way to help prevent that,

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:30.980
because that would have been an
emotional separation from Paul,

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.396
which would have--

00:37:32.396 --> 00:37:33.770
SPEAKER: You had
a ticking clock.

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:34.110
LUCY KALANITHI: Yeah.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.985
And it's like, if Paul
lives for eight months

00:37:35.985 --> 00:37:38.510
and I'm depressed
for three months,

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:42.160
I thought that would be really
painful because depression

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.550
is emotional isolation
from other people.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.780
And I think my ability
to take care of him

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.020
and connect with him if
that was compromised.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.340
So anyway, it was spooky.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.980
It was spooky.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.230
But I'm really glad we did it.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.200
SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.210
In fact, I'm going to jump
around a little bit myself

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:10.120
as well, because you wrote a
brilliant Op-Ed in the New York

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:16.700
Times entitled "My Marriage Did
Not End When I Became a Widow."

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.060
And you also describe
that grieving did not

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:26.490
signal-- it wasn't a static
phase beginning or ending.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.370
It's one phase of an ongoing.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.395
Could you maybe speak
to that a little bit?

00:38:31.395 --> 00:38:32.270
LUCY KALANITHI: Sure.

00:38:35.114 --> 00:38:36.780
And you're talking
about this last part?

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.870
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.720
LUCY KALANITHI: And just to
say grief was so hard for me.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.540
Obviously, I'm sure
anybody in this room

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.310
can relate if you've lost
a loved one close to you.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.830
And I developed horrendous
tingling in my hands

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.360
that for a while I had
catastrophic thoughts about

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.870
and was convinced I had a
disabling nerve disorder

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.707
and couldn't take care of Cady.

00:38:59.707 --> 00:39:02.040
It turned out that that was
a physical symptom of grief.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.640
And I was like,
wouldn't this be great

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.910
if it were a physical
symptom of grief?

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.911
But I have a disabling
nerve disorder the year

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.910
that Paul died, which
turned out not to be true.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:12.110
It just lifted.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.290
But Paul writes about how
his own mom had seizures

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.250
after her father died.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.575
I mean, it's immense.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.730
You know, it's like
the easiest times

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.460
for me are often
situations like this,

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.680
where I'm able to speak
and connect with people.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.700
And the hardest times are after
7:00 PM when Cady goes to bed

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.250
and I'm home alone.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.560
It's been very hard.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.001
But I wrote this essay that
ended up in the New York Times

00:39:41.001 --> 00:39:43.250
by the grace of Random House,
because Random House has

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:47.900
a whole machine once you
have a book with them.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.725
So the essay is called
"My Marriage Didn't

00:39:50.725 --> 00:39:51.850
End when I Became a Widow."

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.310
And it's about the
idea of feeling

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.810
like a relationship continues
or your love for somebody

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.360
continues even after they die.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.470
And it's based
somewhat on a piece

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.210
of writing by CS
Lewis in the book

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.720
"A Grief Observed," where
he says, "Bereavement is not

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.350
the truncation of married love.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.910
It's one of its regular
phases, like the honeymoon.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.730
What we want is to live our
marriage well and faithfully

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:16.479
through that phase too."

00:40:16.479 --> 00:40:17.770
And it really made sense to me.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.720
It's like even promoting
the book for Paul,

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.740
or making a memorial service,
or raising our daughter,

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.290
Paul is still a thread
in our lives, obviously.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.260
And I still feel
obligated to Paul

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:34.420
and just sort of serve
Paul's legacy too.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.230
So I wrote about that.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.680
And this is right
at the beginning

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.600
of that piece, where
it's describing

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.380
visiting Paul's grave.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.060
"When my husband died from
cancer last March at age 37,

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.820
I was so grief-stricken
I could barely sleep.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.200
One afternoon, I
visited his grave

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.860
in a field high
in the Santa Cruz

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.300
mountains overlooking
the Pacific Ocean

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.300
and lay on top of it.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.240
I slept more soundly
than I had in weeks.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.930
It wasn't the vista that
calmed my restless body.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.140
It was Paul, just
there under the earth.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.250
His body was so
easy to conjure--

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.420
limbs that had linked with
mine at night, soft hands

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.440
that I had grasped during the
birth of our daughter, eyes

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.300
that had remained piercing even
as cancer thinned his face.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.780
And yet he was
impossible to hold.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:27.930
I lay on the grass instead,
my cheek against the ground."

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:28.860
SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.440
So I actually, while
you were speaking,

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.390
realized that we kind of
lost track of time as well.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.330
But we still have a few minutes.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.170
And I want to open
this conversation up

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:43.000
to include the audience,
if you have any questions.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.380
LUCY KALANITHI: We have a
daughter who, her dad is Paul,

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.460
but she doesn't have any
of her own memory of Paul.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.110
So how will I help
shape her knowledge

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.370
of Paul, her memory of Paul?

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.660
So in a way, the book
"When Breath Becomes Air"

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.380
is a letter to her.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.072
People ask me whether Paul
wrote her letters or left

00:42:03.072 --> 00:42:04.780
a particular writing
specifically to her,

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.540
and he didn't.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.990
He was conceiving of
the book the whole way

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.480
through as a way to
communicate with her.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.000
And one of its greatest
stresses was not

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.150
to be able to complete it or
not to be able to leave behind

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:20.910
for her the manuscript to read.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:24.940
And the last paragraph of the
book is a love letter to her.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.080
And it's like my
prized possession.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.560
And I have it memorized, even
though I didn't even try.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:35.150
And that's a key message to her.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:39.880
And then I think there's
this whole network of people

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.640
who knew Paul and
loved Paul, especially

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.540
his brothers and
our sisters-in-law,

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.274
and friends and
family and pictures.

00:42:49.274 --> 00:42:50.690
And so I think all
of that sort of

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.600
exists to help her understand
who he was at whatever point

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.880
it is meaningful to
her to discover that.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.950
I think in a way, the
most painful thing

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.580
for me might be if she's
not interested in learning

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.172
about Paul, which maybe would
be true at various times

00:43:04.172 --> 00:43:05.880
in her life and
different at other times.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.930
And so in a way, it's
sort of up to her.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:09.760
But I want to help
her understand

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.480
where she came from too.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.610
She's not in any type of
pain from having lost Paul.

00:43:17.412 --> 00:43:19.527
But later, she'll be in
a different type of pain

00:43:19.527 --> 00:43:20.860
because she doesn't have memory.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.265
And her cousin, Eve, who is
Paul's brother's daughter,

00:43:25.265 --> 00:43:27.390
is the oldest cousin and
just started kindergarten.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:31.240
And she may remember Paul, or at
least have some images of Paul.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.590
And we have this great photo
of them drinking a mango

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.339
lassi with two straws.

00:43:35.339 --> 00:43:37.380
And I wonder whether Cady
will see those pictures

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:41.550
and feel envious if Eve even
has a small memory of Paul,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:45.530
or if Eve, her older
cousin, when she's

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.650
buying alcohol
for underage Cady,

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.630
will also be telling
her about Paul.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.790
So I think that
relationship with her family

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.189
is going to be important too.

00:43:56.189 --> 00:43:57.980
I keep saying stuff
like the word "ballsy."

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.950
That makes me be like, this
is going to go on YouTube.

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.140
I'm a doctor.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.051
But I think it's OK.

00:44:05.051 --> 00:44:05.634
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:44:05.634 --> 00:44:08.420
Yes?

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.680
LUCY KALANITHI:
It's pretty simple.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:16.020
I practice
mindfulness meditation

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.580
for a short period
of time each day.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.560
And I used to be like, I'm
not good at mindfulness.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.260
I keep figuring out I'm not
thinking about my breath

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.389
or whatever and having
to redirect my attention

00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:29.430
to the path of my breath.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.555
But I think there's
no such thing

00:44:31.555 --> 00:44:32.680
as being good at it or not.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:38.120
It's purely about noticing and
then redirecting your mind.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.030
And I started doing
it actually well

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.630
before Paul became ill when I
had an episode of depression

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:46.590
during my residency training
that was relatively mild.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:49.420
But it's actually quite
common during residency

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.260
when physicians are
new at their jobs

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.140
and under stress and
not sleeping very much.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.150
And so there's starting
to be more recognition

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.650
and support for that.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.870
But I had a
therapist at the time

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:03.990
who wrote down this thing on
her whiteboard in her office.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.350
She wrote, pain plus
non-acceptance of pain

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.440
equals suffering.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.712
And at the time I was like,
well, I don't accept this.

00:45:12.712 --> 00:45:14.140
This must not be.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.860
And then later I
realized what she

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.520
meant, which is the fact
of not accepting pain

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.580
that you can't change does
lead to increased suffering.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:26.460
And I think for me, mindfulness
has been helpful for that.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.990
I have a lot of
friends or colleagues

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:32.000
or patients who love
that app Headspace.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.610
I don't own stock
in them or anything.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.060
But there's an
app on your phone.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.360
And they help you track your
progress with meditation.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.300
And they have these
little, short meditations

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.050
you can listen to.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:42.966
I know people have a lot
of success with that.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.080
Obviously, it's based
in Buddhist practice,

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.680
which I don't really
know anything about.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.890
But I think it has a lot of
those sort of little snippets

00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:01.020
of it have really resonated
with me and helped me cope

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.700
and, I think, made me
more resilient because I

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:10.530
don't resist suffering that I
can't change in the same way.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.015
But it's an ongoing,
daily process.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.130
Oh.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:19.210
Do I plan to write more?

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.752
Maybe.

00:46:20.752 --> 00:46:21.460
I don't know yet.

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.840
I find writing to
be a real struggle.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.590
I thought I would be
more nervous to speak.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.599
But I actually am
doing OK speaking

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:30.640
and feel good doing that.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.330
I'm giving a talk at
Ted Med in December,

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:38.630
which is one of the first
talks that I have to deliver.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:41.630
And it's a different thing,
actually, to figure out,

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.560
rather than just talking
about a personal experience

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.640
with some sideswipes at
what the deeper thesis is,

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.330
to think about how to present a
message and what kind of thing

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:54.760
I want to actually
be contributing

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:59.400
to a conversation about
particularly health care.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.680
So I think that's kind
of an exciting next step

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.099
for me is to think about that.

00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:06.890
And one thing that I'm
really interested in

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.790
is getting back to that
question of grappling

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:11.419
with difficult
decisions in medicine.

00:47:11.419 --> 00:47:12.960
How do we communicate
with each other

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.740
about what's actually
happening, and how

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.670
to weigh the tradeoffs
when we really

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:21.140
wish we could beat an illness
but we may not be able to.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.880
So maybe you are
right about that.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.180
I don't know.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.900
It's kind of an exciting
and strange time

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.490
to have a role in medicine,
or even in the public sphere.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.540
That's way different from what
I ever thought I would have.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.950
And it's based on Paul's
leadership in that way

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:43.130
to connect a personal experience
to a bigger picture question.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.960
So I don't know.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.011
But thank you.

00:47:46.011 --> 00:47:46.510
Yeah.

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:47.040
Thank you.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.550
Yeah.

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:48.850
I'd love to.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:52.580
So getting at that
question of medical culture

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.352
and how we have those
conversations and balance

00:47:55.352 --> 00:47:56.560
quality and quantity of life.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.430
And I know Atul Gawande
was here to speak.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.159
And his book "Being
Mortal," and his work since,

00:48:01.159 --> 00:48:03.450
testifying in front of the
Senate and all these things,

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:07.730
is all about, how do we
understand that people have

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.765
other goals for their lives,
rather than just safety

00:48:10.765 --> 00:48:11.640
and quantity of life?

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.962
And I think we have
all this technology.

00:48:13.962 --> 00:48:15.670
In medical culture
and in medical school,

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:18.210
you're often taught,
we get to fix things.

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.210
And we get to use all
these technological tools.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.630
And then the key is the
wisdom of how to do that.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:25.030
And I think we'll start
incorporating a more

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:28.151
ancient narrative too,
with our modern tools.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.230
And then there are all
these other-- you're right.

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:34.580
Doctors listen to doctors.

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.830
So it's good to be
able to talk about that

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.140
in medical schools and medical
conferences and settings.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:43.630
And there are tools for
doctors, too, like Vital Talk.

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.660
Or Atul Gawande
has a lab in Boston

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.310
that puts out
trainings for doctors.

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:51.130
And then for patients
and families,

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:53.290
there are really good tools too.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:57.950
I'm blanking on the
specific name of it.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:59.480
There's one called the
Conversation Project,

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.230
I think it's called,
that's really good.

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.980
And there are a number
of different books,

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:08.102
like "The Conversation" by
another doctor in Boston.

00:49:08.102 --> 00:49:10.560
It's funny those both have the
word "conversation" in them.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.060
But I think that's
one of the keys.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:13.930
Angelo Volandes.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.430
That's who wrote
"The Conversation."

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:16.180
SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:16.971
LUCY KALANITHI: Oh.

00:49:16.971 --> 00:49:20.078
How do I reconcile my love for
Paul with having to move on?

00:49:20.078 --> 00:49:20.578
Yeah.

00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:24.710
I don't know the answer to that.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.939
I mean, I think part
of it is that I didn't

00:49:26.939 --> 00:49:29.480
know that I would have all these
positive feelings about Paul

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.240
that would stretch forward,
like loving him or feeling

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:31.781
proud of him.

00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:35.340
I think I thought I would just
feel devastated and lonely

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.570
and deflated.

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:39.150
And instead it's like,
I feel this other way.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:40.720
I still feel good about Paul.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:51.450
I think the idea of
moving on or moving past,

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:54.970
I think that idea of living
with something makes sense to me

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.566
too.

00:49:56.566 --> 00:49:59.160
I hope I remarry in the
future, like Paul said.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:03.330
But I think I'll love Paul
at the same time as well.

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.080
And I actually
just met somebody.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.280
You guys probably
remember Brittany Maynard,

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.617
who was a young woman
with a high grade brain

00:50:09.617 --> 00:50:11.450
tumor who lived in
California and then moved

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:16.290
to Oregon to seek medical aid in
dying if that became necessary

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:20.980
for her, if her suffering and
dying, if enough was enough.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.030
And she ended up
dying after ingesting

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:25.690
a medical aid in
dying medication

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:29.260
and becoming a big advocate
for Death With Dignity.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.540
And her husband, Dan Diaz, has
continued to speak and testify

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.024
in front of state legislatures.

00:50:35.024 --> 00:50:36.190
And I met him the other day.

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.940
Someone was like, you
should meet this guy

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.790
and talk about grieving
publicly and being

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:42.640
propelled by your love
for your late spouse.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:46.150
And I was like, that is sort of
a weird, singular experience.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:48.310
And so we hit it off,
talking about that

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:51.730
and doing work on behalf
of somebody who's not here.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:56.630
And so I think you do just
continue to honor that person

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.440
and then progress
forward in your life

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.330
and understand the ways in
which they've influenced you.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.830
And she said, actually,
in this beautiful video

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:06.840
about him remarrying.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.339
She said, there's
no part of me that

00:51:08.339 --> 00:51:10.381
doesn't want him to move
forward and be a father,

00:51:10.381 --> 00:51:12.464
and these things that they
couldn't have together.

00:51:12.464 --> 00:51:14.700
And I think it's like this
beautiful, generous thing

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.300
that you would say when
you're losing somebody.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:23.915
Or Paul and Brittany lost me
and lost Dan and lost the future

00:51:23.915 --> 00:51:25.290
that they would
have had with us.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:28.120
And so yeah.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.190
It's like, I can't go on.

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.127
I will go on.

00:51:30.127 --> 00:51:31.710
SPEAKER: Thank you
so much once again.

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:32.570
And thank you all
for being here.

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:34.111
LUCY KALANITHI:
Thanks for having me.

00:51:34.111 --> 00:51:35.620
[APPLAUSE]
