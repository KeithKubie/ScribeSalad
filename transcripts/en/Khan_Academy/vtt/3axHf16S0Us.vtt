00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.540
- So John, if I'm a student
studying American history

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.290
or U.S. government, why should I care?

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.320
- Well first, there are great stories.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.790
The characters in American
history, all the way through,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.723
are fascinating, just, human beings.

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:16.570
They would make great
movie characters, period:

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.500
heroes, villains, people
who rise to courage

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.950
when they were otherwise
pretty boring people.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.190
Look at Abraham Lincoln, for example.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.920
He failed miserably repeatedly,
repeatedly, repeatedly.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.140
Then he becomes the greatest President.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.540
And when he's almost at the end of his,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.030
well, he doesn't know
it's the end of his life,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.080
but later in life, after
he's had his greatness,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.660
he says, "I confess that I
was like a cork in a stream."

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.507
Well, if you're a regular
person and you think,

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.840
"My life feels kinda without a purpose,"

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.360
you can think, well, the
greatest President in America

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.880
felt like his life was
kind of bouncing around.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.970
And so, that is an
incredibly human connection

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.160
to greatness, and we all need connections

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.860
to greatness of whatever
kind to inspire us.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.350
Because the questions
today that America faces

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.360
about freedom and
liberty and what it means

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.440
to be an American, and how the power

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.550
is distributed throughout our governments

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.600
and our lives that affect us today

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.900
were discussed and talked
about and wrestled over

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.550
all throughout American history.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.570
And it is a continuing experiment.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.740
And when Thomas Jefferson wrote

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.047
the Declaration of Independence, he said,

00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:18.087
"This new country that we're creating

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:21.487
"has to constantly refresh,
each new generation

00:01:21.487 --> 00:01:23.007
"has to refresh their contact

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.727
"with the original ideals that
the country was founded on.

00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:27.620
"Otherwise, the country will fail."

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.510
And so, it's not only important to know

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.370
what's going on around
us by studying history,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.560
but it is, according to Thomas Jefferson,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.120
your duty to stay engaged
with the ideas of America

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.856
so that those ideas don't get lost

00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:42.453
in the kind of flurry and
craziness of a current moment.
