This section is on
problem based learning.

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.454
Problem based learning is a
constructionist learning strategy, where

00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:09.085
the learning process is really motivated
by some central organizing problem.

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:10.367
Now, when we say problem here,

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:13.465
we're not really talking about something
small like a little math problem.

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:16.795
We're talking about something a little
bit bigger and a little bit open ended.

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:20.565
So in ecology, we might have the problem
of figuring out why a certain species

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:24.335
went extinct or in medicine you may have
the problem of given some symptoms and

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:27.295
given some family history,
let's diagnose this patient.

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:31.490
So there are these central motivating
problems behind the learning process.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.330
The power of problem based learning is
that it really teaches students at two

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.390
different levels.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.900
On the one hand,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.540
it teaches them the content
knowledge that they need to know.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.220
To diagnose that disease, you would
need to know a list of diseases and

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.940
you would need to know which symptoms
correspond to which diseases.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.741
So there's content knowledge at play,
but

00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.220
problem based learning doesn't
just teach the content knowledge.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.100
It also teaches that content
knowledge in the context of how it

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.150
actually would be used
in the real world.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.260
So in the ecology example, it's one
thing to know the biological principles

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.190
and the genetics and things like
that that go into that organism.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.240
But its something else to understand
the overall idea of constructing

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.660
an explanation of what
happened in that system,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.600
evaluating that explanation against
evidence, and revising it accordingly.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.160
So the power of problem based learning
is it not only teaches students

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.730
content knowledge, but it teaches them
content knowledge in the context of how

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.890
it would be used out in the real world.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.790
And this is very motivating for
students as well, they get to see that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.580
if I went into a career in this,
this is actually what I would be doing.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120
This isn't just some material
that's been whitewashed to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.400
use in a classroom environment.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.180
This is actually what people do in
the real world when they work in

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.240
these fields.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.860
So it's a great way of
motivating learning and

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.230
it's also a great way of teaching.
