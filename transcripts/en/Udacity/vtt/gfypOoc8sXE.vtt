00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's test our knowledge of this notion of disjunction or choice or options

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in finite state machines.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here I've drawn a potentially familiar finite state machine,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and what I'd like you to do is check each box that corresponds to a string

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that is accepted by this finite state machine exactly and fully.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.606
FSM stands for finite state machine. Try it out.
