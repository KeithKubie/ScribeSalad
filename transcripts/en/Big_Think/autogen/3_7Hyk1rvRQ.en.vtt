within our market economy we think of us
 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.200

as having the ability to vote through

as having the ability to vote through
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.110

our dollars so it's one dollar one vote

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120
our dollars so it's one dollar one vote
 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.910
our dollars so it's one dollar one vote
but we've seen inequality in this

production worker it went from being
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.200
production worker it went from being
something like twenty four times the pay

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
something like twenty four times the pay

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
the voice of our working-class Americans
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.869
the voice of our working-class Americans
is no longer be is no longer being heard

is no longer be is no longer being heard
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.549

at the same level because they don't

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
at the same level because they don't
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.680
at the same level because they don't
have as much control within that economy

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
have as much control within that economy
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.810
have as much control within that economy
so they're looking to what we can think

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
so they're looking to what we can think
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.570
so they're looking to what we can think
of as another economy a separate place

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
of as another economy a separate place
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550

to hear their voice which is our ballot

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
to hear their voice which is our ballot
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.340
to hear their voice which is our ballot
economy and we've always believed that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
economy and we've always believed that
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289
economy and we've always believed that
our ballot economy represents one person

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
our ballot economy represents one person
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.520
our ballot economy represents one person
one vote

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
one vote
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.289
one vote
of course we're seeing changes in that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
of course we're seeing changes in that
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.950
of course we're seeing changes in that
too we have come to understand very

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
too we have come to understand very
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.510
too we have come to understand very
clearly the effects of gerrymandering

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
clearly the effects of gerrymandering
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.080
clearly the effects of gerrymandering
over the last several years we have seen

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
over the last several years we have seen
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.899
over the last several years we have seen
in this last election the impact of the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
in this last election the impact of the
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.210
in this last election the impact of the
electoral college and what that does to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
electoral college and what that does to
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.899
electoral college and what that does to
the voice of the majority and we also

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
the voice of the majority and we also
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.789
the voice of the majority and we also
understand that when you have two

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
understand that when you have two
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.859
understand that when you have two
senators from the state like Wyoming or

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
senators from the state like Wyoming or
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600
senators from the state like Wyoming or
from Vermont and two senators from

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
from Vermont and two senators from
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.690
from Vermont and two senators from
California that in fact we don't really

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
California that in fact we don't really
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.770
California that in fact we don't really
have one man one vote but we have enough

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
have one man one vote but we have enough
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469
have one man one vote but we have enough
equality within that system that we

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
equality within that system that we
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.420
equality within that system that we
actually will force to listen to the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
actually will force to listen to the
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370
actually will force to listen to the
voices of people who have felt

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
voices of people who have felt
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.580
voices of people who have felt
disenfranchised in our market economy so

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
disenfranchised in our market economy so
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.130
disenfranchised in our market economy so
what are these policies that have caused

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
what are these policies that have caused
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.330
what are these policies that have caused
people to react in this way well we can

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
people to react in this way well we can
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.889
people to react in this way well we can
think of just a few of them if we think

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
think of just a few of them if we think
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.839
think of just a few of them if we think
about finance immigration trade very

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
about finance immigration trade very
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.510
about finance immigration trade very
often we have been told by the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
often we have been told by the
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.610
often we have been told by the
establishment that immigration

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
establishment that immigration
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.250
establishment that immigration
represents a win-win for America the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
represents a win-win for America the
 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.649
represents a win-win for America the
trade represents a win-win for America

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659
trade represents a win-win for America
 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.350
trade represents a win-win for America
well let's go a little deeper into that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
well let's go a little deeper into that
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.869
well let's go a little deeper into that
is that really true as economists when

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879
is that really true as economists when
 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.210
is that really true as economists when
we think about welfare we're very

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
we think about welfare we're very
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.229
we think about welfare we're very
careful to think about ourselves as

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239
careful to think about ourselves as
 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.819
careful to think about ourselves as
technocrats so we don't want to decide

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829
technocrats so we don't want to decide
 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.490
technocrats so we don't want to decide
for a society what distribution within a

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
for a society what distribution within a
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.800
for a society what distribution within a
society should look like and so we have

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
society should look like and so we have
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.369
society should look like and so we have
this notion of welfare called Pareto

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379
this notion of welfare called Pareto
 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.039
this notion of welfare called Pareto
welfare and we think of something as a

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049
welfare and we think of something as a
 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.309
welfare and we think of something as a
Pareto improvement if you can make at

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319
Pareto improvement if you can make at
 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.680
Pareto improvement if you can make at
least one person better off by making

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690
least one person better off by making
 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.220
least one person better off by making
nobody worse off as you can imagine this

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
nobody worse off as you can imagine this
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.050
nobody worse off as you can imagine this
is somewhat difficult within a policy

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
is somewhat difficult within a policy
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.479
is somewhat difficult within a policy
context it's very hard to find a way to

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
context it's very hard to find a way to
 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.569
context it's very hard to find a way to
have any policies that make that have no

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579
have any policies that make that have no
 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.699
have any policies that make that have no
negative impacts on anyone but can make

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
negative impacts on anyone but can make
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.250
negative impacts on anyone but can make
some people that are off so we found a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
some people that are off so we found a
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.839
some people that are off so we found a
refinement to that something we call

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849
refinement to that something we call
 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.509
refinement to that something we call
Kaldor Hicks we look at the net benefit

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519
Kaldor Hicks we look at the net benefit
 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.240
Kaldor Hicks we look at the net benefit
versus the net cost and if the idea is

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250
versus the net cost and if the idea is
 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.140
versus the net cost and if the idea is
that we can have a net benefit and we

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
that we can have a net benefit and we
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.690
that we can have a net benefit and we
can redistribute it amongst the losers

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
can redistribute it amongst the losers
 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.240
can redistribute it amongst the losers
so we we take whatever benefit we have

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
so we we take whatever benefit we have
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.280
so we we take whatever benefit we have
to the society as a whole and we'd

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290
to the society as a whole and we'd
 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.620
to the society as a whole and we'd
redistribute so that overall people are

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630
redistribute so that overall people are
 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.900
redistribute so that overall people are
better off well then we have a Kaldor

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910
better off well then we have a Kaldor
 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.250
better off well then we have a Kaldor
hicks improvement and we think of that

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
hicks improvement and we think of that
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.860
hicks improvement and we think of that
as a welfare improvement let's look at

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870
as a welfare improvement let's look at
 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.020
as a welfare improvement let's look at
what is going on in the situation of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
what is going on in the situation of
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.280
what is going on in the situation of
trade so we know with trades there are

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
trade so we know with trades there are
 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.069
trade so we know with trades there are
winners and there are losers we also

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079
winners and there are losers we also
 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.800
winners and there are losers we also
know that by the principle of

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810
know that by the principle of
 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.470
know that by the principle of
comparative advantage that we're going

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480
comparative advantage that we're going
 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.800
comparative advantage that we're going
to actually have an efficiency gain so

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
to actually have an efficiency gain so
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.809
to actually have an efficiency gain so
you're going to have some transfer where

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819
you're going to have some transfer where
 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.849
you're going to have some transfer where
American consumers do better off because

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859
American consumers do better off because
 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.369
American consumers do better off because
we have access to goods at better prices

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379
we have access to goods at better prices
 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.479
we have access to goods at better prices
and American producers maybe lose some

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489
and American producers maybe lose some
 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.460
and American producers maybe lose some
of their resources because they can't

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470
of their resources because they can't
 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.650
of their resources because they can't
sell as much to our economy and they

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660
sell as much to our economy and they
 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.030
sell as much to our economy and they
have to face a more competitive economy

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
have to face a more competitive economy
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.280
have to face a more competitive economy
and then we know that we also have this

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
and then we know that we also have this
 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.800
and then we know that we also have this
competitive gain and if you add up the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810
competitive gain and if you add up the
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.080
competitive gain and if you add up the
benefit and the cost you find that in

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090
benefit and the cost you find that in
 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.990
benefit and the cost you find that in
fact we have an overall benefit what we

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000
fact we have an overall benefit what we
 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.960
fact we have an overall benefit what we
often cure when we hear about trade is

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970
often cure when we hear about trade is
 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.569
often cure when we hear about trade is
that it's a win-win situation and what

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579
that it's a win-win situation and what
 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.190
that it's a win-win situation and what
we're really referring to is the fact

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200
we're really referring to is the fact
 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.640
we're really referring to is the fact
that we have a Kaldor hicks improvement

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650
that we have a Kaldor hicks improvement
 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.140

stand that there's one more piece to
that which is that in order for everyone

that which is that in order for everyone
 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.920
that which is that in order for everyone
to be better off we really need to find

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930
to be better off we really need to find
 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.890
to be better off we really need to find
a way to redistribute that income away

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
a way to redistribute that income away

loss similarly if we look at immigration
there are winners and losers there are

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680
there are winners and losers there are
 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.040
there are winners and losers there are
at least three things that happen when

at least three things that happen when
 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.490
at least three things that happen when

goes up and as a result of that there is
 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.540

which is the amount of welfare that we

redistributed policy we're changing the

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900
redistributed policy we're changing the
 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.600
redistributed policy we're changing the
incentive structure by changing the

incentive structure by changing the
 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.600
incentive structure by changing the
price system and so we're introducing a

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610
price system and so we're introducing a
 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.050
price system and so we're introducing a
distortion which is always going to have

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060
distortion which is always going to have
 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.120
distortion which is always going to have
some kind of efficiency effect we're

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130
some kind of efficiency effect we're
 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.219
some kind of efficiency effect we're
always in this position of needing to

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229
always in this position of needing to
 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.839
always in this position of needing to
decide how much efficiency and how much

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849
decide how much efficiency and how much
 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.940
decide how much efficiency and how much
overall welfare do we want to give up so

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950
overall welfare do we want to give up so
 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.930
overall welfare do we want to give up so
that we can actually have a more

that we can actually have a more
 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.280
that we can actually have a more
whole society and this is the piece that

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290
whole society and this is the piece that
 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.620
whole society and this is the piece that
ends up being more of a political choice

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630
ends up being more of a political choice
 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.400
ends up being more of a political choice
than a technical choice and it's also

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410
than a technical choice and it's also
 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.260
than a technical choice and it's also
the piece that's very hard to get people

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270
the piece that's very hard to get people
 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.740
the piece that's very hard to get people
to push through politically except that

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750
to push through politically except that

much to one side maybe we need to

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310
much to one side maybe we need to
 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.730
much to one side maybe we need to
rethink where we are in terms of this

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740
rethink where we are in terms of this
 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.640

it may not be a zero-sum game but it's
 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.560
it may not be a zero-sum game but it's
also another win win and in order to

also another win win and in order to

also another win win and in order to

getting from Rust Belt America we need
