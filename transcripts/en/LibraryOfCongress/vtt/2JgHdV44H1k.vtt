&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: Good
afternoon all, welcome to LJ-119

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.510
into the Kluge Center for a
very exciting event today.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.370
We're delighted to welcome our
friend Doctor José Casanova,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.060
who has been with us for much of
the last year as a Kluge Chair

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.360
and the Cultures of the North.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.130
And I want to welcome many friends
from the Kluge past former fellows,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.380
I just met one and friends
from Georgetown University.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.170
I want to acknowledge James and
Constance from the EU delegation

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.070
to the US, who have been working
with us on many programs and ideas

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.540 position:56%
and I believe there are friends
from the Embassy of Spain here today

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.070
in addition to being
a Kluge Center event.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.930
We're delighted to cosponsor
today's event with our friends

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.050
from the European Union and
all of the European embassies.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.270 position:56%
May is the European month of culture

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.970
and this is the fifth
year of that program.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.070
It is a month-long festival with a
succession of cultural events held

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.650
around Washington including
in the embassies,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.300 position:56%
highlighting the diverse cultures
of twenty-eight countries in the EU.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.770
And today's lecture in addition to
being an event of the Kluge Center

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.630
and the library of Congress
is an official event

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.820
of the EU Month of Culture.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.360
Before I get any further, if you
are carrying an electronic device,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.430
a cell phone, if you'll take a
moment to silence your phones,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.380
this presentation will be filmed.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.560
The Kluge Center brings
together scholars and researchers

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.060
from around the world in a Global
network nearly as well articulated

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.740
as the Jesuit network that
we're going to hear about today

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.070
and they come and do research just
down this hallway in their offices

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.500
and throughout the library
in our reading rooms

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.730
and our rich collections and it's
a constant and evolving community

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.780
and we're delighted to welcome all
of you into our community today.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.290
Dr. Casanova is one of the world's
top scholars in the sociology

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.140
of religion, he is a professor
in the departments of sociology

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.810
and theology at Georgetown, senior
fellow at the Berkeley Center,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.490
his work focuses on globalization,
religion and secularization.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.230
During his time here over the past
half a year, he's been working

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.500
on his manuscript Early
Modern Globalization

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.640
through a Jesuit Prism, which
is the title of his talk today.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.990
He is published on immense range
of articles and for publications

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.280
and edited books on religion,
globalization, migration,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.430
religious pluralism, transnational
religions and sociological theory.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.020
His best-known work, Public
Religions in the Modern World came

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.540
out in 1994, it became a modern
classic and been translated

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.370
into five languages including
Arabic and Indonesian.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.310
In 2012, he was awarded
the Theology Prize

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.560 position:56%
from the Salzburg Hochschulwochen in
recognition of life-long achievement

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.630
in the field of theology, and
I'll just add as an aside that,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.950
José can speak or through to
his global topic, he can speak

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.300
or read French, German, Italian,
Polish, Portuguese, Russian

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.170
and Ukrainian in addition
to his native Spanish.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.210
While here, he greatly aid added
to our sense of collegiality

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.210 position:56%
and collaboration, he was a reliable
mentor to our younger scholars

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.030
and a delightful colleague for
those of us on the Kluge staff,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.640
so it is a real pleasure to
see him today, please join me

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.510
in welcoming Dr. José Casanova.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.070
[ Applause ]

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.860
&gt;&gt; José Casanova: Good
afternoon, thank you very much Ed

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.500
for this kind introduction
and I would like first

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.390
of all express my gratitude,
a deep gratitude

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.170
for this fantastic time I spent
here the Kluge Center the last five

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.550
months for all the help and
the company of the entire staff

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.270
that they've helped
me and also I want

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.110 position:56%
to specially recognize the
nameless staff, that bring the books

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:55.970 position:56%
to our offices, from the first day I
felt like a kid in the candy store,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.920
you ask for candy and two hours you
get served, candy of all shapes,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.850
languages, is the only place
where you can get precisely books

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.620
in every language you
can possibly know

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.800
and every other language
you don't know.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.230 position:56%
So thank you very much and of course
I also want to recognize Emily

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.510
who has been also helping
here and there at the Kluge

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.590
for actually putting my
lecture in PowerPoint,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.870
I say extra thank you
very much Emily.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.360
It's a pleasure to be
here and a great honor.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.640
This project is a follow-up,
basically,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.110
three years ago we directed
a project on the Jesuit

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.610
and Globalization it was a
collective project, the volume came

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.910 position:56%
out at Georgetown University Press
and here I'm expanding the framework

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.140
of the volume into
a monographic study.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.940
So Early Modern Globalization
through a Jesuit Prism.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.320
So the first question is why
Early Modern Globalization?

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.680 position:56%
Because usually we think
globalization either began yesterday

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.520
eighty-nine or something
or is simply a continuation

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.290
of modern Western hegemony,
modernization to entire globe.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:24.870
So it was meant Early Modern to
challenge precisely our modernist

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.750
and Eurocentric assumptions
that assumed

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.460
that everything begins
with modernity.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.000
There was tradition before
then there is modernity,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.050
and everything happened before
is basically irrelevant.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.910
And globalization is simply
supposed to be simply an expansion

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.360
of modernization to the globe,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.580
by pointing out that there was
Early Modern Globalization before

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.520
modernity, before Western
hegemony it means the dynamic

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.250
of Globalization cannot be
understood simply is a continuation

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.010
of Western modernity.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.860
So the question is,
Globalization can only be defined

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.200
in the most abstract
in general terms,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.200
precisely because if
you defined completely,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.300
you will define only part
of it, a period of it or one

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.490
which is characterized by economic
or by politics or by cultures.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.550
So it can only be defined
in abstract

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.510
in general terms is the
process through which the world,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.130
the entire globe becomes
a single place

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.650
with increasing global connectivity
between peoples, societies,

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:39.060 position:56%
and cultures with humanity attaining
and increasing global consciousness.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.020
Now Globalization proper and that's
why Early Modern Globalization

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.690
begins only once the
circumnavigations of the globe

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.070
in the early modern era
after 1492 made possible

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.530
for the first time both
global connectivity

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.040
and global consciousness.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.180
Of course there were
connectivity before all of Asia,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.950
in Africa had been connected for
millennia, certainly for centuries

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.180
at least the Axial
age and the Axial age

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.870
to a certain extent all the great
cultures already anticipated a

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.110
global consciousness,
a global humanity,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.200
some kind of ethical universalism
or logical universalism.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.480
But this anticipation
only becomes a reality

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.180
with precisely the
global connectivity

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.700
and the global consciousness
made possible

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:35.460
by the early modern
circumnavigations of the globe.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.480
Globalization therefore is a
process, a complex process,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.380
it cannot be reduced to any single
factor, an uneven process namely,

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.190
it happens differently in
different parts of the globe

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.090
at different rates, at different
times affecting differently

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.730
different peoples, so it's not
an even process across the globe,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.750
it is the multidimensional process.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.200
It can only be defined unlike,
neither is world capitalism

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.540
or world geopolitics or simply
a world technology in the sense

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.900
of mass media and is
experienced differently

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.990
by different people
in different places.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.730 position:56%
Therefore, when we use globalization
as an independent valuable

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.820
to explain things, probably
we are not doing right.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.690
Normally globalization itself,
doesn't produce anything,

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.750
does not cost anything is only a
process the condition of conflicts

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.660
within which all kinds of social
historical process takes place.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.180
So from these, it's kind

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.080
of a conceptual framework why
globalization, why the Jesuits,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.700
is there more interesting
questions, why the Jesuits?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:10:00.270
In the early modern era, they
serve as pioneer globalizers

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.160
in a sense one can say that they
were the first organized group

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.540
in history to think
and to act globally.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.620
If you can think of any other
group that they did before them,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.440
please let me know because
I have made this claim

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.090
and nobody has ever
challenged this claim.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.540
So far no historian has
challenged this claim, that indeed,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.170
they were the first
organized group in history

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.480
to think and to act globally.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:33.780 position:56%
Arguably for over two hundred
years, from their foundation in 1540

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:41.660
to their papal suppression in 1773,
no other group contributed as much

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.100
to the advancement of
global connectivity

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:50.170
and global consciousness linking
the four quadrants of the world.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.730
They serve as primary brokers,

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.960
in business speak they were
not themselves the ones

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.440
that produced the process, they
serve as brokers linking North

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.330
and South and East and West.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.960
And how did they do it?

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.710
First of all, through their
ubiquitous missions, yes,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.030
we don't have the map here but
just think of the coast of Japan,

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.410
China going down all
the way Southeast Asia,

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:25.600
Indonesia to the Mariana Islands
and then all the Indian ocean,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.660
the coast of India,
the coast of Africa

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.280
and then all the to the Americas.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.490
Basically, they had global missions
everywhere from North America

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.420
to South America, throughout
Africa, throughout Asia,

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.280
basically one generation
after their foundation,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.940
but also through their
prodigious, production,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.600
and global circulation
of annual letters.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.750 position:56%
They were prodigious letter writers,

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.720
Ignatius himself really was the
greatest letter writer of his age,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:00.250
nobody has at least the letter
writing of nobody else has survived

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.130
in so many volumes
as Ignatius letters.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.460 position:56%
And he makes sure that his children,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.910
his spiritual children also
were prodigious letter writers,

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.380
but they were also besides being
private letter writers they were

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.000
very good in keeping all
these documents archiving them

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.390
and archiving them and then
reproducing them, publishing them

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:26.710
as public annual letters and
edifying mission reports.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:32.250
In addition to that
they were scientific

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.770
and ethnographic describers
they were the first

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.120
to a certain extent
ethnographers of the entire globe.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.560
They did geographic mapping of
most of the areas of the world.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.720
They held cartographic exercises
all the way from the Philippines

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:53.010
to the Amazons, from China to North
America, astronomical observations,

00:12:53.010 --> 00:13:00.460
Clavius the great mathematician,
Jesuit mathematician and astronomer

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.380 position:56%
who was the teacher of all the first
generations of the Collegio Romano.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.470
He himself was a great
colleague [phonetic] to Galileo,

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.580
Galileo had him as a greatest
astronomer of his time

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:17.300 position:56%
and basically he was the,
practically the person was in charge

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.250
of the reform of the Gregorian
calendar, and the Jesuits who went

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.040
to China and he help
precisely do the same kind

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.230
of vision of the Chinese calendar.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:35.450
So also through the construction
of numerous scripts, lexicons

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.860
and grammars of non-Western
languages.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.150
Again, whenever they
came to a region

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.940 position:56%
that had no scripts usually it would
be the Jesuit of the development

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.470
of the scripts for many
of the native people.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.960
The Vietnamese script used today
in Vietnam is the script developed

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.620
by Alexander de Rhodes
think of the Walani language

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.630
which is a language basically
created by the Jesuits

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.620
out of different dialects but
has remained the only language

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.740
in Latin America which
is a spoken not Spanish.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.060
So in Paraguay the kind
of the successor nation

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.190
to the Guarani reductions
although they least speak Spanish,

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.240
the majority of the
population only speak Guarani

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.030
so it's the only Latin America
nation that was Christianized

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.030
without being Hispanized
through the Jesuits.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.380
They also served, because they knew

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.200
so many languages pioneered
comparative linguistics

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.800
to the extent they invented what
later would become comparative

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.940
linguistics the same way that
there was the first really

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.510
comparative ethnographers.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:45.020
In this aspect they serve as
pioneer Global cultural brokers,

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.350
through the translation of
classical Greek and Latin texts

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.390
into non-Western language,

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:55.080
Ricci translated Euclidean
geometric principles of geometry,

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.320
would translate aphorisms
from Greek and Latin

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.190
in his great most successful
book that he wrote in Chinese

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.730
on friendship basically
from memory was able

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.710
to reconstruct those
aphorisms and became because of

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:13.080
that he became a great
also Confucian literatus.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.270
But also the translation of
non-Western classical texts

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:23.540
into Latin, Chinese, the classical
Confucian Chinese texts were first

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.710 position:56%
translated by the Jesuits into Latin

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.880
by several translations
first Ricci and many others.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.530
And it was this texts
then later was translated

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.500
into every European language
that led to the great interest

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:44.110
in Chinese affairs, let's say
especially the 18th century the age

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.460
in which China became the focus of
so many interests by philosophers,

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:54.970
political theorists, especially
throughout the Enlightenment.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:16:00.120
But recessed Chinese also you have
the novella, the first translator

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.230
of Sanskrit and Tamil languages
into Tamil text into Latin.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.470
Ippolito Desideri the
first translator

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.510
of Tibetan classical text also.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.710
In this aspect, they serve
as pioneer orientalist,

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.470
before Orientalism became a
discipline in the Western Academy

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.990
at the end of the 18th century,

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:27.560
early 19th century the Jesuits
had served for over a century

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.530
as first Japanalogist, Baliniano
[assumed spelling] can said

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.030
to be the first Western
expert on Japan,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:37.490
the first Ricci the sinologists,
the noble of the first Sanskrit,

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.330
this would be the first otologist.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.990 position:56%
But now only that of course in Latin
America they were not the pioneers

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:49.050
because they came 50 years after
already the spiritual conquest

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.390
of the Americans had taken place,

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.640
but even there they
play a crucial role,

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.780
will mention Jose Dacosta
specially through the production

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.040
of catechisms, they
were no scientist,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.130
they were also primarily
missionaries.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.250
So the most important text they
were writing every other language,

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.110
non-Western language was the
catechism, these was the age

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.510
of course of the Catechisms.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.060
Luther's Catechism was the one

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.500
that really spread the Protestant
Reformation throughout Europe

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.470
and out it came also the Catholic
catechisms, the Trent catechism

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.300
of Trent and the Jesuits would
always precisely write catechisms

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.320
for each culture accommodating
precisely these culture.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.300
There are simply copies
of Trent catechisms,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.840
they're catechisms
written specifically

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.930
for that particular culture
in every possible vernacular,

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.520 position:56%
but also through the global
circulation of all kinds of objects,

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.480
scientific instruments from the
telescope, that they brought

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.490
to China and the quadrant and
many other scientific instruments.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:57.170
They also brought of course
the science of candle making,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.680
they helped to make candles

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.840
for the Chinese Empire the same
way they were making candles

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.360
and fortifications during
the religious worlds

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.970
for Catholics in Europe.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.220
So in these aspect, they
were not only missionaries

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.640 position:56%
and not only scientists but they
were also hard geopolitical realists

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.960
helping also the kingdoms which
they were also serving as scholars.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.260
Printing presses, typist
script, they brought it

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.460
of course this is the age
also of the printing press

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:30.960
and they were able to fuse in
Asia, the European printing press

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.300
and of course, the Chinese script
they had already their own printing

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.370
press for centuries but they
were able to precisely use

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:45.030 position:56%
and fuse the two techniques to print
in all kinds of ancient languages

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.030
but also in all kinds of
non-Western languages.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.750
Botanic plants, medicinal
plants, you may have heard

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.360
of the Jesuit Bark, quinine.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.510
Quinine was called the Jesuit Bark
because it was they who brought it

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.710
from Latin America and became
of course very important

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.330
for the tropics everywhere,
sacred objects of all kinds

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.430
that they distributed
throughout the globe.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.060
If you go to Latin
America to museums

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.860
in sacred objects throughout
Latin America without in Mexico

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:23.600
or in Peru you will find ivory
Jesus, baby Jesus's ivory crosses

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.020
from Manila made in
Manila by Chinese craftsman

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.510
for the Catholic global markets.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:34.930
In the same way that today's
Chinese do Christmas ornaments

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:40.240
for the entire world
already the Chinese in Manila

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.220
in Chinatown give Catholic
small sculptures

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.830
for the entire global
Catholic market.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:55.220
Icons, paintings, and sculptures
these was probably the first age,

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.930
global age of art in which you
have really the first intercultural

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.040
encounters between Japanese
painting and Western painting.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.960
They brought of course
the techniques

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.980
of Western painting including
obviously [inaudible],

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:16.040
the word fails me now,
the Western techniques

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.110
and they brought Japanese
and Chinese techniques.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:24.210
They brought the Western painting
techniques to the court in Beijing,

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.720
but also to the [phonetic] but also

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.660
to eastern Ukraine to
the Orthodox regions.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.680
Indeed, these people talked of
the global Jesuit baroque the kind

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.660 position:56%
of the first, again the first global
age of architecture you find all

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.640
over the globe, but also
music, drama, and ballet.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.810
And music was central, it's
important to understand

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.620
that audiovisual modes of
communication was central

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:56.920 position:56%
in the Jesuit, mission in the
Jesuit, way of portraying the gospel

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.200
and educating in the
schools, and music, drama,

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:05.550
and ballet became central in the
education of the Jesuit colleges

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.160
that we would see in a moment.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.660
You may think of French Ballet,
having been first invented

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.380
in the Jesuit college
Rule Grande in Paris.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.420
It was there where French ballet
was born the same way the much

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:27.350
of the Italian opera to precisely
was appropriated by Jesuits,

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.840
the Jesuit drama and
then was globalized

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.870
in Jesuit colleges
all over the world.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.650
You will have basically
presentations very close

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:41.940
to Italian opera, in Goa, in Macaw,
in Lima, in Cuzco, and so on.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.680
So what explains their
success as pioneer globalizers,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.250
a combination of external
opportunity structures

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:55.730
and internal institutional
and organizational advantages.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:01.240
Let's look first at three main
external opportunities structures;

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.040
First, the Iberian
Colonial Expansion,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.890
this was what made them global
missionaries, they were carried

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.990
by Portuguese and Spanish
colonial ships.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.740
The Portuguese Padroado,

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.620
the Padroado was the system
whereby the Catholic king

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.680
of Portugal became the patron

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.570
of the Catholic missions
throughout his empire in exchange

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.930
for obviously sponsoring
the missions financially

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:35.040
but of course missions helping
construct the Portuguese Empire.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.630 position:56%
The same happened with the
Padroato Real of the Spanish Empire.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.930
So it was these two
the Padroado Portuguese

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.640
and the Spanish Padroato
did together,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.260
because the Portuguese
control;ed the east indies

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.560
through circumnavigating
Africa and all the way

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.020
to India, Goa, Macaw, Melaka.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.620
In the Spanish controlled
the Americas all the way

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.920
to the Philippines.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.830
So there were two global routes;

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.900
one the Portuguese controlled
circumnavigating in Africa,

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:11.930
the Spanish controlled the
route from Manila to Acapulco

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.480
through Mexico City
through Veracruz, Havana,

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.260
and from Havana to the Spain.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.870
And then so these circumnavigations
were made possible

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:24.660
by these precisely the joining the
Spanish and the Portuguese Empires

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:33.520
and very frequently, when letters
went from Rome to China or a letter

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.870
from China to Rome they
would be sending precisely

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:41.070
in several copies via the two
different routes to make sure

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.070
that at least one of
them will reach there.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.250
So you have basically every letter

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.820
from Rome will go one
circumnavigating Africa

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.500 position:56%
by the Portuguese, the other through
the Americans to the new world

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.440
to Manila from there through
Japan and to China etc. Manila

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.190 position:56%
at a time was not the periphery off,
it was really the center of kind

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:06.670
of network of communication
between China

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:10.150
and Europe through the new world.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:17.350
It is a fantastic book of poems
by Bernardo de Balbuena 1605

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:21.620
in Mexico City, la
Grandesa Mexicana is a poem

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.020
to how Mexico City is the
center of the globe, every idea,

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.310
every product, every commodity,

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:33.090
and human shows basically the
Mongol Empire, the Persian empire,

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:39.330 position:56%
the Chinese Empire, Japan, the
Ottoman Empire and products from all

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.970
of these parts of the globe
all come through Mexico City.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.350
So again, Mexico City was not
a periphery of these global

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.760
where in fact there was no
communication between Mexico City

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.000
and China and there was
between Mexico City let's say

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.750
in northern Europe at the time
let's say would later would become

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.990
of course the main
carriers of globalization.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:06.780
So the Manila Ga Lyon was would
make possible the linking of east

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.620
and west through the Americas
because it was these new world

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.310 position:56%
that make inter-global, there had
been of course a lot of connectivity

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:18.880
in Euro or Afro Eurasia
connecting China,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.530
connecting what had been
Chinese civilization,

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.110
Indian civilization and Islam.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:31.920
Up to the 15th century Islam
had been the carrier that kind

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.190 position:56%
of they one linking Asia, Africa
and Europe, it was now the emergence

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.830
of the new world in the linking
all of these parts of the globe

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.390
that of course made this possible.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.770
So the Jesuits were carried to
their missions by Portuguese

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.570
and Spanish colonial ships.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:54.090
The great Jesuit missionary
of Brazil, Antonio Vieira,

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.470
put it much more succinctly
in his Historia do Futuro,

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.480
think of the title for the
book, Historia do Futuro

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.060
and he was of course a visionary.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.640
He was an apocalyptic thinker and
thinking how the world is going

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:13.800
to develop and I quote "if there
were not merchants who go to seek

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.240
for earthly treasures in
the east and the west indies

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.830
who would transport
[inaudible] the preachers

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:25.310
who take heavenly treasures,
the preachers take the gospel

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.000
and the merchants take
the preachers".

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.140 position:56%
But what was interesting is that
the Jesuit preachers went beyond the

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.950 position:56%
limits of the Portuguese and the
Spanish Empires, to places in India,

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.690
the Malawan [assumed
spelling], and in Japan to Kyoto,

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:46.540
in China to Beijing, in Tibet

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:52.110
where neither western merchants
nor colonialists had access.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:58.300
So it is not proper to simply
limit the Jesuit globalization

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:03.610 position:56%
to simply be carried by let's say
global capitalism, because precisely

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.680
where capitalism could
not enter, they were able

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.270
to start precisely these
intercultural encounters and even

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.840
within the Western Colonial empires
of the new world in the Americas,

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.380
in new France, in new Spain,
in the veranato of Peru.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.910
Jesuit established missions in
the outskirts in different tiers

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.640
of the empires where European
colonies did not settle, think of,

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.960
of course of the most famous
Walani reductions in Paraguay

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.770
but also the missions to the
Mapuche Indians in Chile,

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:40.720
the missions to the Indians in Baha
California, of course the missions

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.460
to the north American Indians all
the way from the Iowa to Milwaukee

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.380
down the Mississippi to Louisiana.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.800
So the second external,
this was the golden age

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.440
of Global Catholic missions.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.690
Jesuits were neither the only
nor the first Global Catholic

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.280
missionaries, they
follow in the steps

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.660
of other Catholic religious'
orders, Franciscans, Dominicans,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.170
Augustinians and others
who preceded them

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.180
in the great global Catholic
missions of the 16th centuries.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.130
So I've already mentioned to
the Americans they came late,

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.130
to Spanish America
they already reach

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:25.590
in the 1570s almost 70 years
after, or at least 50 years

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.890
after the spiritual conquest of the
Americas has already taken place

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.700
and the same goes for the
Philippines, the same goes for Goa,

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.270
the same goes for Macaw, but it is
precisely what made them unique.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:45.150
In this aspect, it was part of this
larger Global Catholic missions,

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:50.300
this was the age in which
Catholicism became the first global

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.050
world religion and
these we have to keep

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:57.490
in mind 250 years before
the beginning

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.660
of any continuous Protestant
missions,

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.480
I mean the Protestant missions
only begins in earnest at the end

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:12.880
of the 18th century and well before
John Wesley's famous expression

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.280
"I see the world as my parents."

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:23.130 position:56%
You have Jerome Nadals, Jerome Nadal
was a very important for the most

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.210
after Ignatius to the person
that was most influential

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.160
in shaping the First
generation of Jesuits.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.490
He was probably the only person

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:37.330
who met personally the first 1000
Jesuits at the death of Ignatius,

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:41.280
he visited every Jesuit
providence, every Jesuit college,

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.210
every Jesuit house
especially bringing the last

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.510
of the constitution.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.490
In this aspect he contributed
more than anybody else

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:53.560
to what could be called the
Jesuit esprit de corps and he,

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.030
calling the famous the
slogan, the world is our home

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.040
"Tutus mundus fit habitatio est."

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.720
But here is the once
our home in the context

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.550
where he describes we
Jesuits have three houses,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:15.440 position:56%
the house of the novices, the houses
of the professors, the colleges

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.900 position:56%
and then we have our fourth home,
our real world and it is this notion

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.780
that the whole world, the globe is
our home is what precisely is what

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:29.710
make them into Globalizers.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:37.650
Other Catholic orders had missions,
the Dominicans had missions,

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.820
the Franciscans, but the
whole order was not defined

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.760
as the mission of the order.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.810
The Jesuits were born
as a missionary order,

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.260
the specific ministry of
the Jesuits was to be sent

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.520
to missions upon entering
the Society

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.770
of Jesus members took an oath to
be ready to be sent ad missionaries

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:03.530
to any part of the world where
they could help souls particularly

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.150
in the so-called New Indies.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:13.310
In this aspect, global mobility
was culturally encoded into the DNA

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:18.350
of the Jesuit order
from its very inception.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:22.050
Two of the most controversial
organizational aspects

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:26.670
of the new order; their abandonment
of the traditional monastic wire

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:31.100
and the other religious
orders did not like the fact

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:35.550 position:56%
that they have broken with these and
not with neither the Curia in Rome

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.900
or that they were not
heavily monastic communities,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.070
they didn't dress in any
specific monastic habit

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:47.980
but they could wear any habit
anywhere where they were.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.720 position:56%
So these first and the second
therefore, their fourth specific vow

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.830
of obedience to the
universal Bishop of Rome,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.780
precisely because he has the
jurisdiction to send them

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.300
as missionaries universally
everywhere.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.130
So these two had their
origin precisely

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:11.370
in these intentional
disposition to global mobility.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.230
Finally, the third
external structure

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.360
which also has been
there 50 years before

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.460 position:56%
at least before the Jesuits emerged,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:26.540 position:56%
the culture of Christian Renaissance
humanism, Ignatius has stayed

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.030 position:56%
in the montego [assumed spelling] of
college in Paris in the same college

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:34.820
where Erasmus first and
later Calvin had to stay

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.370
and of course Erasmus was the great
Christians Renaissance humanist

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.640
of the time but also all of
the universities of the time

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.600
where permeated by this culture
of Christian Renaissance humanism

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.640
that then the Jesuits
incorporated into their colleges

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.780
and of course they were
born as a missionary order,

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.980
they became more famous
as educators, as teachers,

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.190
as the first professional
school masters.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:05.860
In this aspect they were the
first Catholic teaching order

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.830
or very other religious male and
female order just follow the Jesuit

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.480
as being a teaching order

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.430
by the first Catholic teaching
order were the Jesuits.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:22.320
In this aspect, they were also the
first transnational professional

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:29.180
organization of school masters in a
sense they invented the profession.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.110
Teaching was not originally
envisioned

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:37.270
as a particular Jesuit ministry
when they were founded in 1540,

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.020
they have no intention

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:44.080
of establishing any school although
they know the founders had degrees

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.350
from University of
Paris, but establishment

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:53.220
of the first Jesuit school
in Mussina Sicily in 1548 was

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.200
to have dramatic repercussions
in the structure

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.100
and the development of the order.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.400
The great historians,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.150
Jesuit historians John Ahmadi
[phonetics] called it the second

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:09.360 position:56%
foundation, it radically transformed
the order that only missionaries

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.960
under move now they become
sedentary teachers in places.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.070
And it is out of this tension
or this combination of mission

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:25.450
and college that the Jesuits as a
unique organization would be safe.

00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:28.570
And of course the dramatic growth

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:33.830
of the society also accompanied
the growth of Jesuit colleges,

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:39.590
it was through Jesuit colleges
that, the Jesuit order group

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:43.310
and the growth allowed for
more colleges everywhere.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:49.310
Look at these figures, 1533 when
they had the oath in Mont Mart,

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.820
in Paris the seven companions,
there were seven of them,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.310 position:56%
when the order was established in
1540 there were ten founding members

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.580
in Rome at the death of
Ignatius, sixteen years later.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:08.670
Later in 1556 already over
1000 members and 46 colleges,

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:13.990
20 years later, 25 year later
multiplication of members by five

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:19.050
or 5000 members, colleges
like three over 144 colleges,

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:24.700
50 years later again multiplication
by three from 5000 to 15,000

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:30.920
and colleges by three 444
colleges by 1749 on the eve

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.510
of their expulsion from
Portugal when it started there

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:41.140
over 2000 members and over 800
colleges throughout Europe,

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.530
the Americas and Asia.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:48.840
Most of them were in Europe but
they were several dozen College's

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.440
throughout the Americas and more

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.280
than a dozen colleges
throughout Asia.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:04.130
What was uniquely distinctive
of the Jesuit college because at

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:07.270
that time there were
Protestants of developing colleges

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.190
in the Protestant territories.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.160
What was unique precisely
its global orientation

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.010
which Stephen Harris the historian

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.860
of science was called the
Jesuit geography of knowledge.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:25.800
An instruction from Ignatius,
he would tell his missionaries

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:31.930
that he himself sent to send
all kinds of novel information

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.910
because there's a lot of
curiosity in Europe and, you know,

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.520
if can be edifying
this curiosity can lead

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.510
to edifying purposes as well.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:43.270
But of course the interesting
things that he was able to send

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.340
that only a few week religious
information or even merchant

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:51.490 position:56%
of course and send also
intelligence information on business

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.810
or on geology, excuse
me, on geopolitics.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.870
But the Jesuits precisely
because of the training they had

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.700
as if you wish scholars

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:05.240
as Renaissance humanists
they were ready to send data

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:10.860
of natural historical geography,
demographic, ethnography,

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:16.460 position:56%
linguistic, artistic, all of these
data send from the missions from all

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.580
over the world into the colleges

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.920
in Europe was processed there
is the scientific information

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.630
and was sent back to
all the colleges,

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.860
the Jesuit colleges
reaching the missions.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:31.030
And it is these back and forth
between missions and colleges

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:35.390 position:56%
between missions in the Americas and
missions in Asia, between colleges

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:39.520
in Europe and colleges in the
Americas and and Goa and in Macaw

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:49.580
that is precisely turned the
Jesuits into pioneer globalizers.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:54.120
So it was these virtuous feedback
of Jesuit knowledge production

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.660 position:56%
between the global network of Jesuit
missions and the global network

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:03.470
of Jesuit colleges what made the
Jesuits into pioneer globalizers.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:06.240
Again, there are so many
other things Jesuits were not

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.990
so much originators as effective
global carriers of a wider culture

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:15.330
of peace and universal humanism
that emerged out of the fusion

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:18.700
of Aristotalian Thomaism
scholasticism

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.820
and Renaissance humanism.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.260
The scholasticism of
the universities,

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:28.450
the humanism of the Italian
colleges they were fused together

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:32.360
in the Jesuit college that
had both this humanists

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.960
and the scientific scholarly form,
and then crystallize in the school

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.230
of Salamanca first Francisco de
Victoria was of course a Dominican

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.200
so was Macuricano but
then [phonetic]

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.500
who was the first Jesuit University
where much of this knowledge

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.120
in which they used [phonetic]
would be developed further

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.350
by Suarez and the others.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.440
So in this aspect through the prism

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.390
of globalization one
can view the Society

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:05.750
of Jesuit is the particular
crystallization

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.970
or the world historical conjuncture

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:12.020
or three interrelated processes
the [inaudible] expansion,

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.850
the early modern Catholic
revival, and the culture

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.630
of Christian Renaissance humanism.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:22.480
But of course those were
external opportunity structures

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.680
and they were available
to many other groups,

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.110
other groups do not take advantage
of these structures to turn

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:32.570
into pioneer globalizers so you
have to find out what was the

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.720
in the internal structures
of the Jesuit

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.470
that allowed to play this role.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.610 position:56%
And one could argue that it was
their peculiar character is an inner

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:49.590 position:56%
worldly activities and highly
mobile transnational religious order

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:54.150
that occupied an interstitial role
between Imperial Catholic powers

00:39:54.150 --> 00:40:00.330
and the papacy, and in particular
three peculiar Jesuit institutional

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:05.270
characteristics, Ignatius
spirituality, this is crucial

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.090
for the formation of the
Jesuit as a person as itself.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:11.270 position:56%
The peculiar combination of an ethic

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:17.390 position:56%
of critical self examination
discernment personal self abnegation

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:20.580
and control dedication
to the service

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.980
of others and to the common good.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.810
Again, is the first religious
order, that has written

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.570
into its constitutions, had not
only for the greater glory of God,

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.380
but for the common good, and the
colleges were not only to used

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.320
to convert or facilitize
for the common good,

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.980
the common good became
then a universal mission

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:43.550
with clear distinctions between
the religious and the profane.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:49.370 position:56%
An openness to the world seeking God
in all things, all of it grounded

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.210
in the spiritual exercises

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:55.590
of Ignatius these were the
paradigmatic Jesuit manual

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.430
and technic of the self.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.730
In the aspect from the beginning

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:06.500
until now every Jesuit is a
spiritual child of Ignatius.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.850
Basically reproducing internally
within itself the same process

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:16.070
of transformation that Ignatius
found in these spiritual exercises.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:22.240
So what he produced is an
organization of self-directed

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.950
and relatively autonomous
individuals that could be expected

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:29.300
to be sent to any part of the
world where they were expected

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:35.180
to reproduce faithfully the
peculiar Jesuit way of proceeding.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.240
It was obedience at long
distance, a lot of Inc.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.510 position:56%
has been written about Paridi
Akadaba [assumed spellings] the fact

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.520 position:56%
that they're supposed to obey as
their Ultimatons [assumed spelling].

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.880
But the fact is that when Ricci
got to China he was alone there

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.780
and he had to make decisions what
is the Jesuit way of proceeding,

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.480
how do I proceed as a Jesuit and
of course any question he sent

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.030
to Rome took two years to get there

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.990
and the answer will
another two years.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:05.160
So in the meantime he had to
find what is the Jesuit way

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.190
of proceeding is, and of
course it is the famous method

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.470
of accommodation that you
would say they start to build

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.220
into the spiritual exercises.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.420
Because spiritual exercises from
the very beginning are written

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:21.040
as a manual for the person that
keeps the spiritual exercises

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.340
and asking the person to
accommodate the exercises

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.370
to the specific spiritual
needs and characteristics

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.200
of the person taking the exercises.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.610
So again, the very method of
the spiritual exercises is one

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:37.160
of accommodation to the spiritual
particularity of the individual.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.680
The same goes, Ignatius would
send very specific instructions

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.550
when you go there do that
and do that and do that,

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:49.100
but after all once you get there,

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.450
you know best how to
proceed our way.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.730
And this is in every
letter at the end

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:59.150 position:56%
after giving very precise directions
but ultimately, you will know best,

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.190
you will have to use
your own judgment.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:07.200
Is this precisely unique form
of organizational structure

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:13.490
and this is the second one, is a
hierarchy centralized organization

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.770
with a highly flexible
managerial style

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.450
and a global system
of communication.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:21.170 position:56%
So it's a novel and typically modern
organization system or structure,

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.420
hierarchic and centralized
spelled out in minute details

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.290
in the first written Constitution
before any state constitution,

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:33.060 position:56%
the Jesuit wrote a Constitution that
later became modern you could say

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.820
for a lot of state
constitutions at least

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.170
in the written form
of the structure.

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:44.190
But accompanied by a
highly fixable mobile

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:50.680
and pragmatic managerial style that
could accommodate the most diverse

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.390
and unexpected local circumstances.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:44:01.530
In these pragmatic monetary style
was facilitated by highly developed

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:03.250
and efficient global system

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:07.080
of communications linking
all the Jesuit centers

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.690
with one another including all the
regional and global peripheries

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:15.390
to the Jesuit provinces and the
Roman Curia through the system

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:19.110
of letter writing that was
communication of every Jesuit

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.490
to is superior who wrote to his
superior who wrote and so on and so

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:27.690
on and communication is not only
vertically but also horizontally

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:34.580
across the global networks,
and finally it is global reach

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.960
as a transnational and papal order.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:42.560
It is the autonomous structure
they were able to develop,

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:47.410 position:56%
is a papal order that claimed to
have universal jurisdiction anywhere

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:51.180
but at the same time was sponsored
by different Catholic kings.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:55.440
So they were protected by the
Spanish king but wasn't comfortable

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.080
with the Portuguese king who
was protecting the Jesuits

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.930
and the French king but precisely
because they were subject

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.900
to so many different
jurisdictions they were

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.010
to certain extent you
could say subject to none.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:13.260 position:56%
And is autonomy that allowed them to
develop this you could say peculiar

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:20.410
or project of globalization that
eventually would actually clash

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:26.270
with what would become later the
hegemonic projects of globalization

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:31.080
of Western centric hegemony
in the 19th century.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.590
But at least for two centuries they
developed a global organization

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:40.460
that can be said to be
the first global NGO,

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:45.480
the first global non-governmental
organization before the

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:51.670 position:56%
consolidation of the modern
Westphalian system of nation states.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:56.310
This was the source of their
autonomy, the unique project

00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:00.990
of globalization, we would take
us much longer to try to spill

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.950
out how this project of
globalization was different

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:07.030
from the ones that
eventually triumphed,

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.350
but it was clearly this conflict
between the Jesuit project

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.060 position:56%
and the other parts of globalization
which eventually would triumph

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.780
in the 18th and the 19th centuries
that led to their suppression,

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.140 position:56%
to their expulsion from every
country whether they had been famous

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.440
and successful.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.540
Again, we don't have time
here to follow the process

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:31.980 position:56%
of expulsion first from Japan and
then from China, then from Portugal,

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.530
then from France, then from the
Spain to the final suppression

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:41.010
by the Pope in 1773, but it
is by precisely reconstructing

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:45.810
in the book I'm writing now by
reconstructing these expulsions

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:49.370
and suppressions that one can
find what were the conflicts

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:52.050
between the Jesuit
project of globalization

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.970
and the other emerging interest.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:00.140
So with these let me ask,
I'm already taking too long,

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.520
briefly globalization
through a Jesuit Prism.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:09.180
It was the intercostal
encounters and the Jesuit method

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.430
of accommodation, that defines
precisely these particular form

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.370
of globalization.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.650
This was an era before
Western hegemony,

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:23.540
when this was not a world
system those were connected,

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:28.440
interconnected histories nobody
can write the history of the globe

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.890
in the 16 or the 17th century
because it has no center,

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:35.340
they are connected history but
they are multiple histories.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:38.690
Western powers could not
subjugate the Mogul empire,

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:43.400
the Chinese Empire, Japan, the
Ottoman Empire, the Persian Empire,

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.920
so there was no western
hegemony in this.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.310
Tn which the Jesuit precisely
Served ts brokers connecting these

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.310
different parts of
the world together.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:56.910
They themselves have not project
of hegemony, it was more a project

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:02.570
of intercultural encounters, but it
is important to look at this model

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:06.010
because it fosters a
revisionist perspective

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:12.180
that perceives globalization that
triumphed, the modern globalization

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:26.110
from 1979, 1789 to 1989 as a
particular phase of global history.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:31.410
The one with the Western hegemony
and is being succeeded today

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:35.420
by a third novel form of
globalization we are entering,

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.700
[inaudible] which shape is going
to take after Western hegemony.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:44.250
And the idea is we need to free
ourselves from the Eurocentric,

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:47.730
Western centric, conceptual
of globalization to be open

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:51.640
to the new postmodern,
post Western globalization

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.100
that is emerging today.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:49:00.120
Valignano was the first one
who gave a kind of expression

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.680
to this myth of accommodation.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:08.160
His famous saying, "our task is
not to Portugalize the Chinese

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.380
but to make Christianity Chinese."

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.560
Again I don't have the time to here
to go into detail but we must see

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:20.620
that Jesuits as Renaissance
humanists that have made Saints

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:28.450 position:56%
of the pagan philosophers, Saint
Cicero, Saint Cenica, Saint Shocatis

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:31.470
and that come to these
other cultures

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:36.390
and can make Saint Confucius
because what Ricci found out is

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:39.450
that actually, and this was
his point, Chinese culture,

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:46.150
without revelation has reached
a level of natural law ethics

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:49.990
in the conception of the
cosmos of the universe

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:56.460 position:56%
which is basically almost in perfect
tune with the bio-revelation.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.240
So they came the closest,

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.050
much closer than the pagan
philosophers we've made sense.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:06.740
So much more we could made
Confii into Saint Confucius,

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:10.640
Confucius of course is a
name invented by Richie

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:15.020 position:56%
but is the way we know Confucianism
everywhere but it was and invention,

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:19.710
it was a manufacturing of Richie
there is a huge book manufacturing

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:24.490
Confucianism, how Richie basically
came to his interpretation

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:28.840
of Confucianism trying to
convince [foreign language]

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:33.080
that their own interpretation
was wrong, my interpretation

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.470
of Confucianism is the one really
close to [foreign language]

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:40.550
and you should follow it.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:45.310
We can argue about which
interpretation was better or closer

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:52.790
to the origins, the point is that
there is a certainly willingness

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.940
to argue, they call
themselves apostle

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.570
to the Gentiles, they same as Paul.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:03.450
It is not by chance that every
Jesuit college in Goa, in Macaw,

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:09.070
in Japan, in Cuzco, in Lima,
are called San Pablo, St. Paul,

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:13.690
because they saw themselves as
following doing for the new globe

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:17.530
for the new world what San
Paul did for the Gentiles

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.430
and San Paul could go to the
europagos [assumed spelling]

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:23.150
in the Athens and talk
of the unknown god.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:27.730
This with Ricci was doing in China
and is what the Jesuits were doing

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:31.530
in India, and in Tibet,
and the idea was

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:36.640
if Christianity was originally
Hebrew or Aramaic, Jews,

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:42.030 position:56%
had to become Hellenic and had to
become Latin in two different forms,

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:44.580
Hellenic Greek Christianity
and Latin Christianity.

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.880
There is room for Japanese
Christianity,

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.250
Chinese Christianity
Indian Christianity

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:54.150
and Christianity can't become
a universal religion truly,

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.700
if it becomes enculturated,

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.510
incarnated in every
particular culture.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:03.840
It is this separation between this
conception of universal religion

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.540
that has no culture, plural
religion and particular cultural

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:11.940 position:56%
and of course any sociology this is
the key distinction between religion

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:16.110
and culture of the division of
religious studies in sociology

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.530
and anthropology of religions
how these differences

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.910
of religion and culture took place.

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:24.120 position:56%
Well it took place first in China
when Mathew Ricci decided which part

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:30.120 position:56%
of Chinese culture where see customs
therefore not idolatrous rights

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.930
and as such would become
Christianized.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:36.230
So the need to differentiate which
part of culture is just culture

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.150
and which part of culture
is religion

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:41.170
that leads precisely to
this differentiation.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.750
What happens was that
differentiation with the Jesuits

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:49.860
in China made brought to
Europe and there Voltaire,

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:54.660
Lignus and the others said fine you
say the Chinese culture is almost

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.210
ready before revelation.

00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:00.330
We don't need revelation gives us
Chinese culture without revelation,

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:04.830
so the project of the enlightenment
is to appropriate Chinese culture

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:08.720
to precisely bring enlightenment to
Europe getting rid of revelation.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.650 position:56%
But this Conflict of formation
called the Chinese rights eventually

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:16.700
the conflict led to
secularization of culturing

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.070
to that this Christianization
of culture in Europe,

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.880
but basically the first
step is first the separation

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.360
of cultural rights which are
purely cultural and those

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.850
which are the religion therefore
idolatrous and therefore cannot be.

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:33.500
And this was with the whole Malava
rights and Chinese rights was all

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:38.220
about and of course it led to
a big conflict between the pope

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.640 position:56%
and the Chinese Emperor, between the
French King and all the religious

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:49.270
that Jesuit eventually bringing
to an end the Jesuit as an order.

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:52.040
But it is these controversial
formula

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:58.140
of Jesuit cultural accommodation
maybe let me answer these,

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.440
let's go back.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.500
So cultural accommodation we must
again because sometimes it is

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.780
that all the scanning Jesuit look,

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:08.200
they were proselytizing that's
why they invented this method, no.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.160
The method was not invented by
Europeans, the method was pushed

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.570
by the locals after the
European missionaries,

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:18.990 position:56%
it was the Japanese [phonetic] look,
you cannot try to Portugalize us,

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:22.040
if you want to succeed here, if you
want to have a serious encounter

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:27.710
with us, you have to dress
like us, wash yourself like us,

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:29.950
eat like us, become Japanese.

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:33.990
And Ricci who came to China
as a Buddhist monk was told

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:36.410
by his friends, no
abandoned this habit

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:40.450
and adduct the Confucian
habit, so it was these,

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:44.150
it was always the locals
that told the Jesuits,

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:50.140
so accommodation was not in kind of
an intellectual strategy developed

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.580
by the Jesuits, it was
a practice that emerged

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:56.130
out of the intercultural
encounter itself.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:55:00.420
And this is the famous in
controversial form of accommodation

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:04.040
but the Ricci to avoid the
habitus of Confucian literatus,

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:08.500
in china [inaudible] in
India Jesuit introduction

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.380
to Paraguay to avoid [phonetic].

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:16.080
But also the least commendable
accommodating habitus

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:20.970
of a slave owner in the Jesuit
slave plantation in Maryland.

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:24.550
In Maryland they have largest
of [inaudible] plantation

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:28.300
which financed my university
Georgetown college you know all the

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.770
controversy in the last
two years about slavery

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:36.360
and Georgetown how even when they
saw the slaves they [phonetic]

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.910
and emancipated the slaves
but actually sold them

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:45.500
to finance precisely
Georgetown University in Brazil.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:50.030
And of course then this brings
the question of what is cultural

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:55.580
that should be incorporated into
universal humanity, human rights

00:55:55.580 --> 00:56:01.500
and which parts of culture
perhaps is incompatible

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.650
with the sacred unity
of the human person

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:06.320
and therefore needs
to be left behind.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.990
We have these discussions today

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:10.260
about how universal
are our human rights,

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:17.710
how much we should simply
accommodate genital cutting

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:21.770
in Africa because it's an old
cultural custom of Africa,

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:27.100
so which part of culture are to
become universalizable as part

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.770
of humanity in which
[inaudible] in conflict with,

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:35.030
what we would call
today human rights.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:38.930
So it was a differentiation
of two universal religions

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:43.900
in particular cultures, first
introduced by the Jesuits as well

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.570 position:56%
as they became civilization idolatry

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:49.990
by the law the various
accommodating syntheses

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:55.500
or supposedly global universalism
and local cultural particularism.

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:59.860
This is the key to the Jesuit
formula of localization,

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.490
a formula which was very much
attacked by everybody in the Rome,

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:08.650
in Paris and by Jesuits themselves.

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:11.880
Let me and simply give
you an illustration

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.630
of the intercultural encounter the
Jesuit perhaps the pragmatic one

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:23.840
by looking at the map, it is a
map, the majority will map the copy

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.720
of which one of them is here
at the library of Congress,

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:35.600
as you can see there are six prints
whatever you call them in Chinese.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:42.640
And what is interesting
of this map is,

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.810
it is neither Sinocentric
nor Eurocentric,

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:52.580
so this map maybe together
between the European and Chinese

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:56.410
and somehow what came of it is
that neither China is the center

00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:57.800
of the world as they were convinced

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.720
that they were nor Europe
was the center of the world.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.800
Europeans were convinced
they were so the center

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:09.720
of the world dividing east and west
is somewhere West of Japan going

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:14.120
down the Pacific Islands you will
not discover yet Australia Oceania

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:18.650 position:56%
because they hadn't been
discovered and the east is the west,

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:22.250
the Americas are at the east
and all of the old world.

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:26.510
So the new world is the east,
the new world is the west

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:32.480
and this sense it centers both
Eurocentrism and Cino-centuries

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:38.130
and it avoided, it is a
map that fuses the west

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:42.410
and cartographic techniques and
Chinese cartographic techniques,

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:45.990
you cannot read it there,
but the map is full of text,

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:49.580
the Chinese maps have a lot of
text telling you about each region

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:53.270
of the world, how, so you
have again, I cannot read it

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:57.520
but I was a fantastic exceeding
the reaching Institute in China

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.380
and the Asian society
in San Francisco.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:04.900
In San Francisco and there was
the translation of all this text,

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:09.250
if anything this is the map
that the Chinese adapted,

00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:11.620
is the map that gave them
the vision on the world

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:16.010
of the new world before the
world they new and for 200 years,

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:19.540
for 300 years these can map
itself we have done revision later

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:22.790
but it is not another
Jesuit with update this map.

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:27.340 position:56%
But basically this map will serve as
the map for China, Korea and Japan

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:31.190
until the end, until the middle of
the 19th century, this was the map

00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:35.020
of the world the Chinese,
Koreans and Japanese used

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:38.130
as precisely world maps
and of course it happen

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:39.430
that Matthew Ricci had to come

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:42.230
up with Chinese names
for every European city.

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.250
So most of the names
the Chinese used today

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:48.650
for European cities are basically
names that Matthew Ricci invented

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:50.870
to such an extent,
right, phonetically help

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:56.600
to transliterate let's say European
cities into Chinese characters,

00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:02.130
but it is not only that really,
it was a world of communication,

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:05.230
collaboration between several
Chinese and Matteo Ricci.

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:11.150
So it was not Matteo Ricci bringing
Western science to the Chinese,

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:14.960
it was these precise encounter
and he was characteristic of also

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.170 position:56%
of his books and friends which I
have already mentioned the aphorisms

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:22.480
which was the way in which, again
from memory I'm sure your familiar

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:28.040
with the classic by Spence the
memory palace of Matteo Ricci

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.750
and of course in the
consulate of the Chinese

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.980
in which memorizing it's
extremely highly regarded,

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:37.910
he almost everybody was all
by the ability of Matteo Ricci

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:42.510 position:56%
in these they could have as
[phonetic] where basically read them

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:46.320
and take in Chinese and he would
be able to basically read it back

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:50.260
from the last character
to the first character.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:56.870
But it was the kind
of in this catechism,

01:00:56.870 --> 01:01:02.500 position:56%
the way he basically integrates kind
of Confucian cosmology and vision

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:07.210
of the world and the Chinese and
the in the Western cosmologist

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.650
that comes up of creationism.

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:11.770
But the same way we
could say of many others:

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:18.830
Jose Dacosta in the Americas, he's
the author of the catechism of Lima

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:23.220
but for being the catechism
of Lima was written in Latin

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.970
and translated simultaneous
to Spanish, Guarani,

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:29.430
excuse me [phonetic],
[phonetic], because he said

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:33.000
to become Christians the natives
of southern America don't need

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.620
to become to be Hispanized, his
notion to become Christian need

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.580
to be Hispanized therefore
they need to Europeanized.

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.050
You have to Christianize or or
you have to Guaranize Christianity

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:46.310
and this is what I mentioned
before of the Walanise,

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:52.540 position:56%
anyhow the Jesuits served as pioneer
interlocutors in the religious,

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.220
cultural, scientific, and artistic
encounters between East and West,

01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:00.990
and between the old, the new worlds
in the early modern global era,

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:04.770
and as we are entering the
multipolar, the decenter world

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.840
in which we have to become again
able to enter a communication

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.450
with other forms of
thinking, which are forms

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:14.900
of considering the human person
with other models of democracy

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:20.330 position:56%
with other models of organization of
the common good and the good life.

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:24.020
I think that the lessons
of the Jesuit

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.730
in the early modernity are still
there but they find solutions

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:29.800
but we don't have solutions
our self either.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.420
What is still struggling within the
same conflict within universality

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.380
and particularity between globality
and locality, the day we struggle

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:41.350
with and so is not that they, that
have given us the modern and how

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:44.840
to become global today
but at least it helps us

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.940
to perhaps de-center our own
Western-centric modern conception

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:53.510
of where the globe is going
to look in 50 years from now.

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.310
Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: The
love of Jesuit here,

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:34.600
maybe the Jesuits may have some
questions, some objections.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:47.780
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much,
say for this fascinating lecture.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.800
Many, many questions
but one that stands

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.410 position:56%
out is contemporary discussions of
globalization there is often a focus

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:59.270
on the tendency of globalization
to flatten, standardize,

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:04.600
homogenize the cultures of the
world and I was strut in listening

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.360
to your lecture about this
early modern instantiation

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.560
of globalization that, there
is going to be a tension still

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.930
between the reproduction as you
put it of Jesuit institutions

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:20.530
and isomorphic reproduction which
implies you notice this kind

01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:25.580
of replication of the
same structure globally

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:31.030
and similarly also the replication
of the Jesuit way of proceeding,

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:35.650
and on the other hand the kind
of relativism, syncretism,

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:41.200
accommodation of other cultures,
languages etc. into the very fold

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.900
of Christianity and I'm wondering

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.890
if you could speak
more to that tension.

01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:49.650
I mean isn't there still a
standardization at work perhaps

01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:53.080
in this process, I would be
very curious to hear all about.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.790
&gt;&gt; Jose Casanova: There is always
of course, I use the college

01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:59.240
and isomorphic because you
may be familiar at this time

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.290
for the school of globalization.

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:05.050
This is about quality
that basically ask itself

01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:07.990
within that the nation's
history is of forms but the fact

01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:11.170
that these forms are re-created
everywhere throughout the world

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:13.360
isomorphic is and indication

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.460
that each nation is study
simply basically a receiver

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:18.750
of the world politic
which is above all of us

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:21.780
and the argument I'm making is
for this world politic to emerge,

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.590
these world of society somebody
has to contribute and one

01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:27.970
of the primary, of the most
important institutions has been

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.570
reproduced isomorphic
clean around the world is

01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:33.410
of course the University and
the college and they worry

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:37.030
to pick somebody who is able to
take these institutional form

01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:39.720
and make it their own and then
reproduce it isomorphically.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.750
And in this aspect there
are elements already

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:44.150
of these the standardization
there, but I'm more interesting

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:46.910
when the others were trying
to standardized by entering

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:50.010
through the dialogue and
[phonetic] these were

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:53.470
of course what they were accused
of I mean if you read Pascal,

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:56.970
Pascal the [phonetic]
letters he just making fun

01:05:56.970 --> 01:06:00.030 position:56%
of these Jesuits have no principles,
they're simply are willing

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:02.790
to accommodate anything
for whatever.

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:07.180
And so the notion of that they
been actually moral relativists

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:11.010
with no principle, well of course
we would call them today moral

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:13.940
contextualists, they realize
it was principles have

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:18.440
to be apply accommodated in each
particular context in its own way

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.910
and the same goes with
in other the [phonetic]

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:25.380
of course the French Catholic
[phonetic] were the most, the first

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.750
and some of the most radical
critics of the Jesuits and a friend

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:35.160
of Pascal [phonetic] in his
famous Catechism de Jesuit,

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.860
basically calls them
hermaphrodite religious order.

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:44.010
Hermaphrodite because they are
neither religious nor secular,

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:45.540
it is the first definition

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.380
of [phonetic] they simply don't
accept these differentiations

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.210
between the religion
and the secular.

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:53.300
They are scientists, and
they are cartographers,

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.670
and they are musicians,
and they construct canons,

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:58.850
and anything they want

01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:03.280
to be basically find God
in all things, right.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:08.610
It is these which of course made
them in the one other hand pioneers

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.440
because they are out
of this impulse,

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.990
they are the proto scientist,
the proto astronomers,

01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:17.360
the proto everything but later
modern science would take over

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.360
and then would develop these
in a most standardized form

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.160
that imposes the Western
form of logic

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.650
and of Western metaphysical
conceptions,

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.980
which today we are
in the process of.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.430
Again in a sense being
challenged in someplace,

01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:39.320
we have no idea how let's say
once India and China emerge truly

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:43.700
as a global powers, they may
challenge our own conceptions,

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.880
anthropology or the conception of
the south, the wheel, you know,

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.730
transmigration of source, I mean
they are [phonetic] they had

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:54.410
in India and in China in the
17th century with Buddhists,

01:07:54.410 --> 01:08:00.460
with Hindus about transmigration of
souls of the south of the free will

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.800
and basically those are issues

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:08.120
that any contemporary global
philosophy will have to take

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.970
into account that we cannot simply
dictate Western considers of the,

01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:14.370
anthropologically concepts
of the South,

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:18.390
considers of the will
cannot be simply globalized

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:22.490
in a homogenizing form, but we
have to adapt other cultures.

01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:27.200
So in this aspect, I think there
are issues that certainly if we are

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:33.190
to multiculturalism in the high
level of integration of world views

01:08:33.190 --> 01:08:34.990
from other civilizations.

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:36.290
If you are going to think

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:43.120
of it global let's say [foreign
language] liberal arts humanities

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.150
education which incorporates
not only Western Classics

01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:50.920 position:56%
but all the classics of humanity and
experience of all human cultures,

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.480
then obviously it cannot
be a standardized method,

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.960
it has to be one which
integrates through dialogue,

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.000
very different currents into
perhaps not a fully synthetic maybe

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.750
[phonetic] but nonetheless while
using corporates all these visions

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.080
of humanity.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.510
Yes

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.810
&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: It's
a century time

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:12.980
for the reception I have a
question it's a very long question.

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:15.880
So I think I might ask
my question privately,

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:19.470
but does anyone have a
brief question for José?

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:23.600
I'm sure that, we can
all ask at the reception.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.570
So on that note why don't
we conclude the question

01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:27.940
and answer and go to the reception.

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.100
Thank you, thank you Jose
for a wonderful talk.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.510
&gt;&gt; Jose Casanova: Thank you so much

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:38.180
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
