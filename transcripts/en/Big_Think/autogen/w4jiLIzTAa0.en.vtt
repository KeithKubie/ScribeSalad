okay so we have a online writing program

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370
okay so we have a online writing program
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.780
okay so we have a online writing program
called self r3 and that helps people

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790
called self r3 and that helps people
 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.130
called self r3 and that helps people
construct the narrative of their life

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140
construct the narrative of their life
 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.990
construct the narrative of their life
that's a good way of thinking about it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
that's a good way of thinking about it
 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.179
that's a good way of thinking about it
and so part of the narrative of your

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189
and so part of the narrative of your
 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.700
and so part of the narrative of your
life is what happened to you in the past

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
life is what happened to you in the past
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.320
life is what happened to you in the past
that made you who you are now

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
that made you who you are now
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.320
that made you who you are now
good and bad and part of what you want

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
good and bad and part of what you want
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.830
good and bad and part of what you want
to do think about the purpose of memory

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840
to do think about the purpose of memory
 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.120
to do think about the purpose of memory
think well the purpose of memory is to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130
think well the purpose of memory is to
 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.089
think well the purpose of memory is to
remember the past it's like no that's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
remember the past it's like no that's
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:32.720
remember the past it's like no that's
wrong

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
wrong
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.910
wrong
the purpose of memory is so that you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
the purpose of memory is so that you
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860
the purpose of memory is so that you
take from the past what you need not to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
take from the past what you need not to
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.620
take from the past what you need not to
do stupid things again in the future

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630
do stupid things again in the future
 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.090
do stupid things again in the future
right so the purpose of memory is to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
right so the purpose of memory is to
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740
right so the purpose of memory is to
learn from the past so that you can

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
learn from the past so that you can
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.950
learn from the past so that you can
construct the future more effectively

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960
construct the future more effectively
 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.330
construct the future more effectively
all right so now if you've had terrible

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
all right so now if you've had terrible
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010
all right so now if you've had terrible
things happen to you in the past and you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
things happen to you in the past and you
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.799
things happen to you in the past and you
don't understand them what that means is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
don't understand them what that means is
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720
don't understand them what that means is
that you're insufficiently prepared for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
that you're insufficiently prepared for
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.430
that you're insufficiently prepared for
the future and that means you're going

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
the future and that means you're going
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560
the future and that means you're going
to be in a constant state of anxiety and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
to be in a constant state of anxiety and
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.319
to be in a constant state of anxiety and
stress and so if you write about your

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
stress and so if you write about your
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.930
stress and so if you write about your
past and you do a causal analysis of the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
past and you do a causal analysis of the
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670
past and you do a causal analysis of the
good and the bad things that happen to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
good and the bad things that happen to
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.709
good and the bad things that happen to
you then that arms you more effectively

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719
you then that arms you more effectively
 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.330
you then that arms you more effectively
for operation in the present and the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
for operation in the present and the
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.459
for operation in the present and the
future that and that produces an

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469
future that and that produces an
 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.349
future that and that produces an
increment in in physical health by the

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359
increment in in physical health by the
 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.870
increment in in physical health by the
way okay so that's the past authoring

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
way okay so that's the past authoring
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.489
way okay so that's the past authoring
program it asked you to divide your life

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499
program it asked you to divide your life
 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:17.959
program it asked you to divide your life
in two epochs and to outline the

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969
in two epochs and to outline the
 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.849
in two epochs and to outline the
emotionally significant events and to

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859
emotionally significant events and to
 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.949
emotionally significant events and to
essentially do a causal analysis of them

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959
essentially do a causal analysis of them
 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.139
essentially do a causal analysis of them
so it's like you're getting the gist of

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149
so it's like you're getting the gist of
 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.510
so it's like you're getting the gist of
the story of your life down you're

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
the story of your life down you're
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.929
the story of your life down you're
articulating yourself so the present

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
articulating yourself so the present
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.330
articulating yourself so the present
authoring program uses a personality

virtues so that you can continue to
capitalize on them it's the simplest of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
capitalize on them it's the simplest of
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.779
capitalize on them it's the simplest of
the three sub programs and the future

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789
the three sub programs and the future
 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.339

done the most research on helps you
 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:51.260
done the most research on helps you
first of all formulate a vision for your

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

something to stay the hell away from and
that's maximally motivating because if

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
that's maximally motivating because if
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.870
that's maximally motivating because if
you want to be motivated to do something

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880
you want to be motivated to do something

you want to be motivated to do something
you can't just be hopeful about it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920
you can't just be hopeful about it
 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.280
you can't just be hopeful about it
you have to be hopeful about doing it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
you have to be hopeful about doing it
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.820
you have to be hopeful about doing it
and afraid of not doing it and that way

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830
and afraid of not doing it and that way
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.860
and afraid of not doing it and that way
your anxiety is behind you pushing you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870
your anxiety is behind you pushing you
 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.270
your anxiety is behind you pushing you
forward instead of in front of you
