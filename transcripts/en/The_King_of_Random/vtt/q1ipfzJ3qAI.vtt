[Music]

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.169
Guys, we did it!

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.800
10 million subscribers.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.620
I started this channel back in 2010,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.560
and back then, I only started it
as a place to upload videos

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.080
of projects that I was working on.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.097
See, back in 2008-2009,
during the recession,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.400
there was a lot of
real estate foreclosures,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.152
and talks of depression,
and I wanted to be the guy

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:50.220
who would be prepared
for any emergency.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.000
So, I was taking apart microwaves,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.060
and playing with electronics.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.880
To just try and figure out
how a society worked,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.590
and how to reverse engineer that at home.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.660
And, so my YouTube channel was
really just a place to start

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.300
uploading videos that I was making
as I was tinkering with these things.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.220
Some people wonder where the
name 'The King of Random' came from,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.040
and it really was from
a person called Mike Lyman,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.620
a friend of my brother's,
who just always happened to be there

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.270
every time I was coming over to show
my brother the new thing that I had made.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.340
He just look at me and say like,
"Dude, you're like the King of Random,"

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.820
and that name, you
know, it kind of stuck.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.420
I kind of liked it.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.260
I kind of didn't,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.560
but when I originally
started my YouTube channel,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.980
because I didn't have a purpose in it,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.040
I didn't know what username
to come up with,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.480
and so some of you subscribers
who've been around since the beginning

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.080
might remember the channel name
was actually 01032010814,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.580
which seems like
a totally random number.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.640
But literally, that was the date and time
that I started my YouTube channel.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.380
It was January 3rd, 2010
at 8:14 in the morning.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.380
So that was my channel name,
and unfortunately, at that time,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.460
I could not go back
and change my channel name,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.520
so I was stuck with it.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.320
But then, Google+ came along,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.960
and I could create a Google+ page
and change my name, and so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.740
the only available name that I could
change it to that wasn't already taken

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.740
was 'The King of Random.'

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.660
So, that's where
'The King of Random' came from.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.660
That's why we've been
'The King of Random' ever since.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.240
[Music]

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.260
A few of you have been asking
to meet The King of Random team.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.860
Well, we've seen your comments, so let
me go ahead and introduce you to them.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.200
Of course, I'm Grant.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.299
For some of you new subscribers,
you may not know who I am.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.840
I started this channel originally,
and dedicated seven years of my life to it.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.540
&gt;&gt; I'm Nate.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.100
I build things, and then I film them?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.840
&gt;&gt; I'm Mark.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.180
You guys may know me, I've been working
on the channel for almost two years now.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.160
&gt;&gt; Risking personal safety.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm the videographer.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.700
&gt;&gt; I'm Richard,and I'm
the one doing the animation.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.600
&gt;&gt; I'm Hunter, I edit the videos,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.340
and I manage the post-production team.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.340
&gt;&gt; Hey guys, I'm Josh, and I do
some of the graphic design,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.760
and video editing for the channel,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.160
and I kind of run the social media as well.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.120
&gt;&gt; I'm Lean.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.359
I edit the videos.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.900
I also made the intro stickers.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.800
&gt;&gt; I'm Dan.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.420
I edit videos and work on special effects.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.520
&gt;&gt; Guys, we're here in Alaska right now.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.700
I'm with my wife, and we're watching
this from Alaska, rolling over right now.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.820
10 million, it's incredible.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.120
&gt;&gt; It's amazing.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.780
&gt;&gt; That was big jump.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.480
&gt;&gt; 992.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.560
&gt;&gt; We got 8 subscribers left.
&gt;&gt; 8 more to go!

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.320
&gt;&gt; Here we go!

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.020
&gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.300
Come on. Come on.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.400
Come on.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah!
&gt;&gt; 993.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.700
We're here with Grandpa.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.160
Got my wife.
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.400
&gt;&gt; A couple of my little boys.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.080
We're in Alaska.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.280
We got six subscribers left to go.
&gt;&gt; Six to go.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.320
Six to go.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.500
&gt;&gt; It's at 994.
We just have six more.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.540
This is intense.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.200
This is crazy.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.180
I'm so excited.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.620
&gt;&gt; Come on.
Come on, people.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.120
&gt;&gt; Oh, they're just leaving us hanging.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.860
&gt;&gt; Subscribe.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.700
Subscribe.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.720
&gt;&gt; 995.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.600
So close.
&gt;&gt; Five more.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.240
Five more.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.060
Oh, we lost one.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.400
&gt;&gt; Jamin, you gotta come see this.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.640
997, three more.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.780
Just three more.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.580
Just three more.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.560
&gt;&gt; Three. Just three more.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.780
&gt;&gt; Just three more guys.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.300
&gt;&gt; Oh, that was a big jump down.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.580
&gt;&gt; Now, six more.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.380
&gt;&gt; Come on you guys, you can do it!

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.980
&gt;&gt; 995.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, what's next?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.440
&gt;&gt; Oh!
&gt;&gt; Oh. Snap!

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.100
&gt;&gt; Do it! Do it!

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.800
&gt;&gt; That's it.
&gt;&gt; That's it.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.540
&gt;&gt; That was amazing!

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.340
&gt;&gt; Whoa!

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.120
&gt;&gt; We did it.
&gt;&gt; 10, 000, 022.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.380
&gt;&gt; We love you guys.
10 million subscribers.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.460
That's amazing!
&gt;&gt; Thank you!

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.720
Thank you!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.440
In 2012, I decided to try a quest.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.780
A quest for discovery,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.720
and this was a hundred projects
that I wanted to do

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.580
to reverse engineer society.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.260
You know, whether it's based
on electronics, magnets,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.400
purifying water,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.880
using sunlight to, you know,
melt steel or concrete,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.840
or cook food or things of that nature.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.420
I was gonna make 100 videos
based on self-reliance,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.600
mechanical engineering,
principles of physics,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.420
and really do it as a
learning process for myself.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.120
I wanted to teach myself
how these things worked,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.260
and once figured it out,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.130
turned it into video,
and put it on this YouTube channel.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.160
Now, fast-forward about three years,
because it took three years

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.340
for me to finish making
those hundred videos,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.440
and by then, I think our channel
had four million subscribers.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.440
We'd been featured on Dr. Oz.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.320
&gt;&gt; This is why you are The King of Random.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.320
&gt;&gt; Good Morning America.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.223
We've had episodes
put on the Discovery Channel,

00:05:16.223 --> 00:05:18.420
and it's really just opened so many doors.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.540
When I look at that number,
it was fantastic.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.800
But it didn't really click for me
until I started going outside,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.080
you know, going shopping,
or going to the places I'd always gone.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.900
But now, people are
starting to recognize me.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.100
Ask for my picture,
ask for my autograph,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.780
and I tell you, that felt really weird.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.720
Because who am I?

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.760
I'm just a guy in my basement,
playing with stuff,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.700
and people are asking for my autograph.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.360
So that was a really crazy shift
that happened about

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.880
two and a half years ago.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.900
&gt;&gt; Alright guys, pizza's here.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.020
Looks pretty impressive.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.040
&gt;&gt; It's actually really big.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.460
I mean, that's my hand to scale, and we're
counting on you guys to polish this off.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.840
&gt;&gt; Especially you Josh, it's all yours.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.280
&gt;&gt; I'm the current host
of The King of Random,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.460
and I also do most of the
researching, prototyping,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.420
and building for all of the projects.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.400
&gt;&gt; And he is really good.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.700
I don't think I could have found
anybody better to fill this role.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.260
He has exceeded my expectations.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.720
Nate, you make me very proud.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.000
&gt;&gt; Oh, we needed that face.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.240
So, when we're getting ready for a shoot,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.247
I always try to think of like
all the options of shots I can get,

00:06:17.247 --> 00:06:20.120
and what will look best
to make these videos stand out.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.920
I love doing epic shots,
like with the flamethrower,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.600
showing the flames, and the different
colors like when it goes green, or...

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.280
I'm like not an on-camera person.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.540
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.180
&gt;&gt; I love it when you guys
comment on like,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.060
really awesome shots that are in videos.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.759
It just makes me feel better
that I've done a better job.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.220
&gt;&gt; One thing that gets me really excited
at work is knowing that I have to be

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.940
more creative,
and random in my outputs.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.720
&gt;&gt; So, I've been working
at The King of Random

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.620
for about a year and a half now,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.000
and I've edited I think 292 videos.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.800
&gt;&gt; You know, I really try to
have fun with the social posts.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.190
The things on Instagram,
stories and all that.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.490
I try to put little Easter eggs,
or a little fun elements in them

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.870
for you guys to see and find.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.080
&gt;&gt; I get excited when I get the chance
to work on a weapons project,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.200
or when I get the chance
to add some special effects.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.060
&gt;&gt; I get excited when viewers
catch the Easter eggs that we

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.580
editors put in the videos, and make
fun of them in the comments.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.220
&gt;&gt; For example, on the colored
hydrophobics sand video,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.040
there's two frames where
it flashes a certain somebody's face,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.680
but reading the comments on that video,
there was a lot of people that caught it,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.290
and it was really fun to go
through and read all of those.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.184
&gt;&gt; I think one of the
funniest comments I ever saw was,

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:33.320
I was scrolling through,
and somebody left this comment like,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.340
"We don't miss you at all Grant,
because Nate is actually better than you anyway."

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.880
I literally like laughed out loud,
and did one of those rolling

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.320
on the floor laughing kind of things,
like not really, but...

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.520
That actually made..
&gt;&gt; Somersaults.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.580
&gt;&gt; That was a defining moment.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.680
I was like, yes!

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.500
Great job, Nate.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.380
I'm proud of you buddy.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.380
&gt;&gt; I also really loved seeing
when you guys have tried out

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.280
something that I showed you how to do.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.740
I love looking at Instagram
and Twitter posts showing

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.640
projects that we taught you about.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.070
&gt;&gt; Funniest comment I've ever
read is probably the running gag

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.600
of "Do A DIY lightsaber" comments.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.260
&gt;&gt; Some of the comments
I thought were funny are when

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.160
you guys thought that I was Grant's wife,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.660
or that Grant's wife was the videographer.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.240
But it was actually
just me the whole time,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.290
and you could see like my
reflection in Grant's sunglasses.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.540
It was was actually me so...

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.020
&gt;&gt; And we're doing a giveaway.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.940
In celebration of this
10 million subscriber milestone,

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.310
we are giving away an iPhone X to one of you.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.940
There's only two things
that you need to do to qualify.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.035
One, please be a subscriber of the channel,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.400
'cause after all, it is the subscribers
who made this milestone possible.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.420
And number two, share one of our videos.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.620
You can go back through
any one of our 700 videos,

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.160
and just scroll down right under it,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.490
click the share button,
and then copy that link,

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.499
and paste it anywhere
around the internet you want.

00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:42.909
That can go on Twitter.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:43.909
That could go on reddit.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.990
It could go on Pinterest,
whatever is your favorite platform.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.279
Go ahead and share one of our
videos, then click the link

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.600
in the description of this video to
submit your name and qualify for entry.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.640
This phone's going to one of you,
and if you're not a fan of the iPhone X,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.280
I have included the gift receipt
so you can take it back,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.940
get the money back,
and buy something that you love.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.749
&gt;&gt; What's up guys?

00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:04.910
Josh here, jumping in for a quick
second to tell you about this special

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.569
shirt we're launching to
celebrate this awesome milestone.

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:12.939
It's only gonna be available for
72 hours after this video launches,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.180
so, if you want one, click the link
in the description to get yours.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.480
Once that 72 hours is up, it's over.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.340
It's done! We're not making any more.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.300
So, again, click the link
in the description to get yours now.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.580
&gt;&gt; There are a couple things we're
hoping to bring online pretty soon.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.120
One is bringing in a female co-host.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.391
We're hoping to bring a female maker
onto the show to bring a little more

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.100
spice and variety,
and a unique perspective.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.120
We're also gonna be doing
King of Random rewind series,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.820
where we compile a bunch of our
best videos down into one video,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.800
and for the next 10 months,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.300
we really want to give away
some big-ticket items to you guys.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.180
We want to give away video cameras,
drones, 3D printers, Nintendo Switch,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.760
iPhones, Galaxy S9s, all those things.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.120
It's going to be coming to you
as a subscriber appreciation,

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.439
because we want you to know we love you.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.520
We really do appreciate you.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.240
You are part of the community
that's making this whole thing possible,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.780
and it's just one of our
ways of trying to give back.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.410
We have done a couple of update videos
kind of explaining the transition,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.780
but there's still a lot of people out
there wondering "What happened to Grant?"

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.640
"Where's Grant?"

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.580
And I'm here.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.280
I'm here with my team.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.960
&gt;&gt; Oh Grant!

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.940
Important question, yeah.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.780
Are you now, or have
you ever been in jail?

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.160
&gt;&gt; That's a very good question.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:23.920
Perfect.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.860
Okay, great.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.000
Alright, we're gonna jump on Instagram
here, and answer some questions live.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.140
We are now live.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.320
What's up Instagram?

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.490
I got Nate over here.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.320
&gt;&gt; I'm in a massage
chair for some reason so...

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.139
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:41.369
There's probably like 30
or so man-hours in one video.

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:42.860
&gt;&gt; It's actually closer to 50.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.560
We have about six...
&gt;&gt; Fifty.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.900
&gt;&gt; We have six full-time employees
on the production team

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.290
working eight hours a day to make a video.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.000
So we have a pipeline, so we're
constantly producing kind of

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.400
like production factory, if you will.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.800
But every video has six
different people working on it,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.440
and that's not even including me.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.620
But it averages out
probably about 50 hours per video.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.340
&gt;&gt; There you go.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of a funny story.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.120
Like if you remember back to when
we were pouring silicone on a chicken,

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.399
which seemed like a totally
random idea at the time.

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:14.249
I needed a lot of silicone to do that.

00:11:14.249 --> 00:11:16.780
I reached out to Keith,
who was roommates with Nate,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.440
and Nate was working at the
place where they do a lot of casting,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.790
so I believe I officially met Nate when
I picked up the silicone for that video.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.260
&gt;&gt; I helped him out with a little bit of that,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.080
and then I started following
the channel more,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.319
and when he announced
that he was looking for an assistant,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.380
I applied along with many other people.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.280
&gt;&gt; The honest answer guys is
I have been behind the production.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.620
I've been guiding
the team's making it happen.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.120
We literally have a list
of like a thousand project ideas

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.180
that we're working through,

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.580
so there's a lot of back infrastructure stuff

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.700
that you don't see behind
the scenes to make all this work.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.620
To be in the videos on top
of that would just be crushing.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.700
And I have had a lot of fun in the videos,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.600
but it got to a point where I just
needed to step back and take a break.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.480
Some personal time.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.600
I have four boys and a family.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.980
Not Nate, but he's like family.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.700
And I just want to
spend some time with them.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.320
My place right now is
to be a Dad, to be with my kids,

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.620
and then to guide the teams
from behind the scenes.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.580
For me, I'd say the most difficult project

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.760
that I've worked on
was the mini metal foundry.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.380
It's probably one of the videos
that our channel is most known for,

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.999
because at the time,
there were no videos on the internet

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:23.810
showing people how to melt down metal.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.230
There were no metal foundries.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.520
I spent six months
prototyping different recipes.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.880
After filming, there was you know
150 hours of work between filming,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.460
scripting, editing,
and all the post-production work as well.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.900
So, that video was like seven months
in the making, which you know,

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.980
was one of my most difficult,
but honestly, one of the most rewarding

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.580
because that entered us into the metal
melting age, which has been significant.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.740
&gt;&gt; For me, it's a little
interesting because the most

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.760
difficult things that I've worked on,
you probably haven't seen

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.500
because there are some
that I'm still kind of stuck on.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.360
There are projects that
I'm still trying to work out

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.889
how best to make them really function.

00:12:59.889 --> 00:13:03.540
I really like to make a sort
of DIY version of a fully

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.980
functional grappling hook launcher.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.260
That's tough.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.500
I've got some other ideas of what
I want to try, but I'm not there yet.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.120
In terms of things that I've completed,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.960
one of the most intense was
also just about my first one,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.230
the giant like 6-foot super soaker.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.380
The massive super soaker,

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.080
the idea where we were
copying what Mark Rober did,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.680
and we backed it off just
a little bit so we could keep his title.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.060
But the enormous super
soaker, that was very intense.

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:32.920
That was working for like 10 to 15
hours a day for almost a week.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.160
It was just a lot of work
in a short period of time.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.780
It was also very hot out,
but it turned out so good.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.820
I love that thing.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.660
&gt;&gt; Our production
schedule is about a month ahead.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.040
So, what we're filming today will
probably be a released in about a month.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.160
If you're following us on Instagram,
and watching the stories,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.329
you might get some
behind-the-scenes glimpses

00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:55.730
to projects that'll be put
out about a month from now.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.730
&gt;&gt; The important question, yeah.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.540
Are you now or have you ever been in jail?

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.620
&gt;&gt; That's a very good question.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.380
So yeah, I know there's articles
online that said I got arrested.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.200
I got put in jail.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.780
I got charged with felonies.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.459
Most of that is actually fake news.

00:14:07.459 --> 00:14:08.459
I've been here the whole time.

00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:09.940
I never got arrested,
never went to jail,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.460
and most of the stuff written
in those articles wasn't true,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.959
and the people who wrote the article
is no longer work for the company.

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:17.920
So, we're in the process of trying
to get that pushed out of the way,

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.970
but I will say, there were charges
pressed against me by somebody who

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.959
filed a complaint to the police,
and there was no investigation.

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:28.580
They just filed charges,
so I did have to go to court.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.360
I went through the legal system,
and the charges were dismissed.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.100
So, everything is good, but it was kind
of a traumatic experience to go through.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.840
It ruffled our feathers a little bit.

00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:39.980
Nobody likes being falsely accused,

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.199
and there's still stuff all over the internet,
kind of putting a little bit of a damper

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:44.199
on our name right now.

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:47.600
We've tried really hard
to do everything right.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.600
We're still trying to everything
right, but here I am.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.399
I mean, my position right
now is to support this team.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.900
I mean, you're working with
some of the best guys I've ever met,

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.600
and so I'm kind
of at the head I guess.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.560
The captain of the ship, you could say.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.060
Just trying to steer it
in the right direction.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.600
You know, I'm testing the winds.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.000
I'm trying to feel how things are going,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.560
and make sure that
what we're focusing on

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.660
isn't so much YouTube trends or algorithm.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.200
We're not chasing views.

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:12.470
We're not doing anything other
than trying to produce

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.500
content that we're absolutely
passionate about and that we love.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.431
I want to let you know that
because this is a subscriber milestone,

00:15:18.431 --> 00:15:20.920
I tried really really hard to get a list

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.809
of all the subscribers
names to put in this video.

00:15:23.809 --> 00:15:27.840
I've been asking YouTube for months to
send me a list of all 10 million

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.480
subscriber names,
and apparently, there have been a lot

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.889
of technical issues doing that.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:36.269
We didn't realize how much data
10 million names takes up in a spreadsheet.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.780
In fact, we tried a sample
with a hundred thousand,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.880
and with all the rendering issues
and trying to convert to a format

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.140
that would work in videos,

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.839
we were spending days and days just
try to get a hundred thousand to work.

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:47.580
And to put things in perspective,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:52.620
10 million subscribers
is 100 lists of 100,000,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.220
which is incredible.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.840
It would have taken
probably months to compile,

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.960
and make something like that work.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.346
But it was in our heart,
in our interest

00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:01.000
to try and put you in the video.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.300
If I could have put your name
in this video, I would have.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.300
Because this subscriber
milestone is all about you.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.440
You are-- You are one of the
10 million, and that means a lot.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.460
&gt;&gt; We now have ten million--

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.040
Ten hundred sparklers.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.900
We thought it'd be kind of fun to
celebrate with sparklers,

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.999
so we picked up a box of a thousand of them.

00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:24.460
We're gonna place them in a 1-0-M,
and light them off with a flamethrower.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:56.140
[Music]

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.040
When I started this channel,
I in no way expected anybody

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.970
else's life to be better for it.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.520
I was only doing it for myself.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.620
But it only took a couple of years
for me to realize that there actually

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.829
are people behind the numbers.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.280
You're behind the numbers.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.279
You're sitting on the other
side of this computer screen.

00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:12.559
We're having a conversation.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.009
That makes sense to me now.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.780
&gt;&gt; Guys, thank you.

00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:17.490
This has been super awesome.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.589
I love doing this.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.370
I've always liked making stuff,
building stuff, and now, I just get

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.560
to do this for you guys,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.520
and having you involved
makes it so much better.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.320
&gt;&gt; I appreciate you guys.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.240
You guys are awesome.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.019
You guys make me be able to have my job.

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:33.520
&gt;&gt; I just want to thank you guys
so much for supporting the channel.
