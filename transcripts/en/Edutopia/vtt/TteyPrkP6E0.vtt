00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.780
- My students learn the physics better

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.530
when they're acting as though
they are true physicists.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.200
I try to teach as much as possible

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.020
in a project-based approach
in all of my classes.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.780
I've seen enough success
out of what it does

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.260
for students that I'm hooked on it.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.570
One of the things about the project

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.680
that I think helps to make it successful,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.340
and the style of teaching successful

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.090
is that students are motivated,
because it's a real task

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.490
and they assume the role of
a job that actually exists.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.670
The project that I'm working on

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.290
with my AP Physics class is
called the Mission to Mars.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.660
The students were
creating testable landers

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.910
that contain four eggs.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.900
It was a very well thought
out, egg drop experiment.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.970
You guys are in the role of
the EDL Systems Engineer,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.640
Entry, Descent and
Landing, to try to make a

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.610
lander that will end up on Mars.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.570
When they see that there's
this interesting problem

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.470
that is being tackled out there,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.760
and is a thing that can lead
to an actual job for them,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.990
they're much more motivated to look deeper

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.920
at the actual physics behind it.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.240
- It's like we're all being acted upon

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880
by like, great forces all the time,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.060
it just happens that the time of it

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.350
- The very first task
is the project launch,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.093
and in that activity students investigate

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:19.170
past designs of EDL systems
that have landed rovers.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.003
- And then we've got to figure out

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:20.950
how we're gonna attach this, so like,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.900
if we're gonna use tape or glue

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.610
or maybe zip ties or something.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.060
- The early stages of the
project is getting motivated

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.810
and understanding the context.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.440
Students really try to map out

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.230
what are gonna be the set of skills

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.930
they'll need to learn in
order to tackle that problem.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.010
As a teacher looking in on those days

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.330
it might look like a
traditional physics lab.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.130
My role then is to make sure that students

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.230
stay in character as a Systems Engineer.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.300
From there students tackle air resistance,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.300
which is one of the concepts in a lot of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.280
introductory physics courses.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.570
- We use the parachute to work with that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.220
so we were trying to make the lowest

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.670
terminal velocity possible by
increasing the surface area.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.740
- You still need to finish up

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.330
your terminal velocity
investigation, so that I know

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.340
you can quantify terminal velocity

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.100
and that you can apply it to your lander.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.660
From there students develop
a deeper understanding

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.330
of impulse and the change
of momentum of their lander

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.360
as it makes contact with
the surface of Mars.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.610
- So we have four 50 gram
weights, one for each egg

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.997
that we'll have in the actual test run,

00:02:23.997 --> 00:02:27.250
and so that's just the masses
that we're using to simulate.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.580
We used different air bag designs

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.710
and so we used methods
like, using force plate

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.660
and dropping it on a
force plate to measure

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.340
how long the force was applied over.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.570
The force spiked when it first hit

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.440
and then you can see that
it bounced a couple times.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.910
- These little air pockets right here,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.150
I feel like that's really
gonna help cushion the fall.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.560
- The task for students actually

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.900
test their landers, is an energy analysis.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.680
During that time students
uncover and investigate

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.830
some of the important
concepts of mechanical energy,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.260
work and the conservation of energy.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.270
Another big part of
project-based learning for me

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.580
is that students have a public product.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.160
So they're not just learning
in isolation from a textbook

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.780
and learning how to do problems

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.810
that they can then write
out on a piece of paper

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.620
and have me evaluate grid.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.590
- And how did you decide?

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.510
Did you experiment at all

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.980
with different sizes of parachutes?

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.130
- We had a number of
experts come in on that day,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.630
engineers that worked in industry,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.483
to evaluate and give
feedback to the students.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.323
- Three, two, one.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.732
- Alright, got four out of four.

00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:40.053
- [Johnny] What's that?
No hairline fractures?

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:40.886
- No.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.110
- I'm curious about the air bags.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.050
- Yeah me too.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.170
- You have Mr. Devine, like telling us

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.890
that these are the things
that people actually do,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.730
but that's different than having people

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.417
who are actually in the job being like,

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:54.577
"Yes, this is a thing that I do.

00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:56.410
"This is some things that I noticed."

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.020
- Yeah, your guys is actually one that

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.210
I thought was good because it seems like

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.880
you guys thought in the
3D space maybe more.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.080
In that many of these
designs look like they relied

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.370
primarily on the air bag
or the parachute right?

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.010
It was good to see the kids being able to

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.030
look at those equations and use them

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.190
to help guide their design,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.040
because that's exactly what
we have to do in industry.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.670
- You can think of it conceptually.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.740
Actually being able to test it?

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.470
And you have to repeat the equations

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.930
over and over and over
again with different trials

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.370
of different airbags and
different parachutes.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.960
Just being able to use that math

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.060
over and over again, helps it stick.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.910
- They are much more eloquent
with their explanations.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.330
Much more agile with their application

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.730
of the concepts when
I've seen them construct

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.520
the knowledge themselves, versus simply

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.600
be handed the tool and
explained how that tool works.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.153
Alright, everybody ready?
