00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.460
We all feel a little blue at times - maybe we had a bad day or week - and that makes us sad, lack motivation,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.400
or have no interest in going out with our friends, or participate in activities we would normally enjoy.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:33.480
Being unwilling to do the things we love, like meeting up with our closest friends, or even trying to do well in school or at our jobs doesn't usually last long.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.160
Once everything's settled, we return to our normal selves. Well, most of us.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.900
People suffering from anhediona can't.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.980
So, what is anhedonia?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.580
Anehedonia is defined as the inability to experience pleasure from activities usually found enjoyable

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.600
or the impaired ability to pursue, experience and/or learn about pleasure,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.800
which is often, but not always, associated with conscious awareness.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.980
The term was first introduced by ThÃ©odule-Armand Ribot.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:13.620
It's easier to understand this with examples, such as a mother not finding joy, playing with her child, or a passionate dancer not being eager to dance.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.940
Another alternative theory suggests that anhedonia comes from the inability to sustain good feelings over time.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.900
In this case, you might feel pleasure fully, but only for a short time. Meaning your interest and involvement aren't maintained.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.180
What types of anhedonia are there?

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.780
Consummatory exists when a person gains no satisfaction from activities, previously or not considered enjoyable. There's no anticipation for a reward.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:52.340
Motivational describes a person who shows no interest in taking part in pleasurable activities because a reward isn't enough of a motivation to them.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.660
Social is for a person who withdraws from all social gatherings and contacts. They have no interest in interacting or making friends.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.900
They want to be alone all the time and have a hard time adjusting socially, contrasting to introversion.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.560
Sexual or ejaculatory is most common in men and qualifies the state of not feeling fulfillment or enjoyment from sexual action.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.160
The form of anhedonia might be caused by low testosterone levels, fatigue, or physical illness.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.660
The fifth type is the specific musical anhedonia.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.240
In this case, the individual has no problem processing musical sound or beats, but receives no pleasure from listening to music.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.460
This state, however, should not be confused with melophobia, which is the fear of music.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.520
The symptoms of anhedonia are many. Ranging from being incredibly flat-mooded, with no variations,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.020
to the suffering individual, being unable to react properly or feel anything.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.100
It is associated with many. Schizophrenia, spectrum disorders, depression, and social anxiety.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.560
Anhedonia may result in the breakdown in the brains reward system.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.020
Every time we feel pleasure, the neurotransmitter chemical called dopamine fills the part of our brain called striatum.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.120
The disease may be linked with a lower activity in a part of our brain called the prefrontal cortex.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.100
Anhedonia causes its effects through this cortex, which controls the dopamine releases.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.400
Though it is related to depression and anxiety disorder, anhedonia isn't the only reason for these disorders.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:45.040
Risk factors of it are a history of major depression disorder (MDD) or schizophrenia, a recent traumatic or stressful event,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.660
a history of abuse or neglect, a major illness, an eating disorder, or even a recreational drug use.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.300
The disease can only be diagnosed through counseling. You should tell your therapist about your symptoms, including the loss of experiencing pleasure.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.220
Your doctor may want to run a blood test, check for vitamin deficiency,  or a thyroid problem.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.620
Unfortunately, there's no validated treatment, especially for social anhedonia.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.260
There's no medication developed specifically aiming at anhedonia.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.980
Have you ever experienced one of the types of anhedonia? Or do you know someone who does?
