Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay. So we're gonna finish up talking about aromatic city, uh, talking then about reactions as well as molecules that are unusually stable, that is transition states that are stabilized. Uh, that's deals, alder reactions, which are Cyclo additions and also, uh, other Perry cyclic reactions like electrocycle like reactions. Then we'll go onto a spectroscopy. Okay. So we're generalizing the concept of [inaudible]. Uh, we saw last time that hook all thought it would, there would be unusual stability when you had four n plus two Pi electrons in a ring. That is when you have an odd number of electron pairs because every odd numbered orbital goes down in energy when you form a ring. So if there's an odd number in total, there are more going down that up. And then we'll go on to see, as I said about transition state era anticipate. So first, just one slide that'll be on the exam on Monday or is fair game anyhow, which is, uh, some things that are not bins annoyed but are still aromatic.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Like Cyclo, Penta dying of course is a ring, but it's not a ring of conjugated p orbitals because there's one intervening one. So the terminal P orbitals of the dying don't interact, don't overlap with one another, right? But if you pull off the proton with a base, then they interact. So now you have five electrons in this, an ion in the Pi system, and it's unusually stable. You can pull off that hydrogen from a carbon with hydroxide. It's p, the PKA of this compound is 15 it's more acidic than water is. It's better to pull a hydrogen off that carbon than to pull a hydrogen off oxygen. Now what, what, um, what's the normal pka for pulling a carbon fully in the hydrogen off the carbon? Do you remember if it's just normal, right? Pardon me? It's about 50 right? Of course. This is Alec.

Speaker 1:          02:12          So you might say, and in fact it's doubly Allah late. So you might say that helps out. No doubt it does help out. But notice that it has six Pi electrons, same as benzene. And we would expect on the basis of our theory for it to be unusually stable. But if it's just that, it's Alec, think about doing the same thing with the seven membered ring. If you pulled the hydrogen off the ch two here of a seven member during, you get this anti on, which would be stabilized by that resident structure, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, and an enormous number of resonance structures, but the PKA is 39 right? It's 20 what? 24 powers of 10 less acidic than the one on the five membered ring. Even though you can draw many fewer only five resonance structures in that case. So it's not a question of resonance structures. It's a question of how many electron pairs there are in that ring. And if it's an odd number, it's stable, and if it's an even number of payers, then it's not stable. Okay, so that one has eight Pi electrons for N it's anti aromatic instead of being aromatic. Right. Another interesting analog is a [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          03:28          So here's a case of psych low-protein reacting with an unusually stable cad ion. Try Fennel methyl cad ion. Notice that that cat eye and is triply Ben Zelig. There are three benzene rings that helps stabilize the positive charge or to speak more accurately, who's electrons are stabilized by the vacant orbital on carbon. Still it's, it's exothermic to transfer the hydride notice it's a hydride not a proton. It's pulling off h minus this time onto the fennel ch three, uh, to get to generate this sick click conjugated cad. I am so that one is even more stable than the unusually stable triply Benzyl lequon. Now what, what's the uh, accounting of that one? Uh, the counting of Pi electrons. Roy, can you tell me how many Pi electrons in a ring of that, of that cat eye and is it going to conform to foreign plus two. Okay. We had a double bond. That's two electrons. And what do we get from that center when we pull off h minus

Speaker 2:          04:45          in the p orbital

Speaker 1:          04:47          zero. So how, how many do we have too? Is that four n plus two where n is an Integer, that's one and a zero. So that one you expect to be unusually stable. It's just got the one pair that goes down in energy. When you form a ring, two Pi electrons is four n plus two. And notice that now if you go to see seven here, we went in the anti and to see seven h eight here we go to s to c seven pardon me to see seven h seven and I am here to see seven h seven cat I and right. If we do the same trick with that react, this hydrocarbon with that Trifecta, methyl cad ion. But that is also, it's the same that's also downhill. It's favorable to make. This is, does that conform to four n plus two what did he say?

Speaker 1:          05:37          Or whole how many Pi electrons and c seven h seven plus say US foreign plus two. Same as benzene. Okay, so here are some really weird compounds that you wouldn't expect to be so unusually stable that are, because it's a generalization, the idea of air Medicity but it applies not only to ground states, but also to transition states. When you get a ring that has a conjugation among a bunch of orbitals that are uh, where the number of electrons is foreign plus two. So in this case, the transition states aromatic, even though the starting material and the products are not aromatic, that that means is that they're special stability only in the transition state. And therefore the reactions will be unusually easy. Okay, so let's see if we have some examples of that. We'll look at cyclo auditions in particular the deals, alder reaction, and also at electrocycle leak reactions.

Speaker 1:          06:38          We'll start with the cyclo additions. So the deals, all the reaction was the subject of, of a Nobel Prize, surprisingly enough to deals and older. Okay. It involved a dying reacting with an alkene. So an EAD and a dying and they react with one another with three pairs of electrons shifting to form a ring. So it, it, it has four sigma electrons that are involved in this and two Pi electrons in the product. In the starting material, it's four Pi electrons and two Pi electrons. It's six electrons, three pairs that are being involved. And we can write curved arrows like that, but we might want to think of it a little more carefully. Suppose we just draw the two approaching one another homo to Lumo like that. Now there are two problems here. Uh, one is that we've got the Lumo drawn upside down. In fact, there are three problems, okay. That we can just write the signs the other way. That's no problem. Another problem is that the hydrogens which we haven't shown the sigma hydrogens are going to be running into one another when we do that. Right? And there's also another problem somehow Pi electrons have to become sigma electrons here and here. It has to be an end on not a Pi interaction in order to do that, how could we get around these problems?

Speaker 2:          08:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:09          Okay. We can rotate the 180 degrees. That'll make the signs correct. How do we get around the other problems of say the hydrogens running into one another? If we rotated at 90 degrees that that's true, but you don't get the best overlap that way for forming and do bond. Anybody else got an idea, Brandon?

Speaker 2:          08:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Put it under. So approach, make the approach, not make the approach where the PA parallel to the direction of the Px is right. Like this. Right now we got around all those problems so we can form this new, but notice the transition state is folded because of this, because they're not coming together in a plane, so to the product and we have to unfold it. We have to grab that bottom black line and pull it up into the plane. Okay, so the product is then going to look like that once we flattened it and you can see the new bonds that are formed. Now let's take just a little bit about what we would predict in in connection with Stereo chemistry of this. Suppose the starting a Alkene, we're of a z configurations. Suppose it had two methyl groups on it. Okay. Then a few form those two bonds at once.

Speaker 1:          09:23          The, they'll still be [inaudible] here. Right. And there'll be sis in the product. That methyl groups. Okay. How about the dying? Suppose the dying had the e z configuration, so methyls that sits here and trans here. Okay. Then if we look at the transition state, it'll be still sis here and trans here. Right? And if we flatten that out, where will the methyls be in the product? How about there's going to be a methyl here on that carbon. Is it going to be pointing toward you or away when you flatten the ring out, if this is the way it's in the transition state, try to think of it mechanically. We break this bond, right? Is that going to be, when we flatten this, why don't we pull this up and flatten it out? Is that methyl going to be coming up toward us or back into the board?

Speaker 2:          10:17          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:19          This is a kind of mechanical thinking that that may be. It may be, it's usually, you know, they, they're, they're used. We used to require people to buy models. You know, these, you've seen those that you may and that probably helped with this mechanical, uh, perception. How many think it when you, when you flat and when you pull this up, the methyl there is going to be pointing towards you. How many think it's going to be pointed away? Ah, that's reassuring that the vast majority are right in this. It's coming towards you. Okay? So you can look at this in the privacy or room. Maybe use toothpicks and grapes or something to make a bottle and see how it twists like that. Okay. Now, how about this one? When you fold this up, what's it going to be at the bottom? Carbon is it? How many think it's going to be pointing towards?

Speaker 1:          11:10          You have the courage of your conviction. Okay. How many think it's going to be pointing in a way? The ways have it democracy wins again, that'd be okay. It's a way in that case. Okay, so you'd have a little practice to think about, about how such things work. And there'll be more of these as you go as we go along here. So those two methyls will be trans preserving the kind of relation they had in the starting material through that particular transition state. Okay. Now is that true? Okay, so here we take a muscle. First we'll look at Riggio chemistry, and then we're going to look at Stereo Chemistry. So Riggio chemistry. Okay. So now we could imagine this dye in the methyl substituted dying, uh, to be either approaching this way or to be upside down. It could be either way. Okay, so we're going to slide it over the top of the other one like that and make the new bonds.

Speaker 1:          12:10          And notice in this case, once we unfolded to unfold it, we're going to have to grab this bond. It's in the form of a you when it makes those new bonds on the left, you see like that one's on top ones on the bottom. They've made these new bonds here and we're going to have to unfold it like that to draw a normal picture of it, right? And when we do that, this methyl group is going to come over here. That is the new blue double bond is here on the right. But when we grab it and fold it out to the left, it's going to be there. Okay. So spatial perception is entering into the, is raising its ugly head. Now, and in this case, when we folded out, the methyls obviously going to be down right now. In fact, those two products form, right?

Speaker 1:          12:57          9% of this and 45% of this. Okay. Now, why is there so much more of this transition state than if that transition state, incidentally, notice that the dying, that the dying is not only over this double bond, it's also over the, as close as it can be to the COO double bond. There's a secondary interaction to the orbitals that makes it go that way. That's called Endo orientation. But don't worry about that. Uh, I struggled here how to do this to make it look realistic. That's the way it really does. Most people wouldn't draw it that way. They'd draw to approaching just, uh, just the die in here and the alkene on the right. And this would come in and that would come in and they draw the new bonds. Right? But really it approaches above. And that's, I think that's interesting. So that's why I took the trouble to draw it that way. But when you do that, you notice that the dying could be either such that it's close to the CEO to, or it could be out here so that if you look at it from the top, it can either be you or it could be an s right. And it prefers to be a you to have the dye in closer to the carbon eel. Okay. So given that that's true, why might you expect to get rather little of this and more of the bottom stuff? Any ideas? I Aisha.

Speaker 1:          14:25          Yeah. Even though the dying is attractive to that group on the bottom, which is why it's formed into a you rather than an s, right. You would also have it close in this case, but in the case on top, you have those two methyls on top of one another. So it looks like steric hindrance could explain this. Okay. But there's another possibility as well. Perhaps there's an intermediate, perhaps one bond forms first in the rate determining step and then a second bond forms. And you have this intermediate, which on this side is an anti and adjacent to a carbonyl group. So that's an anal eight and on the left it's Alec, right? Cause we can draw a resonance structure of that. Now, if that were true, if you had this intermediate, why might you predict getting more of this than have this more of the stuff on the bottom? Why is the one on the bottom of better? Al Lily Kinzer immediate Mary, do you have any idea? The only difference between the alley on the top and the alley on the bottom is where the methyl is in the top. It's on the middle carbon in the bottom. It's on a terminal carbon on the double bond. Let's think about the residents structure. You would draw Mary, were you about to say something?

Speaker 1:          15:53          Huh? In that resonance structure, this methyl is stabilizing that cat ion, right? Not In this case when it's on the middle carbon because the AL Lilly charges on one end or the other. So one could say that this is a more stable intermediate and therefore you'd get that. Or it could just be that at the train. The transition state is a little unsymmetrical. The way we showed in other cases where a bridge thing, like mercury wasn't in the middle, but a little toward one side. Okay. So it could just be that both bonds form at once, but not precisely in step with one another one a little more than the other. Now if it went through an intermediate, there's a test for it to see whether there's an intermediate. Because if you have an intermediate, then you would imagine that that could rotate here, right? So you could, this could move over here before it form the new bond, or indeed this one could rotate, could rotate around this bond and bring that instead of on the top where it is now on the bottom as it approaches this one.

Speaker 1:          16:56          So we could have these rotations that would change the stereochemistry of the product. So we can test that. So let's look at the stereo chemistry of the, now we've put two of these groups on and their sis to one another, right? And if we put that on top and make the new bonds and then fold it back, grabbed this new double bond, the one here and fold it back. We see that these two groups will be adjacent to one another sis. So we'd expect to assist product, right? And when we form those new red bonds, okay, so assists alkene should give us cis cyclohexene and that in fact forms in 68% yield. Okay? If you take the other, uh, stereo isomer of the Alkene, the Trans one and do the same trick, right? You get the Trans cyclohexene and that went in 84% yield, right?

Speaker 1:          17:56          And they don't give, they don't know what El, what isn't here. This is what you actually isolate and can sell to your neighbor, right? The, the uh, uh, that you don't form the wrong isomers so it doesn't rotate. So there's not an intermediate, okay. So the dying just sits down on the Ian at forms, the two sigma bonds simultaneously from the same phase right from the top here, right? So there's no rotatable intermediate with only one new sigma bond. So you didn't have this situation where you could rotate day. So it's a concerted reaction. You form both bonds at once. Okay. Now how about with respect to the dye in Stereo Chemistry? He, here we have II and III, the Trans arrangements around those two double bonds. So we put those on top for him, the new bonds. And you see that now as a drawn here, the product in [inaudible] 81% yield has everything sis, this carbon, this carbon, this carbon and this carbon. Now these two carbons in the ring being cis to one another, or not surprising, you couldn't make those trans, it would be too strange, but that their cysts to these right says that this had to be in the u form here, not the s form. And that these are both up shows that you formed the both bonds at once as shown here. And if you, this is another place for you to sit in your room and think about how these things will unfold and what four points in what direction.

Speaker 1:          19:35          Now if you take this, uh, EEZ, so e, z isomer and, and do the same trick, then in 15 hours and hundred 50 degrees, you get this to be trans instead of cysts. Okay? But notice the difference in conditions. This one happens in five minutes at 120 degrees. This one takes 15 hours at a, at a much higher temperature, 30 degrees Celsius, hotter, right? So there's something wrong. Something's slow about this reaction right now. Can we figure out what might be slow about that reaction? Why might it be bad to come in and do this?

Speaker 1:          20:26          Notice that that hydrogen and a methyl are near one another when we have the rotation around this single bond, so that these are adjacent to one another, right? So it would prefer the s trans con formation, s beans, the single bond in a dying between two double bonds. So it can be as or trans, right? So this prefers to be as trans, but to do the deals, alder reaction to it has to be CIS. So those terminal carbons can be near the same Ian. Right? So because it prefers to be this way, it's much harder. You have to put in an extra energy to make it [inaudible] as well as to do the reaction.

Speaker 1:          21:11          Okay. Now, just to show you some of the variety of the deals, all the reaction. It's not just simple compounds like the ones we showed here. You can use the settling. So if we do that trick in this one at 150 degrees, you get a dying Cyclo Hex, a dying product, because the subtlety and when it loses one of its bonds becomes an eed Nada, not a single bond. Okay. Or, or you can have a ring involved like this, right? And notice that that's the product and it's it, it happens very fast. That one molar concentrations, the half life or the equivalent of a half life is a second right at 20 at room temperature. Okay. Actually below room temperature. So, uh, have you ever seen a skeleton like that before?

Speaker 1:          22:02          Let me draw it a little differently. Row. Yeah. Rebel. See where you got. It's two names. Metathesis. All right. Right. This is, this is the starting with Joe. Wanted to add hydrogens there for the, for the metathesis polymerization, the ring opening metathesis. That's actually absolutely true. But I was thinking of an earlier example of it. Yeah. The Bartlett and knocks of skeleton could be made that way, right? So you could make by cyclic compounds, by a deals all the reaction. Or look at this one, this molecule, this, uh, uh, unsaturated Aldehyde is called a Kirlian. Right? And you can take two molecules of that and dimerize them. What's special about this one? How is it different from the other ones? What's special about the six membered ring?

Speaker 1:          22:58          It has an oxygen in it. It's not just carbons that could do this trick, right? So what they all have in common is they form a six membered ring with a double bond in it. Although if he used an acetylene, it could be two double bonds. But when you want to do a synthesis project and you see that there's a six membered ring with a double bond in that you think deals alder reaction, right? So you'll see if you can take it apart into an Ian and a die in that would do that kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          23:28          Uh, okay.

Speaker 1:          23:33          So, uh, the deals, all the reaction has this cyclical six electron transition state. The one we look at here, and we could actually, uh, look at the, at what the transition state looks like and the, and motion at the time the two bonds are being formed in parallel. So we have the homo in front and the Lubo behind, right. Or actually on top. Right. And those will interact to give a homeowner, not the homo, but the home. Oh, minus one. It turns out in the transition state, but it has this node right down the middle that both of the starting pieces had. Okay. And if you look at the, uh, at the Lumo on the bottom and the home on the top, then that they give the homo in the transition state, which doesn't have the node down the middle. Right? So that's how they go together and the transition state. And here we see, I think the emotion that's involved in doing the, going through the transition state, it's curious that the hydrogen stay more or less in place on the carbons, do most of the moving and forming the bonds. Okay. Now can we do the same thing with two alkenes? Could we take to al key and said, have them come together to form a cyclo butane? What do you think?

Speaker 2:          24:55          Any

Speaker 1:          24:56          thoughts on this one? How many electrons involved in this ring that we're making? The transition state when we're bringing these together and make them overlap? How many electrons are changing in this process?

Speaker 2:          25:15          Ayesha?

Speaker 1:          25:20          Yeah, there are two po, there's pie here and pie here. That's four electrons and they become these two bonds here. Two sigma bonds. So there are four electrons, not four, so it's four n where n is one not four. N Plus two is in the deals. All the reaction. So this one would have an anti aromatic transition state. Right? Of course. It also is strained here, so the reaction might be expected to go the other way, but that doesn't work either. It's the same transition state with four Pi electrons for electrons involved. So it doesn't work in either direction. On the other hand, if you, because another way of looking at is is the whole bowl of one is orthogonal to the Lumo of the other. That's the same analysis we did and showing why h two cat, they had to an hour.

Speaker 2:          26:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:08          But if we shine light on it, then we take an electron out of the Homo and put it into the Lubo and now you can get stabilization because you've changed the symmetry of what the orbitals are. So now in the excited state, the Homo can interact with the Lumo of the other one because you've changed it from Pi to Pi Star in Put in light in, right? So that it's when you shift an electron from the homo to the Lumo, then you can get the reaction to occur. And it's an important reaction for most people, right? Because this is a DNA double helix. On the right is a t, t, g, and on the left is Taa c, right? But if we look right here in the middle, we see two t's, right? So if we zoom in on that, we're looking on the air, this flat, we're looking in the plane of that thing.

Speaker 1:          27:01          Let's rotate it out toward you. So he looked down on those two tees, right? We'll look at that, just that bit of it and rotate it up. And that's what it looks like, right? And we could see what's in front and what's it back this way. And notice there's a double bond here and a double bond here that is a double bond here and a double bond here. Well, they react with one another to make a cycle of butane. No, because it's four Pi electrons that are involved, right? It's not an aromatic transition state. How could you make them react with one another? Pardon me? With light. Right? So if you use UVB and don't put on Sunscreen, then you get that reaction happening, right? And it forms a cycle of butane, right? And this thei mean photo dimerization to do that makes the chain kink of that chain where the two dimerized.

Speaker 1:          27:55          Right? And that inhibits DNA replication and transcription and is believed to be the main source of the mutations that give rise to melanomas. So that's why you put your sunscreen on that takes out UVB. It's to stop that, stop that photo. Dimerization a thymine. Okay. Uh, now we've been looking at cyclo additions, which is one class of these things where the para cyclic reactions where you can have aromatic transition states. And now we're going to look at the other kind, which is electro cyclic reactions where you start with a conjugated chain and curl it around to make a ring. So you could start with Cyclo with a hex, the trying and make a new bond at the bottom and shift the Pi bonds to make a cyclic compound. Cyclo hexidine right now of course you have groups that are substituted on the ends here, maybe just hydrogens that are in the plane, in the starting material, but in and out of the plane and the product.

Speaker 1:          28:57          So you're going to have to twist those carbons to make those things that are in plane out of plane. So changing the pie to the sigma bond requires a twist in one of two ways, right? You can either twist it this way where this comes up and that goes down, right? And that's called con rotation because as we look at it here, both of them are going counterclockwise in the same direction, right? Or we could go through this other geometry and rotate this one counter clockwise, but the one on the left clockwise, right? And that's called dis rotation there. Rotate in opposite directions. Either way would take these four groups here and make them in and out of the plane as they need to be to form a sigma bond. Is there a preference between these?

Speaker 3:          29:51          Okay,

Speaker 1:          29:52          well the Lotus, if you do it this way, that the, that the p orbitals that are on top and the starting material are bending in toward one another. The top of one end touches the top of the other end as they rotate in opposite directions, right? So that among these orbitals there's always going to be an even number of nodes, right? This has no nodes. But if you change the sign here to make this a, to make a note here, you'd have to have a node someplace else as well. So you have to have an even number of nodes. We saw that in in benzene too, right? So that's like these things that were involved in the hookup rule where you have where you ever ring and they all touch one another. On the top you have an even number of nodes, but if you twist in the opposite direction, then the top on the right touches the bottom on the left. And now as you go around, do you have an odd number of nodes? There's a node here between these two as they're beginning to touch, but no other nodes, right? So an odd number of nodes. So it's just the opposite of what hook hole is. Now what name shall we associate with that?

Speaker 3:          31:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:02          Have you ever seen something that looks like that? What's funny about it, you notice if you trace the top of it, you get a node where, where it has to change from red to blue. If red is one sign and blue as the other side of a p orbital, right? It had the twist. So one place there's a node as you go around this, if you drew a bunch of p orbitals on that, right? So you have to have an odd number of nodes if you have that connectivity. And I heard you say that, that's called a mobius strip. So the opposite of vocal is Mobius. Two different ways of doing this rotation to form the Sigma Bond Hook all the Mobius, okay? Now here's the transition state. That would, that would do the hook will right where the top is touching the top to form a sigma

Speaker 3:          31:52          bond, okay?

Speaker 1:          31:55          And notice that as you do that you preserve a mirror of symmetry,

Speaker 3:          32:00          okay?

Speaker 1:          32:01          On the left there's not a mirror. Do you see what symmetry there is on the left? What will change the left hand side of the molecule into the right hand side? What does it look like?

Speaker 3:          32:14          Things like this. It's like a propeller, right? If I could do it here. All right,

Speaker 1:          32:23          so it has an axis of symmetry that that happens all the way from the starting material of the product. So this has a mirror and this has an axis of symmetry. Now let's see what that does. Let's follow each orbital in the starting material as it becomes an orbital in product and see which one B, which starting material or but when it comes, which product orbital for these two different ways, the hookah whole connectivity where you always have a mirror of symmetry and the mobius where you always have an axis of symmetry. So of these six, uh, the six, you have six atomic orbitals here at p orbital here, here, here, here, here, here, six. We have six molecular orbitals, no nodes, one node to node, three nodes, four nodes, five nodes of which three are occupied by the three electron pairs, the same starting material over on the right.

Speaker 1:          33:14          And in the product we have four P orbitals in the conjugated system. So sky one, two, three, four, no nodes, one node to node three nodes. But we have a sigma and the sigma star in the product in both cases. But we have the question of where do the electrons that start here end up in the product? Okay, that's our question to track the Mos. Okay, so let's look first at Psi one and we'll use as a model the the aromatic analog hook, all connectivity where we're making, not not doing this reaction, but just looking at a benzene. This is what we did last time. Remember when we can, if we bring these two ends together, they'll touch here and that'll become more stable. So this one here goes down in the product. We looked at that last time. Okay, so that will happen here.

Speaker 1:          34:08          Here is at the transition state and you see that when you have the mirror that's happening, the ones that are red on top are overlapping here and it's going to build as it goes on toward product. This will get bigger and bigger because that's an important overlap. These pi over this, the Pi bonds back here get smaller and smaller and this orbital of the starting material, this one smoothly converts into Sigma through that transition state. Okay? So cy one becomes sigma. Now think about it on the left, right as you begin to do it, as you rotate them in opposite directions, the bottom here touches the top here. That's going toward a sigma star Anti Bond, right? Not toward a bond. In fact, how it avoids going way, way up and energy. That electron pair is to decrease the size in front and increase it in back, right?

Speaker 1:          35:04          But what it increases in back, it doesn't, uh, it, it forms psy one, right? It makes the node lists set of four here, right? So this one doesn't go to sigma the way it did here it goes to cy one. Now let's look at there are three pairs of electrons we're talking about. That's the lowest one of the starting material. Let's look at the next one, right? As we've brought, brought it together in the, in the, uh, to make a ring in the aromatic case, right? That was unfavorable anti-bonding. So in fact, this pair of electrons went up in energy, okay? And if we look here, we see the same thing, right? This, the society to where we're starting is ending up in a Pi. Orbital notice it's decreasing in front and increasing in back, but with the node because of that mirror. So it's not psy one the lowest, the one where all the p's are in phase is the one that has a node in the middle.

Speaker 1:          36:08          So it goes to the side two of the product, but over on this side, it goes to sigma, right? Cause that that ones, if it had a node here in the beginning, right now, the red on the bottom and red on the top are touching one another. So that's good to make sigma. Okay? Now let's look at the third electron pair. And we saw that in the aromatic system, it went down in energy, right? And in this case, here it is. It's the transition state and it's going down in energy. And in fact, it's going to form psy one. It's not so easy to see that here, but you can, uh, uh, but you can see that it's decreasing in front at least. Okay? I admit that. That's hard to see on the other side. Over here. It's going to, it's going to decrease in front because that's an anti-bonding interaction.

Speaker 1:          36:59          But the thing it's getting in back is blue, red and red. It's got two nodes. So it's not going to sigh one, we've already done that. It's not going to decide to which has only one node. It's going to cy three, which has two nodes and that is terrible, right? Those electrons are head. These sort of cancel one another, but these are going way upstairs. Whereas over here these two sort of canceled one another, but this is going downstairs. So it's much easier to do the hook hole than it is Mobius. If you have three electron pairs, notice that if you had only two electron pairs, you'd have this which more or less cancels versus uh, if you had only two electron pairs, this one goes up more so the, so, so it goes the other way. Okay. We can also look at what would happen with the other orbitals. Right? And notice that if we took an electron from here and put it into here, then it's going to go down in energy. So photo chemically we could make it prefer the left path with six electrons.

Speaker 3:          38:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:11          So again, that's what actually happens thermally in the normal reaction is that it's the hookup with six electrons, not mobius.

Speaker 3:          38:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:22          So dis rotation is preferred for a six electron shift so that if you have methyls like that, the two methyls will end up on the same side. Say if this one rotates up, this one also rotates up. That is if it's my little fingers, they go like that. They rotate in opposite directions. Right? Not In the same direction where one would go up in the other down. Okay. So stereochemistry shows you that it formed and notice that the cyst is the less stable isomer. It's not forming that because it's more stable. It's forming it despite the fact that it's less stable because it prefers to do that. That's foreign plus two. So how could you study whether the opposite con rotation would occur? Like, like, like uh, like this, right. If it were four and electrons, what system would you look at? How would you get four electrons rather than six?

Speaker 1:          39:21          What starting material would you use? Any ideas here? You start with hexa trying. So what are you going to use Nathan? The dying. Beauty. Dying. Okay. So we'll do this. We'll start with the beauty die in that has methyl substituted. So we know Stereo Chemistry and we expect that then to do if it does, let's see. So we got a methyl on the right here and on the left here, right? And if they go do con rotation, they'll call them out on the same side. Okay? So that's what we'll do. But there's a problem. And the problem is this, this reaction is exothermic by 16 kilocalories cause you're converting a Pi bond into a sigma bond. But up above it's not so great because you're forming a cyclo butane, which is strained and that is uphill 11 kilocalories per mole. The reaction won't work.

Speaker 3:          40:24          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          40:24          that's not so great. So we can't do that reaction. Right? We can't study it with that system. Right. Wrong. We can run it the other direction. Start with the dive methyl Cyclo, butane and s and C, which, which, uh, Buda dying at forums because it's the same transition state when you run one way and the other. If you have a certain transition state that's low, you can access it not only coming in this direction but also that same low wind coming back. Right? So we can do the same test starting with the sick leave form and coming back. Okay. And that was done by Brown and Archie in 1972 and it's interesting to see how they made the compound. This is what they needed, right? That cis dive methyl psycholo butane. How did they make it? They made it starting with a cyclo audition where an acetylene adds to a double bond to give us Cyclo beauty.

Speaker 1:          41:21          Right. And it had these carbons attached to it, which then they reduced off. We'll talk about that reaction later. And they made the Oah is a good leaving group with Atossa late and then they used h minus to do the displacement, convert that into methyl. Okay. But the Greek crucial reaction was this cyclo edition. How does that look to you to add a triple bond to a double bond to make a four membered ring? Good or bad? Bad. It's foreign electrons. Two Pi bonds coming together. Right? But what do you notice? How did they make it work? They wanted to do that. What was special?

Speaker 1:          41:59          It's a four electron cyclo edition. That should be bad, but they used light to do it. So they've put the electron into the orbital of opposite symmetry and now it will work. Okay, so this is, so we already saw that that forms the less site stabilize summer, but in their x, so it's dis rotation with six electrons. But this is the experiment they did right? At 280 degrees. It's not an easy reaction. The reaction, the ring opened up and they got this isomer as expected. So this rotated in to the right and this rotated out to the right. It's con rotation, right? Like that. So it's a dis rotation with six electrons con rotation with four. And then what was special about them was not only did they measure that that was 99.9% they measured how much of the other one there was. There was about point double o 5% this was really, really careful work they did.

Speaker 1:          43:01          It's an interesting paper to read. So that says that and notice that this is the less stable isomer, right? Because it has a bond where these are both trans, right? So there's the bias that favors, that's 99.92 point double o five is 11 kilocalories per mole. But the bias in favor of this kind of rotation must be even higher because it's being, it's being hurt by the fact that this one is strained. So it's something greater than 11 kilocalories per mole favoring the transition state for con rotation in the, in that which supports what we predicted by theory. And if you have an eight membered ring with four double bonds in it, that reaction happens at minus 10 degrees. And again, and it's, it's uh, it rotates like that. It's a con rotation. So it's con rotation for four n electrons here or here and is zero and is one, but it's dis rotation for four n plus two here. So it's what we expected for these electro cyclic reactions. And we can look at the, uh, at the transition states for the two and see that, uh, that, that uh, uh, that's, that's what would happen if you could run it forwards. Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:21          And there's a transition state. This is the same kind of thing we did before. I'm not going to dwell on this now. Okay. Now, but a particular example of that kind of thing is opening dewar Benzie do you remember last semester we talked about doer who sent to calculate these models of all the different possible structures for benzene? And one of them was this, which came to be called dewar benzene, even though he didn't advocate that as a structure of benzene, he thought it was this the same way other people did. But he said it's a conceivable structure of benzene. Right? But notice that this one would be strained and that one would be stable. So if you could go from this to this, if you could get this, it would be way downhill and energy, right? Because this is unusually stable being aerobatic, this is unusually stay disciplined, unstable, because it has two, four membered rings, right?

Speaker 1:          45:11          So it would really help to do that. So it should be a really easy reaction. It really wants to open up how does it, well, in 2004, there was a paper where they calculated the energy, four isomers of benzene, and they had all these isomers of benzene. There's benzene, and there were 218 isomers. Right? And in fact, 84 of them are calculated to be within a hundred kilo benzenes the lowest one. But there are many within the strength of a bond above it, right? And in fact, six of them have been prepared, right? And, but they, they don't go to benzene because breaking a single bond, they have, uh, uh, these are more than a hundred kilocalories above. So if you could go to benzine by breaking a bond, it would be very favorable. But you can't because if you look at these structures, breaking of bond, single bond won't take you to benzine.

Speaker 1:          46:07          You'd have to break more bonds than that, okay. However, dewar benzene, which is this one here, right, is 74 kilocalories of Bev benzene. And you only have to break one bond to make it change into benzene, right? But it lasts for two days at room temperature. Why doesn't it go away down hill? Okay. How was it prepared? It was prepared by Van tab one and Papa's in 1963 and they did it, you notice by a site, by an electro cyclic reaction where they take a dying and make it into a cycle of beauty, right? And it's, it had Davey dis rotation, so they used light to do it again. Another example, okay. But it has a half life of two days at room temperature, whereas this one, which is only 11 kilocalories exothermic, right? And this one and this, remember that was the one that had to be heated to 280 degrees in order to go, right?

Speaker 1:          47:12          So that one has a barrier of 33 kilocalories from all. But this one, only 25 not what you would expect on a simple analysis. So it's 66 kilocalories more exothermic, but only eight kilocalories per mole. Faster. It is faster, but not very much faster. Okay, so this one notice opens con rotatory we talked about that. That's what Brownman showed. But, and that's what you expect for for eh, for an electronics where add a zero for where, uh, we're in, is to, to make to the two double bonds. Okay. But in this case and that the homos and Lumos work there, but in this case, if you want to open it up to make benzene, this has to go that way. And that has to go that way to become planer. If one of them went the other direction, you'd have really weird bond angles. Benzine would look like this.

Speaker 1:          48:08          Instead of being a hexagon, it would look like this if you rotated the wrong way. So you have to rotate it in the wrong way to do that. But wait a second, how many electrons here? There's going to be one of that p orbital one there. One here, one here, one here. That's six, six Pi electrons is supposed to be dissertation. Right? Shouldn't that work? No. It looks like there's something more fundamental. It's more fundamental that when you're breaking the sickness, this bond here and making sigma star, it doesn't overlap with the homos here and here. Right. To stabilize. So even though it's the right number of electrons, the homos of Lumos aren't right. Relining up. Right. So it's not, it's not numerology we're fundamentally interested in. It's whether homos at lumos matched to get stability. Okay. And, uh, the next topic is going to be spectroscopy and we'll get to that next Wednesday after the exam on Monday.
