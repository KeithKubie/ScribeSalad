He's a well accomplished computer
scientist entrepreneur and has held

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.010
several other academic and government
leadership positions. Known for his deep

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.059
engagement with students and his

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.459
on campus, Dr. Jahanian has already had
an enormous impact at CMU.

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:21.990
Good evening!

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.519
As one of the top institutions in the
world, we're a really hard-working place,

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.529
there's no question about that. But at
Carnegie Mellon, when we talk about work,

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.200
we mean something a little different.
We're actively engaged in work that matters.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.480
We're at the forefront of bringing 
people together from diverse backgrounds --

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.320
in science, in engineering, humanities, 
public policy, business, the arts --

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.210
to address the pressing issues
facing society. We're positioned like no

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.860
other institution to define and manage
the space where technology and human life

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.480
intersect, and to train the next
generation to solve the problems of global significance.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:14.800
This new era will be fueled by ideas, by breakthroughs 
in new materials and digital technologies and robotics.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.159
How do we contribute to this innovation economy? 
Well, it's through the startups that have come

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.320
out of these universities. It's also
creating a entrepreneurial environment

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.820
where entrepreneurs and innovators want
to come to Pittsburgh and be here.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:35.940
He had his hands in everything good at Carnegie
Mellon, and there is no question that in the few years

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:44.230

he has made lasting impacts to this institution.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:53.460
