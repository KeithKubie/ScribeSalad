&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.450
&gt;&gt; Travis Hensley: Though Robert
Burns is most commonly known

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.390
as Scotland's national poet,
he also made a big impact

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.110
in the United States of
America during the late 18th

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.040
and 19th centuries.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.360
In this lecture, Dr. Sood
discusses the complex way

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.220 position:56%
that multifaceted cultural memory
of Robert Burns in the United States

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.000
of America from 1800 to 1900.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.510
Please join me in welcoming
Arun Sood.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.790
[ Applause ]

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.090
&gt;&gt; Arun Sood: Thank you very much.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.490
And thank you all for coming.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.240
I really appreciate that.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.290
I also want to begin by paying my
debt to the people and institutions

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.920
who have enabled me to undertake
the research that I am going

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.850
to present here today,
in particular the staff

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.720
and everyone associated
with the Kluge Center.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.450
As Travis mentioned, this is
actually my second stint here.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.750
I was here during my PhD,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.250
and I can't overstate how
helpful it has been both in terms

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.950
of my own research and also
my career development --

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.150
and also through collegial
bonding in the sense

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.400
that I have made some great
friends here, friends for life,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.870
some of who are in the
room and some who are

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.270
in different parts of the world.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.040
So to Travis, to Mary Lou, to
Dan, to everyone associated

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.990
with the Kluge Center, I just
want to say a big Thank You.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.610
I'd also like to thank
the Fulbright Commission

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.650
for facilitating this
particular research trip.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.000
I feel very lucky to be part
of a program that is centered

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.070
around cultural exchange,
particularly when we live in an age

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.110
where exchange between different
people from different places,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.230
different cultures, different
countries, is so vital.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.630
And I hope that some of
my research into Scotland

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.260
and America's historical
literary connections gives back

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.660
at least a little bit
to a program that seeks

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.790
to enhance understanding
between cultures.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.000
Part of the pleasure of working
here at the Kluge Center is working

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.290
with such a broad range of
scholars in a confined space.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.400
I am sure the Kluge Fellows
who are in the room would agree

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.540
that when you have the likes of a
national biologist, a religion of -

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.750 position:56%
a historian of religion, a political
scientist, a film director,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.210
working all in a very small space,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.230
it makes for a very
stimulating research environment

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.580
and you get some great
conversations.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.230
Equally, however, I realize that
there will be varying degrees

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.720
of familiarity and also interest
in the subject of my talk today --

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.700
the 18th-century poet and
song collector, Robert Burns.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.230
So to ease us into this
lecture, I want to start

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.950
by playing a song that, perhaps
if you don't know the words,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.330
you will know the melody
to, just to demonstrate

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.520
in a way how Burns's work continues
to be remediated and is probably

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.940
in the collective memory
of us all in some sense.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.490
&gt;&gt; Should old acquaintance be
forgot and never brought to mind?

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:57.250
Should old acquaintance be
forgot, and days of auld lang syne?

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.010
For auld lang syne, my
dear, for auld lang syne,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:14.390
we'll tak' a cup o' kindness
yet, for auld lang syne.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.000
&gt;&gt; Arun Sood: That was, of course,
Burns's lament on times past

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.880
and old friendships parted --

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.350
"Auld Lang Syne," which
I'm sure you're familiar

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.200
with through it being played at
New Year in various locations

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.520
around the world, and of course

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.040
at New York during the
Times Square ball drop.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.210
And in fact Stephen
Winick, who is here today

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.550
from the American Folklife Center,
has written an excellent blog

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.150
on "Auld Lang Syne"

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.360
which I recommend looking
up for more context.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.480
I partly played it, though, because
there is a much-neglected verse

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.240
of Burns's "Auld Lang Syne"
that I think helps to frame part

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.900
of my big project as a whole.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.850 position:56%
In Verses 3 and 4, Burn's speaker --

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.550
lamenting on a lost friendship
separated by time, space,

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.820 position:56%
and geophysical separation -- states
"We twa hae paidl'd in the burn,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.250 position:56%
Frae morning sun till dine; But seas

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.650
between us braid hae roar'd,
Since auld lang syne."

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.370 position:56%
So here Burns's speaker talks of how
seas between us broad have roared.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.490
There is a broad sea roaring
between themself and a friend --

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.810
and that sea, of course,
being the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.370 position:56%
And this is a good reminder for me
in one of Burns's most popular songs

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.440
that Burns lived in and responded
to what Laura Doyle called

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.620 position:56%
"a transnational world of encounters
on the Atlantic periphery."

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.090
It was not just people
that moved back and forth

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.600
across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.670 position:56%
It was songs, poetry, objects,
political thought; the list goes on.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.860
So in many ways, what that verse is
a microcosm of is that Burns lived

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.360
in and responded to a
transnational world.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.910
And it's part of my
project to reconsider Burns

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.320
as a transnational
poet in the context

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.320
of the United States of America.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.540
I do this partly because for much

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.310
of the 20th century Burns
was often considered a poet

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.090
of limited linguistic range
and geographical significance.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.280
He was often considered
a backwards dialect poet

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.290
who only really had
significance beyond -

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.310
within the borders of Scotland.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.000
His international significance,
his literary devices,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.720 position:56%
his broader oeuvre was not really
appreciated or recognized critically

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.610
with the borders of Scotland.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.460
So I am following on from some
peers and scholars and superiors,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.020
mainly at the University
of Glasgow, who have taken

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.470
to reconsidering Burns in
a transnational context.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.280
And I am doing so in the context
of the United States specifically.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.760
So my broader big project
looks at the reception,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.480
the literary influence,
and the cultural memory

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.030
of Burns in 19th-century America.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.950
And it's the cultural memory
aspect that I want to focus

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.510
on for the remainder
of the lecture today.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.340
Before I do so, I want to
say something very briefly

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.250
about how the memory of Burns
and the legacy of Burns continues

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:35.180
to be very contested -- arguably
more so than any other British

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.130
or even worldwide 18th-century
literary figure.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.070
The popular legacy of Burns
constantly straddles these

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.570
boundaries between
history, memory, and myth.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.640
And this often plays out
in the political arena.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.940
So to give you an example,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:58.130 position:56%
the memory of Burns during the 2014
Scottish independence referendum was

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.440
continually squabbled over.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.770
You had the Yes campaign
on one hand, who maintained

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.140
that Burns would have voted
for an independent Scotland.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.610
And we all - meanwhile we
also had the No campaign,

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.460
who tried to appropriate him and
his works into their arguments.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.100
Now this was, of course,
a highly speculative

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.480
and at times tedious debate.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.150
And I think it's summed up
well by this poetic flighting

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.190
between the former UK Prime
Minister David Cameron

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.510
and the former First Minister
of Scotland, Alex Salmond.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:09:24.510
[ Inaudible Audio Recording ]

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.560
[ Laughter ]

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.540
So though this is definitely comic,

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.640
it still illustrates the
continuing symbolic power of Burns

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.170
and his works in that these two
widely divergent politicians

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.800
and parties felt it necessary to
somehow enlist him and his works

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.240
into their arguments in order
to persuade their votership.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.030
And in fact, the same thing -

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.040
a similar thing happened the
following year during the 2015 UK

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.070
general election.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.230
There were voting booths in
Scotland for the Scottish branch

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.420
of the United Kingdom
Independence Party --

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:06.210
UKIP, a right-wing populist
party, that had Burns's -

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.710
lines from Burns's "Dumfries
Volunteers" emblazoned on it.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.010 position:56%
Meanwhile, the opposing Scottish
Nationalist Party had launched their

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.310
campaign on his birthday.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.760
So once again, a repeat
of the 2014 referendum.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.140
There is a tug of war, if you
like, between the legacy of Burns.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:29.140
Now to flip back to the
19th-century United States,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.730
the memory of Burns
was equally contested,

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.250
multiflorous, and complex.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.340
The idea that Burns's
rise to popularity

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.360
in 19th-century America was
because he was a republican poet

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.950
and a friend to liberty had
been both popular and enduring,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.340
partly due to the frequency
with which he has been yoked

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.000
with ideological praise
from influential Americans

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.730
such as Walt Whitman,
Emerson, and Abraham Lincoln.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:02.800
Walt Whitman says of Burns, in 1888
for example, "There are many things

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.390
in Burns's poems and character that
specially endear him to America.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.810
He was essentially a republican
who would have been at home

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:15.620
in the western United States and
probably become eminent there."

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.280
While in a written
memoranda on Robert Burns,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:24.370
Abraham Lincoln remarked, "I
cannot frame a toast to Burns.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.800
I can say nothing worthy
of his generous heart

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.290
and transcendent genius."

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.580
However, groups and individuals
as divergent as Frederick Douglass

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.860 position:56%
and even the Ku Klux Klan among
many others also held their own very

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.400
idiosyncratic 19th-century
memories of Burns

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.120 position:56%
that were simultaneously articulated
through speeches, essays, dinners,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.300
and other forms of
objectified culture.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.570
Regularly implicit in these
articulations of remembrance,

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.540
however, was the subjective
promotion

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.940
of group and individual values.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.610
Where Frederick Douglass
remembered Burns as being kin

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.380
to an African-American slave who
had "broke loose from the moorings

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.360
which society had thrown
around him,"

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.450
the first Ku Klux Klan used the
recitations of Burns's "To A Louse"

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.390
in a - as a rite of initiation
and incorporated other elements

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.080
of his poetry into their
founding constitutional document.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.440
Now these examples are obviously
very polarizing and powerful

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.150
and admittedly require
much further context

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.170
and analysis, which I will go into.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.290 position:56%
But nonetheless, pointing out such
deviations in literary appropriation

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.430
and memory unquestionably
renders Burns a worthy subject

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.060
when discussing the
complex interrelationships

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.980
between memory, history,
and identity.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:56.610
To help us make sense of the weird
and complex commemoration of Burns

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.340
in the 19th century, then, I'd
like to turn to some theory

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.950
with specific regards to
the term "cultural memory."

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.080
Employed and appropriated
across disciplines as diverse

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.420
as literature, neuroscience,
and philosophy,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.580
the term cultural memory has
become academically convoluted

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.320
in recent years.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.560
And literary studies often
refers to how memory or knowledge

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.660
about past events -- authors,
events, people or things --

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.010
are preserved through cultural
means in any given space or place.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.110
In referring to the cultural
memory of Burns in the U.S., then,

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.570
one might think of the term as an
umbrella for considering the ways

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.220 position:56%
in which American society -- through
festivals, songs, ritual, texts,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.640 position:56%
biographies, rights, or otherwise --
remembered the poet and his works.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.800 position:56%
This use of the term broadly derives
from a reinvigorated interest in

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.550
and response to Maurice
Halbwachs' 20th century concept

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.110
of collective memory, or
"La Memoire collective."

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.020
Formulated in the same period
that Freud famously began

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.640
to introduce memory theory
through metapsychology,

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.630
Halbwachs challenged Freud's
view of memory being a resource

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.590
of the individual psyche,
arguing that it operates according

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:20.170
to social rather than a
psychological dynamic.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.920
Halbwachs suggested that
perceptions of the past, or people,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.850
are continually revised by
social forces that act upon us

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.310 position:56%
and moderate our present conceptions
of any given object or person.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.570
The dynamics of social
structures, families, demographics,

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.500 position:56%
social classes, and religious sects,
for example, determine the ways

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.740
in which we remember the
past, creating a shared memory

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.140
and a shared identity
that might differ

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.020
from the collective
memory of other groups.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.800
And it's this idea that led
Halbwachs to distinguish

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.260
between what he felt was memory
and history, where history

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.350
or historical knowledge about the
past is a set of generalized facts

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.360
that follow some sort of
fixed standardization --

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.000
say, for example, the birth
and the death dates of Burns.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.130
Collective memory contains
a subjective dimension

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.270
and promotes a sense of
identity which is intimately tied

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.190
to a particular group
and its value --

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.710
which, when you frame
it in this context,

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.110
might explain why different
groups and individuals

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.170
within 19th-century
American would remember Burns

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.840
in widely divergent ways.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.520
Expanding on Maurice
Halbwachs' model,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.550
Jan Assmann has put forth the idea

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.100
that collective memory
might be split

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.660
into two further interrelated
categories: communicative memory,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.200
which is based on everyday oral
communication; and cultural memory,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.080
which forms when living
communication crystallizes

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.660
in the form of objectified culture.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.150
In other words, where
communicative memory is articulated

00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:01.530
by active participants, cultural
memory relies on symbolization

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.280
and requires what he calls
"institutions of preservation"

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.880
such as relics, books, statues,
and other modes of objectification.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.650
Now admittedly the incisive
categorical tagging here

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.380
of communicative memory
being primarily transmitted

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.100
through oral means and
cultural memory as stemming

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.210
from objectified culture can be
misleading, partly due to the fact

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.950
that cultural memory can also be
preserved or inscribed orally.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.860
So whereas, say, biographies
and statues of Burns

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.090
in 19th-century American might
be the more obvious examples

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.480
of what we would call
"cultural memory"

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.000
in that they were obviously
objectified, it's also important

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.660
to consider historically
significant oral accounts.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.450 position:56%
An example of this might be to think

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.870
of Ralph Waldo Emerson's
orally transmitted 1859 speech

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.340
on the centenary of Burns's birth.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.410
Despite frequently referring to
his memory of Burns, it was not --

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.860
as would be the case for
a communicative memory --

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.430
a living autobiographical
embodied memory.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:12.060
He did not know Burns or have a
firsthand account of the poet.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.480
Instead, Emerson's memory was
shaped by existing institutions

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.800
of preservation such as
the centenary itself,

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.280
the Boston Burns Club, or
biographical texts on Burns.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.910
And this comes through in the
way that Emerson describes Burns

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.940
as being kin to the armed
and privileged minorities

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.720
who worked politically in
the American Revolution.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.810
Here, Emerson's individual memory
clearly reflects the influence

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.700 position:56%
of wider social structures -- namely
ideologically tinted biographies

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.090
that depicted Burns
as a revolutionary

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.820 position:56%
and the Boston Burns Club, which
prided itself on political idealism,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.120
particularly with regards

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.980
to the recently formed
Republican Party of the 1850's.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.770
Though Burns did make
references towards the outcome

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.490
of the American Revolution
in some of his poems,

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.890
the manner in which he is
fervently remembered and likened

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.140
to American revolutionaries at the
Parker House Hotel clearly smacks

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.340
of a memory source being remodified
into an idealized image --

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.350
which is directly in line
with Halbwachs' theory.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:21.810
Moreover, though Emerson's
memory was orally transmitted,

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.410
its ceremonial communication

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.790
at the Parker House Hotel
effectively formed another

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.330
institutional preservation in that
his speech is to be remembered,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.270
transcribed, and disseminated
widely for generations to come --

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:40.500 position:56%
to the point where we sit here, or I
stand here, talking about it today.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.890 position:56%
Perhaps the most striking
competition over the memory of Burns

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.240
in the 19th century was

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.790
between African-American
abolitionist Frederick Douglass

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.280
and opposing groups and individuals

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.030
from the slaveholding states
of the American South.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.110
There has been a recent surge
of interest in the speeches

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.180 position:56%
that Douglass delivered in
Scotland during his antislavery tour

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.210
of Britain and Ireland
in the 1840's,

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.820
primarily due to the
continuing scholarly attempts

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.540
to recover the memory
of Scottish connections

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.990 position:56%
with slavery and the Black Atlantic.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.540
It was during this tour that
Douglass visited the birthplace

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.460
of Burns in 1846 and
wrote an essay titled

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.540
"A Fugitive Slave Visiting The
Birthplace Of Robert Burns."

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:31.860
A fuller examination of Douglass's
account reveals the extent

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.200
to which his individual memory was
shaped by social political tensions

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.580
and in particular abolitionist
discourses.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.460
It would be a stretch or
even an injustice to suggest

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.590
that Douglass systematically
constructed his written memory

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:51.260
of Burns to bolster white
Scottish support for the movement.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.230
Douglass was long acquainted
with Burns's poetry,

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.600
having purchased the
1833 Philadelphia edition

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.130
as his first book after
his escape from slavery.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.770
And he'd later gifted it
to his son as a keepsake

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.080
over three decades later, in 1867.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.900
Yet the rhetorical and
thematic parallels between

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.830
"A Fugitive Slave Visiting
The Birthplace Of Burns"

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.870
and his contemporary oratory
proclamations in 1846 still serve

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.830 position:56%
to highlight a distinct correlation
between Douglass's individual memory

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.540
and the social discourses
that surrounded him.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.680
To drive home the point, it's worth
juxtaposing a speech Douglass gave

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.830
in Paisley with his
account of Burns.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.700
Where Douglass describes Burns
as being trapped in "the moorings

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.050
which society had thrown
around him,"

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:50.040
African-Americans were described in
Paisley as "clanking their chains

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.770
and calling upon Britons
to aid them."

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:59.180
Where Burns lived "in the midst
of a bigoted and besotted clergy,"

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.370
the Paisley speech condemned
the bigotry of a church that

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.120
"comes forward and holds up the
slaveholder as being Christian."

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:13.590 position:56%
Douglass's description of how Burns
battled a corrupt generation plagued

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:18.880
by "a shallow-brained aristocracy"
also resonates with his protests

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.970
in Paisley against "the man whose
pockets are lined with the gold

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.510
with which I ought to
have been educated."

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:32.890
The theme of pious hypocrisy
is also implicit throughout.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.250
Acknowledging the poet's alleged
misgivings, Douglass maintained

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.470
that Burns was "yet more faultless
than many who have come down to us

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.130
in the pages of history as saints."

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:48.560
In a similar condemnation
in Paisley, he remarked,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.330
"The Free Churches do more
for infidelity and atheism

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.730
than all infidels in
Scotland combined."

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:01.420
Douglass's targeted attack on
the Free Church of Scotland,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.740
founded in 1843 after the Great
Destruction, was the result

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.440
of Free Church of Scotland
missionaries accepting monetary

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.180
donations from American
slaveholders in order to spread -

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.460
basically develop the Church
and develop the congregation.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:21.280 position:56%
This partly inspired Douglass's
tour of Scotland, which became known

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.200 position:56%
as the "Send Money Back" campaign --

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.200 position:56%
when taking a moment to reflect on
that, it was truly an incredible act

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.190
of transatlantic humanitarian
activism

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.140
on the part of Frederick Douglass.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.990
In order to acquire the
fullest understanding

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:43.270 position:56%
of the social discourses that shaped
Douglass's memory of Burns, then,

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.770
it's crucial to acknowledge that
his written account was composed

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.920
at the height of his mission to
exert pressure on the United States

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.750
by increasing international
sympathy and support for abolition

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.280
and condemning the slave-based
economy which was continuing

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.550
to benefit the Free
Church of Scotland.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.900
These ardent concerns and social
political factors permeate his

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.000
memory of Burns, as the poet
is symbolically enlisted

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
into Douglass's powerful
discourse on slavery and abolition.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.900
Now the posthumous use
of Burns by Douglass

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.660
and other prominent 19th-century
abolitionists remains an

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.510
uncomfortable topic given the
poet's increasingly debated

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:34.790
and somewhat ambiguous attitudes
towards slavery and abolition.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:39.230 position:56%
Burns, after all, had signed up to
sail to Jamaica prior to the success

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.580
of his first volume of poetry.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.840
And he certainly cannot be
counted among the most prominent

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.470
18th-century abolitionists
in Scotland.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.390
Indeed, there is an
uncomfortable conflict

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.630
between a man whose poetry is
predominantly the egalitarian

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.990
and humanitarian in nature, and
yet who also seems to refrain

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:03.380
from any abolitionist discourse
and had proposed to undertake a job

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.240
as a bookkeeper on a
Jamaican plantation.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.620
Either way, the discussion
of Burns and slavery

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.550
and abolition itself reveals
much about the selective dynamics

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:20.000
of cultural memory and
collective remembrance.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.150
That the reprinting of
Douglass's letter functioned --

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.780
and continues to function --

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.790
as an institution of
preservation is clear is

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.490
that it's influenced several
subsequent transatlantic

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.990
constructions of the poet.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:37.080
Maya Angelou, for example, also
made a pilgrimage to Burns country

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.400
and identified the poet as the
first white man who "understood

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.100 position:56%
that a human being was human being,
and we are more alike than unalike."

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:51.680
Even in the 21st century, we
might then view, for example,

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.990
Kofi Annan's enlistment of
Burns into a global canon

00:24:54.990 --> 00:25:00.650
of humanitarianism
with renewed interest.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.670
Speaking in 2004 at the United
Nation headquarters in New York,

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.860
Annan described Burns
as "an opponent

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.370
of slavery, pomposity and greed."

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:15.360
Rather than doggedly
attempt to defend, condemn,

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.040
or verify such a statement, it
might serve us well in terms

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.190
of historical understanding
of working memories

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.950
to consider more fully the
cultural mechanisms at work

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.000
by the ongoing remediation and
construction of these memories.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.850
To further illustrate the selective
dynamics of cultural memory

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:39.980
in 19th-centry America, we might
turn to explore an opposing and,

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.370
indeed, far less palatable
form of commemoration

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.630
in Pulaski, Tennessee, 1865.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.440
In a ceremonial induction
for potential members

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.270
of the newly formed white
supremacist fraternity,

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.970
the Ku Klux Klan, Burns's

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.950
"To A Louse" was incorporated
as a rite of initiation.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:05.810
The Klan historian Martin Gitlin
has described the process:

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.010
"A skullcap with donkey's
ears sewn on it was placed

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.940
on the head of a candidate.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.130
He was then escorted to a large
dressing mirror the Klan dubbed

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.390
as the 'royal altar' in
order to recite a poem

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.180
by Scotsman Robert Burns.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.850
The blindfold was then removed
to reveal to the candidate

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.480
that he had literally
been dressed up as an ass,

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.790
much to the amusement
of the Klansmen.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:33.670
The embarrassed man could then
accept or deny membership.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.220
Most agreed to join, with those

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.770 position:56%
in the financially depressed rural
areas showing a particular interest.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:45.600
In addition to this, the
first constitutional document

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.040
of the Ku Klux Klan also
reveals a Burnsian influence.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.100
Printed secretly in the office
of "The Pulaski Citizen" in 1867,

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.120
the prescript begins with two
unattributed literary quotes:

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.840
one from Shakespeare's "Hamlet,"
along with an altered stanza

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.470
from Burns's "Address to the Deil."

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:11.540
In the verse you can see there,
Burns's original use of Burns's

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.220
"'rantin' - bardie's rantin,
drinkin'" is replaced with "ghoul"

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:20.000
to denote the white-cloaked
members of the organization who --

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.510
as outlined in the document -- were
to meet in dens under the command

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.930
of the Grand Wizard of the Empire.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.530
In addition to the dark
canting [phonetic] connotations

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.680
of an inebriated ranting ghoul,

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.030
it's likely that the
stanza was also chosen

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:39.310
for its degenerative
reference to a black pit.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.450
Now the question of why
Burns's poetry was adopted

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:48.120 position:56%
by vengeful Confederate veterans
intent on venting their frustrations

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.270
on African-Americans
merits further discussion,

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:56.550
particularly when juxtaposed with
the simultaneous use Burns's work

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.160
in abolitionist discourses
of the period.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:05.770
On one hand, the first Ku Klux Klan
initiation ceremony might be viewed

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.470
as mere comical farce
in its primary purpose

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.750
of entertaining existing
members of the organization.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.430
In this view, Burns and his poem
may not have been considered

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:19.640
as holding any major thematic or
political significance in relation

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.170
to white supremacist ideals.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:26.860
The recitation of the lines "O
wad some Power the giftie gie us,

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.280
to see oursels as ithers see us!"

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.830
complied with the prank
which culminated

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.960
in the potential new member
finally seeing himself humiliated

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.560
in a large dressing mirror as
others did -- dressed up as an ass.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.530 position:56%
Yet wholly reducing the Ku Klux Klan
rite to mere farce would be ignorant

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:50.330
of both the constitutional use
of "Address to the Deil" and,

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.380
more broadly, the extent to
which Scottish writers, imagery,

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.280
and iconography played a part

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.020
in shaping the identity
of Southern extremists.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.270
There is much evidence to suggest
that as Confederate soldiers drew

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.260
on parallels between the
loss of highland culture

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.560
in 18th-century Scotland
and the loss

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.700
of Southern independence
after the Civil War.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.650
This formed the mold for
the foundational identity

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:21.300 position:56%
of various Southern far-right groups
such as the League of the South,

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:25.730
the John Birch Society, and the
anti-Semitic Christian Identity --

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.800
all of whom drew on selective
interpretations of Scottish

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.960
or Celtic history to justify the
defense of what they thought -

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.420
saw as their threatened
white Anglo-Celtic culture.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.310
Ann Rigney states that one

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:45.590 position:56%
of the ways emergent groups
confirm their identity as a group is

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:50.780 position:56%
by celebrating and reinforcing their
sense of a common past or a memory.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.210
Rigney goes further to suggest
that the sense of sharing memories

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.850
or having a past in common
is arguably a precondition

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.970
for the emergence of such
groups in the first place.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.590
Taken as an emergent
group formed after this -

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.500
ashes of the e Civil War, then,

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.390
we might see why the
six founding members

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.670
of the Ku Klux Klan would draw
upon their perceived sense

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.670
of shared Scots Presbyterian
heritage.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:20.680 position:56%
The Klan's appropriation and memory
of Burns, then, was clearly embedded

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.700
within a much wider Southern
tradition really developing

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.610
after the Civil War of drawing on
Scottish iconography to articulate

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.920
and maintain a distinctly
white identity --

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.620
thus implicitly drawing
out the connections

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.660
between literary commemoration
and national or civic identity.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.330
To edge towards a conclusion
on this talk,

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.810
I'd like to consider
the complex issue

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.610
of whether these widely
divergent modes of remembrance

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.310
and reappropriation might
legitimately be grouped together

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.580 position:56%
and viewed as instances of
national cultural remembrance unique

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.730
to 19th-century America.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:02.050
Studies and cultures of national
remembrance have continued to boom

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:06.820 position:56%
in recent decades, partly catalyzed
by a rejuvenated sense of engagement

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.930
with Pierre Nora's
monumental seven-work volume

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.230
"Les Lieux de Memoire."

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.710
Nora pointed to how as a
byproduct of modernization,

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.040
national feeling is actively
cultivated and maintained

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.840
through forms of objectified
culture.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:25.490
For Nora, by the 19th
century national memories

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.610
of the past could no longer
be orally communicated

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:32.010
through spontaneous
or lived experience.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.900
Consequently, Nora argued, national
communities had to construct

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.640
and draw for - draw upon forms
of objectified culture --

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.410
or, rather, "lieux de memoire,"
which translates as sites or realms

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.630
of memory -- in order to establish

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.640
and maintain meaningful
relationships with the past

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.580
and harmonize collective feeling.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.190
These "lieux" or sites might range
from ceremonies, statues, museums,

00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:00.810
anniversaries, flags, buildings, to
outstanding literary individuals --

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.940
with the binding principle
that they, whether physically

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.890
or spiritually, uphold shared
memories of the past that serve

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.900
to form group or national identity.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.770
Now Alex Terrell has suggested
in 19th-century Scotland,

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:20.200
Burns had become what Nora
called a "lieux de memoire"

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.070
in that the public celebration and
commemoration of the poet helped

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.200
to give Scots a notion of
the past and shaped forms

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.750
of Scottish national identity.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.450 position:56%
Burns essentially became a symbolic
figure, and his work became symbolic

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.630
in cementing national feeling.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:41.780
However, the issue of Burns first
functioning as a lieux de memoire

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:47.450
for Scotland in the U.S. is far
more complex and problematic.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.510 position:56%
On one hand, we must acknowledge how
Burns and his works helped to cement

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.660
and articulate the
identity of expatriate Scots

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.090
in America and their descendents.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.870
From the early 1800's onwards,

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.010
expatriate Scots attended
St. Andrew Society dinners

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.360 position:56%
to toast the poet and their country.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.390
Local poets preserved and
adapted Scotch language verse

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.190
and songs inspired by Burns.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.940
And tartan or other
Scottish imagery was -

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.880
often adorned commemorative
events for Burns.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.610
And in fact we do have
a couple of members

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:25.120
from DC's St. Andrew Society here
today, thanks to my friend Brian.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.190
To another extreme, though, the
prevalence of American flags

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:34.970
at the 1859 Burns Centenary, toast
to the president, and assertions

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.530
that Burns fought for freedom

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:40.410
and American liberty might even
suggest a rather fragile case

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.790
for him representing
a lieux de memoire

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.560
for 19th-century American
national identity.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.560
However, as my talk
today has illustrated,

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.750
19th-century American national
identity was hardly uniform

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.810
and comprised of a
plurality of forms.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:03.150
The idea of Burns as a figurative
lieux de memoire in the context

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.830
of the 19th-century
U.S. is problematic

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.360
in that we might identity
within one nation multiple

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.580
and at times competing
layers of memory --

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.930
the most obvious example
of this being, of course,

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:17.470
the simultaneous appropriation
of the poet

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:21.310
by both Northern abolitionists
and Southern secessionists.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:26.740
The 19th-century cultural memory
of Burns, then, was fluid,

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.290
repeatedly reshaped, and reflective

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:33.140
of multiple national
and civic identities.

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:36.580
And accordingly, I'd like to finish
by looking the some developments

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.450
in the field of memory
studies to try

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:43.510
to frame this a little
better and tie up.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:48.630
The Yale historian and memory
theorist, Jay M. Winterd - Winter,

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.470
has argued that we must adopt a
more dynamic approach to cultures

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:55.890
of remembrance and to the
interpretation of Nora's theory

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:57.190
in transnational contexts.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:03.120
In developing a wider vocabulary
for a transnational age,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.420
Winter has introduced the
conceptual term "palimpsest,"

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.840
connoting a repeated
overlay of memories

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.940
that transmits variable
messages but are bound together

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:16.780
by an original source, thus
conceiving of memory sites --

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.520 position:56%
in this case Burns as palimpsests --

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.070
as more appropriately fluid
than retorting to more rigid,

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:26.440
inflexible terms or
metaphors that fail to reflect

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.060
on the layered multidimensional
nature of cultural memory

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.470
in transnational contexts.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.910
Consequently, returning to
the cultural memory of Burns

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:41.470
through the lens of Winter's
metaphor is a useful exercise.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:46.020
It's clear from my examples
today that it's near impossible

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.850 position:56%
to find one shared or national story
or appreciation or appropriation

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:55.270
when unpacking the poet as a
multidimensional site of memory

00:35:55.270 --> 00:36:01.340
in the U.S. Yet equally, these
multidimensional memories

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.020
and remediations should not be
considered as entirely separated

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:09.530
or isolated acts given they stem
from the same memory source,

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.110
expose various conceptions
of both the American

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:15.190
and the Scottish nation,
and are bound together

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:19.850
by specific geochronological
parameters.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:23.000
Consider, then, the multiple
modes and divergent forms

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.390
of commemoration outlined today
as forming a palimpsest replete

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:31.330
with visible but overwritten
layers of memory.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:35.030
Today's discussion has of course
merely touched upon a small portion

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.780
of these palimpsestuous memories.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.710
As the centuries progressed
and continue to progress,

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:45.520 position:56%
new inscriptions would add further
layers to the Burnsian palimpsest --

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.610
such as the continuing erection of
statues, adoption and appropriation

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:54.200
of songs, or widely publicized
commentaries by notable figures

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.150
which were to be reproduced
and continue to be reproduced.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:03.720
Pertaining to Winter's sense of a
palimpsest being reused or altered

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:08.930
but not erasing earlier
inscriptions, these instances

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:12.410
of commemoration allowed for
a diversity of interpretations

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:17.340
of the underlying simultaneous
polyphonic meanings.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.590
Consistently, this
Burnsian palimpsest -

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.350
oh sorry, I'm repeating myself.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:25.030
This Burnsian palimpsest, in
accordance with the fluid nature

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.700
of transnational sites of memory,

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:31.400
variously preserves contested
narratives, divergent ideologies,

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.340
plural identities,
multiple appropriations,

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.410
and contradictory national
histories --

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:41.650 position:56%
whilst all the while retaining a
trace of the original memory source,

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.760
Robert Burns and his works.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:50.020
And since I started today with
one familiar musical clip --

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.910
inscribed, I think, onto the
collective memory of us all --

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:56.700
I'd like to finish by playing
out another very famous melody,

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.160
perhaps one of his
most famous songs,

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.240
"Is There for Honest Poverty."

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.690
Now this song was in fact the
song which Frederick Douglass

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.390
and other prominent abolitionists
of the 19th century drew upon,

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:15.120
including Henry Ward Beecher
and William Lloyd Garrison.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.440
Quoting lyrics from the
song, Douglass declared

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:23.620 position:56%
in a newspaper article in the
"National Antislavery Standard" that

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.630
"Regardless of complexion, 'A
Man's a Man for a' tha.'" --

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:32.870
here evoking Burns's most
egalitarian of refrains.

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.230
So here is an instrumental
version of the song played

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.940
by my friend Sean Healy,
who I almost roped into come

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.290
and play for us live today.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.270
But a mix-up in circumstance
means we'll have

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.410
to make do with a recording.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.160
this is "A Man's a Man
for A'that" followed

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.910
by reel "Journey to Glencoe."

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.510
And we can call this
final inscription

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:57.730
onto the Burnsian palimpsest
before I take some questions today.

&gt;&gt; Arun Sood: Yeah.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.590
I mean it's - in Burns studies it's
almost a million-dollar question

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:41.910
because - several essays that
say one thing or another.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:46.370
I think -- you touch on
it there - with - I -

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.160
it's almost like complacency
on his part.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:53.470
I think that what you can gather
from his work and his letters is

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:59.480
that you are dealing with a highly
sensitive, empathetic individual

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.560
who - whether it's
humans or animals --

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.210
stands to stand up against
abuse and oppression.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:12.210
Why doesn't that extend to
slavery in 18th-century Scotland --

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.080
not in 18th-century Scotland but
the mechanism of slavery abroad --

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.880
when you had abolitionist groups in
Scotland forming and very active?

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.470
And he doesn't appear
on any of their lists

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:27.710
or their societies
or their meetings.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.010
And then you have -- as you say --

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:33.520
the problematic mention of "the
coward-slave" in "A Man's A Man."

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.750
And there's actually another
reference in poems chiefly of the -

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:43.070
in the Scottish dialect that
refers to the "buckskin kai,"

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:46.740
meaning black cattle,
which is also problematic.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:53.050
As for "The Slave's Lament," which
you kind of see as a counterpoint

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:59.590
to that -- a very empathetic,
almost - yeah, very sympathetic way

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:04.370 position:56%
of looking at an individual who has
been torn from the shores of Senegal

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:08.500
to the bitter, frosty,
snowy lands of Virginia --

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.180
that's actually problematic in
itself because there is a lot

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:17.080
of talk amongst scholars that
Burns didn't actually write that.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.320
And I mean you, of all people, I'd
be curious to know where you get

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.190
with this given your skills.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:27.570
But for the new, there is
an upcoming Oxford edition

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:31.110
of Burns's poetry, and I think
there will be a lot of work going

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.110
into trying to establish
whether or not -

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:36.610
or who else could have possibly
written "The Slave's Lament."

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:41.600
But consensus at the moment is
that he didn't actually write that.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.050
So in short, your question what -

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:45.840
whether I think his
attitudes toward slavery was,

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.670
I think is a very difficult
question because I don't think

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:51.400
that there is enough - if there
was enough evidence to say one way

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.880
or another, then it would
have been established.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:57.430
And I think it gets into
realms of speculation a lot.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:05.560
But I do think that - yeah, I mean
my former PI, Jarrod Caruthers,

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.350
had a note with me once where
he sort of said "Well it kind

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:12.350
of made me think about the causes
and the sufferings that happen

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:14.820
in the 21st century that
don't happen in front of us

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.700
but we turned a blind
eye to anyway."

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.240
And not everyone gets
involved in activism.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.240
Not everyone gets involved
in activism towards,

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.590
say, chemical attacks or war.

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:25.490
Or, you know, we continue
with our life

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.010
and we continue what we are doing

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.600
because it's not right
in front of us.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.910
We don't see the suffering
in front of us, so -- .

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:37.160
Is it a case where this - he -
had he been confronted with it --

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.610
had he of sailed to Jamaica,
he would have been empathetic?

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:41.180
I think it probably
would be because he's

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.600
such an empathetic person
on so many other levels.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.050
But can you say for sure?

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.350
I don't think you can.

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:51.350
"I don't know' is the
question - is the answer, yeah.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:56.440
I can direct you to a few essays
that debate the issue well.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:01.340
And also the reference to the
"coward-slave" in "A Man's A Man"?

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.460
So Maury Patrick has an essay
on that has an essay on that

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:08.040
where he -- as you say -- says
it's not the slave in the context

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.580
that we think of, an
African-American slave.

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.850
It's a cowardly form of language.

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:15.210
You have to look at the semantic
meaning of that in the context

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:17.250
of late 18th-century Scotland.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:19.250
So it kind of pulls
up all these things.

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.510

to you, if that helps.

Because if you look -
not necessarily Burns,

Celtic symbolization and imagery.

Because even, like, when
- during the second Klan,

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:49.800
when they adopt the
burning cross motif --

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.550
that's from a Walter Scott novel,

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:56.150
"The Lady of the Lake"
- that poem, sorry.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:53:01.010
And Scott in particular,
his novel was a sort

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:05.960
of the romantic highlander
and the secessionist -

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.800
were very much drawn upon by people
who were bitter about what happened

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.420
after the effects of the Civil War.

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.590
Past the second Klan,
I briefly mentioned

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:19.440
that there you have the likes
of the League of the South,

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.470
which in its original incarnation
was almost an intellectual movement

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:27.160
that tried to establish that
the South was somehow different

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.620
because of its Anglo-Celtic
heritage.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:33.840
And so things like the
Celtic cross was adopted.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.690
It was considered ethnically
different

00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:38.850
through Anglo-Celtic connections.

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:42.970
So the Klan initiation
ceremony, I see what you mean

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.780
by it almost undermines
Burns's poem.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:49.710
But I think there is a definite
link there between the fact

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:52.530
that the majority of
these individuals were

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:57.680
from Scots Presbyterian descent
and so had it - as I was saying

a common point of a past there.
