&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.
Good to have a conversation with you.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.470
Here a Davos, a lot of people around, and
I guess my answer to the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.480
Davos question is this: Now, we've got to
find a way to balance

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.340
ourselves in 2008, to let the vast majority
of people move around the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.160
world and trade and travel freely and at the
same time protect them

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.400
against those extremists and militants who
would do a lot of damage to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.480
our system.
It's about finding a place somewhere between

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.770
complacency and hysteria
and having faith that if you use common sense

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.690
you can solve most of
these problems without violence.
