00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.600
So another way to think about the proof of the folk theorem, is you

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.590
could prove it with a little strategy that is referred to as grim trigger.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.520
&gt;&gt; Mm. I like that. I like the way it sounds.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; So here's, here's the basic structure of grim trigger. It says that

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.960
what we're going to do, is we're going to start off, taking some kind of action

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.890
or pattern of actions, it's a mutual benefit. And as long as it's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.390
cooperation continues this mutual beneficial, behavior will

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.690
continue. But however, if you ever cross

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.740
the line, and fail to cooperate with me.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.850
Then I will deal out vengeance against you forever.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.210
&gt;&gt; Hm, so once again, we're talking about my

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.440
ex girlfriends. I don't know why you're obsessed with this.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.790
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe it's just, maybe it's just trying to help

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.170
you understand. So you know kind of what this situation is.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
Anyways here's, here's what that looks like in the context of

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430
prisoners dilemma. Alright so cooperation is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.520
the, is the mutually beneficial action.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.710
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.500
&gt;&gt; And as long as you continue to

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.490
cooperate with me, that's this C arrow here, then

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.510
I will continue to cooperate with you, but if

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.710
you ever defect on me, I swear I will

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.810
spend the rest of my life making you pay. So no matter what you do at this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.800
point, defect of cooperate, I will just continue to

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.220
defect on you. Pain will rain from the sky.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.200
&gt;&gt; Okay, well this makes sense. So, the idea here

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.680
is that if you know that I"m going to do this,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.960
then hopefully it makes sense for us to continue to mutually benefit.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.485
&gt;&gt; Right. So the whole purpose of this is

00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:25.313
to create, a, a Nash Equilibrium System kind of situation.

00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:28.580
Right? Where if I'm playing this strategy. And you're playing

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.190
this strategy, then neither of us has any incentive to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.210
cross the line, and so we're just going to continue

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.550
to cooperate. Crossing the line is going to decrease your

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.530
reward, so there's no benefit to doing it, so you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.780
won't do it. So it, it's nice because it gets

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.020
us a Nash Equilibrium.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.910
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.410
&gt;&gt; But there's a problem with it.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.820
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.990
&gt;&gt; And you pointed it out before, so let's, let's dive in and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.790
make sure that we understand it and see if we can fix it.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.250
&gt;&gt; Okay.
