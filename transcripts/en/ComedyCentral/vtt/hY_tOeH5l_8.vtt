00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.603
- Let's face it, work blows.

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:05.371 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's good to reward
yourself every now and again

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.206 line:0%
in the form of browser tabs.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.542 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Generally I have
anywhere from four to 42

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.545 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
non-work-related browser
tabs open at any given time.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.047
Let's see what I have today.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.415 align:start size:94% position:6%
I have my standard Hampton
DeVille internet open

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:17.717
like a good employee.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.551
I also have Amazon open.

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.287
It's not like I want
toilet paper delivered

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.556 align:start size:84% position:16%
to my house by the
time I get home today.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.857
I do.

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.092
I also have a food
delivery site open

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.761
in case I want to order
lunch or a second lunch

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.296
or tomorrow breakfast.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.531 align:start size:84% position:16%
I have Wikipedia
open because I forgot

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.266
what red panda babies look like.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.902 line:0%
And now I'm on a weather
site 'cause I wanted to see

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:39.038 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
if Mercury is in
retrograde so I can blame

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.073 line:0%
all my problems on it.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.307
Here's a tip.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.310
If you get interrupted,
just pour hot coffee

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.744
all over your laptop.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.647
Sometimes you just gotta react.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.648
Happy browsing.
