00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.610
In this exercise, we start with a square tessellated into a grid of smaller

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.420
squares. This grid allows us to deform the surface. Deformation happens in the

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.930
vertex shader. What I want you to do is modify the incoming vertex position.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.760
Since this value is passed in, you can't just change it. You'll need to copy it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.560
over to a temporary variable and modify that. You also need to use this

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.130
temporary variable in the rest of the shader instead of the position. How I

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.150
want you to modify the position is by using this formula. The first half of the

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.430
function finds a point on the sphere. The second half translates the whole

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.060
object down by a constant amount so that it stays in view. The uSphereRadius2

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.980
is a value passed in by the main program. It's the square of the radius set

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.620
with the slider. XPOS, YPOS and ZPOS are the position coordinates. To access an

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.970
individual value of a vector, use x, y or z. When you're done, you should see

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.840
something on the screen that looks like part of a sphere. It's a bit bland and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.730
we'll talk more about this later. Definitely save your work since we'll build

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.289
on it.
