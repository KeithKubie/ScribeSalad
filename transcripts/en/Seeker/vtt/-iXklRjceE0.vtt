00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.370
Have you ever watched a scary movie and just
couldn’t look away, no matter how awful

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.950
it got? Turns out you weren’t the only one
in the room.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.030
Hey cinema-philes. Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.290
Movie makers are master manipulators. They’ve
got you twisting your emotions this way and

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.120
that way down to a science. And in fact they’re
even turning to science to learn more about

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.590
how to get even better at making you cry when
Mufasa dies or making you scream when Johnny

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.090
hatchets through a door.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.750
Recently researchers from the University of
Nottingham were curious about how scary movies

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.140
make people nervous. So they hooked up people
to machines to read their electrodermal activity

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.000
(EDA)—or basically how much they sweat.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.380
They showed volunteers 32 scary scenes. With
4 varying types of suspense, like Direct:

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.340
First person, we think we’re the character
in the film. Shared: When we empathize with

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.040
the character. Vicarious: When know the character’s
in danger but they don’t. and Composite:

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.329
Direct, shared, and vicarious suspense synchronized
together.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.370
The researchers found that movies are scariest
when the character doesn’t know what’s

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.450
going to happen, AND when we experience vicarious
suspense. Basically we freak the heck out

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.920
when we know something bad is about to happen
to a character, but the character has no clue.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.710
Something Alfred Hitchcock was the bomb at.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.350
So when we’re watching a movie, we might
all sweat together. And even blink together,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.130
according to a study published Proceedings
of the Royal Society B. Researchers from the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.390
University of Tokyo monitored the eye movements
and blinks from subjects as they watched a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.830
short clip from… Mr. Bean. They thought
that most people might blink at the end of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.960
a scene, at an obvious break. Which was true,
but they also found that blinks tended to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.580
happen during implicit breaks. These blinks
happened during ‘non-critical’ moments

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.700
in scenes, at the end of an action or when
the main character wasn’t on screen. The

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.369
blinks synced up between 23 and 31 per cent
of the time. And maybe this blinking is an

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.979
expression of something going on a little
deeper.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.150
The crazy thing is, movies can also sync up
our brains, according to a study published

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.979
in the journal NeuroImage. Using a technique
called MEG the researchers from Aalto University

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.119
in Finland were able to track brain activity
down to fractions of a second. And they found

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.439
that people’s brains tend to light up in
the same places during the same moments when

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.860
watching movies. And this makes sense for
things like movement and facial recognition.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.530
And that backed up earlier by studies like
one published in 2004 in the journal Science

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.560
that found that when people watched a clip
of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, their

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.540
brains had the same fluctuations at the same
time. And you’d expect people’s auditory

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.450
and visual cortices to sync up when they are
seeing the same thing. That’s what good

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.590
directing and editing do, they control your
attention. One researcher, Uri Hasson, a psychologist

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.950
at Princeton University told Wired that “The
movie takes over the brain responses of the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.280
viewers”.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.290
But not all movies have the same effect. Tense
dramatic scenes like robberies will dominate

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.950
your attention and 70% of your cortex will
be synchronized with everyone else. But boring

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.560
scenes like people walking in a square will
sync up just 5%.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.090
So it seems Hollywood is finding a major ally
in all this brain research. Rather than using

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.690
test screenings to see how a film will do,
maybe they’ll get a little help from NEUROSCIENCE.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.739
And if you’re a movie buff, you’ve probably
wondered why we get so attached to fictional

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.799
characters - like James Bond. Trace and Ian
explore that question in this video
