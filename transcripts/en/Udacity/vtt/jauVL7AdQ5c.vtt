00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.862
Here was the answer for this one. Amazing effort if you got both of these

00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:07.408
correct. Now this one was tricky since there was a simplification that you had

00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:12.158
to do at the end. let's see if you got it. let's start by thinking what we want

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:16.379
our denominator to be in order to simplify. We want each of these powers to be

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.834
a multiple of 6. So that way, they can be divided by 6. We'll want the powers

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:25.452
of 2, x and y to be divisible by 6 since that's our index of the root. So we

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:29.467
want to change to the 1 into 2 to the 6 x squared into x to the 6th and y to

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:35.528
the 8th into y to the 12th. This means we have to multiply the denominator by

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:40.955
the 6th root of 2 to the 5th x to the 4th and y to the 4th. These are the

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:45.389
missing factors we need, to increase each of these powers to these powers. We

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:48.985
want to multiply by a form of 1, so we multiply our numerator by the same

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:54.456
expression as this denominator. Next we multiply 4 times this radical to get

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:59.778
our new numerator. We simply our denominator by writing 2xy squared. It's the

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:04.555
6th root of each of these factors. Our numerator can't be simplified. Since

00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:09.528
each of these powers is not divisible by 6. So we just rewrite 2 to the 5th as

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:13.920
32. We have a common factor of 2 in our numerator and our denominator so we can

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.146
simplify. This leaves us with our final answer. Great work with your factors

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:21.613
and radicals if you got this far.
