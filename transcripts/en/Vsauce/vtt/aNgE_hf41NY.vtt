Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here with some things you can do

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.299
online now, guys.
Let's start the DONGs off in the right hands

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.320
with misternicehands.com.
You can pull his finger.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.200
Wordle.net

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.539
analyzes text, like on a web site,
and generates a free

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.050
word cloud with fun sizes correlating to
the frequency with which the words

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.080
are used. Pretty awesome, right?
But is it the most

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.130
awesomest thing ever dot com ?

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.180
The site pits two things against each
other and lets you vote on which of the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.020
two things

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.870
is awesome.
For instance, pilgrims versus Andrew Jackson.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.719
I'm gonna have to go with pilgrims.
But periodic table

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.340
or Orson Welles? Which is awesomer?
Okay, it's tough, but I'm gonna have to go with

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.360
Mendeleev.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.730
Now, the site tabulates everyone's answers
and runs a list

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.110
of what people currently consider to be
the most awesome.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.320
Notice that right now, life is being beat

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.660
by the Internet. 
Got a song stuck in your head?

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.439
Go to unhearit.com, a site dedicated to playing

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.869
equally catchy songs,
with the hope of removing the one

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.470
that's stuck in your head.
And if you like what you hear, check out

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.600
TuneGlue. Type in a band to add them to
the field and then expand them

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.320
to see other bands related.
Now, I also like Music-Map,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.270
where you can enter a musician's name
and other bands orbit them at distances

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.900
related to how similar their styles are.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.490
If you're tired of music recognition
programs that don't allow you to sing

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.360
your own song or

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.759
hum, enter midomi.com.
It's still not perfect,

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.090
but I am terrible and Midomi still

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.610
understood what I was trying to do.
"I won't loose a baby,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.210
so why don't you kill me?"
Amazing.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.399
Another flawless performance by Michael Stevens.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.900
ThunderShark78 introduced me to Fracuum,

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.020
a series of mazes you continually shrink down

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.380
into.
The perspective is pretty cool.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.840
Now let's get mathematical with Conway's

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.150
Game of Life. This one's a doozy, but
it's really famous. Right now I'm playing

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.300
it as a downloadable version for PC, Mac or Linux,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.730
known as "Golly."
So, the game itself

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.489
is simply a grid that I can fill in and whether a cell

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.450
is alive or dead determines what the next

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.489
generation will look like.
What made this game so famous

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.920
is that using just a few deterministic
rules, we're able to create some quite

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.090
complex

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.800
things.
Now classically, the rules are very

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.890
simple. The fate of a cell depends on the
status of its 1,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.660
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 neighbors.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.610
If two or three cells surround it,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.739
it's gonna be fine, it's going to
continue to live. But if fewer than two,

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.519
or if more than three exist around it,
it will die of isolation or

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.680
overcrowding.
Now, likewise, if

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.269
a dead empty cell has 3, exactly three neighbors,

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.709
it will come to life.
So the next generation of this shape

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.000
looks like this.
It's amazing how just a few

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.560
simple deterministic rules can allow you to create

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.659
shapes like this one, known as a glider, which

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.849
across successive generations actually locomotes.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.740
Oh, and GMSlash showed me a version where the cells

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.980
are mushrooms, and the longer a cell
lives, the bigger the mushroom gets.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.319
But what's a game of life without love?

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.560
Themediabuffs sent me pretentious game,
a wonderful interactive poem that's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.530
touching, but aware of itself.
And Connor showed me an even more tragic love,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.670
a game where you play a guy in love

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.890
with a zombie.
Get her to follow you,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.200
but keep her in a cage.
Also cute is Night

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.239
of the Loving Dead. You play a skeleton who
must find his body parts to reunite

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.959
with his true love.
As you acquire organs, like your brain,

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.060
you can begin to use new powers.
Now, if you're not

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.390
in love with a zombie and would prefer
to prepare for their attack,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.450
TheArzonite offers you Map of the Dead,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.829
a global Google Map delineating areas
where zombie activity will likely be

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.540
highest

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.740
in the event of an outbreak. It includes
helpful landmarks, like nearby food and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.870
ammunition shops,

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.870
so you can plan your strategy now.
If this is all a bit too scary for you,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.759
relax with N3xTB0y's

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.040
z0r.de, a collection of quick looping images

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.090
and silly music. Shantuku discovered this neat interactive scale of the universe tool.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.770
We've covered things like this before,
but you can never have enough.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.759
While we're out in space,
let's get bigger plane cosmic crush,

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.020
like Amonfobious'. Collide with smaller
items to grow larger and avoid

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.720
giant dangerous celestial objects.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.430
Here on YouTube, Vixolent uploaded
a really well-made interactive

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.650
game. You play within a single video and
his use of annotations is quite

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.370
ingenious.
And TheRealMcJoni made this impressive interactive

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.139
domino video.
The tricks and layout are really neat

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.750
and you get to choose a direction at the
end of the video - let's hope it's the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.240
right one.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.740
Back to Metronomy.
Subscribe to Vsauce for more.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.840
And as always,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.480
thanks for watching.
