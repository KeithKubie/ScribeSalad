00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.290
A particle moves along a
number line not shown for t

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.250
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.180
Its position function, s
of t, is shown in blue.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.990
So this is its position
as a function of time.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.030
Its velocity function,
v of t, is in red.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.210
That's velocity.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.150
And its acceleration
function, a if t, is in green.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.421
All are graphed with respect
to time t in seconds.

00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:25.670
With the graphs as an aid,
answer the questions below.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.750
So that's what's going on here.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.387
So it's position as
a function of time.

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:30.220
Actually, let me just
draw their number line

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.170
that they did not depict just so
we can really think about this.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.400
So let's say that's
our number line.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.240
Let's say this right
over here is 0.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.720
That's 1.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.630
That is 2.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.480
This is negative 1.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.200
So we're defining
going to the right

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.600
as the positive direction.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.910
So what's happening here?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.750
So at time equals 0 right
over here, s of 0 is 0.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.430
And then as time
increases, our position

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.140
increases all the way
until time equals 1.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.050
At time equals 1,
our position is 2.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.860
So at time equals 1,
our position is 2.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.640
And then our position, s
of t, starts decreasing.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.420
So one way to think about it
is, and you see we move up,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.000
we move to the
right really fast.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.770
We get to 2.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.240
We stop at 2, and then we
start moving to the left.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.970
So at time equals 0, the
first second looks like this.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.660
We go zoom, oh,
slow down and stop.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.380
And then we start
moving the other way.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.180
And then we start drifting.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.470
Notice our position
is decreasing.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.140
So our position is
decreasing, but it's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.720
decreasing at ever slower,
slower, and slower and slower

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.220
rates.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.160
It's not clear if we'll
ever get back to the origin.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.519
So that's what's going on here.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:56.560
And we see that no matter
which graph we look at.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.130
Our position function is
definitely telling that story.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.070
Our velocity function, which is
the derivative of the position

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.460
function, is telling that story.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.430
Out the gate, we have a
high positive velocity,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.690
but we decelerate quickly.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.966
And at 1 second,
our velocity is 0,

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:13.090
and then we start having
a negative velocity, which

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.970
means we're moving to the left.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.160
So fast rightward velocity,
but we decelerate quickly,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.420
stop at time equals
1 second, and then

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.550
we start drifting to the left.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.630
And the acceleration also
shows that same narrative.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.980
But anyway, let's actually
answer the questions.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.600
The initial velocity
of the particle

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.030
is blank units per second.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.150
I encourage you to pause
this video and answer that.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.040
Well, we just said the velocity,
let's see, at time equals 0,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.570
we're at 8 units per second.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.470
So we'll just put
8 right over there.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.750
The particles moving
to the right when

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.627
t is in the interval, and
since they're doing this

00:02:51.627 --> 00:02:53.960
as a member of, they really
want this kind of in the set

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.530
notation t is a member
of the interval.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.120
Well, when are we
moving to the right?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.080
We already went over that.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.600
We're moving it to
the right-- there's

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.058
a couple of ways
to think about it.

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:04.960
When our velocity
is greater than-- so

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.470
we're moving to the right
when v of t is greater than 0.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.150
When v of t is less than 0,
we're moving to the left.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.110
When v of t is equal
to 0, we're stationary.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.240
So when is v of
t greater than 0?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.460
Well, it's between t being
0, velocity is definitely

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.800
positive, all the way to t is
1, but not including t is 1.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.496
So I'll put a parentheses there.

00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:28.870
So this is equivalent
to saying--

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.530
so t is a member
of that interval

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.540
is equivalent to saying that
0 is less than or equal to t

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.000
is less than 1.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.150
Once again, the first
second, at time 0,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.470
we're going fast, slow
down, and then stop

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.570
for an infinitesimal moment,
and then we start drifting back.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.220
That happens at time equals 1.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.090
We start drifting back.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.000
The total distance traveled
by the particle for t

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.309
in the interval between
0 and 3 is blank units.

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.350
So once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.510
and try to answer that,
the total distance.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.470
So this is interesting.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.030
Don't get distance
confused with displacement.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.860
If I were to move
three to the right

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.740
and then I were to move
back one to the left,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.730
the total distance
I've traveled is four.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.600
The distance I traveled is
four, while the displacement

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.172
would be a positive.

00:04:27.172 --> 00:04:28.630
We could maybe put
a minus 1 there.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.096
We moved one to the left.

00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:31.720
So three to the right,
one to the left.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.670
Well, our displacement would
be a net of positive 2.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.385
So they're asking, what's
the total distance traveled?

00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:49.650
So between time 0 and time 1,
we have moved two to the right.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.020
And then between time 1
and time 3, we move back,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.930
or to the left, we move half.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.982
So to the left, we move half.

00:05:03.982 --> 00:05:05.190
So what's our total distance?

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.360
It's going to be
two to the right

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.745
plus half to the left, which
is going to be 2.5 units.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.080
And we're done.
