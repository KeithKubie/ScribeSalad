&gt;&gt; Jennifer Abella:
Hello, everyone,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.440
and welcome to the National
Book Festival's Teen Stage.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.400
I'm Jennifer Abella, an editor
at "The Washington Post,"

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.280
a charter sponsor of the
National Book Festival.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.460
I love YA literature
and I cannot wait

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.280
to hear from our next guest.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.020
Before we get started, I'd
like to thank our Co-Chairman

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.820
of the Festival,
David Rubenstein,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.290
and other generous sponsors
who've made this fantastic

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.890
event possible.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.770
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.100
there's information
in your programs.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.380
We'll have some time after this
presentation for your questions.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.460
There are mikes in the
aisles and I've been asked

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.600
to remind you that if
you go to the microphone,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.440
you will be included in the
videotape of this event,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.870
which may be broadcast
at a later date.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.470
It's my honor to
introduce Elizabeth Acevedo.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.290
Elizabeth is a DC-based writer

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.570
and National Slam
Poetry champion.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.940
She has performed on
stages very close to here

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.580
at the Kennedy Center and
as far away as South Africa.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.690
She published her
collection of poems,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.340
"Beastgirl &amp; Other
Origin Myths" in 2016

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.680
and made her YA fiction debut,
"The Poet X" released in March.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.640
It's a novel written in verse
about a young girl in Harlem

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.520
who discovers a love
for slam poetry.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.820
And a programming note,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.140
Elizabeth will be signing
books at 4:30 PM today.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.510
Please welcome to the
stage Elizabeth Acevedo.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.500
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.050
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Acevedo: This is
for us writers, us readers,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.220
us girls who never saw
ourselves on bookshelves

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.220
but we're still writing
poems when we talked

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.620
and we've been called teeth
sucking, of snapping eyes,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.790
born bitter, brittle,
of tangled tongues,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.210
sandpaper that's been
origamied into girl,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.670
not worthy of being
the hero nor the author

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.200
but we were also Medusa's
favorite daughters

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.700
of serpent curls,
of hard-eyed looks,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.690
dreaming in the foreshadow,
we composed ourselves,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.970
since childhood taking
pens to our palms

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.160
as if we could rewrite the
stanzas of life lines that tried

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.050
to tell us we would
never amount to much.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.620
And when we were
relegated to the margin,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.640
we still danced bachata
in the footnotes.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.640
We still clawed our way onto the
cover, brought our full selves

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.950
to the page, our every color
palette and bouquet of pansies,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.900
of big gold hoops of these
here hips and smart as quips

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.210
and popping bubble gum kisses,
us girls who never saw ourselves

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.610
on bookshelves but we're still
writing tales in the dark,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.840
as black and brown girls, brick
built, masters of every metaphor

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.510
and every metamorphosis.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.730
Catch us with fresh manicures,
nail filing down obsidian stone

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.500
and painstakingly
crafting our own mirrors

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.620
and stories into existence.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.920
Good afternoon.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.220
How y'all doing?

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.020
Y'all alright?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:36.350
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.840
I like to open with that piece

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.570
because I think it creates an
umbrella for the impetus behind

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.530
"The Poet X," that I'm
often asked, you know,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.440
why did you write this story,
what was the inspiration

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.090
for this book about a young
Latin America in New York City

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.910
who discovers poetry and has a
very contentious relationship

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.340
with her mother.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.820
And the truth of it is that
I've been a writer my whole life

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.460
but I never thought I
would write a novel.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.760
I was a poet.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.980
I was also a poet who was an
eighth grade English teacher

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.780
in Prince George's
County, Maryland.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.400
[ Applause ]

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.510
And the school that I
taught at was 78% Latinx.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.130
It was 20% Black.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.680
And I was told on my first day
of school by the vice-principal

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.210
that I was the first
teacher they had ever had

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.040
of Latinx descent
teaching a core subject.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.170
Right? And so I would
walk into class

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.650
and the students would walk in
and they'd be like, "Oh, no,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.950
this is the wrong class."

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.250
They try to walk out.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.550
I'm like, "Sit down."

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.850
Right? They thought
it was Spanish.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.150
I'm like, "no."

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.400
And I'm this space and although
I'm teaching eighth grade,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.590
a lot of my students are
very low-level readers.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.240
So they were fourth, fifth,
sixth grade reading levels,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.590
although they should've been
already reaching ninth, right,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.000
because we're trying to get
them ready for this next year.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.240
And I kept trying to
do everything I could

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.120
to hook these students
into reading, right,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.370
that I fundamentally believed
that the reason that I am

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.730
where I am is because I was a
veracious reader growing up.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.680
I was a reader before
I was a writer,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.880
that to me I found
answers in books.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.200
The things I couldn't
ask my mother,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.450
the things I couldn't
understand about my neighborhood

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.050
or about why I was
treated certain ways,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.350
I looked to books for answers.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.250
And so I'm trying to like
this is the one key I have

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.620
that I can maybe
give these students

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.550
who reflect the same background

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.020
and it's completely
being rejected.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.450
Right? Which if you're a
teacher, you know this is

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.870
like the most heartbreaking
thing where you're like,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.840
this is my favorite book and you
hand it over and they're like,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.140
"I don't want this thing."

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.390
You're just like, "No!"

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.980
And I had this one student,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.810
Katherine Bolanos [assumed
spelling], who like if I was

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.320
in eighth grade, we
would've been best friends

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.310
but because I was her
teacher, I was like "Ah!"

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.050
Like she was just
a tough cookie.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.760
And she was not where she needed
to be in terms of reading.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.540
And I'm like, alright, I'm
going to get her to be a reader.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.130
So I bring in "Twilight."

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.010
I bring in "Hunger
Games," right.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.860
I bring in whatever book I could
bring and Katherine's like,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.930
"I don't care about
no sparkly vampires.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.030
I don't care about
none of this."

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.100
And she said to me, "Where
are the books about us?

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.460
How come we never read
any books about us?"

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.710
And so I go out and
with my teacher budget,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.640
I buy Sandra Cisneros.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.030
I buy Meg Medina.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.590
I buy Matt de la Pena.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.020
I buy Jacqueline Woodson.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.110
Right? I buy Walter D. Myers.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.450
I bring all these stories
into class and this student,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.240
who had never been
a huge reader,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.210
within two weeks had
finished every book I put

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.510
in front of her.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.570
Right? [applause] And
she goes, "Alright,

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.050
Miss Ace, what's next?"

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.350
I'm like, "What's next?

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.650
That's it.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.950
That's my whole budget,
like we're done."

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.440
Right? And also that there's so
little representative literature

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.310
that I could actually hand
to her for that age group

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.960
and that was the spark,
those two questions:

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.590
Where are the books
about us and what's next.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.460
Right? And I love the quote
by Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.080
who inspired that first poem.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.690
All children's literature should
be a mirror, an opportunity

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.350
to see yourself and a
window, an opportunity

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.190
into an experience different
than your own and that

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.900
that was my main idea.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.700
I want to show these students,
I want to show this community,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.470
I want to show my home girls,
I want to show where I grew up

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.890
and I want to invite
folks to see themselves

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.790
and also tell folks who
are like, I don't know if I

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.870
like verse, I don't know where
Harlem is, what is a morenita,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.280
right, like here, learn a little
something about something other

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.590
than what you already know.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.770
And so after my second year of
teaching, I decided I was going

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.300
to go get my masters
in creative writing.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.310
And I walked into a program

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.300
and I was the only
student of Latinx descent.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.430
I was the only student
of Afro descent.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.550
Right? I was often the
darkest person in the room,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.480
which being that I'm light
skinned is a problem.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.420
And I was the only person
who was born and raised

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.260
in a major city and was
writing about that experience.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.390
And so I would turn in all these
poems, these hood morenita poems

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.750
and I would get them back and
the slang would be circled

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.740
and the Spanish would
have question marks.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.040
And I'm like, "You didn't
want to Google that?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.640
Like Google is free."

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.430
I spent my whole life having
to Google all kinds of things

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.540
because I don't come
from a background

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.690
where this literature is
part of our tradition.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.640
And so there are many words
that I still don't know how

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.960
to pronounce because
I've never heard them.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.020
There are many, many stories
that I have to go back

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.000
and be like, "Well,
what does that mean?"

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.760
Right? But when it came to my
work, I wasn't always afforded

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.270
that same kind of
generosity from my readers.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.320
And I had this one professor
my first year of school

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.290
who was an old school dude.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.930
Right? Walt Whitman in
the face, long-ass beard,

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.100
the kind of person with
a real melodious voice.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.420
So anytime he'd talk,
he wanted to lean in.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.720
And he would say
something real problematic

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.940
and you're like, "Lean back!"

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.020
Right? That kind of professor.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.420
He came to class and he's like,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.600
"I just read the most
amazing poem about deer."

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.990
And I have no beef with deer.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.560
I think venison is delicious.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.870
I'm not hating on
anybody's wildlife.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:00.120
But I think we often have
a stereotype about poetry,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.260
that it's about the clouds
and the flowers and the deer.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.430
And for two and a half hours,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.850
because grad school classes are
long, this professor goes on

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.090
and on about this deer poem.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.390
And he goes one step further,
he says, "I want everybody

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.020
in the room to write
an animal ode."

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.490
Right? And he goes to one
classmate, he's like, "You know,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.180
what do you think
you'd write about?"

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.070
And my classmate says,
"Well, like Elizabeth Bishop,

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.720
I would write about
the blackbird, right,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.080
thirteen ways how to see
a blackbird is incredibly

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.380
popular poem.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.450
And so in my head, I'm
like, "Well, you're writing

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.070
into a tradition but I'm
not sure that's the most

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.370
original answer."

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.040
He goes to another classmate
and my classmate says, "Well,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.060
I would write about
sea anemones."

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.360
And I'm like googling
and I say like,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.660
"What the heck is a sea anemone.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.980
Let me try to spell anemone."

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.040
And then my professor gets
to me and the one piece

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.880
of writing advice you always get
when you're in a writing program

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.180
or when you're in
an English class

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.620
or you've probably heard
this from your teachers is

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.700
"write what you know."

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.800
And so I puffed my chest
up and I'm like, "Well,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.090
I would write about rats."

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.990
If you grow up in any major
city, you know you some rats.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.960
Right? You know, pigeons
are just rats with wings.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.560
Squirrels are just
rats with nice coats.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.860
We know them all.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.980
Right? And I feel like I'm on
Family Feud, like good answer,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.440
like I'm ready for my accolade.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.250
And my professor
looks at me and goes,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.810
"Rats are not noble enough
creatures for a poem.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:24.850
Liz, I think you need
more experiences."

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:32.510
And I think both statements are
devastating in different ways.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:37.070
The idea that someone who
comes from a family that is

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.610
from the Dominican Republic,

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.200
which was the first
place colonized

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.640
in the Western Hemisphere,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:50.900
colonized by Christopher
Columbus himself, by nobility,

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.800
that that is what I'm
supposed to be writing towards.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.630
But then that second piece,
"you need more experiences,"

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:04.670
as if he knew absolutely
anything about my life

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.240
or what I had lived
or the experiences

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.840
that informed my work.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.400
And I think about this often
when I walk into a space

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.720
and I'm working with
young people

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.360
or I'm reading young
people's stories,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.630
what are the experiences
that I might discount

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.110
that you are bringing into
a space, the knowledge

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.710
that you already have
that I have to be open to,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.330
and what is the standard
that I'm comparing your work

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.480
to because it might
not be the standard

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.400
that is most appropriate for the
tradition you are writing into

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.340
or about or maybe, maybe it's
never been written about before

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.080
because the American
canon is very particular

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.750
about who it allows
into its hallowed walls.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.770
Right? And so I have to
be mindful of that moment

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.010
when I was an educator of what
do I take from this interaction

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.460
with this professor
and what do I leave.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.690
Right? And I still
wrote that poem.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.990
It's called "Rat Ode."

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.880
It's an official back
to that professor.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.510
But mainly it serves as
a reminder for any of us

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.590
who have ever been told our
story is too small or too ugly

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.010
or too different for
high art, that we are all

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.770
of us deserving of poetry.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.510
And so if you will allow me, I
will recite that poem for you.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.290
[ Applause and Cheers ]

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:22.230
And this is for all the rats in
the room [audience laughter].

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:30.550
To the rat, because you are
not the admired nightingale,

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.330
because you are not
the noble doe,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.090
because you are not the
picturesque ermine, armadillo

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.770
or bat, they have been written

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.520
and I don't know their song
the way I know your scuttling

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.130
between walls, the scent of
your collapsed corpse rotting

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.430
beneath floorboards.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:53.250
Your frantic squeal as you pull
at your own fur from glue traps,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:58.010
ripping flesh from skin
in an attempt to survive

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.210
because in July of '97, you
birthed a legion on 109th,

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.260
swarmed from behind
the dumpsters,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.720
made our streets infamous for
something other than crack.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.180
Shoot, we nicknamed
you cat killer.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.700
Raced with you through open
hydrants, squeaked like you

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.810
and [inaudible] blasted aluminum
bat into your brethren skull.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.210
The sound slapped down dominos.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.210
You reigned that summer rat,

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.220
and even when they sent
exterminators half dead

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.460
and on fire, you pushed on
because even though you are

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:35.380
in an inelegant, simple
mammal bottom-feeder,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.750
always fricking famished.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.800
Little ugly thing who
feasts on what crumbs fall

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:50.460
from the corners of our mouths,
you live uncuddled, uncoddled,

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.550
can't be bought at Petco
and fed to fat snakes

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.730
because you are not
the maze rat of labs,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.750
pale, pretty eyed, trained.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.290
You raise yourself, sharp
fangs, claws scarred,

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.890
patch dark because of
this, he should love you.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.290
But look at the beast,
the poet tells me.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.650
The table is already full.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.700
And rat, you are not
a right worthy thing.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.620
Every time they say that take
your gutter, your dirt coat,

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.900
filth this page, rat,
scrape your underbelly

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.200
against street concrete.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.460
You better squeak and
raise the whole world, rat.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.590
Let loose a plague
of words, rat.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.270
And remind them that
you, that I,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:38.510
we are worthy of
every poem, here.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:50.050
[ Applause ]

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.190
I think the best thing
my writing program did

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.950
for me was reaffirm that
not everyone is my reader

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.250
and that that is okay.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.960
But that does not mean that
I don't have a readership.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.150
I think it reaffirmed who
is it that I am writing for

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.750
and what is it that I'm
trying to get across

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.610
and that it might not be the
head of the English department

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.690
and that that is okay.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.220
That whenever I'm asked
for writing advice,

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.330
I say write your rats.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.960
Write the little ugly things,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.010
the markers of where you
are from, of who made you,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.700
of what makes you, and
that is what will resonate.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.670
That I could have decided to
write the poem that was going

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.250
to get the most approval.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.430
I could have imitated the
poets that I knew the head

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.410
of the department loved
or I could have said,

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.770
I know the community
I'm trying to reach

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.480
and I know the story
I'm trying to tell

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.190
and that I honestly believe
in Toni Morrison's quote,

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.070
write the book you've
most wanted to read.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.730
And as a huge reader,
I think a book

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.540
like this would've
changed my life.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.080
And that's why I dedicated
myself to this novel.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.570
And I began writing this
novel as an MFA student

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.490
who was working on a
thesis that was not

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.620
in young adult literature and
that was not in verse novels.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.960
Right? So I'm like sneakily
on the side like working

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.340
with this character without
knowing where this was going

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.430
to end up, who was
going to read this,

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.100
who wanted to read a verse novel

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.900
about a Dominica
from like New York.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.200
I don't know, right?

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.500
But like I trusted that if
nothing else, I would arrive

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.480
to a closer truth
about my own story

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.680
and my own inspiration
behind why I wanted to write.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.720
And that the main character in
this novel, I'm always asked,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.340
like, "Is it autobiographical?"

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.890
And I'm like, "Not
if my mama's asking."

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.990
Right? Like, pure fiction.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:49.110
But she is loosely based on
me, on young women I've known,

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.500
on some of my closest friends.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.830
Right? She's a compilation
of a lot of different women.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.250
And so many of the
characters are that I pulled

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.590
from all these folks I know
who I haven't seen on the page,

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.290
I'm like, "I got to get
[inaudible] on the page,

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.450
even if it's just his name,
even if it's just him opening

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.530
up the hydrant, like,
I got get him there,

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.810
because I would have loved
to see these cultural markers

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.410
in a book one day, right.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.050
And so I'm going
to read from "X."

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.000
How many folks have
read the novel?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.490
Oh, y'all adult, look at y'all.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:23.050
Yes. Those of you that
haven't, this is an intro.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.570
And those of you that have, you
can maybe hear it in my voice

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.070
if you didn't get
the audio book.

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:31.280
Xiomara Batista is 15 years old.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.160
She is coming from a very
conservative Catholic household.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.640
She developed very young.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.080
She got her period
when she was nine

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.930
and so her body grew
very large, very quickly

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.230
and she didn't know what to do

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.300
with the attention
that it received.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.490
All of the sudden, she
is objectified in a way

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:51.040
that she was not
prepared to deal with

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.760
and she is taught
that it is her fault.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.060
It is her body.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.360
It is her fault.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.180
And all the things
that happen to her is

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.840
because she is a
walking problem.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.580
And what a lot of
people don't know is

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.440
that Xiomara is a secret poet,
that she has this journal

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.020
that she writes all of
like her interactions in.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.730
And although she wouldn't
call herself a poet,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.980
she is processing the
world through poetry.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.300
When she's out in the world,
she's fighting with her fists.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.820
She is a quiet kid.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.200
She is walking machete.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.600
But in her journal, she's
allowed all of the metaphor

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.030
and all of the language
to figure out what is it

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.330
that I'm grappling with.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.730
And so I want to read just
a couple of pages for you

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.870
to get a sense of how
Xiomara sees herself.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:40.340
I am unhideable, taller
than even my father

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.470
with what mommy has always
said was a little too much body

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.490
for such a young girl.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.740
I am the baby fat that settled
into D cups and swinging hips

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.780
so that the boys who
called me a whale

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.780
in middle school now ask me

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.610
to send them pictures
of myself in a thong.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:02.040
The other girls call me
conceited, ho, thought, fast.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.130
When your body takes up
more room than your voice,

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.200
you are always the target
of well-aimed rumors,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.180
which is why I let my
knuckles talk for me,

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.200
which is why I learned to shrug

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.910
when my name was
replaced by insults.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:21.990
I have forced my skin
just as thick as I am.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.120
Mina muchacha is
mommy's favorite way

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.860
to start a sentence.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.930
And I already know I've
done something wrong

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.500
when she hits me
with that look, girl.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.420
This time it's mina muchacha.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.840
Maria from across the
street told me you were

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.110
on the stoop again
talking to los vendedores.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.310
Like usual, I bite my
tongue and don't correct her

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.730
because I hadn't been
talking to the drug dealers.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.500
They had been talking to me.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.690
But she said she doesn't want
any conversation between me

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.750
and those boys or
any boys at all.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.290
And she better not hear about
me hanging out like a wet shirt

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.980
on a clothesline just waiting
to be worn or she will go ahead

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.430
and be the one to ring my neck.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:09.040
[Inaudible], she asks, but
walks away before I can answer.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.590
Sometimes I want to tell her
the only person in this house

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.740
who isn't heard is me.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.290
I'm the only one in the family
without a biblical name.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.110
Shit, Xiomara isn't
even Dominican.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.680
I know because I googled it.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.690
Clearly, my characters
are just as like enamored

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.720
with googling as I am.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.430
Clearly traumatized.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.270
I know because I googled it.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.220
It means one who
is ready for war.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.660
And truth be told, that
description is about right

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.640
because I even tried
to come into the world

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.980
in a fighting stance,
feet first, had to be cut

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.660
out of mommy after
she had given birth

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.450
to my twin brother Xavier
just fine and my name labors

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.340
out of some people's
mouths in that same awkward

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.460
and painful way until I
have to slowly say Xiomara.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.420
I've learned not to flinch
the first day of school

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.740
as teachers get stuck stupid
trying to figure it out.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.770
Mommy says she thought it was a
saint's name, gave me this gift

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:13.070
of battle and now curses
how well I live up to it.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.470
My parents probably
wanted a girl who would sit

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.370
in the pews wearing pretty
florals and a soft smile

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.900
but got combat boots and a mouth
that's silent until it's sharp

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.490
as an [inaudible] machete.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:31.330
"Pero tu no eres facil" is a
phrase I've heard my whole life.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.470
When I come home with
my knuckles scraped up,

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.840
"pero tu no eres facil."

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.960
When I don't wash the dishes
quickly enough or I forget

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.190
to scrub the tub, "pero
tu no eres facil."

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.650
Sometimes it's a good thing
like when I do well on an exam

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.240
or the rare time I get an
award, "pero tu no eres facil."

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.080
When my mother's pregnancy
was difficult and it was all

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.760
because of me, because I was
turned around and they thought

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.790
that I would die or worse
that I would kill her.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.990
So they held a prayer
circle at church

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.460
and even Father Sean
[assumed spelling] showed

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.150
up to the emergency room, Father
Sean who held my mother's hand

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.050
as she labored me into the world

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.920
and pappy paced behind
the doctor

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.790
who said this was the most
difficult birth she had ever

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.230
been a part of but
instead of dying,

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.630
I came out whaling,
waving my tiny fist.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:24.690
And the first thing pappy said,
the first words I ever heard,

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.440
"pero tu no eres facil."

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.510
You sure ain't an easy one.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:37.590
[ Applause ]

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.710
Thank you all.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.010
I want to make sure that we
have enough time for the Q&amp;A.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.710
So I try to give a little
bit of my trajectory

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.230
of how this book came about
and the different poems

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.140
and arcs that informed that.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.650
But for me, the best part is
actually engaging with you all

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.400
and the questions
that you might have.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.370
And so there are mikes on
these middle aisles here.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.710
I will not be saying
any more poems.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.010
That's it.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.590
Thank you so much for being here
and for spending time with me

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.420
and thinking through
"The Poet X."

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.720
If you have any questions
[applause] --

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.020
Oh, y'all are sweet.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.490
Thank you.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.660
[ Applause ]

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.960
Thank you.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.260
We have about ten minutes.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.730
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.120
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Acevedo: Hi.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.720
&gt;&gt; My question is
about somebody I know

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.650
who is an incredibly talented
writer and spoken word poet

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.520
but has never published,
entered her poetry

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.950
into any competitions.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:52.510
What kind of advice would you
give to somebody like that

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:58.180
to lift their writing
off the ground?

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:02.150
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Acevedo:
I think I would --

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.450
First, my instinct is

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.170
to complicate what you're
asking me a little bit.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.270
Right, that we live in a world

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.980
where if your letters
are not printed,

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.170
we assume that they are not
being held to the same regard

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.960
as something that is published.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.920
Right, that I always
felt this huge anxiety

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.210
that because I was primarily
known as a spoken word artist

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.510
or a slam poet or a
performer and I'm doing quotes

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.740
because I think that these
are very complicated terms

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.970
or I'm a poet who reads out loud
pretty well, right, I think,

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.940
and I come from a
tradition of oral poetry.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.170
And so I uplift that
at all times.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.630
And so if this person is walking
in a stance of I want to be

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.330
in the room when
the poem is heard

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.200
and poems should
always be heard, right,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.860
that whenever someone's like
I don't get poetry, I'm like,

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.590
"Have you read it out loud
because that's a game changer."

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.900
That maybe they are not
interested in publishing.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.360
I also believe that if you are
not someone who reads widely

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.860
and who is reading poetry, it's
going to be incredibly difficult

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.770
to publish poetry because
what journals do you send

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.650
to if you're not sure
what journals are

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.000
in conversation with your work.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.250
If you're not sure what poets
are on the same thread as you,

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.310
to just hold it as an accolade
of I want the publishing credit,

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.130
if that is not the vein
that you want to be in,

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.840
I think what we have
to do is deconstruct

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.690
where we say the
writer should go, right,

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.850
or deconstruct what we think
of as the upliftment of poetry.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.740
However, if this is a poet who
feels like they have been pushed

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.620
to the side and like, well,
maybe publishing isn't for me,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.920
that's what other people do.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.220
We don't do that.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.520
I don't do that.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.940
I can only be on a stage,

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.340
I think that that is a very
different approach, right,

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.240
because that's oftentimes a fear
of the rejection of academia,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.230
of a fear of the canon and that
right now we're an incredible

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.510
moment where so many
different kinds

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.900
of voices are being published,
specifically within poetry,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.200
right, that that's so --

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.340
Like the Ruth Lilly was just
announced and I mean all

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.290
of the poets are poets of color.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.240
Right? And that to me
was an incredible moment

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.690
of the different backgrounds,
gender nonconforming, right,

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.980
like we had all kinds of
diversity represented there,

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.400
so I think it's about
finding your readership.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.170
Going back to the rat poem,
like who are the people

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.610
that are already on
the same page with you

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.960
and sending your poems there
and starting small, right.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.900
That I started kind of with
homies, like I knew a homie

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.230
who was editing a
journal and I'm like,

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.500
alright, here's my poem.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.020
And like you have to take
it because you love me.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.330
And the circulation of that
journal was pretty small

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.690
but it just gave me
the confidence of okay,

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.220
a poem of mine is
out in the world.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.110
It's on the Internet and
this is an incredible thing

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.720
and I'm not there to
mitigate how it's being read

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.880
and maybe that's okay.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.820
And so I think it's about
just encouraging your friend

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.740
to release and maybe finding
where their poem is going

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.180
to be most well received.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.130
Great question.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.260
&gt;&gt; Hi. First of all,
you're amazing.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.560
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Acevedo:
Oh, thank you.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.180
Very sweet.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.480
Thank you.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.780
&gt;&gt; Huge fan.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.620
I'm a poet and as I was going

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.830
through my college application
process, everybody was like, oh,

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.400
you're going to writing school.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.750
And I was like, nope.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.680
But the reason why I
think, I think a lot

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.280
of the reason why didn't apply
to creative writing schools was

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.430
because of listening to
experiences like you had.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:20.010
And as a writer of color, my
question is what would you say

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:25.000
to young poets, especially
young poets and women of color

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.520
who don't want to
enter or are afraid

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:33.250
to enter academic writing
programs because of the lack

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.620
of acceptance of our stories
and what advice would you give

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.580
if somebody was interested
in doing that

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.890
but didn't know how to?

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.740
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Acevedo: Right.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.720
Thank you for that question.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.740
I hope college applications
were okay.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:51.050
Right? Hey, you better get it.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.780
Howard contingency in the front.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:01.900
Congrats. I think that whenever
you're walking into spaces

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.750
where you already know like this
space has been traditionally

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.240
blank, you have to be
incredibly purposeful

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.290
with what you are trying
to get from that space.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.380
And if what you're trying to
get from that space is approval,

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.140
you've already failed.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.450
And that was probably the
biggest lesson I had to learn.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.650
No one was going to be able
to give me enough approval

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.820
in any single program to make
me feel confident enough to work

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.120
into the world, right.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.420
It was always scary.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.720
I always feel like a fraud.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.020
I continuously have
imposter syndrome

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.860
because it's just the way that
we have been programmed to exist

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.920
in these spaces of we are
not worthy to be here.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.210
And you have to do
it anyways, right.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.310
But that there was never going
to be a stamp of approval

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.240
and I couldn't look for it
because I would've been crushed

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.010
that first semester if I had.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.560
Right? And so when you're
applying, you kind of just have

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.430
to go for like the best of
the worst in all honesty

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.730
because I think the programs

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.980
that we have right
now are geared

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:56.370
in a very particular
direction and workshops

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.880
in general are looking
for a thing, right,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.310
that I think the programs

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:06.560
that are allowing the most
eclectic thought processes

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.940
or they're very few
and far between.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.240
And so you kind of have to go

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.630
in knowing what do I
want from this thing.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.470
Do I want to have the
space to read widely?

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.360
Do I want to find maybe
one or two cohort members

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.850
that I can share work
with in the future?

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.330
Do I want to work with
this particular professor?

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.580
That you can't go in being
like I want a Disneyland

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.850
of creative writing because
that is not going to happen.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.050
But if you are very specific
about what you want to do

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.630
in that space, I went
in like I'm going

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:34.930
to come out with a book.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.080
That didn't really
happen but having

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.890
that intention I think kept me
very focused on no one is going

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.340
to sway me from creating
a piece of writing

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.630
that I feel has my heart in
it by the end of this program.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.620
And I left with a
[inaudible] book, right.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.410
And so I think that that is
what you have to do in any

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.520
of these spaces and that
probably speaks to both

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.820
of your questions, I think.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.150
But I want to go back to
what you said about going

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.400
into a program that wasn't about
creative writing, that I think

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.450
that that's even more
adventurous and exciting,

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.270
right, don't study writing.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.960
Like what if you
studied something else

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.970
and that inform the writing,

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.430
that so often people think
they need a writing degree

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.020
or they need to go to a
specialized high school

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.120
in creative writing
or they have to like

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.590
and I think that
you live, right.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.600
The MFA programs are very recent
phenomenon, right, for the last

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.160
like 45 and some
odd change years.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.120
But before that, people
were doctors and engineers

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.060
and garbage men and then they
wrote on the side and that

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.390
that to me is so [inaudible]
to allow yourself to figure

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.740
out what is the best thing
that's going to feed my writing

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.630
and let that guide you, not just
what you think you have to do

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.070
in order to follow
the steps, right,

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.210
because writing is not
engineering and you can't --

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.040
There's no like blueprint to how
you become this kind of thing.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.660
You live and you keep
writing and you read widely

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.570
and you figure out what
space you need to feed that.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:00.480
Thank you and good luck
with your semester.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.710
&gt;&gt; Hi. I also teach
middle school.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:07.060
Yay! And I teach creative
writing in middle school

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.480
and I've already got plans
to use all kinds of things

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.890
that you've said
in my classroom.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:17.150
But your rat poem story
really spoke to me

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:20.780
because I spend a lot of time
trying to convince seventh

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.550
and eighth graders that
they have something to say

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.750
and then I don't want
them to fill in the blanks

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.090
of a five paragraph essay the
way think they think they're

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.390
supposed to do it.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.880
So I have two questions.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.140
One, if you have any
inspirational words

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.710
for my students, I would love
to share those with them.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.550
And two, I would like to know
how you did on that rat poem.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.850
What grade did you get?

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.600
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Acevedo:
I think the --

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.160
I don't know if it's
words of inspiration

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.050
but I hope your students
whatever task they take on,

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:53.850
they take on with empathy,
right, even if it's

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.390
like a math problem, like
whatever it is that I hope

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.350
that that is as much a
part of their curriculum

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.650
or how they're moving
through the world.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.650
Right, like where am
I practicing empathy,

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.900
did I practice empathy
today because I think

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.360
that that is how we
build a better world.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.790
I turned in the poem and
my thesis at the very end

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.850
and he couldn't remember
the interaction,

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.710
which I found hilarious and
a little bit sad, right.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:19.870
But for him it was like,
where did this poem come from.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.720
And I'm like, "You, bro, you!"

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.470
And yet here we are, right,
we say things all the time

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.130
and we don't realize how they
resonate and that's okay.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.430
So, thank you for that.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.730
I'm going to try
to be very quick

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.090
because I know we only
have a couple minutes.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.370
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is kind
of a two-part [inaudible],

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.130
so I'll keep it --
So the first part,

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:38.540
you kind of already answered.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.100
So you can maybe keep
it a little short,

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.540
this idea of transitioning
and going back in the elitism

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.730
that happens sometimes
between the spoken word world

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:51.030
and the creative, the page
poetry world and I remember

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.140
when I started writing,
I was writing on the page

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.870
and they were like, "Don't
look at the spoken word poets.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.590
That's bad."

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.890
But I think that we can
learn a lot from a lot

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.320
of great spoken words poets,
like, you know, Patricia Smith,

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.160
for example, for you and I
wanted you to first of all talk

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.740
about what you've
learned from each world

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.970
that maybe we can teach each
other and then also just talk

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:18.390
about your writing
process in general

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.040
as like the second
part of my question.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.920
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Acevedo: I think
in terms of what we can learn,

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.500
I feel like the community
that primarily comes

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.380
up through spoken word is
looking towards the rest

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.730
of the world, right, but
they're looking at it

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.540
as like we are the misfits.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.330
We don't fit into
these programs.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.850
But oftentimes we've
already been exposed

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.150
to poetry in school.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.450
We've been exposed
to poetry in class.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.750
We may not always understand it.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.250
We may struggle with
connecting to it

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:45.500
but there is exposure
there, right.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.100
And so I think I would speak
less to that side of it

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.390
because often that's a side
that's coming from rejection.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.820
I turned to this form of
poetry because it's the one

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.610
that felt the most like home.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.460
Right? But I think in terms
of what the flipside, right,

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.520
you know, Patricia Smith is
funny because I don't think --

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.820
I think she would agree with me.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.710
She is a poet who has performed.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.010
That's what she would say.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:13.030
Right? Like people should just
be better readers of their work.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.540
Like literally we engage every
day with other human beings

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.820
and we figure out how to make
them understand and then you get

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:23.260
on a stage and you're awful
at reading your own work.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.390
Right? And I guess
people don't want to fall

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:27.690
into being an entertainer but
it's like if you wrote this

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.760
with love and passion
and emotion,

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.060
how do you now bring
that through.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.360
And I had a professor
who told me

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.660
like a reader should
be a blank slate.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.800
I was like that sounds awful.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.540
Right? And so I hope that both
sides go to different kinds

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.060
of readings in order to
engage with one another

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.710
and see the work
that they're doing.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.510
I am being told to
wrap it up and I want

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.810
to respect the time and space.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:49.110
Justina Ireland is
going to be coming

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.860
into this room in ten minutes.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.160
You should stay for her.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.690
She is freaking fantastic.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:55.730
Or you should come and get
your book signed by me.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.830
Those are your options.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.150
The folks who are waiting to
get on the mike, I'm going to be

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.370
over here if you want to just
come chat with me real quick.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.280
Thank you so much
for being beautiful,

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.300
beautiful audience
[applause and cheers].

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.600
I appreciate you.
