00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.420
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: I'm honored to introduce
John Merrow one of the most

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.060
influential education reporters in the nation.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.200
John
Merrow began his career as an education reporter

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.100
for NPR
in 1974 with the weekly series Options in

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.100
Education.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.040
He
served as a host of the Merrow Report, an

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.940
award winning
documentary series, and is currently as the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.520
education correspondent for
PBS News Hour.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.619
Merrow's report has taken him from the
community colleges to the kindergarten classrooms

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.630
to
front lines of teacher protests to policy

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.080
debates on
Capitol Hill.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.230
His varied reporting has continued to be
at the forefront of education journalism.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.890
John's book,
you all have a copy, The Influence of Teachers

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.239
was
released in February and was deemed eminently

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.770
valuable
and a 'must read' by our nation's top education

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.770
leaders.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.670
John also maintains a weekly blog "Taking
Note" where he's become

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.280
welcome an eminent education voices on the
web.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.571
To state
it simply, without John, the country would

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:08.710
not know much
about what's really happening in our schools.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.890
So please join me
in welcoming John Merrow.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.220
Thank you.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.390
[Applause]

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.430
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: Thank you very much.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.990
It is a treat to be at Google.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.720
Is this working?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.369
Are you guys good here?

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.100
You want me to
speak up?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.640
It's okay.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.189
It's okay.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.189
Yeah.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.010
Thank you very
much.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.119
Boy.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.170
I wanted to talk about a couple of things.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.770
Sort of a general theme.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.790
What's wrong with this picture
when you think about American public education.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.540
It was
Thoreau who said the mass of men lead lives

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.420
of quiet
desperation.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.439
I think he was talking about high school
kids.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.149
We have not figured out how to make high school
a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.369
rewarding experience.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.999
As a consequence we have 6,000 kids
leaving, voting with their feet every single

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:17.999
school day.

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.489
More than a million young people.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.329
And oftentimes that's
a defensive and perfectly rational decision

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.319
because high
school is often humiliating for an awful lot

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.879
of young
people.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.819
I don't want to just talk about the stuff
that's

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:36.819
going wrong.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:44.859
I'd really like to talk about solutions
especially because Google and people like

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.709
the Google
people have it in their capacity to change,

00:02:50.709 --> 00:03:00.650
to demand
school, changes in the way schools function.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.959
And
actually the way I think about it is that

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.739
-- there are
some of you in this room over the age of 30

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.739
perhaps.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.859
Maybe one or two.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:22.109
But anyone over the age of 30 went to
school and there were essentially three justifications

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.390
for going to school.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.829
And today, only one of those three
applies.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.969
And I do write about it in the book.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.089
But
quickly, when I went to school or even my

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:39.829
children went
to school, you had to go there because that's

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.010
where they
kept the knowledge.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.790
It was in the books.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.790
And the
encyclopedias.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.400
Remember they were on the shelf?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.540
It was
in the head of the teacher.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.510
That doesn't apply anymore
thanks in large part to Google and the Internet.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.260
It's
this constant 24/7 flood of information that

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.869
our children
are swimming in or perhaps drowning in.

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:04.719
But information
is not knowledge.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.389
So you don't have to go to school
because the information is there.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.260
So therefore, you need
a different kind of school.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.160
You need a school which
helps kids sift through this information and

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.350
turn it into
knowledge.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.609
Maybe even into wisdom.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.430
So that you need a
school that helps young people separate wheat

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.150
from chaff.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.909
And since we want them to choose the wheat,
that means

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.500
you need schools which are self-consciously
aware of

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.050
their duty to teach values.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.520
Second reason that my kids or I,
was socialization.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.180
So the Italian-American kid could
learn to get along with the Puerto Rican kid.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.840
The boy
get along with the girl so on so forth.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.509
There is an app
for that today.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:56.509
A lot of them.

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:02.300
And our kids are
socializing like crazy.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:12.610
They are going Google plus and
Facebook and Farmville and they are -- it's

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.319
pen pals on
steroids.

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.740
You probably don't know what pen pals are.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.330
[laughter] So
you need a different kind of school.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.039
Because that
14-year-old that your 14-year-old is socializing

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.409
with
might not in fact be 14.

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.150
Might in fact be a lot older.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.110
Might have some nefarious motives.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.691
So kids need to be
helped to understand that that stuff that

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:49.500
they're sending
is more permanent than a tattoo.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.280
Just because young
people are digital natives does not make them

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.409
digital
citizens.

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.849
And there's a role for adults in that.

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.800
The
third justification for school, for then and

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.960
now, is
custodial care.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.689
We need a place to send our kids because
we're going to work.

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:11.850
We want them to be safe.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.110
But they
are not safe in a school which is only providing

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.749
custodial care.

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:23.499
If it is a school which doesn't
understand the technology and the new responsibility

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:24.770
for
adults.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.819
If it's in a school that doesn't understand
that

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.210
it's no longer enough to be an answer factory.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.990
Then that
becomes a dangerous place.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.289
Because kids are smart.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:35.370
They
are inventive.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.940
They are restless and they will start
using this technology in harmful ways.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.699
And there is a
lot of that going on.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.960
It's called cyber-bullying.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.730
So
one of the reasons I wrote this book is we

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.610
need a
different kind of school.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.120
We need a different kind of
teacher.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:08.530
And I -- there are a number of issues they'd
like to jump around if you don't mind.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.169
Because there's a
lot wrong with this picture.

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.629
One is that, you know,
everything else has changed.

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:15.900
Schools have changed very
little.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:22.240
Schools tend to use technology to control.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.639
And
so as most of our schools are these answer

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.550
factories, kind
of regurgitation education.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.050
And that turns kids into
consumers.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.270
They are producing on demand.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.530
But they're
really just consuming what you fed them and

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.240
giving it
back.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.960
That's not what we want our young people to
be.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.680
We want them to be producers.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.500
As I say, you still need a
building.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.529
You need a place for our kids to go.

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:56.650
But
there's no reason in God's green earth to

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.180
respect the
walls.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.999
Yes, send them to a building, but don't respect
the walls.

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:08.270
Young people in the school here, in Mountain
View, should be, could be, and perhaps are

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.410
in some of the
schools connected to young people in other

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.410
places.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.180
Working on projects, creating knowledge.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:22.840
Forgive me, Amanda and Vanessa,
because you heard this example.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.680
I spoke at the
Commonwealth Club last night and they were

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.090
in the audience.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.509
But in my -- I live in -- now live in New
York having

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:34.699
just moved from Palo Alto about a year ago.

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:37.289
But looking
out the window of our apartment building,

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:43.570
I notice that
on each corner there is a large trash receptacle

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.070
and our
neighborhood is clean.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.780
And I was working on a piece for
the News Hour.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:56.029
We were filming up in the south Bronx and
I don't know why I noticed it, but on an intersection

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:58.610
there was just one garbage can.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.180
I thought, "okay, well,
let's not think of them as garbage cans."

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.740
And the
streets were dirty.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.440
So don't think of these as garbage
cans.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.880
I renamed them 'cleanliness opportunities'.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.139
So my
neighborhood had four cleanliness opportunities.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:20.710
I
thought, what a terrific project.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:28.269
Tell the eighth graders to get their smart
phones and go to their corner

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:29.480
and take the pictures.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:36.040
And then, the teachers -- those
eighth grade teachers -- in all the middle

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.760
schools in New
York City to do the same thing.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.410
And then figure out a
way to share that data.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.920
And do some data analysis and do
some thinking about it and some writing about

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.540
it and
maybe get in touch with a mayor.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.150
You're creating
knowledge.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.880
You're creating trouble.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.090
But kids like to do
that.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.270
It's positive stuff.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.980
You can do it at school, too.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.430
You get a little air quality monitor which
doesn't cost

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.910
very much and you go monitor the air quality.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.910
You don't
want to take a field trip or can't take a

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.910
field trip.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.770
Go walk
outside the build . But do it at 9 in the

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.660
morning or 11 and so on and
so forth.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.040
Share that data; maybe you'll find some
anomalies.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:28.650
I looked it up the other day, Texas has about
4,000

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.510
miles of fast-running water.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.510
Fast-running.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.970
It's not
that sluggish stuff at the border.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.260
Why not have the
science classes in high schools go to the

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.089
water?

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:42.279
Sample
the water.

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:43.279
Acidity.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.279
Alkalinity.

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:46.970
Speed, Color, Detritus.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.329
Share
the data.

00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:54.920
And where you find anomalies, gee, the water
gets much more acidic down here.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.920
Let's find out why.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.899
That's a reason to go to school, because you
are creating

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:01.180
knowledge.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.510
And that's the challenge.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.570
It's -- the
imperative, I would say.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.620
High school is boring.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.170
And it
is not producing the kind of young people

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.160
we need to fuel
the economy to keep the country moving.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.250
I know Sandra
Day O'Connor spoke here recently and talked

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.410
about civic illiteracy.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.260
Doug was telling me that.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:31.360
Well, you
have illiteracy on all the fringes because

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.829
we are
focusing so deeply and so intensely on basic

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:37.320
literacy and
numeracy.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.420
There are least three literacies that are
essential.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.420
Basic literacy.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.019
Numeracy and creativity.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:49.360
But we're so focused on the first two, we're
driving out

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.230
the third.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:59.589
I feel passionate about this because I don't
think we're moving in the right direction.

00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:03.230
I think we
have this collision course maybe just ships

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.050
passing in
the night.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:10.910
People understand what young people need or
even what the economy needs and yet they're

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.750
having this
imperative to get test scores up.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:22.970
And so, the narrowing
of a curriculum continues.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:29.410
Even though we moan and groan
about it, we're still cutting art, music,

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.110
Phys Ed, even
science.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.480
And there's this pressure to say, "well, if
we

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.041
get these test scores up", and so, some of
these test

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.509
people are saying well, let's just test in
more subjects.

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:43.350
We tested in science.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:49.150
We tested in music then we'd have
to have music as a, which is.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.070
So what you have
now.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:58.899
Let me use Florida as an example since it's
well-known for its evaluation system developed

00:12:58.899 --> 00:13:02.130
under
former governor Jeb Bush, who is a genuine

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.630
intellectual
and a deep thinker about public education.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.000
And on his
watch and even before they set up something

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.180
called FCAT
Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:20.060
The state of
Florida spends 10,900, call it 11,000 dollars

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.560
a year per pupil.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.769
The FCAT
costs 20 bucks.

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:34.300
So they are using a 20 dollar
instrument to measure the use, the efficacy

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.980
of their
11,000 dollar investment.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.300
That's fundamentally insane.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.339
And I think of my own car.

00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:46.100
I drive a used Toyota
4runner.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:53.310
I think it's a 2002 which cost me 12,000
dollars.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:14:00.300
And I spend 500 dollars a year evaluating
it.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.839
The equivalent of the FCAT.

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:06.940
So I spend 500 for my
12,000 dollar investment.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.649
Florida spends 20 bucks for
its 11,000 dollar investment.

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:12.350
You do the math.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.170
And by
the way, my evaluation of my car takes one

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.170
day.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.860
365 days
a year, it takes one day.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.720
Florida kids go to school
180 days.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:30.730
I have met teachers in Florida who say they
spend between one-fifth and one-sixth of their

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.700
time on that
FCAT.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.860
Essentially one day a week out of five day
week.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.930
Or one day out of every six days.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:47.339
Either prepping for
the FCAT, talking about the FCAT, practicing

00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:49.240
the FCAT
or giving the FCAT.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.420
So it's not just that they don't
spend money on the evaluation of it.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.420
They spend a lot of
time.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.420
Time is opportunity.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.420
Those days are gone.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.980
You
spend them drilling.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.649
You aren't going to spend them
doing the other things that you could be doing

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:05.649
in school.

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:06.649
And
what then?

00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:13.319
Then they take the scores on this cheap test
and use it to make judgments about kids and,

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:15.610
of course now,
increasingly about teachers.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.069
It is in a sort of,
you know when I say what's wrong with this

00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:23.760
picture,
there's the, that's a major piece of what's

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.750
wrong with
th3 picture.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:35.660
But, and the situation is has a potential
for getting worse because of a digital divide.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:41.189
A growing
number of young people do not have access

00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:45.750
to high
speed, to bandwidth.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.370
Even if they have the
connections, the toys, they don't necessarily

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.300
have the
speed of connection.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:16:01.440
But access is nowhere near enough
because the mind set has to be production.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:11.230
The mind set
has to be schools that say -- and educators

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.279
who ask a
fundamental question -- schools say, "how

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.830
intelligent are
you?

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.850
How intelligent are you?

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:18.850
How intelligent are you?

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.009
Let's compare."

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:21.089
That's not what we want.

00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:24.899
We want
schools to say, "How are you intelligent?

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:26.800
How are you
intelligent?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.230
How are you intelligent?"

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:34.230
Figure that out
and create opportunities to maximize that

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.230
growth.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.040
Kids
are smart.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.259
And I said before if they're in schools which
are just doing regurgitation education they

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:45.300
are probably
going to use that education in bad ways -- often

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.100
in bad
ways.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:54.519
If the imperative of education is numeracy,
literacy and creativity, then schools should

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:57.360
be saying,
"how are you creative?

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.250
How are you creative?

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.389
How are
you creative?"

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:02.199
And figuring out ways to build that.

00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:07.700
There are all these wonderful possibilities
that we need to, we need

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.820
to demand it actually.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.380
How many of you have children in
school?

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.380
Okay.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:23.810
So this is probably not, well it's slightly
skewed because there are many young people.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.380
But in fact,
in the country only about 20 percent of households

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.570
have
school age children.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:36.700
So there's an 80 percent who do not
have a immediate direct interest in public

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.700
education.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.830
Now you start putting in grandchildren, the
numbers

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.830
change a little bit.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.080
There's still a huge number of
people who do not have a direct immediate

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.220
interest in
what's happening in public school.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.650
So part of what the
school people need to do is figure out how

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.080
to connect
with that 80 percent.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.330
And part of the way you connect
with that 80 percent is when the kids become

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.950
producers of
knowledge.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.570
When the work they do reaches that 80
percent.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:17.410
I'm recruiting teachers now to probably
middle school or high school kids to go out

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:22.760
in a team and
just in their own neighborhood, go into stores

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.290
-- the deli
can be the doorman of the building, the gas

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:32.320
station guy,
the mechanic, somebody at Google -- and of

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.960
course frame
it shoot their own video.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.490
Frame it the same way each
time and ask the person to recite a couple

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.320
of lines from
a poem.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.550
And you want the 80 percent.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.910
You don't want --
you got a kid in school -- you're disqualified.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.750
You want someone
who doesn't have a kid in school and you create

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:54.600
a montage
of him saying "to be or not to be that is

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600
the question.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.830
Whether it is noble in the mind's eye" and
so on.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:03.770
You stitch it
together and you put it up on YouTube and

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:09.750
those 12 people
who don't have kids in school then say, "hey,

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.030
do you see
what they're doing in school?

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.030
By the way, did you see
me?"

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.120
So you are going to build an audience.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.130
It's a drip,
drip, drip thing.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:24.030
But suppose in every community, four or
five teachers did that in different parts

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.530
of the town.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.370
You'd have people saying, "wow."

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.660
And of course, the kids
would be learning.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.800
They'd be creating something.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.160
The
kids would be learning a real set of skills.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.290
It's not
easy to get people to relax and look into

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:44.170
the camera and
say the lines and so, it's a whole set.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.300
Then, of course,
you have to do the editing.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.760
So there's a whole set of
skills for the kid.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.030
And there is the thrill of
production.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.160
There is the ownership.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.890
You know Marx had
it right about folks being separated from

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.840
the fruits of
their labor.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.740
Very few people get to do what Amanda and
I

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:10.290
do which is start something here and go all
the way

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.290
through to the end.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.840
That's the opportunity that we want
our kids, - we should want our kids to have.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:22.140
It's why
they thrive in extracurricular stuff.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.710
Because they own
it.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:34.700
So let me say, defining the problem.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.580
Now, this
general heading is what's wrong with this

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.880
picture.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.380
The
big thing that's wrong with the picture is

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.000
how we define
the problem.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.280
When we talk about public education.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.840
You
know, I would say that it's not that we have

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.410
aimed too
high and failed.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.050
We've aimed too low and we have
succeeded.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:03.810
You know, we simply do not ask enough of our
young people.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:08.050
And we don't ask the right kinds of stuff.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.120
Educators talk about rigor.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.060
We need more rigorous
education.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.900
Nobody has ever looked that word up
apparently.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.240
You know that rigor mortis -- connect the
dots.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.700
Rigor means harsh, yielding, painful.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.390
And that's an
adult mindset about what education supposed

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.390
to be.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.390
It's
wrong.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.630
It should say challenging.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:35.120
But you can't even get them,
break them of that habit which unfortunately

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.240
is very
revealing.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:49.620
As I say we've aim too low and we've succeeded.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:55.720
The second huge 'what's wrong with this picture'
is the

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.480
achievement gap.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.260
Somebody define the achievement gap for
me?

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.510
Go ahead.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.780
What's the achievement gap?

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:14.580
&gt;&gt; Male #1: [inaudible]

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.770
&gt;&gt; Who's the gap between?

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.105
&gt;&gt;Female #1: The rich and the poor
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: Rich and poor?

00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:20.310
Actually not
usually.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.790
I'm sorry?

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.010
&gt;&gt;Female #2: [inaudible]

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.280
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: Yes, it's in terms of race.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:34.050
It's in terms of white
kids versus black kids or black and Hispanic

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.550
kids.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:41.000
I'm
not sure if it occurs to anyone that that

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.720
in itself could
be something of a racist construct.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.550
If we could only get
these kids who aren't white to do as well

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.570
as the whites do [chuckles wryly].

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:59.040
And I kind of think of that -- because so
my way of

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.300
playing with that idea -- but often what we
do is we have

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.740
an achievement gap between white kids and
nonwhite kids.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.980
If we could just get these kids --. So the
focus in school

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.940
is often on the test scores which is the output.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.470
There's
not much conversation about a couple of other

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.470
gaps.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.670
The
gap in opportunity.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.610
Gap in expectations.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.850
Sometimes a
gap in leadership.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.640
But if you have at least two of those
three, often you'll have an outcome gap.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:32.120
But if you
only focus on the outcomes, then you end up

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.120
drilling those
kids.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:39.120
There's a well-known vocabulary gap when young
people start preschool or kindergarten.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:45.220
Number of words
is -- people argue about whether it's 3 million

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.760
or 30
million more words that the middle class or

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.650
upper middle
class white kid has heard than the poor kid.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.140
But if
you're only focusing on the vocabulary gap,

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.270
what will
happen in poor schools is they'll start drilling

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.070
kids on
vocabulary.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.030
Well, that's not how those white kids learn
those words.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.240
They learned them in conversations.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:11.050
They
learned by using words in social and family

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.150
kinds of but
schools where they're focused just on the

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:18.850
outcome, which
is what's going to be tested, they subvert

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.450
the process
and make it painful.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:30.330
I often say that what we really
should talk about is the Asian/white achievement

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.330
gap.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.630
You say, "My God will you look at this Asian/white
achievement gap."

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.630
We got to do something.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:36.630
These white
kids are way behind.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.720
We got to start drilling the white
kids.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.470
Let's eliminate recess for the white kids.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:44.410
Let's
get rid of art and music for the white kids.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.200
I hope that
would suggest the absurdity of it.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:55.500
That would be one of
the ways of thinking about what we need to

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.740
do in public
education.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.900
I'm making it sound very bleak.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.900
And I don't
mean to.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.230
I actually like to show you a little clip
of

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:11.770
what we're working on now.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:18.410
Part of our problem is an
absorption, a fascination with magic bullets.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.090
Silver
bullets.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.090
This will do it.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.290
If we just could bring in
Teach for America, everything would be fine.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:27.030
If we just
could have charter schools or vouchers or

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.380
some one
thing.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:42.850
The New Orleans in August 2005 was virtually
destroyed by hurricane Katrina and the subsequent

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.740
flooding when the levees broke.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:51.630
The school system had been --. We
started reporting from there not long after

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:56.460
that and, in
fact, just finished filming in November.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.450
In October,
maybe.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.780
So really six years.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.540
We have six years worth of video
that we're now editing into a documentary

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.840
film, we hope, if
we get lucky and raise enough money to finish

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.160
it that
way.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.720
And it's a remarkable story.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:29.600
And with your
permission, I'll show you a little bit.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:57.860
[drum beat] [helicopter noise]
[slow brass jazz music] In the fall of 2005,

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.340
six weeks after
Hurricane Katrina made landfall I arrived

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.340
in New
Orleans.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.060
I think I saw it in the paper God answered
my

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.060
prayers.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.050
&gt;&gt;Jimmy Fahrenholtz: Yeah, I'm not a particularly
religious person.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.170
That's just
one of my asides.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.770
God didn't answer my prayers.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.210
I think that
we got lucky.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.390
&gt;&gt;John Merrow: We got lucky.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.980
&gt;&gt; Jimmy Fahrenholtz: Yeah
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: I was in New Orleans to report

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.150
on the city's
beleaguered public school system for the PBS

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.240
News Hour.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.110
All but a handful of the schools sustained
incredible

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.120
damage.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.620
60,000 students were displaced; many homeless.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.420
Their teachers scattered across the nation.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.250
And in the
midst of this great tragedy an unexpected

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.320
sentiment had
emerged.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.630
&gt;&gt; Jimmy Fahrenholtz: The storm has come through
and done the

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.630
damage.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.630
Look at what we can take from that, what we
can use it for.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:42.630
It's a tool.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.290
[construction noises]
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: For those who have been championing

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:51.440
drastic reform,
the opportunity was irresistible.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.470
Hurricane Katrina had
shut down the city of New Orleans and with

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:58.900
it, its schools,
long considered among the worst in the nation.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.570
The greatest
experiment in the history of American public

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:07.559
education
was about to begin.

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:17.190
&gt;&gt; [slow music finale].

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:30.020
[pause]
&gt;&gt; [upbeat jazz music].

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:43.240
[traffic noises]
&gt;&gt; Principal Laurie: It's powerful.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.780
I feel so honored.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:52.050
It's just an honor,
to be here at this point in time, to be part

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.500
of this new
beginnings.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:01.550
[traffic noises]
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: December 14, 2005.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.260
Much of the city is still
deserted.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.300
In less than 24 hours, public school will
re-open.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.230
No one is sure how many students to expect.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.890
Here at O. Perry Walker High School, the pressure
is on.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:20.680
Hopefully never ever again in the history
of this country, not mention the world,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.660
will any group of folks be given an opportunity
because

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.720
of a Katrina or some other natural disaster.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.010
But the
reality is we have this opportunity and we

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.710
need to seize
this moment.

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:39.220
&gt;&gt; Female teacher: We have to be on our toes
when the kids come in.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.770
And
you set the stage.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.220
We all know that from teaching.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.590
If
you've taught one month, you know the first

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:45.590
day sets the
stage.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.790
&gt;&gt;Male teacher #1: Some of us as teachers
we're going to want to go back

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.790
the way it was done before.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:57.770
A lot of the children are going
to be expecting things to look like they did

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:58.880
before.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.940
And
it's just going to be interesting how we can

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.010
create a new
vision of what -- who we are and what we want

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.010
to be.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.400
&gt;&gt;John Merrow: Business as usual was out the
door.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.230
Walker was
re-opening as a public charter school.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.740
It would be
independent of the local school board for

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.220
four years.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.760
If
it didn't prove its worth during that time,

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.760
it would
close.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.370
&gt;&gt; Male teacher #2: We were slaves to the
old system, [coworkers agree] but the shackles

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:30.920
have been removed from us so now we are free.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.520
We are
free to do the things that we need to do as

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.230
teachers to
educate.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.200
I feel free.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.200
[laughter].

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.160
[water sounds].

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.360
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: The raging river whose waters
destroyed New Orleans

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:56.250
begins here, 1400 miles away in northern Minnesota.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.600
And
it's here at the Mississippi river's source

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.760
that charter
schools which would play a vital part in the

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.520
rebirth of
New Orleans were born.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.880
It was at a meeting in 1988.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.530
The
driving force was labor union leader Albert

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.530
Shanker.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.510
&gt;&gt; Albert Shanker: I believe very strongly
that what you need to do is

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.000
give the professionals and the school the
right to run

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
the schools.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Stop telling them what to do.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.280
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: What Shanker was proposing
was unheard of.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.830
Most of
the country's 100,000 public schools were

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.470
run from
central offices, top down.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.700
Shanker wanted to give control
to teachers and to principals who rarely got

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.170
to decide whom
to hire or fire or how to spend the money.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.290
&gt;&gt; Shanker: Set the goals for them and tell
them what you're going

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.070
to measure five years from now and at the
end of that period of

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.070
time there ought to be real rewards and real
punishments

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.799
or real consequences for making it or not
making it.

00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:49.970
&gt;&gt; Female teacher #2: Look up here.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.370
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: Shanker and others hope that
every school district

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.160
would create at least one charter school as
a laboratory

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.440
for other schools to learn from.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.600
But the idea of giving
power to individual schools was vigorously

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.750
opposed by
school boards.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:08.360
Many states passed laws banning charter
schools or limiting their numbers.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.670
By 2004, the
country's 15,000 school districts had opened

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:15.690
only 3,000
charter schools.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:20.080
Charter schools were marginal at best.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.860
Then came Katrina.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:31.930
&gt;&gt; Leslie Jacobs: I went into the city in
October and you felt like you

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.320
were in a Hitchcock movie.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.720
It was like a smart bomb had
gone off.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720
It was buildings.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.720
There were no people; there were no birds;
there were no animals.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.720
There were no signs of movement.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.720
Schools
are shuttered.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.210
The city is shuttered.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.930
I think there was
the strong belief, at that point in time,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.270
that with the
schools shuttered and the opportunity to start

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.980
it over
again, we were going to take advantage of

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.280
that and do a
much better job.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.000
&gt;&gt;Leslie Jacobs: [voice over piano music]
Everyone in New Orleans wants the same things

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.450
-- safe
streets, good jobs, better schools.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.890
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: Insurance executive and recent
mayoral candidate, Leslie Jacobs,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.090
served on the Orleans Parish school board
for four years.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.770
&gt;&gt; Leslie Jacobs: It's probably the most frustrating
experience I ever had in

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.770
my lifetime.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:18.030
I work 30, 40 hours a week, every week, not
paid.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.030
I
accomplished nothing.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.060
[band music plays] The valedictorian of one
of our

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.850
high schools could not walk across the stage
and get her

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.690
diploma because she failed the graduation
exit exam in

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:29.690
math seven times.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:34.230
&gt;&gt; Aesha Rasheed: It was kind of this poisonous
environment, I felt.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.060
There was a very toxic environment in education
in New

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.060
Orleans before Katrina.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.780
&gt;&gt;John Merrow: At the time was the education
reporter for the

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.780
Times-Picayune.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.040
&gt;&gt; Aesha Rasheed: I think that there were
many good teachers but when

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.520
you're constantly labeled as failing and you
aren't supposed

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.260
to be failing, I think the adults start to
carry that

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.420
feeling of failure, too.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.660
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: The problems weren't just
academic and in the district's

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.310
central office, corruption was rampant.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:02.200
24 school
employees had been indicted on fraud charges.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.650
71 million
federal dollars were unaccounted for.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.110
New Orleans'
public schools were on the verge of bankruptcy.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.121
&gt;&gt; Aesha Rasheed: I remember thinking like
how were you going to

00:34:10.121 --> 00:34:14.519
resolve this depth of corruption, this depth
of

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:17.599
disenfranchisement, these deep feelings of
inadequacy?

00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:19.589
How do you resolve that in a system that has
to keep

00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:20.589
going?

00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:23.039
And so, I used to think that if there could
be

00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:26.079
just a few months where there was just no
school, right?

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:27.079
Then
Katrina happens, right?

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:29.009
And you're kinda like, "well, there you go."

00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:32.809
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: In November 2005, with most
New Orleanians still

00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:36.039
displaced, lawmakers in Baton Rouge took action.

00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:37.919
[muted jazz trumpet music]
&gt;&gt;Female broadcaster: The house and senate

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:40.850
voted late yesterday to approve Louisiana
governor,

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.760
Kathleen Blanco's, proposal for the state
to take over schools in New Orleans.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.750
[jazz harmonica music]
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: In an unprecedented move,

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:51.909
the state seized control of
100 of New Orleans' worst schools; 90 percent

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:53.730
of the
entire district.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:54.929
Their challenge was immense.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:59.640
&gt;&gt;John Merrow: Some people have said, "Well,
Katrina was in some way a

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.640
blessing".

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.790
&gt;&gt;Principal John Hiser: Let me tell you something.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.779
If you looked into the
eyes of children who have been through that,

00:35:06.779 --> 00:35:07.819
they would
never say that.

00:35:07.819 --> 00:35:09.479
&gt;&gt;Principal Hiser: And what is your name,
sir?

00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:11.549
.&gt;&gt; Male student: Kelvin Dawkins
&gt;&gt;Principal Hiser: Dawkins, is that correct?

00:35:11.549 --> 00:35:13.640
&gt;&gt; Principal Hiser: Kids don't say that.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.069
&gt;&gt; Principal Hiser: Anybody who works with
children knows damn well

00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:22.250
Katrina was not a blessing in any way shape,
form, or fashion.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.540
[children chatting] I have listened to all
of it:

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.600
"I left my teddy bear behind.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.380
I left my room behind, my
games behind, my friends behind, my grandma

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.380
behind".

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.079
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: In spite of the obstacles,
the ambitious plan was for

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:37.240
the state to fix the schools.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.720
Leslie Jacobs was
skeptical.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.430
&gt;&gt; Leslie Jacobs: I'm still not convinced
today that a Department of Ed has

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.250
the capacity to run schools.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.190
That's really not what
state Department of Eds are set up to do.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.961
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: But Jacobs, then on the state
Board of Education, did

00:35:50.961 --> 00:35:54.119
not want the local school board to run the
show, either.

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:57.369
She saw a way to take care of both problems,
give the

00:35:57.369 --> 00:35:59.050
power to the schools.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:03.890
&gt;&gt; Leslie Jacobs: I do not believe charter
schools are a silver bullet, period.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:08.819
But if
you're a good school leader and you have the

00:36:08.819 --> 00:36:11.349
freedom of a
charter school, you're going to run a good

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:13.030
to great
school.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:16.450
&gt;&gt;John Merrow: In New Orleans, charter schools
were not going to be

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.690
competing with the traditional public school
system.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.630
The
goal was for them to replace that system.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.670
[children talking] As students
returned to old O. Perry Walker for the first

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.799
day of class
since Katrina, Principal Laurie made sure

00:36:29.799 --> 00:36:32.910
they understood
this was the start of something new.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.880
&gt;&gt; Principal Laurie: You guys know that we're
now a charter school versus New Orleans Public

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.779
School; you know that, right?

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:41.640
What that means is that we're no longer under
the

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.369
governor's structure of New Orleans Public
Schools.

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:45.690
This is now the Algiers Charter School Association.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.330
And so, what
they did--.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:52.630
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: Six years later New Orleans
is still rebuilding.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.680
The
school system that once had 60,000 students

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.020
is now a
system of schools.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:03.690
75 percent of them charter schools
with 40,000 students.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.100
Academic performance has improved
every year.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.520
Transforming the Big Easy has been anything
but.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:19.579
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: That's the rough first ten
minutes of the film that

00:37:19.579 --> 00:37:20.799
we're working on now.

00:37:20.799 --> 00:37:22.280
It's a remarkable story.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.960
It's a
story of what's possible.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.990
They're still test-score driven.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.829
I don't think they're asking that question,
'how

00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:31.960
are you intelligent?'

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.569
But they're getting there.

00:37:33.569 --> 00:37:36.140
And
it's a story of what's possible and, by golly,

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.839
it's a
story, California needs to watch, needs to

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:46.599
be aware of
because this is an incredibly -- fill in your

00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:49.650
own
adjective state -- when it comes to public

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:50.650
education.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:54.109
I
did a documentary in 2005, a history of public

00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:57.059
education
in California, called First to Worst.

00:37:57.059 --> 00:38:03.529
Sad to say, we could
do a sequel if there were another word that's

00:38:03.529 --> 00:38:05.710
more
superlative than worst.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:10.530
[chuckles wryly] "First to Worst to Even Worse'.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.859
The rich/poor gap has grown.

00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:23.220
The funding is still pretty screwed
up with about 400 of the state's 1000 school

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.180
districts
having private foundations that create a kind

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.490
of quasi
public/private system.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.039
But our hope is that film.

00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:38.259
Have any of you seen a film called Waiting
for Superman?

00:38:38.259 --> 00:38:41.160
My hope
is that we'll undo some of the damage that,

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.250
that -- what
to me was a propaganda -- well made propaganda

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:51.900
film --
will undo some of that damage.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.660
We're working a second
documentary, in addition to our work for PBS,

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:02.200
about a woman
named Michelle Rhee who was the chancellor

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.650
in -- people
are nodding their heads.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.839
She's halftime in California
now.

00:39:06.839 --> 00:39:09.539
She's married to the mayor of Sacramento.

00:39:09.539 --> 00:39:13.720
But she
was chancellor in Washington, D.C. for three

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.720
years plus.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.490
And we followed her on the News Hour.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.930
If you saw her in
"Waiting for Superman", there's a scene where

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.029
she fires somebody.

00:39:21.029 --> 00:39:22.130
That was our
footage.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:26.710
We had a bit of legal squabble with the producer
for Waiting for

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.170
Superman about that.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:37.190
Basically they wanted to use it
without paying for it.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:43.370
And we had to threaten to sue and
they caved when I threatened to boycott the

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:44.920
Hollywood
premier in my underwear.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.650
[laughter] They wrote us a big check at
that point.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.740
But it wasn't much fun.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.119
But anyway, there's
a documentary about Michelle Rhee that's coming

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:56.930
as well.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:00.000
Let me see if there's is anything you would
like to ask or

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.430
say.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:08.099
And I'm not -- I guess you want the microphone.

00:40:08.099 --> 00:40:09.920
So
maybe would you say your name and --.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:17.230
&gt;&gt; Male #2: I'm Harvey [inaudible] and near
the end of that clip it said that almost all

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:21.740
or
75 percent of the schools were run by private

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:22.740
foundations.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.740
Is that --.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.740
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: They're charter schools.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.710
They're run by charter
operators.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.630
They're not for-profit though.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:35.069
[audience member responds inaudibly] They're
actually are no for-profit charter schools

00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:37.400
there.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:41.680
There's one that has a connection to a for-profit
operator.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:47.530
But what New Orleans did -- because you've
seen the research about charter schools and

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:51.030
you know that
a lot of them are no better than regular public

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.640
schools--,
they are public schools.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.580
But what New Orleans did, even
though it was desperate to open schools, it

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.599
turned down
most of the people who asked for a charter.

00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:04.859
Who applied
for a charter.

00:41:04.859 --> 00:41:06.940
They had about 50 applicants.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.020
They
probably needed 20 schools.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.730
They only approved six
charters and by setting that bar very high

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.779
at the
beginning, that didn't guarantee outcomes,

00:41:17.779 --> 00:41:19.691
but it
certainly made it much more likely that they

00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:20.691
would be
successful.

00:41:20.691 --> 00:41:21.691
Yeah, please.

00:41:21.691 --> 00:41:22.920
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Hi.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920
I'm Devon.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.799
And I have two questions.

00:41:25.799 --> 00:41:28.519
What do
you think the barriers are.

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:32.910
I perceive one as being the
fact that a lot of the teachers aren't prepared

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:36.349
to
utilize the media, all the technology that

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:38.499
we have available
right now.

00:41:38.499 --> 00:41:40.710
And also, what do you think about testing?

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:45.119
Do you think it's possible to create the tests
that would

00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:47.390
allow us to teach the way we'd like to?

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.430
Or do you think
those need to be generated?

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.420
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: Those are two terrific questions.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.970
Let me take the
second one first about testing.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.930
The answer is yes.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.180
There
are good tests.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:07.430
There's a program called the
International Baccalaureate which has a challenging

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:17.519
curriculum and tests that are built to test
that curriculum.

00:42:17.519 --> 00:42:20.670
The flaw is that we use
cheap tests.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:25.940
The company named Harts which makes flea
powder and kitty litter spends more money

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:32.150
testing its
products than we spend testing what our children

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.150
have
learned.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.810
I mean that Florida example is probably not
an

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:37.810
outlier.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:41.560
20 bucks on an 11,000 dollar investment.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.390
But
sure you can have good tests.

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:47.980
We are in the process now
of developing national tests.

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.670
There's something called a
Common Core Curriculum.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.060
And there are people trying to
develop tests.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:59.040
My feeling, and by the way they're
having trouble finding the psychometricians

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.839
because they're all working
for Harts.

00:43:02.839 --> 00:43:09.680
Or Toyota or somewhere else where they take
testing the products very carefully.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:16.410
My hunch is that you could develop, for
example, an exam in physics and you wouldn't

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.520
have to
develop a new one each year if you said, "these

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.180
are the
five aspects of physics and you get -- here

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.380
are 100 good
questions in this aspect".

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.660
And just change the numbers.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.529
So you can't teach each of the problems.

00:43:30.529 --> 00:43:31.710
Release the whole test.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:35.540
Release all 3,000 items and say the national
physics test

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.670
this year is going to be 30 of these questions.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:40.670
Nobody's
going to.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.670
And you just change the numbers.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:44.160
I mean, you
could do something like that.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.599
So you wouldn't have to
spend a ton of money developing new tests

00:43:47.599 --> 00:43:51.009
every year and
you could have really good tests.

00:43:51.009 --> 00:43:55.769
Barriers to using the
technology.

00:43:55.769 --> 00:43:56.789
There are several.

00:43:56.789 --> 00:44:02.960
I don't think, everyone
talks about teachers and their technological

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.040
illiteracy
or their fear and I think those are real.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.150
I think a
larger barrier is the adult need for control.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.349
And you
know they've gone through.

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:18.119
You all probably know more
about this than I do, I'm sure you know more

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:21.030
about this than I do, the notion of a walled
garden to

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:26.720
keep kids from going off and looking at porn
or whatever.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.330
And those are -- there are some challenges
there.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:32.170
My
wife was head of a girls school in Palo Alto

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:37.900
for many
years and she would not allow laptops because

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.730
she felt
that when you put this guy up, you're creating

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.890
a barrier.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:46.900
And she was actually, Steve Jobs was one of
the parents,

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:53.720
and said to him, "when there's a tablet, we're
okay with

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.720
it."

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.730
And if you ever been in a college classroom,
been

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:01.170
in the back of the room while somebody is
up front

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.360
lecturing and everybody has their laptops
open, they're

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.890
doing all kinds of stuff.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:09.940
But the barrier, yes, teachers
need some help.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.369
But of course they can get the help from
the kids.

00:45:13.369 --> 00:45:16.249
The kids are these digital natives.

00:45:16.249 --> 00:45:17.529
If they
can let go.

00:45:17.529 --> 00:45:23.369
But a larger part is that schools tend to
use the technology for control, to get information.

00:45:23.369 --> 00:45:26.940
Instead of this idea of creating.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.630
And so, you have to
change the mind set which says, "yeah, we're

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.249
going to be
in the building, but we're not going to respect

00:45:31.249 --> 00:45:32.249
the
walls."

00:45:32.249 --> 00:45:38.119
We're going to do real projects that are real
work.

00:45:38.119 --> 00:45:40.819
The idea of using technology as a better way
of

00:45:40.819 --> 00:45:45.410
getting kids to regurgitate is profoundly
offensive.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:50.369
I
mean, there was a piece in the Times about

00:45:50.369 --> 00:45:54.839
how some
school they were using the clickers to give

00:45:54.839 --> 00:45:56.040
true/false
questions.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.119
[laughs] I mean, that's technology -- they've
invested money to

00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:05.140
buy these things it's insane.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:09.760
But it's a combination of I
think ignorance and fear on the part of the

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760
adults.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.760
Yes,
sir?

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:16.759
&gt;&gt; Male #3: I'm Hubert Chang, software engineer
here and graduate of the

00:46:16.759 --> 00:46:19.460
International Baccalaureate program.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.059
So I'm wondering.

00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:25.109
There's a book called Freakonomics and another
book

00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:28.289
called SuperFreakonomics in which the author
is talking

00:46:28.289 --> 00:46:29.999
about education, I think.

00:46:29.999 --> 00:46:34.579
So I'm wondering whether you've read it
and what you think about it.

00:46:34.579 --> 00:46:37.119
Specifically they gave two
points.

00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:41.660
One point is that the achievement gap may
not so

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:46.210
much be the result of going to good schools
versus bad

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:51.570
schools but it may be the attitude of the
children's

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.089
parents.

00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:59.500
Like in black communities, doing well in school
is sort of considered to be acting white.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.280
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: Acting white yeah.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.650
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Like there are negative consequences
of that for those

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.650
children.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:10.829
And secondly they also make a point because
of

00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:17.279
the feminine movement, right now compared
to let's say 40

00:47:17.279 --> 00:47:22.630
years ago let's say the IQ and the quality
of teachers

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:26.579
have decreased a lot because it used to be
that a lot of

00:47:26.579 --> 00:47:29.579
smart women were teachers and now they're
taking other

00:47:29.579 --> 00:47:35.119
jobs leaving less smart people to become teachers.

00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:41.829
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: There are two sort of complicated
thoughts.

00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:44.260
So I
can -- I may have to ask you to remind me

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.930
the first one
again.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:50.109
But on the notion of the teaching force.

00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:53.789
There's
no question that the composition of the classroom

00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:54.789
has
changed.

00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:59.369
It used to be that there were very few jobs
for

00:47:59.369 --> 00:48:04.829
talented women other than teaching and a few
others.

00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:11.790
And
so, schools were filled with capable, smart

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:12.790
and so on.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:21.640
And we had a system then where we trusted
the teacher.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.529
Go to your parents.

00:48:23.529 --> 00:48:27.779
My mom saved all my report cards --
bless her heart.

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:31.359
[laughter] And when I was an adult, gave me
the

00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:32.359
report cards.

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:34.900
And by then I had children of my own.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.759
And
I was -- and of course I looked at them which

00:48:36.759 --> 00:48:39.650
was a huge
mistake.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:44.020
But one thing I noticed was that in my
elementary school report cards, there was

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:49.160
a block about
this big for the teacher to write comments.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.989
Johnny's
doing such and such -- he's running with scissors

00:48:50.989 --> 00:48:54.700
-- whatever.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.880
Then with my children.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.500
My older son who's now 43.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.599
It
was smaller.

00:49:02.599 --> 00:49:07.970
By the time his -- my youngest -- there was
virtually no.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:14.640
There was couple of check places where
they'd say does this or that.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:20.910
What I inferred from that
is we were moving from a system of trust to

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:23.369
a place where
we really didn't care what the teacher said.

00:49:23.369 --> 00:49:25.880
Because we
didn't trust the teacher.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.700
And now, we're all about
verifying.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.270
We're going to measure how you do on the
test.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:35.289
And then we're going to draw some conclusions
about your teacher.

00:49:35.289 --> 00:49:38.049
So we
move from trust to verify.

00:49:38.049 --> 00:49:40.249
And it was Ronald Reagan who
said.

00:49:40.249 --> 00:49:43.230
when talking about the Soviet Union , trust
but

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:44.570
verify.

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:46.230
And that's really what you need in education.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:49.809
You need a system which trusts teachers.

00:49:49.809 --> 00:49:54.609
We have this
big argument going on in this country defining

00:49:54.609 --> 00:49:55.740
the
problem.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:00.390
Is the problem we don't have enough good people
in the classroom teaching our children?

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.980
Or is the
problem that it's a crummy job?

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:08.970
If you're a teacher, you
cannot get up and say, "I need to use the

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:09.970
bathroom."

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:10.970
You
just can't do it.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:12.269
I mean, you can't make a phone call.

00:50:12.269 --> 00:50:15.829
You don't get to spend time with your colleagues.

00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:19.470
You
don't have a 20 percent rule or anything approaching

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.660
that.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.329
American teachers spend more time in front
of

00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:27.089
their children than do teachers in countries
that are

00:50:27.089 --> 00:50:30.339
eating us for lunch like Finland and South
Korea.

00:50:30.339 --> 00:50:32.440
Their
teachers are expected to be able to watch

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.319
each other and
collaborate and talk about kids.

00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:39.400
How's Charlie doing in
your class?

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.980
So there's a respect for the profession.

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.420
So
the argument is do we need better people?

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.650
Or do we have to
make it a better job.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:51.599
The better people are, you know,
Teach for America.

00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:53.690
Waiting for Superman.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.849
If we could
just get rid of those bottom 10 percent.

00:50:57.849 --> 00:51:00.940
And next year
there will be a new bottom 10 percent.

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:06.010
[chuckles wryly] The 'better job'
people say, "no you need to change the working

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:07.010
conditions."

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.270
Pay is a problem.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:11.240
Teacher pay has not
moved very much in 40 years.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:17.770
40 years ago the average
teacher made about 49,000 dollars, adjusted

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:18.770
for inflation.

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.999
Today it's 55,000
dollars.

00:51:20.999 --> 00:51:23.660
That's a raise of 140 dollars a year.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.079
I did
percentages but I've forgotten them.

00:51:27.079 --> 00:51:31.079
140 dollars a year every year for 40 years.

00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:34.089
But it's not the pay that teachers talk about
when

00:51:34.089 --> 00:51:35.089
they're polled.

00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:37.849
They want a chance to collaborate.

00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:39.280
To
do what we do in our work.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.980
We don't allow that to
happen.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:46.079
So my hunch is -- and it's the argument of
this

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:47.130
book.

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:48.859
It's a big argument but it's irrelevant to
the

00:51:48.859 --> 00:51:50.710
needs of kids.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:57.540
Adults sparring is irrelevant, because as
I said at the beginning, the conditions have

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.829
changed for
kids in terms of school.

00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:06.190
But if you made it a better
job, you would by definition -- it would be

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.160
more
appealing.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:13.930
As you may know 40 percent of first year
teachers leave the profession in five years.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.309
It's a huge
drain.

00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:20.779
And the human capital costs to bring in new
people are huge as well.

00:52:20.779 --> 00:52:25.299
It's not a rewarding profession
in the sense you have to teach for 20 years

00:52:25.299 --> 00:52:30.820
before you
start having some real investment.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.519
People are saying,
"no, you should pay new teachers more at the

00:52:33.519 --> 00:52:34.519
beginning.

00:52:34.519 --> 00:52:35.519
Forget these pensions.

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.119
Do an IRA.

00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:41.489
Give them some
responsibility there and you can change that

00:52:41.489 --> 00:52:43.989
structure
and bring in different people."

00:52:43.989 --> 00:52:50.609
But that would be a
necessary condition but not a sufficient condition.

00:52:50.609 --> 00:52:51.609
Acting white.

00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:55.220
And the family.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:00.809
I'm probably an outlier
on this.

00:53:00.809 --> 00:53:12.440
Because I think educators -- the education
profession-- has an arrogance about it that

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.079
is entirely
undeserved.

00:53:15.079 --> 00:53:22.049
And that is their attitude implicit hardly
ever stated is just leave your kids at the

00:53:22.049 --> 00:53:23.049
door.

00:53:23.049 --> 00:53:24.510
Leave
the money.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:27.670
Leave your kids at the door and we'll educate
them.

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:29.249
And that ain't the way it works.

00:53:29.249 --> 00:53:34.329
The parents are
the principal educators of the child.

00:53:34.329 --> 00:53:35.499
Whatever else
happens.

00:53:35.499 --> 00:53:44.200
Child's going to learn more from you as his
mother or father than from a teacher.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:49.100
And so, schools
should capitalize on that, in my view, in

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.921
an organic way.

00:53:50.921 --> 00:53:56.240
And if I were the school superintendent, which
I never

00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:03.430
will be and I once was -- it's a long story.

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:06.840
I would say
in first grade, in kindergarten, the teacher

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.559
should say
once a week to the class have an assignment

00:54:11.559 --> 00:54:14.489
which the
parents are a part of.

00:54:14.489 --> 00:54:17.210
Kindergarten, go home and ask your mom or
your

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:20.220
dad your grandmother or guardian what was
the first movie

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:26.540
they remember seeing and come tell the class
about it.

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:34.039
Go shopping and get the price of this and
that soup and

00:54:34.039 --> 00:54:39.410
crackers and come tell.

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.130
Ask your mom about the first
trip she ever took.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:47.130
And you're in second grade now and
so write a little paragraph about it.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:51.210
Interview your dad
about the first movie he ever saw.

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:52.920
His favorite food.

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.579
Any ordinary humdrum stuff.

00:54:57.579 --> 00:55:03.660
You know the parent is going
to want to read what her child wrote.

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.430
And is going to to
want to read what the teacher said about.

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.240
And so, it
becomes--.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.869
It's not that parent involvement committees
that schools set up.

00:55:11.869 --> 00:55:13.210
It's just in the thing.

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:14.680
In the
fabric.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:23.279
And then, you don't get this distinction between
doing well in school as acting white.

00:55:23.279 --> 00:55:27.710
Rather it just
becomes part of what you do.

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:30.170
It doesn't have to stop in
elementary school.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:33.200
They can figure out what to keep it
going.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:38.960
It has to be in the DNA of the education folks
to

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:44.479
say, "we know; we're in this together".

00:55:44.479 --> 00:55:45.479
See?

00:55:45.479 --> 00:55:51.450
The job of
school is not to teach children.

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.410
The job of school is to
help grow adults.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:59.769
And they can't do that by themselves
nor should they ever try.

00:55:59.769 --> 00:56:03.750
But if they say, "well, my job
is to teach."

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.180
You got it wrong from the get-go.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:09.069
You say,
"our job is to help grow adults."

00:56:09.069 --> 00:56:12.220
And by the way, what
kind of adults do we want?

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.900
Listen.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.150
Don't give up.

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:18.220
[chuckling]
Okay.

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:21.319
Come on up.

00:56:21.319 --> 00:56:22.319
So I mean I think.

00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:24.739
There's a way to
get around it but it is a real problem.

00:56:24.739 --> 00:56:25.739
Yes, sir?

00:56:25.739 --> 00:56:29.049
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Yeah, so I was wondering what
were your thoughts on

00:56:29.049 --> 00:56:31.989
studio schools -- thoughts and feelings.

00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:36.749
And second, it
seems like you really want to evaluate students

00:56:36.749 --> 00:56:41.380
on a
scalable manner so be able to test them quickly

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.380
and
efficiently.

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:48.599
But your idea of wanting to evaluate each
kid on like what their intelligence is seems

00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:50.920
like a case
by case evaluation basis.

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.839
Do you think -- do we have to
break that idea of wanting to scale testing?

00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:59.460
Do we actually have to have good teaching?

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.180
How do you
balance those two?

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:05.880
&gt;&gt;John Merrow: Oh, wow -- you have to tell
me about studio schools.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.500
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Sorry.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:13.079
So there was a Ted talk about studio schools
schools where work is very project based.

00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:17.249
They're
running pilot programs in London.

00:57:17.249 --> 00:57:20.099
Somewhere in England.

00:57:20.099 --> 00:57:21.099
Yeah.

00:57:21.099 --> 00:57:26.000
&gt;&gt; John Merrow: So can I tell you talk about
project based learning

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.249
instead?

00:57:27.249 --> 00:57:28.499
Yeah.

00:57:28.499 --> 00:57:31.809
I wholeheartedly endorse that as a
concept.

00:57:31.809 --> 00:57:36.320
I mean, that's really what should be going
on.

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:43.989
But it goes back to, journalism school where
you're

00:57:43.989 --> 00:57:46.539
producing a newspaper or magazine or radio
show.

00:57:46.539 --> 00:57:48.109
That's
project-based learning.

00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:51.739
When you're in drama and you're
doing a play.

00:57:51.739 --> 00:57:55.559
It's the kind of stuff that keeps kids in
school when they get to do things like that.

00:57:55.559 --> 00:57:59.170
I think we
need much more of that.

00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:03.150
We need -- my quarrel with
things like the Khan Academy which in many

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:07.739
ways is
terrific, my quarrel is it's isolating and

00:58:07.739 --> 00:58:11.059
it's
acquisition of knowledge.

00:58:11.059 --> 00:58:14.930
Which is important but you
need to go beyond that where you use that

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:17.329
knowledge to
create more knowledge.

00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:18.930
And where you work with other
people.

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:22.280
So the more project-based learning the better.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:27.420
In terms of scalability of testing, I think
you need

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.420
both.

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.250
You need something like our National Assessment
of

00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:33.599
Educational Progress which by the way samples.

00:58:33.599 --> 00:58:34.789
Doesn't
test every kid.

00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:37.710
Samples the health of a district or the health
of a

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:40.680
school and is reliable.

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.259
But what you want is if you're
trusting teachers and the teacher is saying

00:58:45.259 --> 00:58:48.950
'how are you
intelligent how could we build on that'?

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:52.849
Then there's
much more attention to you and there's much

00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:55.819
more trust of
what I, as your teacher, say about how.

00:58:55.819 --> 00:58:59.210
And there's some
work that you've done because it's real work.

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.650
It's more
complicated.

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:03.930
It's more expensive than 20 bucks.

00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:05.079
Yeah.

00:59:05.079 --> 00:59:08.280
I think I'm going over time here and I don't
want to keep

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:12.829
you from, but I do very much appreciate the
opportunity

00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:16.680
to talk about what I've been doing for 35
years now and

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.989
hopefully for a few more years anyway.

00:59:18.989 --> 00:59:19.989
Thank you very
much.

00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:20.989
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank-you very much, John.

00:59:20.989 --> 00:59:20.990
[Applause]
