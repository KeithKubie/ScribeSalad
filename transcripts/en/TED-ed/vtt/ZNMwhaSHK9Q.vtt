00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:07.103
Using the word Shakespeare

00:00:07.103 --> 00:00:09.244
within any classroom in the 21st century

00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:11.122
has become almost as dangerous for teachers

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.342
as putting balloons in a toaster.

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:14.890
After uttering this simple word,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.310
the common teacher is met with a mass of groans,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.174
moans,

00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:19.210
devastated looks,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.939
and the occasional chair tossed in his or her direction.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.712
But Shakespearean works are not boring,

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:24.352
confusing,

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:27.691
long and painful plays written more than 400 years ago.

00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:29.539
They're adventures relating to the extremities

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.688
of human nature:

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:31.354
love,

00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:32.200
hate,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.936
jealousy,

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:34.105
zealous ambition,

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:35.580
fear,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.975
mistrust,

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:36.940
deception,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.932
and murder.

00:00:37.932 --> 00:00:40.626
We owe much of our own language to his invention.

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:42.065
He invented over 2,000 words

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:43.268
for use in his plays,

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:45.774
which still remain in the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:47.634
Words like "countless"

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:48.910
and "assassination"

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.064
as well as phrases like

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:51.318
"one fell swoop,"

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:52.456
"foul play,"

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:54.006
and even "to be in a pickle"

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.382
all originated from William's brilliant brain.

00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:57.169
And there are many echoes

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:59.294
of Shakespeare's romantic language too.

00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:00.712
If you read &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;,

00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:02.140
you'll come across sentences like,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.048
"She doth teach the torches to burn bright,"

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:09.021
and, "So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows."

00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:10.398
Both are quite clever metaphors,

00:01:10.398 --> 00:01:12.646
suggesting that Juliet is both exceptionally beautiful

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:15.069
and far moreso than anyone else.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.022
"For thou art as glorious to this night,

00:01:17.022 --> 00:01:18.273
being o'er my head,

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:20.615
as is a winged messenger of heaven,"

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.372
is a simile suggesting angelic qualities

00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:23.869
of the lady in question.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.477
This is not too different from today's comments like,

00:01:26.477 --> 00:01:27.600
"Hey, beautiful!"

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.023
and, "You're the hottest girl in the room."

00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:31.838
Shakespeare also uses

00:01:31.838 --> 00:01:33.419
slightly more complex metaphors

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:35.949
to describe the intentions of a mischievous man.

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:37.042
For instance,

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:40.572
"This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips,

00:01:40.572 --> 00:01:41.700
two blushing pilgrims,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.981
ready stand to smooth that rough touch

00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:45.453
with a tender kiss,"

00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:48.523
essentially means, "I wish to kiss you."

00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:50.208
Such male intentions were not limited

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:52.340
to simple pecks on the cheek either.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.476
An intentional ambiguity was often used

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:56.590
as a cheeky means to proposition marriage

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.623
or a more intimate relationship.

00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:01.010
Therefore, instead of viewing Shakespearean works

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.335
as out-dated, boring, and unhelpful,

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:04.601
start reading today

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:05.659
and discover the best ways

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.944
to get the one you love

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:08.324
to love you back.
