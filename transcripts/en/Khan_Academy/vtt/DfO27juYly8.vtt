00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
 

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.480
Right now, based on what we know
so far, if we wanted to

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.080
name this molecule, we would
say, well, what's the longest

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.450
carbon chain here?

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.720
Well, we have a two-carbon
chain, and there's all single

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.490
bonds, so we're dealing
with an ethane.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.440
Actually, I'll write
it all at once.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.700
And then we have on the one
carbon, we can call this the

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.730
one carbon, and call this the
two carbon, we have a bromine

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.780
and a fluorine.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:34.100
So we could call this 1-bromo,
and we're putting the bromo

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.650
instead of the fluoro because
B comes before F

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.640
alphabetically.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.410
1-bromo-1-fluoro, and then we're
dealing with an ethane.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.400
We have a two-carbon chain,
all single bonds,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.630
fluoroethane.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.010
That's the name of that molecule
there, just a review

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.630
of some of the earlier
organic nomenclature

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.940
videos we had done.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.850
Now, we know immediately, based
on the last few videos,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.920
that this is also a chiral
carbon, and if we were to take

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.740
its mirror image, we would get
another enantiomer of this

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.780
same molecule, or that they are
enantiomers of each other.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.710
So what is the mirror
image of this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.430
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane look like?

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.380
Well, you'd have the
carbon right here.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.670
I want to get all the
colors right.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.050
You would still have the
bromine up above.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.100
You would have this methyl group
that's attached to the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.280
carbon now pointing in the
left direction, CH3.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.020
The fluorine would now still be
behind the carbon, and now

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.890
the hydrogen would still pop out
of the page, but it would

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.600
now pop out and to the right.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.610
 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.080
That is the hydrogen.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.180
Now, based on our naming so
far, we would name this

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.860
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, and
we would also name this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.100
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, but
these are fundamentally two

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.169
different molecules.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.100
Even though they have the same
molecules in them; they have

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.280
the same molecular formula;
they have the same

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.640
constitution in that this
carbon is connected to a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.810
hydrogen, a fluorine, and a
bromine; this carbon is

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.420
connected to the same things;
this carbon is connected to a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.440
carbon, three hydrogens; so
is this one; these are

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.675
stereoisomers.

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:32.990
These are stereoisomers, and
they're mirror images of each

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.240
other, so they're enantiomers.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.220
 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.500
And actually, they will, one,
polarize light differently,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.070
and they actually can often have
very different chemical

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.860
properties, either in a chemical
or biological system.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.190
So it seems not good that
we have the same

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.540
names for both of these.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.460
So what we're going to focus on
in this video is how do you

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.860
differentiate between the two?

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.510
 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.460
So how do we differentiate
between the two?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.470
So the naming system we're going
to use right here is

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.040
called the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog
system, but it's a different

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.000
Cahn, it's not me.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.835
It's C-A-H-N instead
of K-H-A-N.

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:26.500
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, and
it's a way of differentiating

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.520
between this enantiomer, which
right now we would call

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.110
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane,
and this enantiomer,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.820
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.210
It's a pretty straightforward
thing.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.520
Really, the hardest part is to
just visualize rotating the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.560
molecules in the right way
and figuring out in which

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.410
direction it's kind of--
whether it's kind of a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.010
left-handed or right-handed
molecule.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.770
We're going to take
it step by step.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.960
So the first thing you do in the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.170
is to, one, identify your
chiral molecule.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.330
Here, it's pretty obvious.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.550
It's this carbon right here.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.350
We'll just focus on this left
one, the one we started with

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.430
first. It's bonded to three
different groups.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.900
And then what you want to do is
you want to rank the groups

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.770
by atomic number.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.120
So if you go up here, out of
bromine, hydrogen, fluorine,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.130
and a carbon, this is what is
bonded directly to this

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.900
carbon, which has the highest
atomic number?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.470
Bromine is over here-- let me
do this in a darker color.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.790
We have bromine at 35, we have
fluorine at 9, we have carbon

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.250
at 6, and then we have
hydrogen at 1.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.500
So of all these, bromine is the
largest. We'll just call

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.260
this number one.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.390
Then after that, we
have fluorine.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.690
That is the number two.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.810
Number three is the carbon.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.950
And then hydrogen is
the smallest, so

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.450
that is number four.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.290
So now that we've numbered
them, the next step is to

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.890
orient this molecule so that
the smallest atomic number

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.890
group is sitting
into the page.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.060
It's sitting behind
the molecule.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.570
Right now, this hydrogen is the
smallest of all of them.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.860
Bromine's the largest, hydrogen
is the smallest, so

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.970
we want to orient it behind
the molecule.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.650
The way it's drawn right
now, it's oriented in

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.920
front of the molecule.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.210
So to orient it behind the
molecule, and this really is

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.560
the hardest part is just to
visualize it properly.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.480
Remember, this fluorine is
behind; this is right in the

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.595
plane of the paper; this is
popping out of the paper.

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:30.430
 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.920
We would want to rotate.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.820
You could imagine we'd be
rotating the molecule in this

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.800
direction so that--
let me redraw it.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.140
 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.090
We have the carbon here.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.060
And now since we've rotated it
like this, we've rotated it

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.450
roughly 1/3 around the circle,
so it's about 120 degrees.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.220
Now, this hydrogen is where
the fluorine was.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.430
 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.730
So that's where the
hydrogen is.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.340
The fluorine is now where
this methyl group is.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.120
 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.960
These dotted lines show
that we're behind now.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.420
This shows that we're
in the plane.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.340
And the methyl group is now
where the hydrogen is.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.640
It's now popping out
of the page.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.370
It's going to the
left and out.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.120
So this methyl group is now
popping out of the page, out

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.290
and to the left.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.300
That's where our methyl
group is.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.420
So all we've done is we've just
rotated this around about

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.950
120 degrees.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.680
We've just gotten this to go
behind, and that's kind of the

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.340
first step after we've
identified the chiral carbon

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.380
and ranked them by
atomic number.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.760
And.
Of course.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.360
The bromine is still
going to be on top.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.220
 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.020
Now, once you put the smallest
atomic number molecule in the

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.430
back, then you want to
look at the rankings

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.630
of one through three.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.510
And we have four
molecules here.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.040
We look at the largest, which
is bromine, number one.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.540
Then number two is fluorine,
number two, and then number

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.830
three is this methyl group.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.360
That's the carbon that's bonded
to this carbon, so it's

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.900
number three right there.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.660
And in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog
system, we literally just

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.640
think about what would it take
to go from number one to

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.900
number two to number three?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.400
And in this case, we would
go in this direction.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.250
To go from number one to number
two to number three, we

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.020
would go in the clockwise
direction.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.670
We're just ignoring the
hydrogen right now.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.200
That's just sitting behind it.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.310
That was the first step, to
orient it so it's sitting in

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.040
the back, the smallest
molecule.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.590
And then the three largest
ones, you just say what

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.750
direction do we have to go to
go from number one to number

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.780
two to number three?

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.570
In this case, we have
to go clockwise.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.180
And if we go clockwise now,
then we call this a

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.210
right-handed molecule, or we use
the Latin word for right,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.410
which is rectus.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:54.510
And so we would call this
molecule right here not just

00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.700
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, this
is R, R for rectus.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.210
Or you could even think right,
although we'll see left is

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.790
used as S, which is sinister,
so the Latin is really where

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.050
the R comes from.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:18.260
But this is
(R)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.470
That's this one right here.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.910
So you might guess, well, this
must be the opposite, this

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.450
must be the counterclockwise
version.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.860
We can do it really fast.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.480
So same idea.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.280
We know the largest one.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.960
Bromine is number one.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.970
That's the largest in terms
of atomic number.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.809
Fluorine is number two.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.400
Carbon is number three.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.230
Hydrogen is number four.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.830
What we want to do is put
hydrogen in the back, so what

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.350
we're going to have to do is
rotate it to the back to where

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.190
fluorine is right now.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.860
So if we had to redraw this
molecule right here, you'd

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.890
have your carbon still.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.015
You still have your bromine
sitting on top.

00:08:52.015 --> 00:08:55.030
But we're going to put the
hydrogen now to the back, so

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.120
the hydrogen is now where
the fluorine used to be.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.370
The hydrogen's there.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.120
 

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.310
This methyl group, this carbon
with the three hydrogens, is

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.830
going to be rotated to where
the hydrogen used to be.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.060
It's now going to pop out of
the page, because we're

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.710
rotating it in that direction,
so this is our methyl group

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.590
right there.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.900
And then this fluorine is going
to be moved where the

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.740
methyl group was, so this
fluorine will go right here.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.070
And now, using the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system,

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.240
this is our number one, this
is our number two, just by

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.800
atomic number, this
is number three.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.850
You go from number one through
number two to number three.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.620
You go in this direction.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.870
You're going counterclockwise.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.520
 

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.890
Or we are going to the left, or
we use the Latin word for

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.890
it, which is sinister.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.420
And the word sinister comes from
the Latin word for left,

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.250
so I guess right is good, and
people thought either

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.100
left-handed people were bad, or
if you're not going to the

00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.720
right, it's bad.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.180
I don't know why sinister took
on its sinister meaning now in

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.110
common language.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.400
But it's now the sinister
version of the molecule.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.700
So we would call this version,
this enantiomer of

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:19.840
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, we
would call this S, S for

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.970
sinister, or for left, or
for counterclockwise:

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.220
(S)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:31.440
 

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.330
So now we can differentiate
the names.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.180
We know that these are two
different configurations.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.540
And that's what the S and the R
tell us, that if you have to

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.660
go from this to this, you would
literally have to detach

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.150
and reattach different groups.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.570
You'd actually have
to break bonds.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.850
You actually have to swap two of
these groups in some way in

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.470
order to get from this
enantiomer to this enantiomer.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.410
They're different
configurations, really

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.270
fundamentally different
molecules, stereoisomers,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.770
enantiomers, however
you want to call them.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.866
