00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:10.094
As a wildfire rages through
the grasslands,

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:14.595
three lions and three wildebeest
flee for their lives.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:16.125
To escape the inferno,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:21.224
they must cross over to the left bank
of a crocodile-infested river.

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:24.310
Fortunately, there happens
to be a raft nearby.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.488
It can carry up to two animals at a time,

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:30.995
and needs as least one lion
or wildebeest on board

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:33.351
to row it across the river.

00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:35.674
There's just one problem.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:39.806
If the lions ever outnumber the
wildebeest on either side of the river,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.444
even for a moment,

00:00:41.444 --> 00:00:45.426
their instincts will kick in,
and the results won't be pretty.

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:50.075
That includes the animals in the boat
when it's on a given side of the river.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:54.255
What's the fastest way for all six animals
to get across

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:57.974
without the lions stopping for dinner?

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:01.555
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:02.815
Answer in: 3

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:03.845
Answer in: 2

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:04.796
Answer in: 1

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:06.911
If you feel stuck on a problem like this,

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:10.816
try listing all the decisions you can make
at each point,

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:14.195
and the consequences each choice
leads to.

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:18.006
For instance, there are five options
for who goes across first:

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.186
one wildebeest,

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:20.186
one lion,

00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:21.286
two wildebeest,

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:22.275
two lions,

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:23.736
or one of each.

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:25.245
If one animal goes alone,

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:27.587
it'll just have to come straight back.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.475
And if two wildebeest cross first,

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.456
the remaining one will immediately
get eaten.

00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:34.976
So those options are all out.

00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:36.597
Sending two lions,

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.267
or one of each animal,

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:42.506
can actually both lead to solutions
in the same number of moves.

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:45.672
For the sake of time,
we'll focus on the second one.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.637
One of each animal crosses.

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:51.082
Now, if the wildebeest stays 
and the lion returns,

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:53.537
there will be three lions
on the right bank.

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:56.457
Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest.

00:01:56.457 --> 00:01:59.250
So we need to have the lion
stay on the left bank

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.939
and the wildebeest go back to the right.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.987
Now we have the same five options,

00:02:03.987 --> 00:02:07.137
but with one lion 
already on the left bank.

00:02:07.137 --> 00:02:10.298
If two wildebeest go,
the one that stays will get eaten,

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:12.417
and if one of each animal goes,

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:14.977
the wildebeest on the raft
will be outnumbered

00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:17.728
as soon as it reaches the other side.

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:19.078
So that's a dead end,

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:20.978
which means that at the third crossing,

00:02:20.978 --> 00:02:23.646
only the two lions can go.

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:25.067
One gets dropped off,

00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:27.457
leaving two lions on the left bank.

00:02:27.457 --> 00:02:30.457
The third lion takes the raft back to
the right bank

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:33.018
where the wildebeest are waiting.

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:34.238
What now?

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:37.297
Well, since we've got two lions waiting
on the left bank,

00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:40.877
the only option is for two wildebeest
to cross.

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:44.767
Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest
going back,

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.339
since that just reverses the last step.

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.909
And if two lions go back,

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.919
they'll outnumber the wildebeest
on the right bank.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.748
So one lion and one wildebeest
take the raft back

00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:58.800
leaving us with one of each animal
on the left bank

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.959
and two of each on the right.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.149
Again, there's no point in sending 
the lion-wildebeest pair back,

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.981
so the next trip should be either
a pair of lions

00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:10.098
or a pair of wildebeest.

00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:13.889
If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest
on the left, so they stay,

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.760
and the two wildebeest cross instead.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.840
Now we're quite close because the
wildebeest are all where they need to be

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.770
with safety in numbers.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.677
All that's left is for that one lion
to raft back

00:03:25.677 --> 00:03:29.390
and bring his fellow lions over
one by one.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.589
That makes eleven trips total,

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:35.460
the smallest number needed
to get everyone across safely.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.062
The solution that involves sending both
lions on the first step works similarly,

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:43.619
and also takes eleven crossings.

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.331
The six animals escape unharmed
from the fire just in time

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:50.249
and begin their new lives 
across the river.

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:52.679
Of course, now that the danger's passed,

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:57.121
it remains to be seen how long their
unlikely alliance will last.
