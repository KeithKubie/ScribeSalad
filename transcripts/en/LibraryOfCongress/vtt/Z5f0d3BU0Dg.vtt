00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.520
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good evening.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.140
I'm Anne McLean from the
Library's Music Division.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.910
This is a great crowd.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.530
Thank you for coming.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.730
We are really pleased to be able
to have such a wonderful group

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.860 position:56%
of people here for this talk
centering on Peter Guralnick's book,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.890
Sam Phillips, The Man Who
Invented Rock and Roll.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.850
And I say centering on
because we're fortunate tonight

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.210
to be presenting not only one but
two astute and perceptive observers

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.060
of popular music culture.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.760
Peter has invited Geoffrey Himes

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.340
for what should be a
deeply informed conversation

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.420
of very wide musical horizons.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.940
We're really pleased to have
Peter here making a stop

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.480
on a packed nationwide
book tour for a book

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.720
that the New York Times calls
beautiful and meticulous.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.120
It's the story of recording
producer, Sam Phillips,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.830
as rock and roll prophet.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.990
That's a description
from the journalist,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.310
Gregory Cott [assumed spelling],
who calls Phillips a key architect

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.660
in a musical as well
as social revolution.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.550
Peter's the offer of a number
of poetic and provocative

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.250
and insightful books that
chronicle our nation's pop history.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.520 position:56%
These include benchmark studies on
Elvis Presley, Last Train to Memphis

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.120
and Careless Love, and
the powerful Dream Boogie,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.480
The Triumph of Sam Cooke.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.260
We're also pleased to have the
chance to welcome Geoffrey Himes,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.420
author of a major book on Bruce
Springsteen, Born in the USA,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.350 position:56%
and a long time feature
commentator for the Washington Post.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.210
If you follow magazines like
Rolling Stone, Paste, Down Beat

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.940 position:56%
and Jazz Times, you'll know the
calliber of his thought and writing.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.630
This lecture is part of a huge and
diverse 90th anniversary season.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.010
I know some of you've
been to our events.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.250
We hope you'll come back
for more evenings like this.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.940
Check out our brochure.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.860
I'd like to say that the Library's
Music Division is the home

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.100
of the world's largest music
collection, 22 million items.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.280
But we not only have the artifacts,
but we love creating programs

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280
like this that introduce
not only those artifacts

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.490
of our magnificent shared musical
culture but give us a chance

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.040
to think about one
of the only things

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.450 position:56%
that can transcend all cultural
boundaries, the love of great music.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.780
So thanks so much.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.510
Please welcome Peter
Guralnick and Geoffrey Himes.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.500
[ Applause ]

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.410
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: All right.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.710
Hello. All right.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.590
Thanks for coming everybody.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.070
I'm glad to see so
many people coming out.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.620
What I want to talk about
first is when we talk

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.420
about popular music history, we
usually think of it being made

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.710
by people who sing
and play instruments.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.200
But I think one of the
things that's interesting

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.460
about Peter's new book is
how he points out the fact

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.240 position:56%
that non musicians play an important
part in shaping the history

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.940
of popular music, and I was hoping

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.700
that we could start off
having you talk a bit

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.090
about why non musicians are an
important part of this history.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.390
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick:
Well I think Sam --

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.840
Sam actually would have [inaudible]
the title producer didn't exist

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.350
at the time, but he liked
to think of himself more

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.720
as a practicing psychologist.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.210
But his mission in some
ways was very different

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.360
from let's say the mission
of somebody like Rick Hall

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.220 position:56%
who also very much influenced
recorded music, all kinds of people.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.820
Willie Mitchell created the
sound that showcased Al Green,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.650
very different from the Albert
Greene with an E on the end

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.870
who had debuted with Back Up Train.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.170
Am I feeding back [inaudible]?

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.500
Speak up a little?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.800
All right.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.100
I'm going to shout out.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.600
Somebody like Rick Hall was
looking to create a sound.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.900
He had a sound mind.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.650
You could go through any number
of takes to create that sound.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.200
Sam was looking for the
sound that was in you.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.360
Sam was looking to bring out of you
what you may or may not know was

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.040
in yourself and to
give you confidence

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.340
and courage to express it.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.790
And in many ways, it's funny, I may
have mentioned that in the book,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.360
but I was thinking the
other day that I could just

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.040
as easily have called the
book I Hear America Sing,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.160
The Emergence of Sam Phillips.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.710
I mean, that's what it is.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.010
He heard America singing.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.780
He heard America singing
[inaudible] birds on the trees

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.140
or could be the wind
out in the country.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.860
It could be the silence
of the country evening.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.520
It was that kind of singing --

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.450 position:56%
it was what DeFord Bailey heard that
inspired him to play the harmonica.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.980
Listened to the sounds of trains.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.450
Living out in the country.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.700
DeFord Bailey was the person who
was the first African American

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.990
and for many years the only African
American in the Grand Ole Opry,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.980
wonderful harmonica player.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.900
So in some ways, Sam was
the exception, I think,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.480
to what Geoffrey is talking about.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.570
Producers like Chips Moman
played a very active role in --

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.530 position:56%
not in inflicting the will but in
looking for something in particular.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.440
And that is what Sam was --
if you listen to a sampling --

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.410
I mean I put together a
collection with the same title

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.730
as the book on Yep Roc Records.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.050
You can get it on vinyl,
three LP's and two CD's.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.450
But it -- for those vinyl
favor -- those who favor vinyl.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.530
But he had such a range of music.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.250
The one thing that ties
it together is spontaneity

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.690
and individuality of performing.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.250
That's what he was looking for
most of all and sort of like

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.410 position:56%
when you talk about Harmonica Frank,
a sort of a medicine show performer

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.100
who played the harmonica
and when he came

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.310
to sing just moved the
harmonica around his mouth.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.720
He didn't use a bracket
or anything like that.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.760
And to Sam, Harmonica
Frank was a beautiful hobo,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.270
and he said, "You're a hobo.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.570
You have to be inspired.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.870
You have to be resourceful."

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.280
And that's what he
looked for in music.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.080
So I don't know if
that's a direct response

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.440
to what Geoffrey said,
but it's my response.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.090
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: But the book,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.470
you talk about all these
profound records that came

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.210
out during these 11 years that
Sam was actively making records.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.350
Whether it's Howlin' Wolf or
Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.110
or Charlie Rich or Ike Turner,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.220
these are all obviously very
talented people, but it seems to be

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.820
in the book you're
making the argument

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.500
that the music they
made was different

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.940
because Sam Phillips
was a collaborator.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.470
Is that accurate to say?

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.750
Is that fair to say?

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.050
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: You
sound so much better

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.350
than I do on the microphone.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.370
I don't know.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:16.970
We'll see if the fault is
in the mic or if it's in me.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.440
I suspect it's in me.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.740
But -- okay.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.880
See, that's what I needed.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.700
I needed coaching.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.520
But it's -- I forget
where we were in this.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.820
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: What
difference did it make

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.170
that Sam was a collaborator?

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.540
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: I
think so much of it.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.540
I don't think Sam knew what
was in each of these artists.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.840
He saw them as artists.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.100
He saw them as people who
he sensed -- he believed --

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.460
one of the things Sam believed

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.580
in most strongly was his
ability to read people.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.340
It was also his ears.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.300
Those were probably the two
things he prided himself most on.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.240
But he didn't know
necessarily what each person --

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.230
in the case of Howlin'
Wolf, he knew what he heard.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.100
It's where the soul
of man never dies.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.960
In that case, he might as well have
been Alan Lomax or field reporter

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.760
because although what he was trying
to do was to bring out the sound

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.180
of Howlin' Wolf to the maximum
degree that you would be able

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.390
to appreciate it as
he appreciated it

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.580 position:56%
on a record as opposed to in person.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.890
There, he was simply
trying to record it.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.240
But when he met Elvis
Presley, he describes him

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.450
as being the most introspective
person whoever came into his studio

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.860
and one of the most insecure.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.310
And all he simply recognized
the unique talent.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.020 position:56%
He didn't know what that talent was.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.750 position:56%
In that case, his genius if you want
to call it that, was the patience,

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.130
and the man not giving to patience

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:58.530
as his associate assistant
[inaudible] the man not given

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.310
to patience.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.250 position:56%
Sam showed the most extraordinary
patience, and he was willing to wait

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.650
until he heard emerge this
voice and then he wanted

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.780
to do everything he
could to assist it.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.150
But it wasn't like he had
a vision for Elvis Presley.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.140
He just simply -- or that he had
a vision for Little Junior Parker.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.660
I mean, he was looking for them
to express themselves in a way

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.100
that he sensed they had -- they
were able to express themselves.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.770
In the case of somebody
like Johnny Cash,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.260
I think what Geoffrey says is
certainly true in the sense

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.420
that Johnny Cash came in with
[inaudible] blues and recorded it

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.900
at one of his very first sessions
in what amounted to a demo.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.230
And he's got this kind
of [inaudible] voice

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.610
that you would never
recognize as Johnny Cash.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.460
He sounds almost like
Marty Robbins singing

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.610
in a higher range than he used to.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.680
And Sam just didn't
hear the song at all.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.320 position:56%
Eventually, he came to see the song.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.260
Sam came to see the song
as a metaphor for the way

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.580
in which we're all in prison,
which is kind of a funny thing.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.130
Sam was not a poetic person
necessarily, but that was --

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.490
and he sold that to
Johnny -- to John --

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.970
Johnny Cash as being a way in which
the songs communicated to everybody

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.950
and then he got John to
speed up the tempo much

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.950
against Johnny Cash's will and
as he did with I Walk the Line,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.020
and Johnny Cash said,
"This will never work.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.300
I'll do it, but we'll
never use it," and walked

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.130
out of the studio convinced
they would never use it.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.660
When he heard it on the radio,
he said, "Dang, that's good."

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.940
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: Right, but what
I'm saying is that just as Elvis

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.860 position:56%
and Johnny Cash didn't have a clear
vision of what they were going to do

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.460
and just as Sam didn't have a clear
vision of what they were going

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.530
to do, but it was the fact
that they were working together

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.160
that made a difference.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.720
They were like both on an
artistic qwest together,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.230
and neither of them
would have achieved it

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.040
without the other in a sense.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.340
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: Yeah.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.640
I guess that's true.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.140
But the thing was is that Sam
was looking for spontaneity.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.650
I remember.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.790
Sam was looking for
spontaneity above all.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.630
I mean, Jack Kerouac talked
about spontaneous [inaudible].

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.030
That was Sam.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:17.080
And it was nurturing spontaneity
and seizing upon the feeling

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.380
as opposed to the perfection.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.360
I mean, Sam hated the
word perfection.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.730
He said, "I hate that word.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.020
It should be banned from
the English language."

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.350
I think what he meant
was that as you seek --

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.330
as you correct all your mistakes,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.140
as you make everything perfect
you achieve nothing more

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.780
than kind of sterility.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:40.210
And so, yeah, he was working with
artists who in almost every case

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.070
from Howlin' Wolf, Mike
Turner to Jerry Lee Lewis,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.840
Charlie Rich apprised that
same kind of spontaneity.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.820
And that was what he
nurtured most of all I think.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:54.910
But it was not so much that
he had a template or any kind

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.510
of specific approach that would
-- and it just delighted him.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.540
I mean, for instance,
Harmonica Frank or you listen --

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.890
you probably didn't hear it
coming in, but he listened

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.080
to Joe Hill Louis,
and you think, "God,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.680
how could anybody ever record it?"

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.820 position:56%
I mean, it's completely out of tune.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.070
It's -- Sam loved distortion.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.690
You go right to the edge of
distortion and over the edge.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.200
And yet there's something about
it that's absolutely both unique

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.500
and compelling.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.370
And that was what drew Sam
to the music to begi with,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.040
and I think it's what he tried to
bring out of each of the musicians.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.100
He didn't want them settling down.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: One of the things
you talked about in the book is

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.720
that Sam had this -- did have a
vision in the sense that he grew

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:46.880
up among poor people in Alabama
who were not paid attention to by

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.690
and large by the cultural
establishment of the 40's.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:56.890
And he was convinced that these
poor southerners both black

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:04.580
and white had something to say
and needed a catalyst or vehicle

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.720
to have it come out, to have it
emerge into the public marketplace

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.380
so to speak and that was
what he was going to do.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.680
You write about this.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.530
Even though he didn't have
a specific sonic template

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.960
for these people, he did
have that as a mission.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.260
Is that right?

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.560
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick:
Well, he did, yeah.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.920 position:56%
But I mean, the thing is is that Sam
and from the age of seven or eight,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.030
he said to me -- he
said, "Listen to me now."

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.870
I'm talking about an
8 or 9-year-old kid.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.170
Had a sense of racial
injustice, was struck by the fact.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:44.930
He was working in the fields on 323
acre farm that his father rented

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.690
and lost with the depression.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.710
He was working with black
and white sharecroppers.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.840
And it struck him so forcibly.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.310
And I know this from relatives
of Sam's of his generation

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.560
who it definitely did not strike
as forcibly and were not thrilled

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.410 position:56%
to hear this little kid starting off
his opinions about racial injustice.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.090
I mean, Sam would talk
about anything.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.050
He was not at risk
of being accepted.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:13.060
He wasn't -- to his benefit
and to his disbenefit too.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:19.380
But he -- and from a very
early age if not from 8 or 9,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.430
certainly from his
teens on he believed

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.970
that the African American music --

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.610
he wanted to give voice
to the voiceless.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.920
This was his mission all the
way through as Geoffrey said it.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.810
It became his mission for
poor whites as well as blacks,

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:37.070
but to begin with, the
idea was that his idea was

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.250
that the African American
expression both secular

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.590
and gospel what he heard
coming out of the black church,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.710
which was a block and a half
from the church he attended

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.020
and that he would stand outside
of every afternoon for as long

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.320
as he could in the summer.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.870
He said with the windows open
wide he could fully partake

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.170
of the service.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.700
When we went back to it in 1999,

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.800
I've never seen anyone
more thrilled going

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.350
into that African American church.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.380
But that -- sounds he heard in
the fields and what he observed

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.760
on Beale Street when he
was 16, his first vision

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.660
of Beale Street was a vision of
freedom and set him in his mind

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.500
that he was going to move -- he was
going to live in Memphis some day,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.660
not live in Memphis to
work in the Hotel Peabody,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.960
which his what he did do.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.510
It was to be -- to live in
Memphis which was exemplified

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.160
by Beale Street, black
America's mainstream.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.280
So he -- but he believed
that ever fiber of his being

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.490
from a very early age, let's
say from early teens on,

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.510
that if a mainstream audience
meaning a white audience could ever

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.050
hear the sounds he had heard
the African American sounds

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.280
that they would be swept away
by the power of that music

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.140
and spirituality of that music.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.440
Not just the music, but the
message and that this would break

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.660
down the walls of segregation,
which is more a dream then it is --

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.850
but that was why he opened his
first studio or his only studio.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.400
He opened the studio -- the
Memphis Recording Service

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.040
at 706 Union Avenue
January 2, 1950 on the cusp

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.330
of the second half
of the 20th century.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.630
But that's when he opened it.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.740
I mean, he said it
contemporaneously was to give some

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.650
of these great Negro artists in
the south the opportunity to record

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.950
where they don't have any.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.390
And that's what he did for
the first four or five years

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.870 position:56%
that the studio was open, and he did
it on his belief, not out of his --

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.820 position:56%
he did it at great economic peril
to himself, at great risk to himself

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.820
in many ways, but he did it
because he believed so strongly

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.490
that once the world was exposed,

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.730
once the mainstream
audience was exposed

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.270
that they would seize
upon this music and that

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.800
that would open up doors.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.180
It would break down the
walls of segregation in a way

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.720
that wasn't going to change
every element of society.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.740
It was going to change
a large element

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.960
of the way that people thought.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.530
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: What I found
striking reading the book,

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:04.610
especially about this sense of
mission that Sam had was that a lot

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.390
of the artists that he worked

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:12.600 position:56%
with were striving towards something
similar, but it didn't seem

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.240
like they could articulate it or
be as conscious of it as Sam was.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.680
One of the things that
marked Sam was that --

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.530
as you say, even at 8 or 9 --

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.980 position:56%
he could articulate and
consciously set these kind of goals,

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.870
which strikes me and makes --

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.800
just one of the things that
makes him an unusual person.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.950
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: I mean, his
first ambition was to be a great --

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.390 position:56%
was to be a -- not great -- criminal
defense lawyer like Clarence Darrow

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.600 position:56%
to right the wrongs of society,
which were both social and had to do

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.020 position:56%
with both social and racial justice.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.860
That was -- and he wasn't able
to do that because he had to drop

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.660
out of school after his junior
year because his father died.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.200
But, I mean, an example of the
way in which Geoffrey's talking

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:59.060 position:56%
about is he often spoke about how he
didn't know anyone who was more free

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.210
of prejudice than Elvis Presley.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.990
He believed there was
no question whatsoever

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:09.030
that Elvis shared his goal --
knew exactly what he was doing.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.330
I believe this too.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.630
I mean, but I didn't know Elvis.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.680
I wrote him a letter, but
that's as close as I got.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.040
But he said that he believed
that Elvis just as much

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.520
as he knew exactly what they were
doing, knew that they were sneaking

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.580
around the race line,
knew what he was doing

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.130
when he embraced not just
African American music

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.010
but African American artists when
he had his picture in the paper

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.600
with BB King, Little Junior Parker,
Bobby Blue Bland when he spoke

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.480
about his admiration of these
African American artists

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.170
in the mainstream press.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.570
And when he was hailed as what
was then called a race hero

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.750
in the African American
press at that time.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.150
Something which was set aside
-- I mean, not set aside by him

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.400
but it was reversed
and later [inaudible]

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.470
within the African
American community.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:04.580
But Sam said there was no question
that Elvis shared those views,

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.980
that he knew what they were doing.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:11.370
He knew that -- and that he
gloried in the idea that --

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.650
he says, "You got to admit,"
he says, "I just got to say,

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.540
didn't we knock the shit
out of that race line?"

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.090
But Elvis was not saying it.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.490 position:56%
Elvis was not going to articulate
it and probably none of his artists.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.090 position:56%
I mean, someone like Jerry Lee Lewis
-- I'm not going to get into --

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.200
I'm not going to imagine
the complexity

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.740
of Jerry Lee Lewis' feelings about
anything because it could go --

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.340
sort of like trying to imagine
Merle Haggard's political views.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.440
I mean, these are brilliant
musicians,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.090
and these are real geniuses.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.560
But anyway -- but the point is
that when Jerry Lee Lewis says

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.890
if I could play guitar like
BB King, I'd be president --

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.760
to get to Jerry Lee Lewis.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.730
BB King was -- the fact that
Sam had recorded not just Elvis

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.540
but BB King was a key element
in bringing him in the studio.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.690
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: One of the
things that the book points out is

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:06.470
that Sam Phillips worked with a lot
of different people besides Elvis

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:13.630
and the Million Dollar Quartet,
but the relationship between Elvis

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.040
and Sam is very interesting.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.400
You're talking about how they
shared these kind of values.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.020
At the same time, they
were different people.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.100
I was wondering if you could
articulate what the differences

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.090
and how those differences
complimented and allowed them

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:32.160
to make the records they made.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.660
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: Well,
to say one thing about Sam.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:39.920
The Sam who recorded these
great records from Rocket 88

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.990
and Howlin' Wolf right on
through to Charlie Rich's

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:48.020 position:56%
Who will the Next Fool Be was not
-- Sam in the studio is not the same

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.180
who created the public persona
that many of you have seen

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.630
from his later years which
was a conscious creation

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.010
which was very different and
which was highly articulate,

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.310
highly oratorical, high
ecclesiastical at times

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.500
or at least I wrote
about meeting him.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:10.440 position:56%
He was like an old testament prophet
sauntering from the hill top.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.430
But that was not the
person who did the music.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.510
The person who produced
the music for want

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.730
of a better word was
someone who nurtured it,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:24.450
who was very soft spoken but
who was firm in his beliefs

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.410
and who was never going
to back down about --

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.420
on anything that he did believe.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.250
As he said, he was not going to
get up on any tall stumps to try

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:42.870
to convince either preachers
or DJ's or record distributors

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.280
to play his music because
he knew these people.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.580
They were friends.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.570
And he knew that their views
were not necessarily his.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.560
But he was certainly going to
try to sell what he believed

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.280 position:56%
in in the best way that he knew how.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.740
And he had this degree of
certainty of self-certainty.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.250 position:56%
I think that's probably the thing
that set him most apart from someone

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.360
like Elvis who in a
certain sense if you were

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.040
to say what was Elvis' problem?

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.770
I mean, it was -- aside
from what might be called --

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.640
and again, I'm as reluctant to
assign a term to this as I am

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.470
to describe the -- Merle
Haggard's politics.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.690
I mean, you could call what Elvis
suffered from the last five years

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.990
of his life as a kind
of clinical depression,

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.320
which was just never dealt with.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.190
But the other thing was, his
biggest problem was simply

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.700
that unlike someone like Sam Cooke
who absorbed everything he could

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.190
from everyone that he
met and then moved on,

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.760
Elvis was someone who
wanted to be loved.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.840
And it was -- as Sam
described him --

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.080
had the insecurity that
prevented him from saying okay,

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.530
I've gotten what I can from you,
from Sam, from Colonel Parker,

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:54.020
from whoever and moved on to do
what he himself wanted to do.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.430
And it was sort of an
inability to deal with --

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.190
for want of a better
word -- adulthood.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.190
And so I think that
that's -- that's where --

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.800
I mean, Sam was on a mission.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.100
He knew what he wanted to do.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.400
He set out to do it.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.840
He was somebody who suffered
from depression all his life.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.030
He had -- twice he had eight
electroshock treatments

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.340
when he was -- 1944 --
when he was 21 years old

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.090
and electroshock was not -- it
was at the dawn of electric.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.390
What's it called now?

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:28.360
Electroconvulsive -- yeah,
electroconvulsive therapy, yeah.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.910
And this is a very different thing
from the kind of shock treatment

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.680
that he had, and many people
never recovered from it.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.340 position:56%
But this is what Sam believed at 21.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.190
He's settled on the idea that
this was what he needed to happen.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.250
He did it at this sanitarium
in Birmingham.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.590
And then right after Rocket
88 -- and he would tell --

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.200
I mean, if you met him on the
street, he might tell you this.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.840
If Geoffrey were interviewing
him, he would --

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.290
Geoffrey might ask him about
Elvis, and he might say,

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.050
"Let me tell you about
the electroshock."

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.530
Because he believed
there was no shame in it

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.900
and that mental illness was no
different then physical illness

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.340 position:56%
and that one shouldn't hide anything

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.300
and that he wasn't proud
of having recovered.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.050
It's like talking about
a recovering alcoholic.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.850
He saw it as this was
his temperament

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.700
and this was how he dealt with it.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.910
He was fortunate, and he was
not going to try to hide it.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:23.050
But the point is went after
the second set in '51 right

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.790
after Rocket 88 he
was told by the doctor

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:31.110
who administered the electroshock
that he would never be able

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.620
to lead a normal life or
that he would be unlikely

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.450
to be able to avoid excitement.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.790
And the next thing he did was
he recorded Howlin' Wolf a few

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.090
weeks later.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.350
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: You've
mentioned several times

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.900
that this is your most personal
book, and there's more of you

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.700
in this book then there
are in previous books.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.470
For those who don't know, Peter has
written several works of fiction,

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.940
and his first sort of major trilogy
was collected pieces, Lost Highway,

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.910
Feel like Going Home and Sweet
Soul Music and then the sort

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.150
of second trilogy of biographies

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:14.610 position:56%
which is a two volume Elvis Presley
biography and Sam Cooke and now Sam.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.120 position:56%
Why was this the most personal book?

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.490 position:56%
Was it merely just because you knew
Sam better than these other subjects

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.000 position:56%
or was it something -- I mean, I
think there's something in this book

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.580
where he talked about
how Sam articulated --

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.890
the reason you devoted
your life to music.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.190
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: Well, yeah.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.710
I think actually Sam's vision
of art in many ways corresponded

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.280
to my own -- his vision -- he got
a book as a prize, I Dare You,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.910
by the founder of Ralston
Purina whose name is --

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:49.490
his son or grandson was
the Senator from Missouri.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.110
Danforth, yeah, yeah.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.610
And that was the theme of
his life was you had to dare.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.880
You had to overcome
your inhibitions.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.040
You had to overcome your fears.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.400 position:56%
In many respects, the thing that was
so inspiring to me about meeting Sam

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.500
for the first time in
'79 was not so much

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.550
that he revealed something
I never thought of is

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.670
that he validated everything
that I had ever believed.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.290
And he validated it within a
large philosophical concept

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:20.900
and in a sense placed the
music that had so influenced me

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.900
but which was not necessarily
related to the ideas,

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.670
placed the music within
this philosophical

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:28.430
and almost revolutionary
context that he just --

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.270
I was just thrilled to have this.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:36.140
And even I was running a boys camp
at the time, did for many years,

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:41.540
and all the principles that Sam
spoke, trying to [inaudible]

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:48.310
and articulate in running his
recording ventures were the same

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.940
principles that I was
trying to carry out.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.110
I'm not saying I achieved
them to the same extent,

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:58.910
but I think that this thing
about being personal is

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:05.300
that you'll find a lot of me in the
first three books I wrote in Feel

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.410
Like Going Home, Lost
Highway and Sweet Soul Music.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:12.970
But I rigorously kept
myself out of the Elvis

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.420
and the Sam Cooke biography.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.170
I felt like I didn't want to --

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.260
I wanted to tell this in a way

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.960
that allowed the story
itself to come out.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:27.080
I think if you read that -- if you
saw what I put in, what I left out,

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.510
you could draw a portrait of me
from those books that would be

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.970
as accurate as from anything else.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.880
I mean, I think there's
no such thing

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.040
as Sam said he hated perfection.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.120
Well, I mean, I don't
-- I'll raise him one.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.410
I'll say there's no such
thing as objectivity.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:48.740
And that this is a kind of myth
that people perpetuate in all kinds

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.500
of ways but everything comes
down to the angle of perception.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.400 position:56%
What you put in, what you leave out.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.580
This says an enormous
amount about a painter,

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.400
about a musician, about a writer.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.670
And so you could draw a portrait of
me from these books in which I --

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:07.750
rigorously eliminated
myself in a way

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.270
that I hadn't from
the earlier books.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.560 position:56%
This is the Sam Cooke and the Elvis.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.070
But here, I knew from the beginning
that what I wanted to create

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:24.590
with the Sam Phillips was a book,
like a novel, a nonfiction novel

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:29.600 position:56%
that did justice to the nonlinearity
of his life, the explosiveness

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.580
of his life and to the
variousness of human experience.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.840
I wanted to right something that
was along the lines of what Sam saw

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.820
so that it could be
both epic and intimate.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.270
It could be tragic and comic.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:43.060
It could be discursive and focused.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.460
It could be like -- I
mean, Sam always talked

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.760 position:56%
about every session being like -- he
wanted every session to be like Gone

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.730
with the Wind and big fun too.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.590
Now I'm not going to cite Gone with
the Wind, but it's like the idea

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.160
of an epic family novel
or something.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.180
But the thing was that the only
way I could do this, I didn't --

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.670
Sam lived to a far riper
age than either Sam Cooke

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.030
who died at -- what did he die?

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:10.930
33, I think, and Elvis
who died at 42.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.720
And the thing about Sam was he left
the music business more or less

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.520
in 1960 when he was 37 years old.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.890
He lived to be 80.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.750
And so I didn't want a book that
was a recitation of honors gained

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:32.240
or travels made or
critiques, praise given.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.420
I wanted to do something that
did justice to the craziness

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:43.120
of Sam's life, not crazy
in the mental health way

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:49.620 position:56%
but just the absolute individuality,
as Kerouac might have said,

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.040
the wowness of Sam's life.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.000
And I wanted -- and the
only way I could do that was

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.780
by introducing myself not as a
character so much as a witness

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.480
because I knew him for 25 years.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.130
And that was the way that I had
of breaking up the narrative.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:09.010
It was a way I had of making it
more anecdotal, being able --

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.620
veering away from strict chronology
and being able to take a story

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.550
from beginning to end even
if the end happened years

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:20.600
after what the chronological
course of the narrative was.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.770
And in the course of
it, I mean, I just --

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:29.270
as Sam said to me fairly early on
-- I mean, I met him in '79 and got

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.240
to know him much better when
I was working on the Elvis,

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.430
and we did a whole bunch
of interviews and stuff

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.900
and started going out to dinner.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.870
But as Sam said to me, he
says, "You know, my son Knox --

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:44.290
Knox loved you from the
first, but I didn't."

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.190
So I could say that Sam believed

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.120
that you keep a distance
from people.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.360
Otherwise, they're going
to push you off the cliff.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:56.490
And Sam was kind enough to say,
"Well, I knew that you," he says,

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.180 position:56%
"I had to keep my distance because I
knew you had your doubts about me,"

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.080
and I'm thinking, "I
had my doubts about you?

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.770
I was sold from the first word.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.510
That's very nice of
you to say that."

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:10.010
So we sort of went
from this formal --

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:14.670
I mean, when I met him in '79
he had done, by his account,

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:18.110
that was the first interview
he ever had done outside

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.850
of the Memphis newspapers and the
trades, Billboard and Cash Box

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.760
and there were a couple of others.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.280
He forget about a couple.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.580
But in essence, that was true.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.070
He did not want to do interviews.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.330
He didn't believe -- he
didn't want to look back.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.050
He saw interviews as looking back.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.650
He always wanted to look forward.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.090
He was in radio then.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.520
But that first interview was
like the [inaudible] of Sam.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.320
I mean, I didn't realize
what it was at the time.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.250
It was an amazing experience,
and I met him in a flood.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.630
The radio station had flooded.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.730
He had this new radio
station he had just built,

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.740
just built every square inch of
it down to the plantings outside,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.110
and the sprinkler system
let go the night before.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.640
I had been trying to get
an interview for ten years,

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.580
and the sprinkler system let go.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.990
And Knox, Sam's son, Knox, who
had been trying to sell Sam

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:10.100
on doing the interview, met me
in the parking lot and said,

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.020
"I don't think we can
do the interview.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.320
We're going to have to postpone."

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.620
I'm thinking postpone?

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.550
Postpone? You know,
another ten years?

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:23.200
And so eventually being the
resourceful person that I am

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.820
and being so creative,
I said, "Well,

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.750
isn't there anything
I can do to help?"

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.790
A brilliant suggestion.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.130
And so I carried buckets of water.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.430
I squeegee'd.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:35.100
I moved tapes and then
at the end of this eight

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.660
or nine hours we did
what turned out for me

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.760
to be the shortest
interview Sam ever did.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.750
It was only 2.5 hours.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.110
And I had no idea really
what it represented.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.850
It was teachings of Sam and
in a sense after knowing him

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:53.460
for 25 years, I came to realize
how important his sense of mission,

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:59.390
his sense of teaching, of
conveying these lessons,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.270
these life lessons was.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.940
I couldn't have known that at the
time, but it was quite astonishing.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.650
So I don't know what that was.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.680
It wasn't friendship certainly.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.980
I was there.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:16.120
I recorded both his thoughts
and my reactions and wrote

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.670
about them in Lost Highway.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:25.920
But then over the years, we
became friendlier or friendly

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.400
and then eventually I would
say after many years friends

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.520
and then one day he said,
"You know, I really love you."

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.550
And I said, "Wow, that's
really," but that was --

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.800
at that point, he wasn't
feeling well.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:44.660
But it -- no, I mean,
it's hard to say.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.960
I mean, Geoffrey's right.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.600
It is in many ways the most
personal but in another way I was

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.760
so intensely bound up in the Sam
Cooke, and it expresses so many

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:59.140
of my views of society, of
race, of class, of the community

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:05.000
that nurtured Sam Cooke and
has been so important in terms

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.020
of my being afforded access

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.180
through the writing I'd
done, the people I met.

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.940
So -- but I guess I'd have

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.580
to say Sam feels this is
the most [inaudible] person.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.840
Maybe I should be embarrassed
about that.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.200
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: Obviously, the
Sam Phillips books cover a lot

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.650
of the same territory
as the Elvis piece did.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:32.430
I just wondered if you could talk a
bit about why you wanted to return

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:37.030
to that territory to -- what you
thought to be gained by going back

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:43.020 position:56%
with that same territory and also it
seems -- you may disagree with this,

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.160
but from my perspective,
it seems that both Elvis

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:52.790
and Sam had this burst of brilliant
triumps in the 50s, early 60s

00:34:52.790 --> 00:35:00.980
and then had difficulty or were
quieter after life, but also seems

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.650
that they dealt with that
challenge in different ways.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.620
I wonder if you could
speak to that as well.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.470
&gt;&gt; Pete Guralnick:
That's a lot of things.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.540
If I were to just disagree
wholesale,

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.490
that would be the easiest
way to answer.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.390
But no, I don't disagree.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:20.480
But in terms of second acts, I
mean, who except Philip Roth?

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.950
I mean, there are other people come
back and surpass the achievements

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.740
for which they were
hailed in their youth.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:33.240
I mean, you look at so
many people in the arts.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:38.780 position:56%
After an intense period of early
creativity, what would have happened

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.540
to Sam Cooke had he lived?

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.960
I mean, I don't know.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.190
I mean, you could postulate that he
would have been Mayor of Chicago,

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.090
but it's hard to know what --

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.580
I guess I didn't see it as
revisiting the same territory.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:36:00.040 position:56%
I mean, in some ways, having written
to Sam Cooke and thinking about

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.750
or having written a lot
about blues, you're thinking

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.620
about writing a biography
of Muddy Waters

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.890
which Robert Gordon did a
wonderful biography of Muddy Waters

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:12.280
or thinking about doing a
biography of Otis Redding.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.870
That would have seen to
me like a repetition.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:19.290
In Sam's case, he was
so [inaudible] generous.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.590
I just never thought of him.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.550 position:56%
I mean, Elvis was part of the story.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:28.800
But by no means, not even -- by no
means, the main part of the story.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.660
And I guess I saw this as if it
was revisiting, it was revisited

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.820
in a completely different
perspective,

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.350
showing all of these things.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.610
I mean, I've written
about Howlin' Wolf before.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.320
This was in a completely
different perspective.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.640
I mean, one of the
things, for example,

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.290
in writing about Howlin' Wolf in
this book was the discovery by --

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:50.320
and this is in the Howlin'
Wolf biography by Mark Hoffman

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.390
and his co-writer was
named somebody I'm sure.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.830
Yeah, James Segrest, right.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:37:04.150
And they found that Howlin' Wolf
had suffered this enormous nervous

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:08.150
breakdown in the Army and was
actually released in those terms

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.890
and released with the idea that
he would never again be able

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:14.310
to lead anything approaching
a normal life.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.520
And although this was
something that neither --

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.760 position:56%
Wolf had said to me one time, I
never read this, I never heard it --

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.490 position:56%
but Wolf had said to me when I
asked about the Army thinking about,

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.900
that this must have been
an expansive experience,

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.230
getting him off the
farm, out of Mississippi.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.530
I'm asking him.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.750
I thought at that point because
he had said it sometimes found

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.050
[inaudible] which he never did.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.670
He got as far as Tacoma or
state of Washington anyway.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.510
But he -- I asked him about
it from that point of view.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.760
He says, "Oh, man.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.710
The Army, they drill
you so hard it just

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.670
about gave me a nervous breakdown."

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.970
Well, it did.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.270
It gave him a literal
nervous breakdown,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.290
and that's how he mustered
out of the Army.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.310
And in this book -- I mean, I
considered it, and I thought, well,

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:03.070
geez, Sam -- neither Sam nor Wolf
knew about the other's experience

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.670
and yet there's no question
in my mind that this was one

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.190 position:56%
of the ways in which they connected.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.380
They were both extraordinarily
bright people,

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.500
extraordinarily observant people.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.910
In Wolf's case, extraordinarily
paranoid person.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.160
But just an amazimg person.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.150
I mean, Sam said about Wolf about
the first time they met, he says,

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:26.910
"Well, as much as I was reading the
Wolf, he was reading me much more."

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.190
But that was a way
-- in other words,

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.690
for me that changed the
portrait completely.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:36.150
Seeing Elvis come in, for example,
into the studio in the wake

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.490 position:56%
of an article about The Prisonaires,

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:44.410 position:56%
the quintet from the Tennessee State
Penitentiary that Sam had recorded

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.660
in the early summer of '53,
and there was a big article

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.730
in the Commercial -- or maybe it
was the Press Scimitar that talked

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.610
about this man, Sam Phillips, who
was looking for original talent,

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.880
was willing to record anybody,
and there's no question in my mind

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.330
that this is why Elvis came into
the studio a few weeks later.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.180
But the point is seeing
it within that context,

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.360
that's something I wrote about to
some extent in the Elvis biography.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.220
But it loomed so much larger
within this very different context.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.840
So I guess from my point
of view, that was --

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.460
and I saw Sam also as
a person who even long

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.950
after he had left the field
for which he had gained --

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:31.790 position:56%
in which he so changed the world
and as Jerry Wexler said in a decade

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:35.540
of recording he created a
millennium's worth of work.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:41.880 position:56%
But I saw him as being -- continuing
to be as interesting a person,

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.960
as challenging a person,
as individual a person,

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.160
and I wanted to continue
in the book to continue

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:52.600
to show the intrinsic interest of
this character, the adventurousness

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.140
of this person and the sense,
exploratoriness and also the sense

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.730
of insecurity that
continued to fuel him.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:06.780
So it -- I guess from my point
of view if you do think of it

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:12.090
as revisiting or if I think of it
as revisiting, I wouldn't go back.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.870
And there are many places
that I never have gone back

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.200
because I felt there
was no way to do it.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.800
I do have to say, though, that
the one place I would always have

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:25.290
revisited and it's one of the
two biggest regrets of my life,

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.250
and this shows how
shallow a person I am.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.730 position:56%
One, that I no longer play baseball.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:35.100
I played baseball until I was
48, and I just miss that so much.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.680
I played -- I went back to tennis.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.400
That's okay, but baseball --

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:45.340 position:56%
but the other is that when I sent
Solomon Berg whom Geoffrey knew well

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.960
-- when I sent Solomon Berg
a copy of the Sam Cooke,

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.120
the next time I saw him, he
says, "You know, it's great Pete.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.440
It's really great."

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.930
He says, "But when are
we going to do the book?"

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.080
And I tried so many
times we talked about it.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.360
Solomon -- it was the one book
that I ever thought that I would do

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.220
in somebody else's voice.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.460
I mean, and I tried
to get Solomon --

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.970
Solomon was someone
like quick silver.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.630
It was hard to get him to commit.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.060
And if he said, "Look,
why don't you fly

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.540
out to L.A., I'll buy the ticket.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.840
I'll put you up.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:24.090
I'll find you a Pied-a- terre,"
after first turning down the offer

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.230
of payment because you never
knew what that might mean --

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.470
it's not even a question
of being compromised.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.860
It's a question of showing up at
the airport and having no ticket.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.080 position:56%
In fact, being sued for malfeasance.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.960
But the other thing was I knew that
if I went out to L.A. I could fly

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.060
out to L.A. and find out
that Solomon was in Japan.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.200
So I -- but I tried to
get him to commit to it,

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:53.250 position:56%
and put down on tape what his
experiences were like when he was 8,

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.000
9, 10, when he was a
wonder boy preacher

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.670
in his grandmother's church.

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.640
And he says, "Okay, okay.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.940
How about when I was 10?"

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.550
I said, "Okay, when you were 10.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.120
Did something happen
when you were 10?"

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.510
This is about the funniest
and sad story.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.550
So then he said, "That's when
they put me out on the street."

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:10.850
Well, I never heard
anything like that.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.150
And so I said, "What do
you mean they put you --

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.450
who put you out on the street?"

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.750
He said, "That's what I
could never find out."

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.140
I said, "Why did they put
you out in the street?"

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.440
He says, "I don't know."

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.810
And he burst into tears, which was
the last three times I saw him.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:26.310 position:56%
Solomon, the most jolly, just one of
the most brilliant people, I mean,

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.970
just unbelievable but he gave way

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.920
to emotion each of
the last three times.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.220
I don't know what it meant.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.520
I don't know.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.790
But that's the one place I would
revisit that a thousand times.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:39.750
I would give anything to have been
able to have written that book

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:44.120
in Solomon's voice
and as Solomon says,

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.070
it would have been the
greatest book in the world.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:49.110
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: Before we
throw it open to the audience,

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.510
I was wanting to ask
you one more thing.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:56.700
We were talking at dinner about the
challenges and rewards of the kind

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.700
of life that we do,
writing about music.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.910
And you were speaking earlier --

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:06.580
we were speaking earlier about
how Sam affirmed a lot of the --

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.160
articulated and affirmed a lot

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.340
of the motivations
you had in your work.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:16.660
We also talked about how
non musicians do play a role

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.940
in shaping music, and I think that
we do too to a much smaller extent

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.780
than Sam Phillips perhaps
but a little bit.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.080
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: Are
you saying we should be

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.210
in the rock and roll Hall of Fame?

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.510
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: No, but --

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.810
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick:
No halls of fame.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:32.110
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: But
I guess what I'm leading

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.450
up to is can you talk a
little bit about how --

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.360
why you embarked on this work

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.960
and what's kept you
at it all these years?

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.110
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: You
mean the work in general?

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.860
Yeah. Right.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.790
Well, I always wanted
to be a writer.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.560
You know I always wanted
to be a baseball player.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.520
But I wanted to be -- also I
always wanted to be a writer

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.640
from the time I was
6 or 7 years old.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.540
My grandfather taught
English at [inaudible] School.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.850
He was a great inspiration
to me, and I was surrounded

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.350
by books with my parents.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.720
And I just -- but I
mean, it was nobody --

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.810
as Sam would say, it was
nobody's motivation but my own.

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.380
I wanted to be a writer.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:08.450
And I published a collection
of short stories when I was 20.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:10.610
I'd written my first
novel when I was 19.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.940
It was not music at all that
-- I mean, I loved music.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.240
But it was the blues.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.850
I fell into the blues
when I was about 15 or 16.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.290
And that just led me
to everything else.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:26.500
But when I was around 20 or 21,

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.380
all of a sudden these
underground weekly sprang up,

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.750
Crawdaddy started up, and it was
this kid named Paul Williams.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:37.160
He was a few years younger than I
was, and I knew him from the school

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.060
that he attended some
years after I did.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.730
And anyway, in several instances,
people came to me and said,

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.630
you know, how would you -- Paul
came and said, "How would you

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:48.930
like to write for Crawdaddy?"

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.100
Or "How would you like to write for
[inaudible] something about music?"

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.100
Because everybody knew how
crazy I was about the blues.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.580
And I said, "Great, then I
want to write about the blues."

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:59.070
And so there I am in early
issues of Crawdaddy writing

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.490
about Robert P. Williams with
Skip James, Buddy Guy in the midst

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.700
of Moby Grape, Jefferson
Airplane, Grateful Dead.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.930
I mean -- and Psychodelian General.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.230
I'm not putting that down.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.600
I'm just saying it's an odd --

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.060
I mean, I don't belong
there but there I am.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.660
And when this friend of mine named
Larry Stark [assumed spelling]

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.160
became the drama critic, the first
drama critic at Boston After Dark,

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.460
which was essentially started --

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.510
it was the Boston Phoenix
and that started

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.990
as a way to sell advertising.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.540
I mean, it was just -- they needed
content to sell the advertising

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.970
for entertainment because
this guy who was

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:36.030
in Harvard Business School realized
the mainstream papers weren't

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:39.600
selling advertising for
concerts and stuff like that.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.800
So Larry said, "How would
you like to write on music?"

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.420
And I said, "Yeah, sure.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:47.430
But I want to write about
Muddy Waters, James Brown,

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:49.610
Bo Diddley, Howlin' Wolf."

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:50.910
And that's what I did.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.560
My idea, the only reason I did it,
was to tell people about this music

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.100
that I knew was so great.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.950
I mean, in a way it's parallel --

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.480
maybe this is why the
book is so personal

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.560
because it's not the same degree
of achievement in any way.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.630
But it's parallel to what Sam said.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.320
The first thing I wrote
for Boston After Dark,

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.590
all the original things I wrote
and were talking about payment,

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.840 position:56%
which is never worth thinking about.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.820
But I don't get -- I didn't get
paid anything for years and years.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.700
I mean, I wrote about --
the first thing I wrote

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.640
about was the James Brown Show.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.940
And I wrote about it.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.070
This was a time of
happenings in theater.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:29.440
I said, "This is the
greatest, spontaneous eruption.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.600
This is the greatest
improvisational theater.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.950
This is the greatest
happening you'll ever see,"

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:39.580
and described what I had seen
from going to James Brown,

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.160
to the James Brown show
over the last few years.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.540
And just was trying to sell
people on the idea of going

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.370
to see James Brown because
it would uplift them.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:49.670
It would elevate them.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.110
It would give them
a vision of Nirvana.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:57.840
And not psychedelic, psychedelia.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.810
But so and that was
why I wrote them.

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.140
I wrote about Muddy Waters.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.820
It was a thrill to me to put
down -- set down their names.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.910 position:56%
I never thought of it as a vocation.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.180
I don't even know if I thought
of it was an advocation.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.740
It was just -- it was a mission
to sort of tell people --

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.450
it was a thrill to
put the names down,

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:17.740
to write the name Big Joe Turner,
to type it out, to see it in print,

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:22.080
to write about Johnny Shines, to
write about Bo Diddley and to try

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:26.790
to present them in terms that
did justice to the greatness

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.730
of their achievement,
not to play off of --

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.540
not to say it was awesome
or not to say --

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.150
but to try to describe
what it was that was

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.180
so elevated about what they did.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:39.330
And not to do it in -- I'm sure

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:43.160
to some people it may still
seem very pretentious,

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.290
but it was to do it in terms
that were attempted to be equal

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:49.820 position:56%
and treat the music with the dignity

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.050
that it deserved and
also the enthusiasm.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.580
So that was my entire motivation.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.800
It remains my entire motivation.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.000
I mean, I wrote -- I
considered myself --

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.610
I never considered myself a critic.

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:05.310
I've always thought of myself
as an advocate in a sense.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.520
I've never written about
anything that I didn't love.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.890
I've never written on assignment.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:10.750
And I'm not saying that boastfully.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.650
I mean, it was really hard to do.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:20.600
It caused -- as my son, Jake,
said when he was about 8 years old

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.050
and starving from lack of food.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:23.610
I was never starving
from lack of food

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:30.020
but I often thought we could
have better food on the table.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:34.050
But the thing was it was something
I felt absolutely committed to,

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.370
and that's really as much
as anything the motivation

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:39.520
for the Sam Phillips is to tell
the world as [inaudible] said,

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.810 position:56%
"Tell the world about Sam Phillips."

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:43.140
Or he said, "Tell the
world about what?"

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.220
It's whatever the song is.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.520
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes: All right.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.820
Do we have microphones for people?

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.340
Anybody have questions?

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:54.000
Maybe Ann can help identify people.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.340
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Q and A

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.470
and afterwards we'll explain
about the book selling.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:22.890
We won't be selling books tonight,

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:26.290
but we will be offering ten
percent off in our bookshop,

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:29.320
and we'll explain how that goes,
but let's go ahead with Q and A.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.380
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: Let me
also say that if you do want

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.070
to have it signed, but
if you brought a book,

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.730
I'm glad to sign that.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.360
This is not a silent
auction or anything

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:48.300
so if you have something you want
to say and get -- that's fine --

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.880
or ask or something like that.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:57.370
So it's -- I'm sorry to hear about
the books, the lack of books.

00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:00.650
But anyway, any books you
brought that you want me

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:06.610
to sign, I'm glad to sign.

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:10.260
&gt;&gt; Having looked at your website
and picture after photograph

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:14.890
after photograph and a few
minutes ago you made the --

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:19.370
said the phrase people I've met,
and I'm assuming you've met a lot

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:21.200
of people and interviewed
a lot of people.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:26.310
But does one or two real son
of a bitches come to mind?

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:29.450
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: No, no.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:34.070
I mean -- because the
point is what have I done?

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:38.040
I've gone out looking for
people that I've admired.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.540
I mean, it's -- if you ask me if
I admire everything about them?

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.400
No. I mean, who am I
to make the judgment?

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:49.990
I'm interested in somebody -- like
Merle Haggard for example is not --

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:55.580
he's whatever you call it, like a
sweet cup of tea on every occasion.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.330
But it's not -- I don't
feel any investment

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:01.630
in somebody being one
way or another.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.960
I admire the hell out
of Merle Haggard.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.580
I just see him as one of
the great creative artists

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.300
of the 20th century.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.330
And that -- or maybe any century.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:14.150
And that's what I'm writing about.

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:18.760 position:56%
What I'm interested in talking to
people about is what motivates them,

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.240
what their ambition is,
what their aspirations are,

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.830
what their aspirations were and
describing what the weather was.

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:29.900
I don't have any particular
pride or place in this.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:34.620
I don't see myself as
either being insultable

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.910
or threatenable in a sense.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.970
So no, I would say not.

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.270
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Himes:
Follow up that question.

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:43.720
It seems that one of the
challenges for a biographer is how

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:48.440
to balance the work with
the life and most --

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:54.940 position:56%
a lot of biographies write about the
drugs and marriages and so forth,

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:58.140
which is not why we're interested
in them in the first place.

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:04.230 position:56%
And I was wondering how you wrestled
with that problem or that challenge?

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:05.860
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: I
feel like I think we --

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:10.880
I'm going to recapitulate some of
what we talked about at dinner,

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.620
but I feel as if I've got
a number of commitments.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.330
The first commitment is
to telling the truth.

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:23.910
The second commitment to being fair
to the person I'm writing about,

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:27.250
treating anybody I write
about with dignity and respect

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:29.760
that I would hope for
and that they deserve.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.060
It's kind of the opposite

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:35.090
of some political figures
in this particular age.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:40.000
And I guess the third thing is
just being true to the reader.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.430
So it's not like I feel
like I can leave things out.

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:47.060
It's not that I have a
view of them particularly.

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:52.310
I mean, if somebody leads -- for
instance, I've been with people

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.880
when I was doing portraits.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:04.410
I've been with people where I
saw things happen that I felt --

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:07.970
while I was accidentally
witnessed to them, I had no right

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:11.560
to expose them whatever the
[inaudible] might have been.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:15.760
They informed the way in which I
saw the person I was writing about,

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.230
not necessarily negatively.

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:19.440
I mean, I just don't
have a judgment.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.970
I don't have -- I'm not
bringing my values to bear

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:24.620
on the person I'm writing about.

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:27.890
But they certainly could inform but
it wasn't like I was going to break

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:31.740
up a marriage or put somebody in
jail because I happen to be present

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:37.160
at something that I was
an accidental observer.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.920
But I mean, we talked a little.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.160
I mean, I wrote about Charlie
Rich in Feel Like Going Home,

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.430
the first book I wrote,
which actually all

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:50.770
of the books were written
as books as opposed to --

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:53.730
that was something where I
went out and wrote the book

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:58.140
as individual portraits, but they
were all written for the book.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.690
Lost Highway was the
one exception to that.

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:06.840
But the thing was, I meet
Charlie Rich out at the Vapors

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.330
out by the airport in Memphis.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:14.490 position:56%
It later became either Big Bad Bob's
Vapors or just Bad Bob's Vapors.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:17.350
I don't know if it's
still in operation or not

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:19.770
but it was fairly --
until fairly recently.

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:21.790
And I met him at a tea
dance where there --

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:27.470
he and Narvel Felts and
Ace Cannon alternated sets,

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:31.130
and I think there must have been
at lease nine sets among them.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.760
It went on for a long time.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.660 position:56%
Meeting Charlie Rich and his wife
Margaret Anne, I don't think I've --

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.820
I don't think I've ever liked
anybody better on first meeting.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:44.040
When I came to writing about
him, I thought this is terrible.

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.370 position:56%
I'm never going to get to see him
again, this guy that I like so much,

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:51.460
Margaret Anne who I like so much,
because the portrait that I drew.

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.500
And you'll laugh if you read
the book, if you read Feel

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.740
Like Going Home because it seems
so pale in light of the way

00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.630
in which peole are
written about today.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.670
But I thought I'm never going to
see him again because I was writing

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:07.680 position:56%
about depression, guilt, alcoholism,
just a sense of exclusion

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:13.900
and insecurity and agoraphobia
which was very odd for a performer.

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:18.320
And -- but it was what I
had to write, and I wrote it

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:23.310
from as I feel one is compelled to.

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:26.140
You write it from an
empathetic point of view.

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.690
An actor can't portray a
villain and you can't --

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:33.570
and just go [inaudible] every other
word just to show his distance

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.550
or her distance from the
character she's portraying.

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:42.120
But so I wrote this, and I just
felt badly, but that was the truth.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:46.390 position:56%
And I tried to treat it with
honesty, with dignity, with respect.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:48.190
But that was the truth.

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:51.510
And I've never been more
relieved or never felt better

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:55.300
than when the publisher
of Feel Like Going Home,

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:59.680 position:56%
the woman named Margaret Pete called
me up and said, "I had to tell you.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:03.180 position:56%
I just got a call from Charlie Rich,
and he ordered 30 copies of the book

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:05.230
to give to all the
members of his family."

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:08.230
And when I saw him not longer
afterwards, and I was friendly

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:12.220
with him until he died
for the next 25 years.

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:16.720
But when I saw him, he said, "You
know, the truth hurts sometimes,

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.420
but it's the truth, and
you wrote the truth."

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:25.820
Not everybody takes that
view, but that's what I --

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:32.370
and I'll tell you a round about
story, a quick round about story,

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:38.670
but a magazine wanted to
do an excerpt first serial

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:40.310
from [inaudible], a big magazine.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.680
It would have been a great thing.

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.880
But what they wanted me
to do was to rewrite --

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.970
it was the part about Larry Geller

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.950
who was Elvis' sort
of spiritual advisor.

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:54.270
Adventures in new age religion,
and that's what he was.

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:55.570
That was what he was interested in.

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:56.870 position:56%
That's what Elvis was interested in.

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:58.170
It's not what I'm interested in.

00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:01.210
I mean, I may be disappointing you
here, but this is not my interest.

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:02.510
I'm not a [inaudible].

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:05.480
I'm not a follower
of Madame Blavatsky

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.370
or Audiobiography of a Yogi.

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:09.590
But that's what they
were interested in.

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:16.710
And so this magazine wanted
me to portray Larry Geller

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:18.170
as a hippocrite and a charlatan.

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:19.470
Now, it's possible.

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.810
I'm not saying it's
true, but it's possible

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:24.220 position:56%
that that might be my personal view.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.270
As I say, I'm not saying that
it is, but it's possible.

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:29.220
But I would never portray him.

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.790
His role in Elvis' life
was a legitimate role.

00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:34.460
He had a genuine knowledge
and interest,

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:37.330
knowledge of an interest
in those areas.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:39.110
Elvis was passionate about them.

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:41.950
He devoted 2.5 years
of his life to it.

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:45.970
And it ended very unhappily
because they dropped the excerpt,

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:50.210
and I felt like I poisoned
the relationship with somebody

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:51.860
who could be very important.

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.430
And I'm not saying
this to be heroic.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:58.150 position:56%
I'm just saying I felt an obligation
both to the truth and to try

00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:01.030
to understand what it was
with the people I was writing

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:03.230
about were not what
I thought of them

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:11.630
or what it provided
judgment of them.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.690
&gt;&gt; So today a young Elvis
Presley instead of going

00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:19.000
to a studio would probably
record a demo

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.300
in his home on his own equipment.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.120
And so I wondered what
your thoughts might be

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:31.210
as to what we might have
lost through this process

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:33.750
and are there any up sides to it

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.460
that we don't have
necessarily people

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.980
like Sam Phillips taking
people under their wing?

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:42.610
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick:
I'm not sure how many

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:44.050
up sides there are to the internet.

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:47.480
I know it's a huge convenience.

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:52.180
But I think we're moving the filter
and also we're moving the idea

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.260
that I told you I don't
believe there's any such thing

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:58.990
as objectivity, but I do
believe there's such a thing

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:01.190
as editorial weighing
or at least some attempt

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:04.400
at the appearance of objectivity.

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.640
And I think the collaboration
to go back to what Geoffrey said

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.930
to begin with, the collaboration
of two people, the collaboration

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:14.020
of Sam Phillips and Howlin' Wolf
or Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:17.100
or Chips Moman and Elvis
at the American sessions

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:23.940
in '69 can create a -- or even
the creation of the collaboration

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:27.300 position:56%
of something like Elvis Costello and
Allen Toussaint on River in Reverse.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.290
Is it called River in Reverse or
was that the -- that's the single?

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:31.710
What was the album called?

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:33.570
That was it?

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:38.820
Okay. Anyway, I think this can
lead to all kinds of things.

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:44.360
I think creating -- on the other
hand, creating on your own --

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.060
not everybody needs
that collaboration.

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.360
Not everybody needs leadership.

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:53.780
The problem is we've lost any
sense of common heritage I guess.

00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.080
I mean, I know from teaching

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:59.200
at Vanderbilt there is
not a single book that is

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.500
in a creative writing course --

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.800
there's not a single
book that everyone

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.930
in the class has read except
To Kill a Mockingbird.

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:06.620
And maybe The Great Gatsby.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:10.250
Other then that, it's not that
people don't read, but there is --

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:16.120
and so the conversation is
abbreviated to some extent.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:21.850 position:56%
I mean, I'm interested, and I try
to engage in this conversation by --

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:25.260
I try to find out from everyone.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.560
I say what are you into?

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.370
Movies, books, music.

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:32.330
But there's almost no common ground
and certainly no shared heritage.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:36.720
And I think what you lose by that
is the ability to build on that.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.170
Elvis was totally conscious
of being part of a tradition,

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.460
of being part of this
continuum of great music

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.730
that included Howlin' Wolf,
Hank Williams, Carusso,

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:49.110
included Carusso, included
all of this.

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:53.390
And today our sense of history
might go back five years

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:56.730
but not any longer and maybe not
even five years at this point.

01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:58.550
So I think that is
a lot lost in that.

01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:01.020
At the same time, there are
tremendous opportunities,

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.740
and the creativity.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.230
There's no less creativity today.

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:06.430
There are no fewer original voices.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:15.130
There's no absence of music,
art, literature to celebrate.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.810
I mean, people talk about
the death of the novel.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:19.750
I think there are more great novels
being written now then ever before.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:23.780
It's harder to find
them on common ground.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:29.390 position:56%
But I don't think anything will ever
discourage Sam Phillips [inaudible].

01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:33.120
If you are a creative person, for
God's sake, don't let anything get

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.440
in the way of that creativity.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.850
I think for the creative
person nothing will get

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:40.250
in the way of that creativity.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Peter.

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:48.760
Two questions.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.360
First of all, the people
that you've written

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.970
about are pretty much originals.

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:54.320
But as you said, it's
continuum of music.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.060
So my first question is
are there any artists --

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.030
you mentioned Elvis Costello as
an artist with [inaudible] --

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:01.540
that you would like
to write about today?

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.210
That you think either
having the same impact

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:05.850
and if so, who are they and why?

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:07.150
If not, why not?

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:09.980
And the other question
is music is passed down.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.800
You mentioned your son
who criticized the meals

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.240
on your table for a time.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.540
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: No, no, no.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.330
He was just -- I like
the combination

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:20.850
of I'm starving for lack of food.

01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:22.150
I thought that was --

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:25.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But I was saying were you able to
take this great love that you have

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:28.030
for it and influence him at
all in terms of his music?

01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:29.610
That's something fathers
think about.

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:30.910
You pass it down.

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:32.210
You either accept it or reject it.

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:34.300
So both of those if you would.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.620
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: Well, I
think as far as passing down,

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.880
I mean Jake manages groups.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:43.150
My daughter, Nina, has been
involved in various ways

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:46.280
in the music business and others.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.760 position:56%
Now she's the head of the Children's
International Film Festival.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.930
But no, I wouldn't want to
pass on my taste particularly.

01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:59.890
We share common enthusiasms,
but I'm as interested

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:05.660
in their sharing what they're into
with me as my sharing it with them.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:10.620
I think it's the idea of pursuing
what Sam called individualism

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.920
in the extreme.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:18.090
That to me was the idea of relying
on your resourcefulness as opposed

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:23.810
to looking for a path which took
you step by step through life

01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:27.580
or made you fearful
of taking gambles.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:32.160
I mean, in many ways I
think I would aspire to --

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.960
or Jake and Nina represent is what
I aspire to be when I grow up.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.450
But I don't -- we certainly
share a lot in common.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:47.610
I remember taking Nina
against her vociferous will

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:51.860 position:56%
to go see I.F. Stone towards the end
of his life after he learned Greek

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.160
and he was talking about --

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.800
was he talking about the
trials of Socrates trial?

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.620
And Nina's looking around
saying, "KQ is zero."

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.680
KQ being kid quotient.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.030
"Why do I have to be here?"

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:04.330
And I said, "Because greatness

01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:06.170
such as this will not
pass your way again."

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:10.570
But I didn't expect to sell her
on I.F. Stone, and I didn't.

01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:13.130 position:56%
But I wanted at least to expose her.

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:19.330
I took Jake -- I took him to see
Aretha Franklin when he was 2 or 3,

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.730
and he met Muddy Waters
when he was 7 or 8.

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:23.810 position:56%
But I don't see that as significant.

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:27.610
It was -- what was significant was
exposing him to the possibility,

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:32.720
the possibilities of art, the
possibility of creativity,

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:39.140
the breadth, the breadth of
choices that are available.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:48.040
And so I think that was
it more than anything.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:53.230
&gt;&gt; So I have a -- when you were
speaking earlier about your sense

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:58.640
of yourself as an evangelist for
the music that you really enjoy,

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.950
as you've written books and you've
traveled and spoken about the music

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:07.310
that you enjoy, I'm wondering if
you had a sense of whether or not

01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:11.210
that the audience for what
you're saying is different here

01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:12.700
than it is in Europe.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:16.930
As a fan of this music,
for instance,

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:22.030
I've noticed that there are
ridiculously lavish treatments

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:27.860
of for instance the Sun Catalog
from Bear Family in Germany.

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.710
There's nothing like that in
the U.S. I listen to a lot

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:35.050 position:56%
of [inaudible] blues, and there's
document records in England and JSP,

01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:37.490
and there's nothing
really like that here.

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:39.860
And I'm wondering --

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.960
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: What
about the [inaudible]?

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.260
&gt;&gt; But [inaudible] -- okay --

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.560
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick:
[Inaudible] has stopped in that,

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.810
but for the first 20
or 30 years or so.

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:51.160
&gt;&gt; Maybe this is a
misperception on my part.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.630
But it seems like there's more
in terms of getting the music

01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:59.090
out there, there seems like there's
more enthusiasm about it there

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:01.920
than there is here, and I was just
wondering if you perceived anything

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.060
like that when you've talked
to people about the music?

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.360
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: I think

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.020
that Richard Weize I think
recently sold Bear Family

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.850
but who has owned Bear
Family from the beginning.

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:14.430
He is one of a kind.

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:17.340
And his dedication essentially
to creating a library

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:21.010
of American music -- not just
American, but that's what I know,

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.950
and his documentation of
Sun and his willingness

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:28.340
to just expand the most
lavish amounts of time.

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:29.750
I don't know about
money, but certainly time

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:32.120
and probably money too, is unique.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.070
I don't think it has to
do with him being German.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:38.560
It just has to do -- or European,
it has to do with just somebody

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.440
who is so driven to do this.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.370 position:56%
And I wrote in the brief discography
at the back of Sam Phillips

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:50.430
that really for the
first time in all the --

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:54.670 position:56%
writing about the music that I could
send people to a single catalog,

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:55.970
to the Bear Family catalog.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.160
Not that that not necessarily
is going to be everything

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.780
that they would want, but it's
just an astonishing achievement.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.890
A lot of the other stuff
-- I mean, some of it --

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:09.940
we're a very big country
and for something to be hip

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.800
in England doesn't necessarily
represent a huge amount of people

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.790 position:56%
to have the Sweet Soul Music
Festival in [inaudible] which I went

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:19.660
to for years which is phenomenal.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:22.770
It doesn't mean that
soul music is prevalent

01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:24.300
in Italy as opposed to here.

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.590
It's probably popular here,
but it's more dispersed.

01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:31.920
And I think there's a
trendiness to some of it.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.660
As Sam said, for God's sake,
that's the one thing we don't need.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.660
We don't need another trend.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.960
Whatever the trend is.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.260
Even if it's something you like.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:44.300
But no, I think there's always
been a real appreciation of music.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.570
I think the other thing to keep
in mind is the copyright laws.

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:50.490
And so much of what's
put out in Europe.

01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:53.780
Our copyright laws are
dictated by Disney.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.630
I mean, that's what has
extended what was supposed

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:57.000
to go to public domain.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:04.370
But the European copyright
laws actually sanctioned theft

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:06.770
in many ways.

01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:15.180
And Bear Family, for example, will
put together incredible 12 CD set

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:19.190
and then have it bootlegged by
three or four English labels

01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:21.000
for say newly remastered.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.600
But it's all they've done
is they've taken the --

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.700
and Bear Family tried
to mark their masterings

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.120
so that they would be detectable,
but it cost too much money to sue.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.130
So I think there is to
some degree what you say,

01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:37.470
but labels like [inaudible] before

01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:43.080
that [inaudible] library
were amazing collections.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.200
What Roots did was essentially
to do every single record,

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.560
and it's invaluable if you want
to have every single record

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:58.610
by Tamper Red or by Frankie
Half Pint Jackson or something.

01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:01.420
But it's not -- I don't know.

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.840
I'm not going to knock it,

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.260
but I would say there
has been a great deal

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.110
of appreciation here as well.

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:11.560
It takes different forms
in different places.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:18.670
&gt;&gt; Peter, any Prisonaire
stories you can share with us?

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:19.970
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick:
I always liked --

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:23.450
and the Prisonaires were this
group that was brought to Sam

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:29.090 position:56%
by his sometime partner, Jim
Bullet, who had had the Bullet label

01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:34.110
in Nashville which had one of
the greatest hits of all time

01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:37.760
in Francis Craig's
Near You in the 40's.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.790 position:56%
Something which I doubt that many of
you heard, and I wouldn't have heard

01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:42.520
if I weren't writing the book.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:47.460
But anyway, Jim Bullet brought
the Prisonaires who were part

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.400
of the Frank Clemmons, Governor
Frank Clemmons, who was a great --

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.430
Sam greatly admired as a true
Democrat, big D, little D,

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:58.060
which Sam always considered
himself and a great believer

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.580 position:56%
in rehabilitation prisons in prison.

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.430
And Prisonaires had been appearing
on a number of radio shows

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:08.360
in Nashville, had made
some [inaudible]

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.350
and so that's how Sam heard them.

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:14.550
Sam said, "Then the
devastation came over me."

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.850
That's the quote I always liked.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.510
Sometimes I'll remember
the word devastation.

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:18.920
Sometimes I don't.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.540
Because it was both the music
which was very much derived

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.340
from the Ink Spots
which was really --

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:29.490
Bill Kenny, an idol of Elvis'
as well as the lead singer

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:34.180
for the Prisonaires,
but Johnny Brag.

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:39.370
But it was also the idea of
doing something, of being a kind

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:43.150 position:56%
of Clarence Darrell, doing something
that could lead to rehabilitation.

01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:44.450
And he went over.

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:49.000
He went over to Nashville to
meet with Frank Clemmons to try

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.530
to pursuade him not to allow
Sam to record them in prison,

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:55.990
which he could have easily done,
but to allow them to be transported

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:59.920
with guard and trustee to
the Sun Studio in Memphis.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.430
Memphis Recording Service
in Memphis.

01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:07.630
And he brought with him a gospel
singer named Howard Surat [assumed

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.660 position:56%
spelling] who Sam often said had the
most beautiful voice he ever heard.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.060
Again, Sam had [inaudible]
for everyone.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.360
That was his [inaudible].

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.930
But he is a beautiful singer,

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:20.200
and Sam tried very half-heartedly
to get him to sing pop.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.350
And I think was very relieved
when Howard Surat had no interest.

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:26.360
Well, he was convinced
that if Frank Clemmons

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:33.690
who was also an Evangelical -- if
he heard Howard Surat and listened

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:38.120
to Sam's arguments that he would
agree and Howard Surat brought

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.970
with him a guy whose
name was otherwise lost

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:42.510
to history as far as I know.

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.550
Reverend something
like [inaudible] Ray

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:49.770
who was an evangelist
from maybe Nebraska.

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:52.380
I've known at some point

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.840
and who Howard Surat was
going around singing for.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.970
It was like on the
Billy Graham Crusade.

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:01.700
So there's a picture of all of
them when Sam made his pitch,

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:05.950
and Frank Clemmons was
pursuaded and that's how Sam set

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:11.450
out the first Prisonaires
session which was then a reporter

01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:14.280
from either Commercial Appeal,
Press Scimatar was present at,

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.060
wrote the article and that's
what brought Elvis in.

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.820
&gt;&gt; I think we maybe just have
time for one question more

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:25.250
and then we'll set up
in the hallway there.

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.540
&gt;&gt; Great hearing you again tonight.

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.560
Getting back to Solomon
Berg, it would be great

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.860
if you could do that book.

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:37.120
I know Solomon performed a
couple times, and he's awesome.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.600
Started listening to him
about 40, 50 years ago.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.810
But did he not have 12 children?

01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:47.150
Maybe 20? Which a number
of them ended

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:50.520
up in his band performing
with him for many years?

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.560
Could not these kids be
great sources for information

01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:00.180
about Solomon Berg for a really
terrific definitive book?

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.850
&gt;&gt; Peter Guralnick: Well,
information doesn't even begin

01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:05.590
to approach the book that should
be written about Solomon Berg.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:09.270
And I never wanted to do anything
but a book in Solomon's voice.

01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:12.850
So he did -- I can't
remember at this point.

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:14.150
How many children did he have?

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:15.450
He had 12?

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:18.230
How many was it?

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:22.880
I thought it was like
21, but as Solomon said,

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.050
I got lost in the Bible verse
that said go forth and multiply.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:33.010
But he -- and his last
four children by --

01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:38.810
with his wife Sunday [assumed
spelling] Ho, and he said to me,

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:40.110
"You know, ho ho noodles."

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:41.410
As if I would know.

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:43.590
Do all of you know
about ho ho noodles?

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:45.350
To this day, I don't.

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:48.950
Sunday was very charming,
very nice person.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:51.350
I never asked her about
the noodle company.

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:56.420
But his last four children
[inaudible] and Queen Elizabeth.

01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:00.920
I'm trying to remember who else.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.690
Candy. I don't know
who she was named for.

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:08.170
They did perform with him as
did one of his sons, Junior.

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:09.590
JFK Junior.

01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:13.180
And I think there was one other.

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:15.130
And his brother, Ellik
[assumed spelling]

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.120
when I first met Solomon
was playing guitar for him.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.980
But nobody could tell
Solomon's story but Solomon,

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.630
like Solomon or but Solomon.

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:30.450
The thing about Solomon was that
like Sam he was a creative artist

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:34.440
of the highest attainment,
not just when he was singing

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.480
in every aspect of his life.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.900
And there was no story he told no
matter how fanciful it might seem

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:43.320
that didn't have some basis in
reality like the time he played

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.940
for the Ku Klux Klan by mistake.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.400
He says and they're
coming towards me.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.960
These lights, these torches.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.260
They're all wearing hoods.

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:58.920
Little children wearing
little hoods.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.330
But every one of these stories
had some basis in reality,

01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:05.850
and often I confronted
that reality but they were

01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:11.290
so beautifully comically
and brilliantly told.

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:18.860
The popcorn story or the -- no, the
only way we lost our opportunity

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:23.820
to write the book, Solomon
and I when Solomon died.

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.690
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I hate to cut
this off because it's so warm

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:31.210
to see how you guys have
been entrancing everybody.

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:32.510
Thank you so much.

01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:37.630 position:56%
Let's thank them rather very warmly.

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:41.230
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
