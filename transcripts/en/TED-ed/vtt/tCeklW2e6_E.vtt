00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:10.880
After a massive storm tears 
through the Hex Archipelago,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.640
you find five grizzled 
survivors in the water.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.270
Shivering their timbers,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.791
they explain that they’re the former crew 
of the great pirate Greenbeard,

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:24.129
who marooned them 
after they tried to mutiny.

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:27.832
Each was bound up in a different 
spot on a small island,

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:30.846
until the storm washed them out to sea.

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:33.968
In gratitude for saving them, 
they reveal a secret:

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:39.662
the island they were on is also where 
Greenbeard has buried his treasure hoard.

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:44.841
But when the sailors try to describe 
the island, something seems off.

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:51.011
All agree it was flat and barren with no 
prominent features except for some trees.

00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:55.120
Yet each pirate claims they saw 
a different number of trees,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.571
ranging from two to six.

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:02.572
The pirate who saw two trees says the
treasure was buried right at his feet.

00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:05.761
When you fly your hot air balloon 
over the area to investigate,

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:11.031
you see hundreds of small islands,
each with exactly six trees.

00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:13.292
The next storm will be here soon,

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:16.119
so you’ll have to hurry 
and narrow your search.

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.892
What does the island with Greenbeard’s
treasure look like from the sky?

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:27.532
And where will the treasure be 
on that island?

00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:31.941
Pause here if you want
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:33.330
Answer in 3

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.541
Answer in 2

00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:35.770
Answer in 1

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.420
It might seem like the pirates 
are delirious from dehydration.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.211
But that’s not what’s going on.

00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:45.002
Remember, each was confined 
to a separate point on the island,

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:49.222
and no two of them could see 
the same number of trees.

00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:53.841
That means that for all but one pirate, 
something was blocking their view.

00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:56.410
And since there are no other 
features on the island,

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.201
that something could only 
have been other trees.

00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.501
A pirate would see fewer trees 
when two or more

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.001
fell along a straight line 
from their vantage point.

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.510
So we need to find the island

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.721
where five different pirates standing 
in different spots

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.471
would each see a
different number of trees.

00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:21.571
Virtually every island has a position 
from which you can see six trees.

00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:25.182
And on most islands there’s a
position where 5 trees can be seen

00:02:25.182 --> 00:02:28.260
by standing in line with two of them.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.419
It turns out that the hardest locations
to find are those with fewer visible trees

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:39.040
precisely because they require more trees
to line up with the viewer’s position.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.059
So how can we see just two trees?

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.870
One way would be if all the trees 
were lined up in single file,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.800
such as on this island.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.832
Then, you could stand at the end 
of the line and see one,

00:02:50.832 --> 00:02:52.801
stand in the middle and see two,

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.162
or stand anywhere else and see all six.

00:02:56.162 --> 00:02:59.087
But there’s no place from 
which you can see only three,

00:02:59.087 --> 00:02:59.842
four,

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:00.951
or five,

00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:04.382
so one straight line of trees is out.

00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:06.802
So what about two lines of trees?

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:10.890
So long as the lines aren’t parallel
and they intersect over land,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.301
there’ll always be a position 
where the two lines converge

00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:17.181
from which you could 
see exactly two trees.

00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:19.683
And if they’re grouped two and four,

00:03:19.683 --> 00:03:21.051
or three and three,

00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:24.925
there are many arrangements in which 
you could also see three,

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:25.825
four,

00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:27.091
five,

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:29.593
and six trees.

00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:33.289
Fortunately for us, there’s only 
one island in the archipelago

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.932
with two non-parallel lines of trees,

00:03:36.932 --> 00:03:41.793
and it’ll be buried at the intersection 
of the two lines.

00:03:41.793 --> 00:03:47.221
You land on this island and dig up a chest
containing a massive pile of tree seeds,

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:49.041
ready for planting.

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:51.610
Was this treasure really worth 
all that trouble?

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.691
That’s a matter of perspective.
